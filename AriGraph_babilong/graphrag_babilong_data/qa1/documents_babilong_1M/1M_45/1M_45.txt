And, if I mistake not, he figures that you will learn
the secret from them in some way, and that the mine will again come to
light.Now, if you get wind of that mine and attempt to locate it, or
purchase it from the natives, you will be beaten out of it in a hurry.And you may be sure Don Wenceslas will be the one who will eventually
have it, for there is no craftier, smoother, brighter rascal in
Colombia than he.And so, take it from me, if you ever get wind of the
location of that famous property--which by rights is yours, having
belonged to your grandfather--_keep the information strictly to
yourself_!But I shall be working in the Guamoco district
for many months to come, hunting Indian graves.I shall have my
runners up and down the Simiti trail frequently, and may get in touch
with you.It may be that you will need a friend.The boat is
whistling for Badillo.A last word: Keep out of the way of both
Wenceslas and Diego--cultivate the people of Simiti--and keep your
mouth closed."A few minutes later Jose stood on the river bank beside his little
haircloth trunk and traveling bag, sadly watching the steamer draw
away and resume her course up-stream.He watched it until it
disappeared around a bend.And then he stood watching the smoke rise
above the treetops, until that, too, faded in the distance.No one had
waved him a farewell from the boat.No one met him with a greeting of
welcome on the shore.He turned, with a heavy heart, to note his environment.It was a
typical riverine point.A single street, if it might be so called; a
half dozen bamboo dwellings, palm-thatched; and a score of natives,
with their innumerable gaunt dogs and porcine companions--this was
Badillo."_Senor Padre._" A tall, finely built native, clad in soiled white
cotton shirt and trousers, approached and addressed him in a kindly
tone."To Simiti," replied the priest, turning eagerly to the man."But," in
bewilderment, "where is it?""Over there," answered the native, pointing to the jungle on the far
side of the river.The wearied priest sat down on his trunk and buried his face in his
hands.It was the after-effect of his
long and difficult river experience.Or, perhaps, the deadly malaria
was beginning its insidious poisoning.The man approached and laid a
hand on his shoulder."Padre, why do you go to Simiti?"Jose raised his head and looked more closely at his interlocutor.The
native was a man of perhaps sixty years.His figure was that of an
athlete.He stood well over six feet high, with massive shoulders, and
a waist as slender as a woman's.His face was almost black in color,
and mottled with patches of white, so common to the natives of the hot
inlands.But there was that in its expression, a something that
looked out through those kindly black eyes, that assured Jose and
bespoke his confidence."I have been sent there by the Bishop of Cartagena.I am to have
charge of the parish," Jose replied."We want no priest in Simiti," he said with quiet firmness.His manner
of speaking was abrupt, yet not ungracious."Then you must know a man--Rosendo, I think his name--"

"I am Rosendo Ariza.""Rosendo--I am sick--I think.And--I have--no friends--"

Rosendo quickly grasped his hand and slipped an arm about his
shoulders."I am your friend, Padre--" He stopped and appeared to reflect for a
moment.Then he added quickly, "My canoe is ready; and we must hurry,
or night will overtake us."The priest essayed to rise, but stumbled.Then, as if he had been a
child, the man Rosendo picked him up and carried him down the bank to
a rude canoe, where he deposited him on a pile of empty bags in the
keel.he called back to a young man who seemed to be the
chief character of the village."Sell the _panela_ and yuccas _a buen
precio_; and remind Captain Julio not to forget on the next trip to
bring the little Carmen a doll from Barranquilla.And Juan," addressing the sturdy youth who was preparing
to accompany him, "set in the Padre's baggage; and do you take the
paddle, and I will pole._Conque, adioscito!_" waving his battered
straw hat to the natives congregated on the bank, while Juan pushed
the canoe from the shore and paddled vigorously out into the river.Don Rosendo y Juan!_" The hearty farewells of
the natives followed the canoe far out into the broad stream.Across the open river in the livid heat of the early afternoon the
canoe slowly made its way.The sun from a cloudless sky viciously
poured down its glowing rays like molten metal.The boat burned; the
river steamed; the water was hot to his touch, when the priest feebly
dipped his hands into it and bathed his throbbing brow.Badillo faded
from view as they rounded a densely wooded island and entered a long
lagoon.Here they lost the slight breeze which they had had on the
main stream.In this narrow channel, hemmed in between lofty forest
walls of closely woven vines and foliage, it seemed to Jose that they
had entered a flaming inferno.The two boatmen sat silent and
inscrutable, plying their paddles without speaking.Down the long lagoon the canoe drifted, keeping within what scant
shade the banks afforded, for the sun stood now directly overhead.The
heat was everywhere, insistent, unpitying.The foliage on either side of the channel merged into the hot waves
that rose trembling about them.The thin, burning air enveloped the
little craft with fire.The quivering
appearance of the atmosphere robbed him of confidence in his own
vision.A cloud of insects hung always before his sight.Not a bird or
animal betrayed its presence.The canoe was edging the Colombian
"hells," where even the denizens of the forest dare not venture forth
on the low, open _savannas_ in the killing heat of midday.Jose sank down in the boat, wilting and semi-delirious.Through his
dimmed eyes the boatman looked like glowing inhuman things set in
flames.Rosendo came to him and placed his straw hat over his face.Hours, interminable and torturing, seemed to pass on leaden wings.Then Juan, deftly swerving his paddle, shot the canoe into a narrow
arm, and the garish sunlight was suddenly lost in the densely
intertwined branches overhanging the little stream."The outlet of _La Cienaga_, Padre," Rosendo offered, laying aside his
paddle and taking his long boat pole."Lake Simiti flows through this
and into the Magdalena."For a few moments he held the canoe steady,
while from his wallet he drew a few leaves of tobacco and deftly
rolled a long, thick cigar.The real work of the _boga_ now began, and Rosendo with his long
punter settled down to the several hours' strenuous grind which was
necessary to force the heavy canoe up the little outlet and into the
distant lake beyond.Back and forth he traveled through the
half-length of the boat, setting the pole well forward in the soft
bank, or out into the stream itself, and then, with its end against
his shoulder, urging and teasing the craft a few feet at a time
against the strong current.Jose imagined, as he dully watched him,
that he could see death in the pestiferous effluvia which emanated
from the black, slimy mud which every plunge of the long pole brought
to the surface of the narrow stream.The afternoon slowly waned, and the temperature lowered a few degrees.A warm, animal-like breath drifted languidly out from the moist
jungle.The outlet, or _cano_, was heavily shaded throughout its
length.Crocodiles lay along its muddy banks, and slid into the water
at the approach of the canoe.Huge _iguanas_, the gorgeously 
lizards of tropical America, scurried noisily through the overarching
branches.Here and there monkeys peeped curiously at the intruders and
chattered excitedly as they swung among the lofty treetops.But for
his exhaustion, Jose, as he lay propped up against his trunk, gazing
vacantly upon the slowly unrolling panorama of marvelous plant and
animal life on either hand, might have imagined himself in a realm of
enchantment.At length the vegetation abruptly ceased; the stream widened; and the
canoe entered a broad lake, at the far end of which, three miles
distant, its two whitewashed churches and its plastered houses
reflecting the red glow of the setting sun, lay the ancient and
decayed town of Simiti, the northern outlet of Spain's mediaeval
treasure house, at the edge of the forgotten district of Guamoco.Paddling gently across the unruffled surface of the tepid waters,
Rosendo and Juan silently urged the canoe through the fast gathering
dusk, and at length drew up on the shaly beach of the old town.As
they did so, a little girl, bare of feet and with clustering brown
curls, came running out of the darkness."Oh, padre Rosendo," she called, "what have you brought me?"Then, as she saw Rosendo and Juan assisting the priest from the boat,
she drew back abashed."Look, Carmencita," whispered Juan to the little maid; "we've brought
you a _big_ doll, haven't we?"Night fell as the priest stepped upon the shore of his new home.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


Jose de Rincon opened his eyes and turned painfully on his hard bed.The early sun streamed through the wooden grating before the unglazed
window.A slight, tepid breeze stirred the mosquito netting over him.He was in the single sleeping room of the house.It contained another
bed like his own, of rough _macana_ palm strips, over which lay a
straw mat and a thin red blanket.On the rude door, cobwebbed and dusty, a scorpion clung torpidly.From
the room beyond he heard subdued voices.His head and limbs ached
dully; and frightful memories of the river trip and the awful journey
from Badillo sickened him.With painful exertion he stood upon the
moist dirt floor and drew on his damp clothes.He had only a vague
recollection of the preceding night, but he knew that Rosendo had half
led, half dragged him past rows of dimly lighted, ghostly white houses
to his own abode, and there had put him to bed."_Muy buenos dias, Senor Padre_," Rosendo greeted him, as the priest
dragged himself out into the living room.But
the senora will soon have your breakfast.Rosendo placed one of the rough wooden chairs, with straight cowhide
back and seat, near the table."Carmencita has gone to the boat for fresh water.Pour the _Senor Padre_ a cup, _carita_," addressing a little girl who
at that moment entered the doorway, carrying a large earthen bottle on
her shoulder.It was the child who had met the boat when the priest
arrived the night, before."Fill the basin, too, _chiquita_, that the Padre may wash his hands,"
added Rosendo.The child approached Jose, and with a dignified little courtesy and a
frank smile offered him a cup of the lukewarm water.The priest
accepted it languidly.But, glancing into her face, his eyes suddenly
widened, and the hand that was carrying the tin cup to his lips
stopped.The barefoot girl, clad only in a short, sleeveless calico gown, stood
before him like a portrait from an old master.Her skin was almost
white, with but a tinge of olive.Her dark brown hair hung in curls to
her shoulders and framed a face of rarest beauty.Innocence, purity,
and love radiated from her fair features, from her beautifully rounded
limbs, from her soft, dark eyes that looked so fearlessly into his
own.Somewhere deep within his soul a
chord had been suddenly struck by the little presence; and the sound
was unfamiliar to him.Yet it awakened memories of distant scenes, of
old dreams, and forgotten longings.It seemed to echo from realms of
his soul that had never been penetrated.The man forgot himself, forgot that
he had come to Simiti to die.He remained conscious only of something that he could not
outline, something in the soul of the child, a thing that perhaps he
once possessed, and that he knew he yet prized above all else on
earth.He heard Rosendo's voice through an immeasurable distance--

"Leave us now, _chiquita_; the Padre wishes to have his breakfast."The child without speaking turned obediently; and the priest's eyes
followed her until she disappeared into the kitchen."We call her 'the smile of God,'" said Rosendo, noting the priest's
absorption, "because she is always happy.""Yes, Padre, she is heaven's gift to us poor folk.I sometimes think
the angels themselves left her on the river bank.""Why--she was not born
here?""Oh, no, Padre, but in Badillo.""Ah, then you once lived in Badillo?""_Na, Senor Padre_, she is not my child--except that the good God has
given her to me to protect."The priest's voice was unwontedly
eager and his manner animated.But Rosendo fell suddenly quiet and embarrassed, as if he realized
that already he had said too much to a stranger.A shade of suspicion
seemed to cross his face, and he rose hurriedly and went out into the
kitchen.A moment later he returned with the priest's breakfast--two
fried eggs, a hot corn _arepa_, fried _platanos_, dried fish, and
coffee sweetened with _panela_."When you have finished, Padre, we will visit the Alcalde," he said
quietly."I must go down to the lake now to speak with Juan before he
goes out to fish."The interest which had been aroused by
the child continued to increase without reaction.His torpid soul had
been profoundly stirred.For the moment, though he knew not why, life
seemed to hold a vague, unshaped interest for him.He began to notice
his environment; he even thought he relished the coarse food set
before him.The house he was in was a typical native three-room dwelling, built of
strips of _macana_ palm, set upright and tied together with pieces of
slender, tough _bejuco_ vine.The interstices between the strips were
filled with mud, and the whole whitewashed.The floors were dirt,
trodden hard; the steep-pitched roof was thatched with palm.A few
chairs like the one he occupied, the rude, uncovered table, some cheap
prints and a battered crucifix on the wall, were the only furnishings
of the living room.While he was eating, the people of the town congregated quietly
about the open door.Friendly curiosity to see the new Padre, and
sincere desire to welcome him animated their simple minds.Naked
babes crawled to the threshold and peeped timidly in.Coarsely
clad women and young girls, many of the latter bedizened with bits
of bright ribbon or cheap trinkets, smiled their gentle greetings.Black, dignified men, bare of feet, and wearing white cotton trousers
and black _ruanas_--the cape affected by the poor males of the
inlands--respectfully doffed their straw hats and bowed to him.Rosendo's wife appeared from the kitchen and extended her hand to
him in unfeigned hospitality.Attired in a fresh calico gown, her
black hair plastered back over her head and tied with a clean black
ribbon, her bare feet encased in hemp sandals, she bore herself
with that grace and matronly dignity so indicative of her Spanish
forbears, and so particularly characteristic of the inhabitants of
this "valley of the pleasant 'yes.'"Breakfast finished, the priest stepped to the doorway and raised his
hand in the invocation that was evidently expected from him."_Dominus vobiscum_," he repeated, not mechanically, not insincerely,
but in a spirit of benevolence, of genuine well-wishing, which his
contact with the child a few minutes before seemed to have aroused.The people bent their heads piously and murmured, "_Et cum spiritu
tuo._"

The open door looked out upon the central _plaza_, where stood a large
church of typical colonial design and construction, and with a single
lateral bell tower.The building was set well up on a platform of
shale, with broad shale steps, much broken and worn, leading up to it
on all sides.Jose stepped out and mingled with the crowd, first
regarding the old church curiously, and then looking vainly for the
little girl, and sighing his disappointment when he did not see her.In the _plaza_ he was joined by Rosendo; and together they went to
the house of the Alcalde.On the way the priest gazed about him with
growing curiosity.To the north of the town stretched the lake, known
to the residents only by the name of _La Cienaga_.It was a body of
water of fair size, in a setting of exquisite tropical beauty.In
a temperate climate, and a region more densely populated, this
lake would have been priceless.Here in forgotten Guamoco it lay like
an undiscovered gem, known only to those few inert and passive folk,
who enjoyed it with an inadequate sense of its rare beauty and
immeasurable worth.Several small and densely wooded isles rose
from its unrippled bosom; and tropical birds of brilliant color
hovered over it in the morning sun.Near one of its margins Jose
distinguished countless white _garzas_, the graceful herons whose
plumes yield the coveted aigrette of northern climes.They fed
undisturbed, for this region sleeps unmolested, far from the beaten
paths of tourist or vandal huntsman.To the west and south lay the
hills of Guamoco, and the lofty _Cordilleras_, purpling in the
light mist.Over the entire scene spread a damp warmth, like the
atmosphere of a hot-house.By midday Jose knew that the heat would
be insufferable.The Alcalde, Don Mario Arvila, conducted his visitors through his
shabby little store and into the _patio_ in the rear, exclaiming
repeatedly, "Ah, _Senor Padre_, we welcome you!All Simiti welcomes
you and kisses your hand!"In the shade of his arbor he sat down to
examine Jose's letters from Cartagena.Don Mario was a large, florid man, huge of girth, with brown skin,
heavy jowls, puffed eyes, and bald head.As he read, his eyes snapped,
and at times he paused and looked up curiously at the priest.Then,
without comment, he folded the letters and put them into a pocket of
his crash coat."_Bien_," he said politely, "we must have the Padre meet Don Felipe
Alcozer as soon as he returns.Some repairs are needed on the
church; a few of the roof tiles have slipped, and the rain enters.Perhaps, _Senor Padre_, you may say the Mass there next Sunday.A--a--you had illustrious ancestors, Padre," he added with
hesitation.asked Jose with something of
mingled surprise and pride."They speak of your family, which was, as we all know, quite
renowned," replied the Alcalde courteously."Very," agreed Jose, wondering how much the Alcalde knew of his
family."Don Ignacio was not unknown in this _pueblo_," affably continued the
Alcalde.At these words Rosendo started visibly and looked fixedly at the
priest."The family name of Rincon," the Alcalde went on, "appears on the old
records of Simiti in many places, and it is said that Don Ignacio
himself came here more than once.Perhaps you know, _Senor Padre_,
that the Rincon family erected the church which stands in the _plaza_?And so it is quite appropriate that their son should officiate in it
after all these centuries, is it not?"He
knew little of his family's history.Of their former vast wealth he
had a vague notion.But here in this land of romance and tragedy he
seemed to be running upon their reliques everywhere.The conversation drifted to parish matters; and soon Rosendo urged
their departure, as the sun was mounting high.Seated at the table for the midday lunch, Jose again became lost in
contemplation of the child before him.Her fair face flushed under his
searching gaze; but she returned a smile of confidence and sweet
innocence that held him spellbound.Her great brown eyes were of
infinite depth.They expressed a something that he had never seen
before in human eyes.What was it
that through them looked out into this world of evil?Childish
innocence and purity, yes; but vastly more.Through his meditations he heard Rosendo's
voice."Simiti is very old, Padre.In the days of the Spaniards it was a
large town, with many rich people.The Indians were all slaves then,
and they worked in the mines up there," indicating the distant
mountains."Much gold was brought down here and shipped down the
Magdalena, for the _cano_ was wider in those days, and it was not so
hard to reach the river.This is the end of the Guamoco trail, which
was called in those days the _Camino Real_."interrogated Jose; not that the
question expressed a more than casual interest, but rather to keep
Rosendo talking while he studied the child.But at this question Rosendo suddenly became less loquacious.Jose
then felt that he was suspected of prying into matters which Rosendo
did not wish to discuss with him, and so he pressed the topic no
further."How many people did Don Mario say the parish contained?"he asked by
way of diverting the conversation."Four years since Padre Diego was here," commented Jose casually.At the mention of the former priest's
name Dona Maria hurriedly left the table.Rosendo's black face grew
even darker, and took on a look of ineffable contempt.It was now plain to Jose that Rosendo distrusted him.But it mattered
little to the priest, beyond the fact that he had no wish to offend
any one.What interest had he in boorish Simiti, or Guamoco?The place
was become his tomb--he had entered it to die.Ah, yes, she had touched a strange chord within him; and for a time he
had seemed to live again.But as the day waned, and pitiless heat and
deadly silence brooded over the decayed town, his starving soul sank
again into its former depression, and revived hope and interest died
within him.The implacable heat burned through the noon hour; the dusty streets
were like the floor of a stone oven; the shale beds upon which the old
town rested sent up fiery, quivering waves; the houses seethed; earth
and sky were ablaze.And the terrible _ennui_, the isolation, the utter lack of every trace
of culture, of the varied interests that feed the educated, trained
mind and minister to its comfort and growth--could he support it
patiently while awaiting the end?Would he go mad before the final
release came?He did not fear death; but he was horror-stricken at the
thought of madness!Of losing that rational sense of the Ego which
constituted his normal individuality!Rosendo advised him to retire for the midday _siesta_.Through the
seemingly interminable afternoon he lay upon his hard bed with his
brain afire, while the events of his warped life moved before him in
spectral review.The week which had passed since he left Cartagena
seemed an age.When he might hope to receive word from the outside
world, he could not imagine.Even
should letters succeed in reaching Simiti for him, they must first
pass through the hands of the Alcalde.And what did the Alcalde know of him?And then, again, what did it
matter?He must not lose sight of the fact that his interest in the
outside world--nay, his interest in all things had ceased.He had yielded, after years of struggle, to pride, fear,
doubt.He had bowed before his morbid sense of honor--a perverted
sense, he now admitted, but still one which bound him in fetters of
steel.His life had been one of grossest inconsistency.He was utterly
out of tune with the universe.His incessant clash with the world of
people and events had sounded nothing but agonizing discord.And his
confusion of thought had become such that, were he asked why he was in
Simiti, he could scarcely have told.At length he dropped into a
feverish sleep.The day drew to a close, and the flaming sun rested for a brief moment
on the lofty tip of Tolima.Jose awoke, dripping with perspiration,
his steaming blood rushing wildly through its throbbing channels.Blindly he rose from his rough bed and stumbled out of the stifling
chamber.Who might be in the kitchen, he
did not stop to see.Dazed by the garish light and fierce heat, he
rushed from the house and over the burning shales toward the lake.What he intended to do, he knew not.His weltering thought held but a
single concept--water!The lake would cool his burning skin--he would
wade out into it until it rose to his cracking lips--he would lie down
in it, till it quenched the fire in his head--he would sleep in it--he
would never leave it--it was cool--perhaps cold!Was there aught in the world but fire--flames--fierce,
withering, smothering, consuming heat?He thought the shales crackled
as they melted beneath him!He thought his feet sank to the ankles in
molten lava, and were so heavy he scarce could drag them!He thought
the blazing sun shot out great tongues of flame, like the arms of a
monster devilfish, which twined about him, transforming his blood to
vapor and sucking it out through his gaping pores!A blinding light flashed before him as he reached the margin of the
lake.He clasped his head in
his hands--stumbled--and fell, face down, in the tepid waters.CHAPTER 2


"It was the little Carmen, Padre, who saw you run to the lake.She was
sitting at the kitchen door, studying her writing lesson."The priest essayed to rise from his bed.Night had fallen, and the
feeble light of the candle cast heavy shadows over the room, and made
grotesque pictures of the black, anxious faces looking in at the
grated window."But, Rosendo, it--was--a dream--a terrible dream!""_Na_, Padre, it was true, for I myself took you from the lake,"
replied Rosendo tenderly.Jose struggled to a sitting posture, but would have fallen back again
had not Rosendo's strong arm supported him.He passed his hand slowly
across his forehead, as if to brush the mental cobwebs from his
awakening brain.Then he inquired feebly:

"What does the doctor say?""Padre, there is no doctor in Simiti," Rosendo answered quietly.Then--

"But perhaps I do not need one."It did not happen to-day, Padre," said Rosendo with pitying
compassion.The priest stared at him uncomprehendingly.Then--

"The dreams were frightful!"There, Padre, think no more about it.You were wild--I fought to keep
you in bed--we thought you must die--all but Carmen--but you have your
senses now--and you must forget the past."Then his wild delirium had laid bare his soul!And
the man who had so faithfully nursed him through the crisis now
possessed the sordid details of this wretched life!Jose struggled to orient his undirected mind.A hot wave of anger
swept over him at the thought that he was still living, that his
battered soul had not torn itself from earth during his delirium and
taken flight.Was he fated to live forever, to drag out an endless
existence, with his heart written upon his sleeve for the world to
read and turn to its own advantage?Rosendo had stood between him and
death--but to what end?Had he not yet paid the score in full--good
measure, pressed down and running over?His thoughts ran rapidly from
one topic to another.He had
dreamed of her in that week of black night.He wondered if he had also
talked of her.He had lain at death's door--Rosendo had said so--but
he had had no physician.Perhaps these simple folk brewed their own
homely remedies--he wondered what they had employed in his case.Above
the welter of his thoughts this question pressed for answer."What medicine did you give me, Rosendo?"Jose's voice rose querulously in a little excess of excitement.You left me here without medical aid, to live or die, as might be?"The gentle Rosendo laid a soothing hand upon the priest's feverish
brow."_Na_, Padre,"--there was a hurt tone in the soft answer--"we
did all we could for you.But
we cared for you--and we prayed daily for your recovery.The little
Carmen said our prayers would be answered--and, you see, they were.""And what had she to do with my recovery?""_Quien sabe?_ It is sometimes that way when the little Carmen says
people shall not die.And then," he added sadly, "sometimes they do
die just the same.It is strange; we do not understand it."The gentle
soul sighed its perplexity."Did the child say I should not die?"he
asked softly, almost in a whisper."Yes, Padre; she says God's children do not die," returned Rosendo.The priest's blood stopped in its mad surge and slowly began to chill.What uncanny influence had he met with here
in this crumbling, forgotten town?He sought the index of his memory
for the sensations he had felt when he looked into the girl's eyes on
his first morning in Simiti.But memory reported back only impressions
of goodness--beauty--love.Then a dim light--only a feeble gleam--seemed to flash before him, but
at a great distance.Something called him--not by name, but by again
touching that unfamiliar chord which had vibrated in his soul when the
child had first stood before him.He felt a strange psychic
presentiment as of things soon to be revealed.A sentiment akin to awe
stole over him, as if he were standing in the presence of a great
mystery--a mystery so transcendental that the groveling minds of
mortals have never apprehended it.He turned again to the man sitting
beside his bed."Asleep, Padre," pointing to the other bed."But we must not wake
her," he admonished quickly, as the priest again sought to rise; "we
will talk of her to-morrow.I think--"

Rosendo stopped abruptly and looked at the priest as if he would
fathom the inmost nature of the man.Then he continued uncertainly:

"I--I may have some things to say to you to-morrow--if you are
well enough to hear them.But I will think about it to-night,
and--if--_Bien_!Rosendo rose slowly, as if weighted with heavy thoughts, and went out
into the living room.Presently he returned with a rude, homemade
broom and began to sweep a space on the dirt floor in the corner
opposite Jose.This done, he spread out a light straw mat for his
bed."The senora is preparing you a bowl of chicken broth and rice, Padre,"
he said."The little Carmen saved a hen for you when you should awake.She has fed it all the week on rice and goat's milk.She said she knew
you would wake up hungry."Jose's eyes had closely followed Rosendo's movements, although he
seemed not to hear his words."Rosendo," he cried, "have I your bed?And do you sleep there on the
floor?"Say nothing, Padre," replied Rosendo, gently forcing Jose back again
upon his bed."But--the senora, your wife--where does she sleep?""She has her _petate_ in the kitchen," was the quiet answer.Only the two poor beds, which were occupied by the priest and the
child!And Rosendo and his good wife had slept on the hard dirt floor
for a week!Jose's eyes dimmed when he realized the extent of their
unselfish hospitality.And would they continue to sleep thus on the
ground, with nothing beneath them but a thin straw mat, as long as he
might choose to remain with them?Aye, he knew that they would,
uncomplainingly.For these are the children of the "valley of the
pleasant 'yes.'"Jose awoke the next morning with a song echoing in his ears.He had
dreamed of singing; and as consciousness slowly returned, the
dream-song became real.It floated in from the living room on a clear,
sweet soprano.When a child he had heard such voices in the choir loft
of the great Seville cathedral, and he had thought that angels were
singing.As he lay now listening to it, memories of his childish
dreams swept over him in great waves.The soft, sweet cadences rose
and fell.His own heart swelled and pulsated with them, and his barren
soul once more surged under the impulse of a deep, potential desire to
manifest itself, its true self, unhampered at last by limitation and
convention, unfettered by superstition, human creeds and false
ambition.Then the inevitable reaction set in; a sickening sense of
the futility of his longing settled over him, and he turned his face
to the wall, while hot tears streamed over his sunken cheeks.Again through his wearied brain echoed the familiar admonition,
"Occupy till I come."Always the same invariable response to his
strained yearnings.The sweet voice in the adjoining room floated in
through the dusty palm door.It spread over his perturbed thought like
oil on troubled waters.At this
thought the sense of awe seemed to settle upon him again.A child--a
babe--had said that he should live!If a doctor had said it he would
have believed.But no; Rosendo
had said it; and there was no reason to doubt him.But what had this
child to do with it?Then
whence his sensations when first he saw her?Whence that feeling of
standing in the presence of a great mystery?"Out of the mouths of
babes and sucklings--" Foolishness!To be sure, the child may have
said he should not die; but if he were to live--which God forbid!--his
own recuperative powers would restore him.Rosendo's lively
imagination certainly had exaggerated the incident.Exhausted by his mental efforts, and lulled by the low singing, the
priest sank into fitful slumber.He was
standing alone in a great desert.Darkness encompassed him, and a
fearful loneliness froze his soul.Neither trees nor vegetation broke the dull monotony of the cheerless
scene.Nothing but waste, unutterably dreary waste, over which a chill
wind tossed the tinkling sand in fitful gusts.Again
he called, his heart sinking with despair.Then, over the desolate waste, through the heavy gloom, a voice seemed
borne faint on the cold air, "Occupy till I come!"His straining eyes caught the feeble glint of a light, but at
an immeasurable distance.Again he called; and again the same
response, but nearer.A glow began to suffuse the blackness about him.Nearer, ever nearer drew the gleam.Trees and vines sprang from the waste sand.As if in a
tremendous explosion, a dazzling light burst full upon him, shattering
the darkness, fusing the stones about him, and blinding his sight.He struggled to his feet; and as he
did so a loud voice cried, "Behold, I come _quickly_!""_Senor Padre_, you have been dreaming!"The priest, sitting upright and clutching at the rough sides of his
bed, stared with wooden obliviousness into the face of the little
Carmen.CHAPTER 3


"You are well now, aren't you, Padre?"It was not so much an interrogation as an affirmation, an assumption
of fact."Now you must come and see my garden--and Cucumbra, too.And
Cantar-las-horas; have you heard him?I scolded him lots; and I know
he wants to mind; but he just thinks he can't stop singing the
Vespers--the old stupid!"While the child prattled she drew a chair to the bedside and arranged
the bowl of broth and the two wheat rolls she had brought."You are real hungry, and you are going to eat all of this and get
strong again.she added, emphatically expressing her
confidence in the assumption.He seemed again to be trying to sound the
unfathomable depths of the child's brown eyes.Mechanically he took
the spoon she handed him.Madre
Ariza borrowed it from Dona Maria Alcozer.From his own great egoism, his years of heart-ache, sorrows, and
shames, the priest's heavy thought slowly lifted and centered upon the
child's beautiful face.The animated little figure before him radiated
such abundant life that he himself caught the infection; and with it
his sense of weakness passed like an illusion."Well, you know"--the enthusiastic little maid clambered up on the
bed--"yesterday it was Manuela--she was my hen.I told her a week ago
that you would need her--"

"And you gave up your hen for me, little one?"And she
clucked so hard, I knew she was glad to help the good _Cura_.You know,
things never do--do they?"To hide his confusion and gain time he began to
eat rapidly."No, they don't," said the girl confidently, answering her own
question."Because," she added, "God is _everywhere_--isn't He?"What manner of answer could he, of all men, make to such terribly
direct questions as these!And it was well that Carmen evidently
expected none--that in her great innocence she assumed for him the
same beautiful faith which she herself held."Dona Jacinta didn't die last week.But they said she did; and so they
took her to the cemetery and put her in a dark _boveda_.And the black
buzzards sat on the wall and watched them.Padre Rosendo said she had
gone to the angels--that God took her.But, Padre, God doesn't make
people sick, does He?They get sick because they don't know who He is.Every day I told God I knew He would cure you.While the girl paused for breath, her eyes sparkled, and her face
glowed with exaltation.Child-like, her active mind flew from one
topic to another, with no thought of connecting links."This morning, Padre, two little green parrots flew across the lake
and perched on our roof.And they sat there and watched Cucumbra eat
his breakfast; and they tried to steal his fish; and they scolded so
loud!Why did they want to steal from him, when there is so much to
eat everywhere?But they didn't know any better, did they?I don't
think parrots love each other very much, for they scold so hard.Padre, it is so dark in here; come out and see the sun and the lake
and the mountains.And my garden--Padre, it is beautiful!Esteban said
next time he went up the trail he would bring me a monkey for a pet;
and I am going to name it Hombrecito.And Captain Julio is going to
bring me a doll from down the river.But," with a merry, musical
trill, "Juan said the night you came that _you_ were my doll!And throwing back her little head, the child laughed
heartily."Padre, you must help padre Rosendo with his arithmetic.Every night
he puts on his big spectacles and works so hard to understand it.He
says he knows Satan made fractions.But, Padre, that isn't so, is it?Padre, you know _everything_, don't you?There are lots of things I want you to
tell me--such lots of things that nobody here knows anything about.Padre,"--the child leaned toward the priest and whispered low--"the
people here don't know who God is; and you are going to teach them!There was a _Cura_ here once, when I was a baby; but I guess he didn't
know God, either."She lapsed into silence, as if pondering this thought.Then, clapping
her hands with unfeigned joy, she cried in a shrill little voice, "Oh,
Padre, I am _so_ glad you have come to Simiti!I just _knew_ God would
not forget us!"His thought was busy with the phenomenon
before him: a child of man, but one who, like Israel of old, saw God
and heard His voice at every turn of her daily walk.Untutored in the
ways of men, without trace of sophistication or cant, unblemished as
she moved among the soiled vessels about her, shining with celestial
radiance in this unknown, moldering town so far from the world's
beaten paths.The door opened softly and Rosendo entered, preceded by a cheery
greeting._"Hombre!_" he exclaimed, surveying the priest, "but you mend fast!But I told the good wife that the little
Carmen would be better than medicine for you, and that you must have
her just as soon as you should awake."Absorbed in the child, he had
consumed almost his entire breakfast."He is well, padre Rosendo, he is well!"cried the girl, bounding up
and down and dancing about the tall form of her foster-father.Then,
darting to Jose, she seized his hand and cried, "Now to see my garden!commanded Rosendo, taking her by the arm."The good
_Cura_ is ill, and must rest for several days yet.""No, padre Rosendo, he is well--all well!appealing to Jose, and again urging him forth.The rapidity of the conversation and the animation of the beautiful
child caused complete forgetfulness of self, and, together with the
restorative effect of the wholesome food, acted upon the priest like a
magical tonic.Weak though he was, he clung to her hand and,
struggling out of the bed, stood uncertainly upon the floor.Instantly
Rosendo's arm was about him."Don't try it, Padre," the latter urged anxiously."The heat will be
too much for you.Another day or two of rest will make you right."But the priest, heedless of the admonition, suffered himself to be led
by the child; and together they passed slowly out into the living
room, through the kitchen, and thence into the diminutive rose garden,
the pride of the little Carmen.Dona Maria, wife of Rosendo, was bending over the primitive fireplace,
busy with her matutinal duties, having just dusted the ashes from a
corn _arepa_ which she had prepared for her consort's simple luncheon.She was a woman well into the autumn of life; but her form possessed
something of the elegance of the Spanish dames of the colonial period;
her countenance bore an expression of benevolence, which emanated
from a gentle and affectionate heart; and her manner combined both
dignity and suavity.She greeted the priest tenderly, and expressed
mingled surprise and joy that he felt able to leave his bed so soon.But as her eyes caught Rosendo's meaning glance, and then turned to
the child, they seemed to indicate a full comprehension of the
situation.The rose garden consisted of a few square feet of black earth,
bordered by bits of shale, and seemingly scarce able to furnish
nourishment for the three or four little bushes.But, though small,
these were blooming in profusion."Every night
he brings water from _La Cienaga_ for them!"Rosendo smiled patronizingly upon the child; but Jose saw in the
glance of his argus eyes a tenderness and depth of affection for her
which bespoke nothing short of adoration.Carmen bent over the roses, fondling and kissing them, and addressing
them endearing names."She calls them God's kisses," whispered Rosendo to the priest.At that moment a low growl was heard.Jose turned quickly and
confronted a gaunt dog, a wild breed, with eyes fixed upon the priest
and white fangs showing menacingly beneath a curling lip.cried the child, rushing to the beast and throwing her
arms about its shaggy neck."Haven't I told you to love everybody?And
is that the way to show it?Now kiss the _Cura's_ hand, for he loves
you."Then as she took the priest's hand and
held it to the dog's mouth, he licked it with his rough tongue.The priest's brain was now awhirl.He stood gazing at the child as if
fascinated.Through his jumbled thought there ran an insistent strain,
"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.The Father dwelleth in me
and I in Him."He did not associate these words with the Nazarene now,
but with the barefoot girl before him.Again within the farthest
depths of his soul he heard the soft note of a vibrating chord--that
chord which all the years of his unhappy life had hung mute, until
here, in this moldering town, in the wilderness of forgotten Guamoco,
the hand of Love had swept it.Dona Maria
summoned her little family to the midday repast.Rosendo brought a
chair for Jose and placed it near the rose garden in the shade of the
house, for, despite all protest, the priest had stubbornly refused to
return to his bed.Left now to himself, his thought hovered about the
child, and then drifted out across the incandescent shales to the
beautiful lake beyond.In the
distance the wooded <DW72>s of the San Lucas mountains rose like green
billows.It was Nature's hour
of _siesta_.In his own heart there was a great peace--and a strange
expectancy.He seemed to be awaiting a revelation of things close at
hand.In a way he felt that he had accomplished his purpose of coming
to Simiti to die, and that he was now awaiting the resurrection.The peaceful revery was interrupted by Rosendo."Padre, if you will
not return to your bed--" He regarded the priest dubiously.A long pause ensued, while Jose impatiently waited for Rosendo to
continue.He was eager to talk
of her, to learn her history, to see her, for her presence meant
complete obliteration of self."Padre," Rosendo at length emerged from his meditation."I would like
to speak of the little Carmen."Life and strength seemed to
return to him with a bound.Shall we visit the church, which is only across
the road?No one will be in
the streets during the heat."Let us go to the church, yes; but I can walk.Jose leaned upon Rosendo, the latter supporting him with his great
arm, and together they crossed the road and mounted the shale platform
on which stood the ancient edifice.Rosendo produced a huge key of
antique pattern; and the rusty lock, after much resistance, yielded
with a groan, and the heavy door creaked open, emitting an odor of
dampness and must.Doffing their hats, the men entered the long,
barn-like room.Rosendo carefully closed and locked the door behind
them, a precaution necessary in a drowsing town of this nature, where
the simple folk who see day after day pass without concern or event to
break the deadening monotony, assemble in eager, buzzing multitudes at
the slightest prospect of extraordinary interest.The room was dimly lighted, and was open to the peak of the roof.From
the rough-hewn rafters above hung hundreds of hideous bats.It was adorned with decrepit images, and held a
large wooden statue of the Virgin.This latter object was veiled with
two flimsy curtains, which were designed to be raised and lowered with
great pomp and the ringing of a little bell during service.The image
was attired in real clothes, covered with tawdry finery, gilt paper,
and faded ribbons.The head bore a wig of hair; and the face was
painted, although great sections of the paint had fallen, away,
leaving the suggestion of pockmarks.Beneath this image was located
the _sagrario_, the little cupboard in which the _hostia_, the sacred
wafer, was wont to be kept exposed in the _custodia_, a cheap
receptacle composed of two watch crystals.At either side of this
stood half consumed wax tapers.A few rough benches were strewn about
the floor; and dust and green mold lay thick over all.At the far right-hand corner of the building a lean-to had been
erected to serve as the _sacristia_, or vestry.In the worm-eaten
wardrobe within hung a few vestments, adorned with cheap finery, and
heavily laden with dust, over which scampered vermin of many
varieties.An air of desolation and abandon hung over the whole
church, and to Jose seemed to symbolize the decay of a sterile faith.Rosendo carefully dusted off a bench near one of the windows and bade
Jose be seated."_Padre_," he began, after some moments of deep reflection, "the
little Carmen is not an ordinary child.""I have seen that, Rosendo," interposed Jose."We--we do not understand her," Rosendo went on, carefully weighing
his words; "and we sometimes think she is not--not altogether like
us--that her coming was a miracle.But you do not believe in
miracles," he added quizzically."Why do you say that, Rosendo?""You were very sick, Padre; and in the fever you--" the impeccably
honest fellow hesitated."Yes, I thought so," said Jose with an air of weary resignation."And
what else did I say, Rosendo?"The faultless courtesy of the artless Rosendo, a courtesy so genuine
that Jose knew it came right from the heart, made conversation on this
topic a matter of extreme difficulty to him."Do not be uneasy, Padre," he said reassuringly.Whenever you began to talk I would not let others listen; and I stayed
with you every day and night.But--it is just because of what you said
in the _calentura_ that I am speaking to you now of the little
Carmen."Because of what he had said in his delirium!"Padre, many bad priests have been sent to Simiti.Priests who stirred up revolution elsewhere, who committed
murder, and ruined the lives of fair women, have been put upon us.And
when in Badillo I learned that you had been sent to our parish, I was
filled with fear.I--I lost a daughter, Padre--"

The good man hesitated again.Then, as a look of stern resolution
spread over his strong, dark face, he continued:

"It was Padre Diego!We drove him out of Simiti four years ago.But my
daughter, my only child, went with him."The great frame shook with
emotion, while he hurried on disconnectedly."Padre, the priest Diego said that the little Carmen should become a
Sister--a nun--that she must be sent to the convent in Mompox--that
she belonged to the Church, and the Church would some day have her.But, by the Holy Virgin, the Church shall _not_ have her!And I myself
will slay her before this altar rather than let such as Padre Diego
lay their slimy paws upon the angel child!"Rosendo leaped to his feet and began to pace the floor with great
strides.The marvelous frame of the man, in which beat a heart too big
for the sordid passions of the flesh, trembled as he walked.Jose
watched him in mute admiration, mingled with astonishment and a
heightened sense of expectancy.Presently Rosendo returned and seated
himself again beside the priest."Padre, I have lived in terror ever since Diego left Simiti.For
myself I do not fear, for if ever I meet with the wretch I shall wring
his neck with my naked hands!But--for the little Carmen--_Dios!_ they
might steal her at any time!There are men here who would do it for a
few _pesos_!I pray daily to the Virgin to
protect her.She--she is the light of my life.I neglect my _hacienda_, that I may guard her--and I am a poor
man, and cannot afford not to work."The man buried his face in his huge hands and groaned aloud.Jose
remained pityingly silent, knowing that Rosendo's heaving heart must
empty itself."Padre," Rosendo at length raised his head.His features were drawn,
but his eyes glowed fiercely."Priests have committed dark deeds here,
and this altar has dripped with blood.When a child, with my own eyes
I saw a priest elevate the Host before this altar, as the people knelt
in adoration.While their heads were bowed I saw him drive a knife
into the neck of a man who was his enemy; and the blood spurted over
the image of the Virgin and fell upon the Sacred Host itself!And
what did the wicked priest say in defense?Simply that he took this
time to assassinate his man because then the victim could die adoring
the Host and under the most favorable circumstances for salvation!_Hombre!_ And did the priest pay the penalty for his crime?The
Bishop of Cartagena transferred him to another parish, and told him to
do better in future!""And I remember the story my father used to tell of the priest who
poisoned a whole family in Simiti with the communion wafer.Their
estates had been willed to the Church, and he was impatient to have
the management of them."But, Rosendo, if Simiti has been so afflicted by bad priests, why are
you confiding in me?""Because, Padre," Rosendo replied, "in the fever you said many things
that made me think you were not a bad man.I did suspect you at
first--but not after I heard you talk in your sleep.No, not God; but the men who
say they know what He thinks and says.And
after I heard you tell those things in your fever-sleep, I said to
Maria that if you lived I knew you would help me protect the little
Carmen.Then, too, you are a--" He lapsed abruptly into silence.You have said she is
not your daughter.I ask only because of sincere affection for you
all, and because the child has aroused in me an unwonted interest."Rosendo looked steadily into the eyes of the priest for some moments.From the eyes of the one there
emanated a soul-searching scrutiny; from those of the other an
answering bid for confidence."Padre," began Rosendo, "I place trust in you.Something makes me
believe that you are not like other priests I have known.And I have
seen that you already love the little Carmen.One day, about eight years ago, a steamer on its way down the river
touched at Badillo to put off a young woman, who was so sick that the
captain feared she would die on board.He knew nothing of her, except
that she had embarked at Honda and was bound for Barranquilla.He
hoped that by leaving her in the care of the good people of Badillo
something might be done.The boat went its way; and the next morning
the woman died, shortly after her babe was born.They buried her back
of the village, and Escolastico's woman took the child.They tried to
learn the history of the mother; but, though the captain of the boat
made many inquiries, he could only find that she had come from Bogota
the day before the boat left Honda, and that she was then very sick.Some weeks afterward Escolastico happened to come to Simiti, and told
me the story.He complained that his family was already large, and
that his woman found the care of the babe a burden.I love children,
Padre, and it seemed to me that I could find a place for the little
one, and I told him I would fetch her.And so a few days later I
brought her to Simiti.But before leaving Badillo I fixed a wooden
cross over the mother's grave and wrote on it in pencil the name
'_Dolores_,' for that was the name in the little gold locket which we
found in her valise.There were some clothes, better than the average,
and the locket.In the locket were two small pictures, one of a young
man, with the name '_Guillermo_' written beneath it, and one of the
woman, with '_Dolores_' under it.Captain Julio took the
locket to Honda when he made inquiries there; but brought it back
again, saying that nobody recognized the faces.I named the babe
Carmen, and have brought her up as my own child.She--Padre, I adore
her!""But we sometimes think," said Rosendo, resuming his dramatic
narrative, "that it was all a miracle, perhaps a dream; that it was
the angels who left the babe on the river bank, for she herself is not
of the earth.""Tell me, Rosendo, just what you mean," said Jose reverently, laying
his hand gently upon the older man's arm."Talk with her, Padre, and you will
see.She is like--"

His voice dropped to a whisper.

"And she knows Him better than she knows me."The gloom within the musty
church was thick; and the bats stirred restlessly among the dusty
rafters overhead.Outside, the relentless heat poured down upon the
deserted streets."In the _calentura_ you talked of wonderful
things.You spoke of kings and popes and foreign lands, of beautiful
cities and great marvels of which we know nothing.And you recited beautiful poems--but often in other tongues than ours.I listened, and was astonished, for
we are so ignorant here in Simiti, oh, so ignorant!We have no
schools, and our poor little children grow up to be only _peones_ and
fishermen.But--the little Carmen--ah, she has a mind!Padre--"

Again he lapsed into silence, as if fearful to ask the boon."Yes, Rosendo, yes," Jose eagerly reassured him.Rosendo turned full upon the priest and spoke rapidly."Padre, will
you teach the little Carmen what you know?Will you make her a strong,
learned woman, and fit her to do big things in the world--and
then--then--"

"Yes, Rosendo?""--then get her away from Simiti?his voice sank to a hoarse whisper--"will you help me keep her
from the Church?"Jose sat staring at the man with dilating eyes."Padre, she has her own Church.He leaned over and laid a hand upon the priest's knee.His dark eyes
seemed to burn like glowing coals.His whispered words were fraught
with a meaning which Jose would some day learn."Padre, _that_ must be left alone!"A long silence fell upon the two men, the one massive of frame and
black of face, but with a mind as simple as a child's and a heart as
white as the snow that sprinkled his raven locks--the other a
youth in years, but bowed with disappointment and suffering; yet now
listening with hushed breath to the words that rolled with a mighty
reverberation through the chambers of his soul:

"I am God, and there is none else!Arise,
shine, for thy light is come!"The sweet face of the child rose out of the gloom before the priest.The years rolled back like a curtain, and he saw himself at her tender
age, a white, unformed soul, awaiting the sculptor's hand.God forbid
that the hand which shaped his career should form the plastic mind of
this girl!Of a sudden a great thought flashed out of the depths of eternity and
into his brain, a thought which seemed to illumine his whole past
life.In the clear light thereof he seemed instantly to read meanings
in numberless events which to that hour had remained hidden.His
complex, misshapen career--could it have been a preparation?--and for
this?He had yearned to serve his fellow-men, but had miserably
failed.For, while to will was always present with him, even as with
Paul, yet how to perform that which was good he found not.But
now--what an opportunity opened before him!What a beautiful offering
of self was here made possible?Rosendo sat stolid, buried in thought.Jose reached out through the
dim light and grasped his black hand.His eyes were lucent, his heart
burned with the fire of an unknown enthusiasm, and speech stumbled
across his lips."Rosendo, I came to Simiti to die.And now I know that I _shall_
die--to myself.And here
before this altar, in the sight of that God whom she knows so well, I
pledge my new-found life to Carmen.My mind, my thought, my strength,
are henceforth hers.May her God direct me in their right use for His
beautiful child!"Jose and Rosendo rose from the bench with hands still clasped.In that
hour the priest was born again.CHAPTER 4


"He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."The reporters of the unique Man of Galilee, upon whose straining ears
these words fell, noted them for future generations of footsore
pilgrims on life's wandering highway--for the rich, satiated with
their gorgeous gluttonies; for the proud Levite, with his feet
enmeshed in the lifeless letter of the Law; for the loathsome and
outcast beggar at the gates of Dives.And for Jose de Rincon, priest
of the Holy Catholic Church and vicar of Christ, scion of aristocracy
and worldly learning, now humbled and blinded, like Paul on the road
to Damascus, begging that his spiritual sight might be opened to the
glory of the One with whom he had not known how to walk.Returning in silence from the church to Rosendo's humble cottage, Jose
had asked leave to retire.He would be alone with the great Presence
which had come to him across the desert of his life, and now stood
before him in the brightness of the undimmed sun.Indeed, quite the contrary; a quickened sense of
life, an eagerness to embrace the opportunity opening before him,
caused his chest to heave and his shrunken veins to throb.On his bed in the darkened room he lay in a deep silence, broken only
at intervals by the hurried scampering of lizards darting through the
interstices of the dry walls.His uncomprehending eyes were fixed upon
the dust-laden thatch of the roof overhead, where droning wasps toiled
upon their frail abodes.He lay with the portals of his mind opened
wide.Through them, in ceaseless flow, passed two streams which did
not mingle.The one, outward bound, turbid with its burden of egoism,
fear, perplexity, and hopelessness, which, like barnacles, had
fastened to his soul on its chartless voyage; the other, a stream of
hope and confidence and definite purpose, a stream which leaped and
sang in the warm sunlight of Love as it poured into his receptive
brain.The fresh thought which flowed into his mental chambers rapidly formed
into orderly plans, all centering upon the child, Carmen.The relative truths and worldly knowledge--purified,
as far as in him lay, from the dross of speculation and human
opinion--which lay stored in the archives of his mind?History, and its interpretation of human progress; the
languages; mathematics, and the elements of the physical sciences;
literature; and a knowledge of people and places.With these his
retentive mind was replete.And her tutor, he now knew, was the Master Mind, omniscient God.And he knew, more, that she possessed secrets whose potency he might
as yet scarcely imagine.For, in an environment which for dearth of
mental stimulus and incentive could scarcely be matched; amid
poverty but slightly raised above actual want; untouched by the
temperamental hopelessness which lies just beneath the surface of
these dull, simple folk, this child lived a life of such ecstasy as
might well excite the envy of the world's potentates.But meantime, what should be his attitude toward the parish?He fully
realized that he and the Church were now as far apart as the poles.Yet this was become his parish, the first he had ever held; and these
were his people.And he must face them and preach--what?If not the
Catholic faith, then would he be speedily removed.And that meant
complete disruption of his rapidly formulating plans.But might he not
in that event flee with Carmen, renounce the Church, and--

Impossible!Excommunication alone could sever the oath by which the
Church held him.And for that he could not say that he was ready.For
excommunication meant disgrace to his mother--perhaps the snapping of
a heart already sorely strained.To
preach the Catholic faith without sincerity was scarcely less.Yet
amid present circumstances this seemed the only course open to him.But what must he teach Carmen in regard to the Church?Could he
maintain his position in it, yet not of it; and at the same time rear
her without its pale, yet so as not to conflict with the people of
Simiti, nor cause such comment as might reach the ears of the Bishop
of Cartagena?And if it was God's plan, he might safely trust Him
for the requisite strength and wisdom.For this course the isolation
of Simiti and the childish simplicity of its people afforded a
tremendous advantage.On the other hand, he knew that both he and
Carmen had powerful enemies.Yet, one with God might rout a host.Thus throughout the afternoon the priest weighed and pondered the
thoughts that sought admission to his reawakened mind.He was not
interrupted until sundown; and then Carmen entered the room with a
bowl of chocolate and some small wheaten loaves.Behind her, with an
amusing show of dignity, stalked a large heron, an elegant bird, with
long, scarlet legs, gray plumage, and a gracefully curved neck.When
the bird reached the threshold it stopped, and without warning gave
vent to a prolonged series of shrill, unmusical sounds.The startled
priest sat up in his bed and exclaimed in amazement."It is only Cantar-las-horas, Padre," laughed the little maid."He
follows me wherever I go, unless he is off fishing.Sometimes when I
go out in the boat with padre Rosendo he flies clear across the lake
to meet us.He is lots older than I, and years ago, when there were
_Curas_ here, he learned his song.Whenever the _Angelas_ rang he
would try to sing just like it; and now he has the habit and can't
help it.But he is such a dear, wise old fellow," twining a chubby arm
lovingly about the bird's slender neck; "and he always sings just at
six o'clock, the time the _Angelas_ used to ring."The heron manifested the deepest affection for the child as she gently
stroked its plumage and caressed its long, pointed bill."But how do you suppose he knows when it is just six o'clock,
_chiquita_?"asked Jose, deeply interested in the strange phenomenon."God tells him, Padre," was the direct and simple reply.Assuredly, he should have known that!But he was fast learning of this
unusual child, whose every movement was a demonstration of Immanuel."Does God tell you what to do, Carmen?"he asked, seeking to draw out
the girl's strange thought, that he might probe deeper into her
religious convictions."Doesn't He tell you,
too?"He was a _Cura_; he should be very
close to God."Yes, _chiquita_--that is, He has told me to-day what to do."There was a shade of disappointment in her voice when she replied: "I
guess you mean you listened to Him to-day, don't you, Padre?I think
sometimes you don't want to hear Him.But," she finished with a little
sigh, "there are lots of people here who don't; and that is why they
are sick and unhappy."Jose was learning another lesson, that of guarding his speech to this
ingenuous girl."What have you been doing this afternoon, little one?"Her eyes instantly brightened, and the dark shade that had crossed her
face disappeared."Well, after the _siesta_ I helped madre Maria clean the yuccas for
supper; and then I did my writing lesson.Padre Rosendo told me to-day
that I could write better than he.But, Padre, will you teach madre
Maria to read and write?And there are just lots of poor people here
who can't, too.There is a school teacher in Simiti, but he charges a
whole _peso oro_ a month for teaching; and the people haven't the
money, and so they can't learn."Always the child shifted his thought from herself to others.Again she
showed him that the road to happiness wound among the needs of his
fellow-men.The priest mentally recorded the instruction; and the girl
continued:

"Padre Rosendo told madre Maria that you said you had come to Simiti
to die.You were not thinking of us then, were you, Padre?People who
think only of themselves always want to die.That was why Don Luis
died last year.He had lots of gold, and he always wanted more, and he
was cruel and selfish, and he couldn't talk about anything but himself
and how rich he was--and so he died.He didn't really die; but he
thought about himself until he thought he died.That's what always happens to people who think about themselves
all the time--they get buried."Jose was glad of the silence that fell upon them.Wrapped so long in
his own egoism, he had now no worldly wisdom with which to match this
girl's sapient words.He felt that Carmen was but the
channel through which a great Voice was speaking."Padre," the tones were tender and soft, "you don't always think of
good things, do you?"But--"

"Because if you had you wouldn't have been driven into the lake that
day.And you wouldn't be here now in Simiti.""But, child, even a _Cura_ cannot always think of good things, when he
sees so much wickedness in the world!""But, Padre, God is good, isn't He?""Then where is the wickedness, Padre?""Why--but, _chiquita_, you don't understand; you are too young to
reason about such things; and--"

In his heart Jose knew he spoke not the truth.He felt the great
brown eyes of the girl penetrate his naked soul; and he knew that in
the dark recesses of the inner man they fell upon the grinning
skeleton of hypocrisy.Carmen might be, doubtless was, incapable of
reasoning.But by what crass
assumption might he, admittedly woefully defeated in his combat with
Fate, oppose his feeble shafts of worldly logic to this child's
instinct, an instinct of whose inerrancy her daily walk was a living
demonstration?In quick penitence and humility he stretched out his
arm and drew her unresisting to him."Dear little child of God," he murmured, as he bent over her and
touched his lips to her rich brown curls, "I have tried my life long
to learn what you already know.And at last I have been led to you--to
you, little one, who shall be a lamp unto my feet.Dearest child, I
want to know your God as you know Him.I want you to lead me to Him,
for you know where He is.""He is _everywhere_, Padre dear," whispered the child, as she
nestled close to the priest and stole her soft arms gently about his
neck."But we don't see Him nor hear Him if we have bad thoughts, and
if we don't love everybody and everything, even Cucumbra, and
Cantar-las-horas, and--"

"Yes, _chiquita_, I know now," interrupted Jose."I don't wonder they
all love you.""But, Padre dear, I love them--and I love you."first of the tender graces which adorned this beautiful child.Verily, only those imbued with it become the real teachers of men.The
beloved disciple's last instruction to his dear children was the
tender admonition to love one another.But why, oh, why are we bidden
to love the fallen, sordid outcasts of this wicked world--the
wretched, sinning pariahs--the greedy, grasping, self-centered mass of
humanity that surges about us in such woeful confusion of good and
evil?Because he taught that he who loves not, knows not God.And because,
oh, wonderful spiritual alchemy!because Love is the magical potion
which, dropping like heavenly dew upon sinful humanity, dissolves the
vice, the sorrow, the carnal passions, and transmutes the brutish
mortal into the image and likeness of the perfect God.Far into the night, while the child slept peacefully in the bed near
him, Jose lay thinking of her and of the sharp turn which she had
given to the direction of his life.Through the warm night air the
hoarse croaking of distant frogs and the mournful note of the toucan
floated to his ears.In the street without he heard at intervals the
pattering of bare feet in the hot, thick dust, as tardy fishermen
returned from their labors.The hum of insects about his _toldo_
lulled him with its low monotone.The call of a lonely jaguar drifted
across the still lake from the brooding jungle beyond.A great peace
lay over the ancient town; and when, in the early hours of morning, as
the distorted moon hung low in the western sky, Jose awoke, the soft
breathing of the child fell upon his ears like a benediction; and deep
from his heart there welled a prayer--

"My God--_her_ God--at last I thank Thee!"CHAPTER 5


The day following was filled to the brim with bustling activity.Jose
plunged into his new life with an enthusiasm he had never known
before.His first care was to relieve Rosendo and his good wife of the
burden of housing him.Rosendo, protesting against the intimation that
the priest could in any way inconvenience him, at last suggested that
the house adjoining his own, a small, three-room cottage, was vacant,
and might be had at a nominal rental.Some repairs were needed; the
mud had fallen from the walls in several places; but he would plaster
it up again and put it into habitable condition at once.During the discussion Don Mario, the Alcalde, called to pay his
respects to Jose.He had just returned from a week's visit to Ocana,
whither he had gone on matters of business with Simiti's most eminent
citizen, Don Felipe Alcozer, who was at present sojourning there for
reasons of health.Learning of the priest's recent severe illness, Don
Mario had hastened at once to pay his _devoirs_.And now the Holy
Virgin be praised that he beheld the _Cura_ again fully restored!Yes,
the dismal little house in question belonged to him, but would the
_Cura_ graciously accept it, rent free, and with his most sincere
compliments?Jose glanced at Rosendo and, reading a meaning in the
slight shake of his head, replied that, although overwhelmed by the
Alcalde's kindness, he could take the cottage only on the condition
that it should become the parish house, which the Church must support.A shade of disappointment seemed to cross the heavy face of Don Mario,
but he graciously acquiesced in the priest's suggestion; and
arrangements were at once concluded whereby the house became the
dwelling place of the new _Cura_.Rosendo thereupon sent out a call for assistants, to which the entire
unemployed male population of the town responded.Mud for the walls
was hastily brought from the lake, and mixed with manure and dried
grass.A half dozen young men started for the islands to cut fresh
thatch for the roof.Others set about scraping the hard dirt floors;
while Don Mario gave orders which secured a table, several rough
chairs, together with iron stewpans and a variety of enameled metal
dishes, all of which Rosendo insisted should be charged against the
parish.The village carpenter, with his rusty tools and rough,
undressed lumber, constructed a bed in one of the rooms; and Juan, the
boatman, laboriously sought out stones of the proper shape and size to
support the cooking utensils in the primitive dirt hearth.Often, as he watched the progress of these arrangements, Jose's
thoughts reverted longingly to his father's comfortable house in
far-off Seville; to his former simple quarters in Rome; and to the
less pretentious, but still wholly sufficient _menage_ of Cartagena.Compared with this primitive dwelling and the simple husbandry which
it would shelter, his former abodes and manner of life had been
extravagantly luxurious.At times he felt a sudden sinking of heart as
he reflected that perhaps he should never again know anything better
than the lowly life of this dead town.But when his gaze rested upon
the little Carmen, flying hither and yon with an ardent, anticipatory
interest in every detail of the preparations, and when he realized
that, though her feet seemed to rest in the squalid setting afforded
by this dreary place, yet her thought dwelt ever in heaven, his heart
welled again with a great thankfulness for the inestimable privilege
of giving his new life, in whatever environment, to a soul so fair as
hers.While his house was being set in order under the direction of Rosendo,
Jose visited the church with the Alcalde to formulate plans for its
immediate repair and renovation.As he surveyed the ancient pile and
reflected that it stood as a monument to the inflexible religious
convictions of his own distant progenitors, the priest's sensibilities
were profoundly stirred.How little he knew of that long line of
illustrious ancestry which preceded him!He had been thrust from under
the parental wing at the tender age of twelve; but he could not recall
that even before that event his father had ever made more than casual
mention of the family.Indeed, in the few months since arriving on
ancestral soil Jose had gathered up more of the threads which bound
him to the ancient house of Rincon than in all the years which
preceded.Had he himself only been capable of the unquestioning
acceptance of religious dogma which those old _Conqueros_ and early
forbears exhibited, to what position of eminence in Holy Church might
he not already have attained, with every avenue open to still greater
preferment!How glorious their
honored name!--

With a sigh the priest roused himself and strove to thrust these
disturbing thoughts from his mind by centering his attention upon the
work in hand.Dona Maria came to him for permission to take the moldy
vestments from the _sacristia_ to her house to clean them.The
Alcalde, bustling about, panting and perspiring, was distributing
countless orders among his willing assistants.Carmen, who throughout
the morning had been everywhere, bubbling with enthusiasm, now
appeared at the church door.As she entered the musty, ill-smelling
old building she hesitated on the threshold, her childish face screwed
into an expression of disgust."Come in, little one; I need your inspiration," called Jose cheerily.The child approached, and slipped her hand into his."Padre Rosendo
says this is God's house," she commented, looking up at Jose."He says
you are going to talk about God here--in this dirty, smelly old place!Why don't you talk about Him out of doors?"Jose was becoming innured to the embarrassment which her direct
questions occasioned.And he was learning not to dissemble in his
replies."It is because the people want to come here, dear one; it is their
custom."Would the people believe that the wafer and wine could be changed into
the flesh and blood of Jesus elsewhere--even in Nature's temple?"But _I_ don't want to come here!""That was a naughty thing to say to the good _Cura_, child!"interposed Don Mario, who had overheard the girl's remark."You see,
Padre, how we need a _Cura_ here to save these children; otherwise the
Church is going to lose them.They are running pretty wild, and
especially this one.She is already dedicated to the Church; but she
will have to learn to speak more reverently of holy things if she
expects to become a good Sister."The child looked uncomprehendingly from, one to the other."Oh, Padre Diego, at her baptism, when she was a baby," replied Don
Mario in a matter of fact tone.Jose shuddered at the thought of that unholy man's loathsome hands
resting upon the innocent girl.Of
all things, he knew that the guarding of his own tongue was now most
important.But his thought was busy with Rosendo's burning words of
the preceding day, and with his own solemn vow.He reflected on his
present paradoxical, hazardous position; on the tremendous problem
which here confronted him; and on his desperate need of wisdom--yea,
superhuman wisdom--to ward off from this child the net which he knew
the subtlety and cruel cunning of shrewd, unscrupulous men would some
day cause to be cast about her.A soul like hers, mirrored in a body
so wondrous fair, must eventually draw the devil's most envenomed
barbs.To Jose's great relief Don Mario turned immediately from the present
topic to one relating to the work of renovation.Finding a pretext for
sending Carmen back to the house, the priest gave his attention
unreservedly to the Alcalde.But his mind ceased not to revolve the
implications in Don Mario's words relative to the girl; and when the
midday _siesta_ came upon him his brow was knotted and his eyes gazed
vacantly at the manifestations of activity about him.Hurrying across the road to escape the scalding heat, Jose's ears
again caught the sound of singing, issuing evidently from Rosendo's
house.It was very like the clear, sweet voice which had floated into
his room the morning after he awoke from his delirium.He approached
the door reverently and looked in.Carmen was arranging the few poor
dishes upon the rough table, and as she worked, her soul flowed across
her lips in song.The words and the simple melody which
carried them were evidently an improvisation.But the voice--did that
issue from a human throat?Yes, for in distant Spain and far-off Rome,
in great cathedrals and concert halls, he had sometimes listened
entranced to voices like this--stronger, and delicately trained, but
reared upon even less of primitive talent.The girl caught sight of him; and the song died on the warm air.The priest strode toward her and clasped her in his arms."And I suppose He tells you when to sing, too, as He does
Cantar-las-horas?""No, Padre," was the unaffected answer.The man felt rebuked for his light remark; and a lump rose in his
throat.He looked again into her fair face with a deep yearning.Did you but know--could you but realize--that
the kingdom of heaven is within you, would not celestial melody flow
from your lips, too?Throughout the afternoon, while he labored with his willing helpers in
the church building and his homely cottage, the child's song lingered
in his brain, like the memory of a sweet perfume.His eyes followed
her lithe, graceful form as she flitted about, and his mind was busy
devising pretexts for keeping her near him.At times she would steal
up close to him and put her little hand lovingly and confidingly into
his own.Then as he looked down into her upturned face, wreathed with
smiles of happiness, his breath would catch, and he would turn
hurriedly away, that she might not see the tears which suffused his
eyes.When night crept down, unheralded, from the _Sierras_, the priest's
house stood ready for its occupant.Cantar-las-horas had dedicated it
by singing the _Angelus_ at the front door, for the hour of six had
overtaken him as he stood, with cocked head, peering curiously within.The dwelling, though pitifully bare, was nevertheless as clean as
these humble folk with the primitive means at their command could
render it.Instead of the customary hard _macana_ palm strips for the
bed, Rosendo had thoughtfully substituted a large piece of tough white
canvas, fastened to a rectangular frame, which rested on posts well
above the damp floor.On this lay a white sheet and a light blanket of
red flannel.Rosendo had insisted that, for the present, Jose should
take his meals with him.The priest's domestic arrangements,
therefore, would be simple in the extreme; and Dona Maria quietly
announced that these were in her charge.The church edifice would not
be in order for some days yet, perhaps a week.But of this Jose was
secretly glad, for he regarded with dread the necessity of discharging
the priestly functions.And yet, upon that hinged his stay in Simiti."Simiti has two churches, you know, Padre," remarked Rosendo during
the evening meal."There is another old one near the eastern edge of
town.If you wish, we can visit it while there is yet light."Jose expressed his pleasure; and a few minutes later the two men, with
Carmen dancing along happily beside them, were climbing the shaly
eminence upon the summit of which stood the second church.On the way
they passed the town cemetery."The Spanish cemetery never grows," commented Jose, stopping at the
crumbling gateway and peering in.The place of sepulture was the
epitome of utter desolation.A tumbled brick wall surrounded it, and
there were a few broken brick vaults, in some of which whitening bones
were visible.In a far corner was a heap of human bones and bits of
decayed coffins."Their rent fell due, Padre," said Rosendo with a little laugh,
indicating the bones."The Church rents this ground to the people--it
is consecrated, you know.And if the payments are not made, why, the
bones come up and are thrown over there.""But you see, Padre, the Church is only concerned with souls.And it
is better to pay the money to get souls out of purgatory than to rent
a bit of ground for the body, is it not?""Come, Padre," continued Rosendo."I would not want to have to spend
the night here.For, you know, if a man spends a night in a cemetery
an evil spirit settles upon him--is it not so?"Jose still kept silence before the old man's inbred superstition.A
few minutes later they stood before the old church.It was in the
Spanish mission style, but smaller than the one in the central
_plaza_."This was built in the time of your great-grandfather, Padre, the
father of Don Ignacio," offered Rosendo."The Rincon family had many
powerful enemies throughout the country, and those in Simiti even
carried their ill feeling so far as to refuse to hear Mass in the
church which your family built.Strange noises are sometimes heard inside, and the
people are afraid to go in.You see there are no houses built near it.They say an angel of the devil lives here and thrashes around at times
in terrible anger.There is a story that many years ago, when I was
but a baby, the devil's angel came and entered this church one dark
night, when there was a terrible storm and the waves of the lake were
so strong that they tossed the crocodiles far up on the shore.And
when the bad angel saw the candles burning on the altar before the
sacred wafer he roared in anger and blew them out.But there was a
beautiful painting of the Virgin on the wall, and when the lights went
out she came down out of her picture and lighted the candles again.But the devil's angel blew them out once more.And then, they say, the
Holy Virgin left the church in darkness and went out and locked the
wicked angel in, where he has been ever since.That was to show her
displeasure against the enemies of the great Rincons for erecting this
church.The _Cura_ died suddenly that night; and the church has never
been used since The Virgin, you know, is the special guardian Saint of
the Rincon family.""But you do not believe the story, Rosendo?""_Quien sabe?_" was the noncommittal reply."Do you really think the Virgin could or would do such a thing,
Rosendo?"She has the same power as God, has she not?The frame
which held her picture"--reverting again to the story--"was found out
in front of the church the next morning; but the picture itself was
gone."Jose glanced down at Carmen, who had been listening with a tense, rapt
expression on her face.What impression did this strange story make
upon her?She looked up at the priest with a little laugh."Let us go in, Padre," she said."I--I would--rather not," the old man replied hesitatingly.Physical danger was temperamental to this noble
son of the jungle; yet the religious superstition which Spain had
bequeathed to this oppressed land still shackled his limbs.As they descended the hill Carmen seized an opportunity to speak to
Jose alone."Some day, Padre," she whispered, "you and I will open the
door and let the bad angel out, won't we?"He knew that the door of his own mind
had swung wide at her bidding in these few days, and many a bad angel
had gone out forever.CHAPTER 6


The dawn of a new day broke white and glistering upon the ancient
_pueblo_.From their hard beds of palm, and their straw mats on the
dirt floors, the provincial dwellers in this abandoned treasure house
of Old Spain rose already dressed to resume the monotonous routine of
their lowly life.The duties which confronted them were few, scarce
extending beyond the procurement of their simple food.And for all,
excepting the two or three families which constituted the shabby
aristocracy of Simiti, this was limited in the extreme.Indian corn,
_panela_, and coffee, with an occasional addition of _platanos_ or
rice, and now and then bits of _bagre_, the coarse fish yielded by the
adjacent lake, constituted the staple diet of the average citizen of
this decayed hamlet.A few might purchase a bit of lard at rare
intervals; and this they hoarded like precious jewels.Some
occasionally had wheat flour; but the long, difficult transportation,
and its rapid deterioration in that hot, moist climate, where swarms
of voracious insects burrow into everything not cased in tin or iron,
made its cost all but prohibitive.And the latter even exceeded in value the black, naked
babes that played in the hot dust of the streets with them.Standing in the warm, unadulterated sunlight in
his doorway he watched the village awaken.At a door across the
_plaza_ a woman appeared, smoking a cigar, with the lighted end in her
mouth.Jose viewed with astonishment this curious custom which
prevails in the _Tierra Caliente_.He had observed that in Simiti
nearly everybody of both sexes was addicted to the use of tobacco, and
it was no uncommon sight to see children of tender age smoking heavy,
black cigars with keen enjoyment.From another door issued two
fishermen, who, seeing the priest, approached and asked his blessing
on their day's work.Some moments later he heard a loud tattoo, and
soon the Alcalde of the village appeared, marching pompously through
the streets, preceded by his tall, black secretary, who was beating
lustily upon a small drum.At each street intersection the little
procession halted, while the Alcalde with great impressiveness
sonorously read a proclamation just received from the central
Government at Bogota to the effect that thereafter no cattle might be
killed in the country without the payment of a tax as therein set
forth.Groups of _peones_ gathered slowly about the few little stores
in the main street, or entered and inspected for the thousandth time
the shabby stocks.Matrons with black, shining faces cheerily greeted
one another from their doorways.Everywhere prevailed a gentle decorum
of speech and manners.For, however lowly the station, however pinched
the environment, the dwellers in this ancient town were ever gentle,
courteous and dignified.Their conversation dealt with the simple
affairs of their quiet life.They knew nothing of the complex
problems, social, economic, or religious, which harassed their
brethren of the North.No dubious aspirations or ambitions stirred
their breasts.Nothing of the frenzied greed and lust of material
accumulation touched their child-like minds.They dwelt upon a plane
far, far removed, in whatever direction, from the mental state of
their educated and civilized brothers of the great States, who from
time to time undertake to advise them how to live, while ruthlessly
exploiting them for material gain.And thus they have been exploited
ever since the heavy hand of the Spaniard was laid upon them, four
centuries ago.Thus they will continue to be, until that distant day
when mankind shall have learned to find their own in another's good.As his eyes swept his environment, the untutored folk, the old church,
the dismally decrepit mud houses, with an air of desolation and utter
abandon brooding over all; and as he reflected that his own complex
nature, rather than any special malice of fortune, had brought this to
him, Jose's heart began to sink under the sting of a condemning
conscience.Its pitiful emptiness smote
him sore.No books, no pictures, no furnishings, nothing that
ministers to the comfort of a civilized and educated man!And yet,
amid this barrenness he had resolved to live.A song drifted to him through the pulsing heat of the morning air.It
sifted through the mud walls of his poor dwelling, and poured into the
open doorway, where it hovered, quivering, like the dust motes in the
sunbeams.It was Carmen, the child
to whom his life now belonged.Resolutely he again set his wandering
mind toward the great thing he would accomplish--the protection and
training of this girl, even while, if might be, he found his life
again in hers.Nothing on earth should shake him from that purpose!Doubt and uncertainty were powerless to dull the edge of his efforts.His bridges were burned behind him; and on the other side of the great
gulf lay the dead self which he had abandoned forever.A harsh medley of loud, angry growls, interspersed with shrill yelps,
suddenly arose before his house, and Jose hastened to the door just in
time to see Carmen rush into the street and fearlessly throw herself
upon two fighting dogs.she exclaimed, dragging the angry brute
from a thoroughly frightened puppy.And after all I've talked to you about loving that
puppy!"The gaunt animal slunk down, with its tail between its legs."Did you ever gain anything at all by fighting?And right down in your heart you know you love that puppy.You've
_got_ to love him; you can't help it!And you might as well begin
right now."The beast whimpered at her little bare feet."Cucumbra, you let bad thoughts use you, didn't you?Yes, you did; and
you're sorry for it now.Well, there's the puppy," pointing to the
little dog, which stood hesitant some yards away."Now go and play
with him," she urged.rousing the larger dog and
pointing toward the puppy.Cucumbra hesitated, looking alternately at the small, resolute girl
and the smaller dog.Her arm remained rigidly extended, and
determination was written large in her set features.The puppy uttered
a sharp bark, as if in forgiveness, and began to scamper playfully
about.Cucumbra threw a final glance at the girl.The large dog bounded after the puppy, and together they disappeared
around the street corner.The child turned and saw Jose, who had regarded the scene in mute
astonishment."_Muy buenos dias, Senor Padre_," dropping a little courtesy."But
isn't Cucumbra foolish to have bad thoughts?""Why, yes--he certainly is," replied Jose slowly, hard pressed by the
unusual question."He has just _got_ to love that puppy, or else he will never be happy,
will he, Padre?"Why would this girl persist in ending her statements with an
interrogation!How could he know whether Cucumbra's happiness would be
imperfect if he failed in love toward the puppy?"Because, you know, Padre," the child continued, coming up to him and
slipping her hand into his, "padre Rosendo once told me that God was
Love; and after that I knew we just had to love everything and
everybody, or else He can't see us--can He, Padre?"He can't see us--if we don't love everything and everybody!Jose
wondered what sort of interpretation the Vatican, with its fiery
hatred of heretics, would put upon this remark."Dear child, in these matters you are teaching me; not I you," replied
the noncommittal priest."But, Padre, you are going to teach the people in the church," the
girl ventured quizzically.In his hour of need the
answer was vouchsafed him."Yes, dearest child--and I am going to teach them what I learn from
_you_."Carmen regarded him for a moment uncertainly."But, padre Rosendo says
you are to teach _me_," she averred."And so I am, little one," the priest replied; "but not one half as
much as I shall learn from you."Dona Maria's summons to breakfast interrupted the conversation.Throughout the repast Jose felt himself subjected to the closest
scrutiny by Carmen.What was running through her thought, he could
only vaguely surmise.But he instinctively felt that he was being
weighed and appraised by this strange child, and that she was finding
him wanting in her estimate of what manner of man a priest of God
ought to be.And yet he knew that she embraced him in her great love.Oftentimes his quick glance at her would find her serious gaze bent
upon him.But whenever their eyes met, her sweet face would instantly
relax and glow with a smile of tenderest love--a love which, he felt,
was somehow, in some way, destined to reconstruct his shattered life.Jose's plans for educating the girl had gradually evolved into
completion during the past two days.He explained them at length to
Rosendo after the morning meal; and the latter, with dilating eyes,
manifested his great joy by clasping the priest in his brawny arms."But remember, Rosendo," Jose said, "learning is not _knowing_.I can
only teach her book-knowledge.But even now, an untutored child, she
knows more that is real than I do.""Ah, Padre, have I not told you many times that she is not like us?exclaimed the emotional Rosendo, his eyes
suffused with tears of joy as he beheld his cherished ideals and his
longing of years at last at the point of realization.What he, too,
had instinctively seen in the child was now to be summoned forth; and
the vague, half-understood motive which had impelled him to take the
abandoned babe from Badillo into the shelter of his own great heart
would at length be revealed.With a final
clasp of the priest's hand, he rushed from the house to plunge into
the work in progress at the church.Jose summoned Carmen into the quiet of his own dwelling.She came
joyfully, bringing an ancient and obsolete arithmetic and a much
tattered book, which Jose discovered to be a chronicle of the heroic
deeds of the early _Conquistadores_.she exclaimed with glistening eyes; "and I've
read some of this, but I don't like it," making a little _moue_ of
disgust and holding aloft the battered history."Padre Rosendo told me to show it to you," she continued."But it is
all about murder, you know.And yet," with a little sigh, "he has
nothing else to read, excepting old newspapers which the steamers
sometimes leave at Bodega Central.And they are all about murder, and
stealing, and bad things, too.Padre, why don't people write about
good things?"Jose gazed at her reverently, as of old the sculptor Phidias might
have stood in awe before the vision which he saw in the unchiseled
marble."Padre Rosendo helped me with the fractions," went on the girl,
flitting lightly to another topic; "but I had to learn the decimals
myself.And they are so easy, aren't
they?hugging the old book to her little
bosom.Both volumes, printed in Madrid, were reliques of Spanish colonial
days."Read to me, Carmen," said Jose, handing her the history.The child took the book and began to read, with clear enunciation, the
narrative of Quesada's sanguinary expedition to Bogota, undertaken in
the name of the gentle Christ.Jose wondered as he listened what
interpretation this fresh young mind would put upon the motives of
that renowned exploit.The precipitation with which the question had been propounded almost
took his breath away.He raised his eyes to hers, and looked long and
wonderingly into their infinite depths.And then the vastness of the
problem enunciated by her demand loomed before him.What, after all,
did he know about Jesus?Had he not arrived in Simiti in a state of
agnosticism regarding religion?Had he not come there enveloped in
confusion, baffled, beaten, hopeless?And then, after his wonderful
talk with Rosendo, had he not agreed with him that the child's thought
must be kept free and open--that her own instinctive religious ideas
must be allowed to develop normally, unhampered and unfettered by the
external warp and bias of human speculation?It was part of his plan
that all reference to matters theological should be omitted from
Carmen's educational scheme.Yet here was that name on her lips--the
first time he had ever heard it voiced by her.And it smote him like a
hammer."Not now, little one," he said hastily."I want to hear you read more
from your book.""No," she replied firmly, laying the volume upon the table."I don't
like it; and I shouldn't think you would, either.Besides, it isn't
true; it never really happened.""Why, of course it is true, child!It is history, the story of how the
brave Spaniards came into this country long ago.We will read a great
deal more about them later.""No," with a decisive shake of her brown head; "not if it is like
this.It isn't true; I told padre Rosendo it wasn't.""Well, what do you mean, child?""It is only a lot of bad thoughts printed in a book," she replied
slowly."And it isn't true, because God is _everywhere_."Clearly the man was encountering difficulties at the outset; and a
part, at least, of his well-ordered curriculum stood in grave danger
of repudiation at the hands of this earnest little maid.The girl stood looking at him wistfully.Then her sober little face
melted in smiles.With childish impulsiveness she clambered into his
lap, and twining her arms about his neck, impressed a kiss upon his
cheek."I love you, Padre," she murmured; "and you love me, don't you?"He pressed her to him, startled though he was."God knows I do, little
one!""Of course He does," she eagerly agreed; "and He knows you don't want
to teach me anything that isn't true, doesn't He, Padre dear?"Yea, and more; for Jose was realizing now, what he had not seen
before, that _it was beyond his power to teach her that which was not
true_.The magnitude and sacredness of his task impressed him as never
before.His puzzled brain grappled feebly with the enormous problem.She had rebuked him for trying to teach her things which, if he
accepted the immanence of God as fact, her logic had shown him were
utterly false.Clearly the grooves in which this child's pure thought
ran were not his own.And if she would not think as he did, what
recourse was there left him but to accept the alternative and think
with her?For he would not, even if he could, force upon her his own
thought-processes."Then, Carmen," he finally ventured, "you do not wish to learn about
people and what they have done and are doing in the big world about
you?""Oh, yes, Padre; tell me all about the good things they did!""But they did many wicked things too, _chiquita_.And the good and the
bad are all mixed up together.""No," she shook her head vigorously; "there isn't any bad.There is
only good, for God is everywhere--isn't He?"She raised up and looked squarely into the priest's eyes.Dissimulation,
hypocrisy, quibble, cant--nothing but fearless truth could meet that
gaze.Suddenly a light broke in upon his clouded thought.This girl--this
tender plant of God--why, she had shown it from the very beginning!And he, oh, blind that he was!The
secret of her power, of her ecstasy of life--what was it but
this?--_she knew no evil!_

And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."It was the first--the very first--lesson which Thou
didst teach Thy child, Israel, as the curtain rose upon the drama of
human life!And the awful warning has rung down through the corridors
of time from the mouths of the prophets, whom we slew lest they wake
us from our mesmeric sleep!Israel forgot Thy words; and the world has
forgotten them, long, long since.Daily we mix our perfumed draft of
good and evil, and sink under its lethal influence!Hourly we eat of
the forbidden tree, till the pangs of death encompass us!And when at last the dark angel hovered over the sin-stricken earth
and claimed it for his own, the great Master came to sound again the
warning--"As a man thinketh in his heart, _so is he_!"But they would
have none of him, and nailed him to a tree!Even the unique Son of God
wept as he looked with yearning upon you!Because of your
stubborn clinging to false ways, false beliefs, false thoughts of God
and man!Because ye would not be healed; ye would not be made whole!Ye loved evil--ye gave it life and power, and ye rolled it like a
sweet morsel beneath your tongue--and so ye died!So came death into
this fair world, through the heart, the brain, the mind of man, _who
sought to know what God could not_!"Padre dear, you are so quiet."The girl nestled closer to the awed
priest.And so the multitude on Sinai had stood in awed quiet as
they listened to the voice of God.The man could not grasp the infinite
import of the marvelous fact.And yet he had sought to teach her
falsities--to teach her that evil did exist, as real and as potent
as good, and that it was to be accepted and honored by mankind!But
she had turned her back upon the temptation."Padre, are you going to tell me about Jesus?""Yes, yes--I want to know nothing else!I will get my Bible, and we
will read about him!""But have you never--has your padre Rosendo never told you that it is
the book that tells--?""But," her face kindling, "he told me
that Jesus was God's only son.But we are all His children, aren't
we?"But Jesus was the greatest--"

"Did Jesus write the Bible, Padre?""No--we don't know who did.People used to think God wrote it; but I
guess He didn't.""Then we will not read it, Padre."The man bent reverently over the little brown head and prayed again
for guidance.What could he do with this child, who dwelt with
Jehovah--who saw His reflection in every flower and hill and fleecy
cloud--who heard His voice in the sough of the wind, and the ripple of
the waters on the pebbly shore!And, oh, that some one had bent over
him and prayed for guidance when he was a tender lad and his heart
burned with yearning for truth!"God wrote the arithmetic--I mean, He told people how to write it,
didn't He, Padre?"Surely the priest could acquiesce in this, for mathematics is purely
metaphysical, and without guile.And we will go right through this little book.Then,
if I can, I will send for others that will teach you wonderful things
about what we call mathematics."The priest had now found the only path
which she would tread with him, and he continued with enthusiasm."And God taught people how to talk, little one; but they don't all
talk as we do.There is a great land up north of us, which we call the
United States, and there the people would not understand us, for we
speak Spanish.I must teach you their language, _chiquita_, and I must
teach you others, too, for you will not always live in Simiti.""I want to stay here always, Padre."No, Carmen; God
has work for you out in His big world.You have something to tell His
people some day, a message for them.But you and I have much work to
do here first.And so we will begin with the arithmetic and English.Later we will study other languages, and we will talk them to each
other until you speak them as fluently as your own.And meanwhile, I
will tell you about the great countries of the world, and about the
people that live in them.And we will study about the stars, and the
rocks, and the animals; and we will read and work and read and work
all day long, every day!"The priest's face was aglow with animation."But, Padre, when shall I have time to think?""Why, you will be thinking all the time, child!""What other things do
you have to think about, _chiquita_?""About all the people here who are sick and unhappy, and who quarrel
and don't love one another.""Do you think about people when they are sick?"she replied vigorously "When they are sick I go where
nobody can find me and then just think that it isn't so.""_Hombre!_" the priest ejaculated, his astonishment soaring Then--

"But when people are sick it is really so, isn't it, _chiquita_?""It can't be--not if God is everywhere.The child drove the heart-searching question straight
into him."Why--no, I can't say that He does."Because they think bad things, Padre.And they don't care about Him--they
don't love Him.And so they get sick," she explained succinctly.Jose's mind reverted to what Rosendo had told him.When he lay tossing
in delirium Carmen had said that he would not die.And yet that was
perfectly logical, if she refused to admit the existence of evil."I thought lots about you last week, Padre."The soft voice was close to his ear, and every breath swept over his
heartstrings and made them vibrate."Every night when I went to sleep I told God I _knew_ He would cure
you."Verily, I have not seen such faith, no, not in Israel!And the faith
of this child had glorified her vision until she saw "the heavens open
and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.""Carmen"--the priest spoke reverently--"do the sick ones always get
well when you think about them?"There was not a shade of euphemism in the unhesitating reply--

"They are never really sick, Padre.""But, by that you mean--"

"They only have bad thoughts."he suggested by way of drawing out her full
meaning."Yes, Padre--for God, you know, really _is_ everywhere.""What put such ideas into your little head?Yes, of a verity she spoke truth.For nothing but her constant
communion with Him could have filled her pure thought with a deeper,
truer lore than man has ever quaffed at the world's great fountains of
learning.He himself, trained by Holy Church, deeply versed in
letters, science, and theology, grounded in all human learning, sat in
humility at her feet, drinking in what his heart told him he had at
length found--Truth."Carmen, how do you know, how are you
sure, that He told you?""But just how do you know that it is true?""Why--it comes out that way; just like the answers to the problems in
arithmetic.I used to try to see if by thinking only good thoughts
to-day I would be better and happier to-morrow.""Well, I always was, Padre.And so now I don't think anything but good
thoughts.""That is, you think only about God?""I always think about Him _first_, Padre."He had no further need to question her proofs, for he knew she was
taught by the Master himself."That will be all for this morning, Carmen," he said quietly, as he
put her down.I, too, have some thinking to do."When Carmen left him, Jose lapsed into profound meditation.Musing
over his life experiences, he at last summed them all up in the vain
attempt to evolve an acceptable concept of God, an idea of Him that
would satisfy.He had felt that in Christianity he had hold of
something beneficent, something real; but he had never been able to
formulate it, nor lift it above the shadows into the clear light
of full comprehension.And the result of his futile efforts to this
end had been agnosticism.His inability conscientiously to accept
the mad reasoning of theologians and the impudent claims of Rome had
been the stumbling block to his own and his family's dearest earthly
hopes.He knew that popular Christianity was a disfigurement of truth.He knew that the theological claptrap which the Church, with such
oracular assurance, such indubitable certainty and gross assumption
of superhuman knowledge, handed out to a suffering world, was a
travesty of the divinely simple teachings of Jesus, and that it had
estranged mankind from their only visible source of salvation, the
Bible.He saw more clearly than ever before that in the actual
achievements of popular theology there had been ridiculously little
that a seriously-minded man could accept as supports to its claims
to be a divinely revealed scheme of salvation.Yet there was no
vital question on which certainty was so little demanded, and
seemingly of so little consequence, as this, even though the
joints of the theologians' armor flapped wide to the assaults of
unprejudiced criticism.But if the slate were swept clean--if current theological dogma were
overthrown, and the stage set anew--what could be reared in their
stead?Is it true that the Bible is based upon propositions which can
be verified by all?The explorer in Cartagena had given Jose a new
thought in Arnold's concept of God as "the Eternal, not ourselves,
that makes for righteousness."And it was not to be denied that, from
first to last, the Bible is a call to righteousness.Assuredly something vastly
more profound, for even that "misses the mark."No, righteousness was
right conduct until the marvelous Jesus appeared.But he swept it at
once from the material into the mental; from the outward into the
inward; and defined it as _right-thinking_!murmured Jose, sitting with head buried in his hands."Aye, the whole scheme of salvation is held in that one word!And the
wreck of my life has been caused by my blind ignorance of its
tremendous meaning!But Carmen, wise
little soul, divined it instinctively; for, if there is one thing that
is patent, it is that if a thing is evil it does not exist for her.Of course it means _thinking no evil_!Jesus lived his
thorough understanding of it.And so would the
world, but for the withering influence of priestly authority!"At that moment Carmen reappeared to summon him to lunch."Come here, little girl," said Jose, drawing her to him."You asked me
to tell you about Jesus.He was the greatest and best man that ever
lived.And it was because he never had a bad thought."The little face turned lovingly
up to his.And so do I--now; for I have found Him even in
desolate Simiti."CHAPTER 7


Carmen's studies began in earnest that afternoon.In the quiet of his
humble cottage Jose, now "a prisoner of the Lord," opened the door of
his mental storehouse and carefully selected those first bits of
knowledge for the foundation stones on which to rear for her, little
by little, a broad education.He found her a facile learner; her thorough ease in the rudiments
of arithmetic and in the handling of her own language delighted him.His plan of tutelage, although the result of long contemplation, and
involving many radical ideas regarding the training of children,
ideas which had been slowly developing in his mind for years, he
nevertheless felt in her case to be tentative.For he was dealing
with no ordinary child; and so the usual methods of instruction were
here wholly out of the question.But on several points he was already firmly resolved.First, he would
get well below the surface of this child's mind, and he would endeavor
to train her to live in a depth of thought far, far beneath the froth
and superficiality of the every-day thinking of mankind.Fortunately,
she had had no previous bad training to be counteracted now.Nature
had been her only tutor; and Rosendo's canny wisdom had kept out all
human interference.Her unusual and
mature thought had set up an intellectual barrier between herself and
the playmates she might have had.Fortunately, too, Jose had now to
deal with a child who all her life had thought vigorously--and, he was
forced to conclude, correctly.Habits of accurate observation and
quick and correct interpretation would not be difficult to form in
such a mind.Moreover, to this end he would aim to maintain her
interest at the point of intensity in every subject undertaken; yet
without forcing, and without sacrifice of the joys of childhood.He
would be, not teacher only, but fellow-student.He would strive to
learn with her to conceive the ideal without losing sight of the fact
that it was a human world in which they dwelt.When she wished to
play, he would play with her.But he would contrive and direct their
amusements so as to carry instruction, to elucidate and exemplify it,
to point morals, and steadily to contribute to her store of knowledge.But he could not know then that
Nature--if we may thus call it--had anticipated him, and that the
child, long since started upon the quest for truth, would quickly
outstrip him in the matter of conceiving the ideal and living in this
world of relative fact with an eye single to the truth which shines so
dimly through it.Jose knew, as he studied Carmen and planned her training, that
whatever instruction he offered her must be without taint of evil, so
far as he might prevent.And yet, the thought of any attempt to
withhold from her a knowledge of evil brought a sardonic smile to his
lips.She had as yet everything to learn of the world about her.Could
such learning be imparted to her free from error or hypothesis, and
apart from the fiat of the speculative human mind?It must be; for he
knew from experience that she would accept his teaching only as he
presented every apparent fact, every object, every event, as a
reflection in some degree of her immanent God, and subject to rigid
demonstration.Where historical events externalized only the evil
motives of the carnal mind, he must contrive to omit them entirely, or
else present them as unreality, the result of "bad thoughts" and
forgetfulness of God.In other words, only as he assumed to be the
channel through which God spoke to her could he hope for success.To
impart to her a knowledge of both good and evil was, at least at
present, impossible.To force it upon her later would be criminal.Moreover, _why not try the audacious experiment of permitting and
aiding this child to grow up without a knowledge of evil_?--that is,
in her present conviction that only good is real, potent and
permanent, while evil is impotent illusion and to be met and overcome
on that basis.Would the resultant training make of her a tower of
strength--or would it render her incapable of resisting the onslaughts
of evil when at length she faced the world?His own heart sanctioned
the plan; and--well, the final judgment should be left to Carmen
herself.At times Cucumbra interrupted by bounding
in, as if impatient of the attention his little mistress was giving
her tutor.Frequently the inquisitive Cantar-las-horas stalked through
the room, displaying a most dignified and laudable interest in the
proceedings.Late in the afternoon, when the sun was low, Bosendo
appeared at the door.As he stood listening to Jose's narrative of men
and places in the outside world, his eyes bulged.At length his
untutored mind became strained to its elastic limit.he could not refrain from interrupting, when
Jose had spoken of the fast trains of England."Why, the Simiti trail
to Tachi is one hundred and fifty miles long; and it always took me
six days to walk it.And do you say there are trains that travel that
distance in as many hours?""There are trains, Rosendo, that traverse the distance in three
hours.""_Na_, Padre, it can't be done!"cried the incredulous Rosendo,
shaking his head."I have more
pliable material here to handle than you."But Rosendo remained; and it was evident to the priest that he had
come on an errand of importance.Moreover, the supper hour was at
hand, and perhaps Dona Maria needed Carmen's help.So, dismissing the
child, Jose turned to Rosendo."You were right," he began, as if taking up the thread of a broken
discourse."Carmen _was_ left on the river bank by the angels.""Then you do think it was a miracle!"said Rosendo in a voice of awe,
as he sank into a chair."Everything is a miracle, friend; for a miracle is
simply a sign of God's presence.And finding Carmen in this musty,
forgotten place is one of the greatest."Yes, Padre, that is true," assented Rosendo gravely."I was led here," continued Jose; "I see it now.Rosendo, all my life
I have regarded evil as just as real and powerful as good.And my life
has been one of bitterness and woe.Carmen sees only the good God
everywhere.Simply that my mental attitude has been all wrong, my views erroneous,
my thinking bad.I have tried to know both good and evil, to eat of
the forbidden tree.And for so doing I was banished from paradise."Why--well, no, Padre--that is, I--" The honest fellow was becoming
confused."Well, just this, then," explained the priest with animation."I
haven't gotten anywhere in life, and neither have you, because we have
limited ourselves and crippled our efforts by yielding to fear, pride,
ignorance, and the belief in evil as a real power opposed to good.""I have often wondered myself, Padre, how there could be a devil if
God is almighty.For in that case He would have had to make the devil,
wouldn't He?""And as He did make
everything, then either He made the devil, or else there isn't any.""But that is pretty hard to see, Padre," replied the puzzled Rosendo."Simply the belief that there is a power apart from God.""But doesn't that belief come from the devil?"Listen, Rosendo: Carmen is daily
putting into practice her instinctive knowledge of a mighty fact.She
will reveal it all to us in due time.Let us patiently watch her, and
try to see and understand and believe as she does.But in the
meantime, let us guard our minds as we would a treasure house, and
strive never to let a thought of evil get inside!My past life should
serve as a perpetual warning."Rosendo did not reply at once, but sat staring vacantly at the ground.Jose knew that his thoughts were with his wayward daughter.Then, as
if suddenly remembering the object of his call, he took from his
wallet two letters, which he handed to Jose with the comment: "Juan
brought them up from Bodega Central this morning."One was from Spain, from his
uncle.It was six weeks old when it arrived in
Simiti, and had been written before the news of his removal from
Cartagena had reached Seville.His mother was well; and her hopes for
her son's preferment were steadily reviving, after the cruel blow
which his disgrace in Rome had given them.For his uncle's part, he
hoped that Jose had now seen the futility of opposition to Holy
Church, and that, yielding humbly to her gentle chastisement for the
great injury he had inflicted upon her, he would now make amends and
merit the favors which she was sure to bestow upon him in due season.To this end the uncle would bring to bear his own influence and that
of His Eminence, the Archbishop of Seville.The letter closed with an
invocation to the Saints and the ever-blessed Virgin.It was nominally from the Bishop of
Cartagena, although written, he well knew, by Wenceslas.His Reverence
regretted that Jose had not come to him again before leaving
Cartagena.He deplored exceedingly the necessity of assigning him to
so lowly a parish; but it was discipline.His tenure of the parish
would be a matter of probation.Assuming a penitent desire on the part
of the priest to make reparation for past indiscretions, His Grace
extended assurances of his support and tender consideration.And,
regarding him still as a faithful son, he was setting forth herewith
certain instructions which Jose would zealously carry out, to the
glory of the sacred Mother Church and the blessed Virgin, and to his
own edification, to wit: In the matter of the confessional he must be
unremittingly zealous, not failing to put such questions to the people
of Simiti as would draw out their most secret thoughts.In the present
crisis it was especially necessary to learn their political views.Likewise, he must not fail to impress upon them the sin of concealing
wealth, and of withholding contributions to the support of the
glorious Mother.He, as priest of the parish, would be held personally
responsible for the collection of an adequate "Peter's Pence," which
must be sent to Cartagena at frequent intervals for subsequent
shipment to Rome.For all contributions he was to allow liberal
plenary indulgences.In the matter of inciting zeal for the salvation
of those unfortunate souls lingering in the torments of purgatory,
Jose must be unflagging.Each family in the parish should be
constantly admonished and threatened, if necessary, to have Masses
said for their deceased members; and he must forward the proceeds from
such Masses at once to Cartagena.No less important, he must keep
constantly before him the great fact that the hope of the blessed
Mother lay in her young.To this end he must see that all children in
his parish were in due time confirmed, and every effort made to have
the females sent to the convent of Mompox.To encourage his
parishioners, he might assure them of His Reverence's tender regard
for them as his beloved children, and that he had certain special
favors to grant to them in due time.Also, that a statue of the
Virgin, which had arrived from Rome, and which carried the most potent
blessing of the Holy Father, was to be bestowed upon that church in
the diocese which within the next twelve months should contribute the
largest amount of Peter's Pence in proportion to population.This plan
should be especially attractive to the people of Simiti, as the town
lay on the confines of a district renowned in the ancient annals for
its mineral wealth.Herein, too, lay a great opportunity for the
priest; and His Reverence rejoiced in the certain knowledge that he
would embrace it.Invoking the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the
Ever-Blessed Virgin and Saint Joseph, His Grace awaited with interest
the priest's first report from the parish of Simiti.The letter fell like a wet blanket upon Jose, chilling him to the
marrow, for it revived with cruel poignancy the fact that he was still
a servant of Rome.In the past few happy days he had dwelt apart from
the world in the consciousness of a new heaven and a new earth,
revealed by Carmen.This sudden call to duty was like a summons from
Mephistopheles to the fulfillment of a forgotten pact.Beneath the specious kindliness of
Wenceslas lay sinister motives, he knew.But--a darker thought--did Wenceslas know of Carmen's existence?Could
Cartagena have received any intimation of his plans for her?Refusal
to comply with these instructions meant--he dared not think what!On
the other hand, strict compliance with them certainly was out of the
question.As for Peter's Pence, what could the impoverished folk of this
decrepit town furnish!And yet, if a reasonable sum could only be
contributed at frequent intervals, would not the vampire Wenceslas
rest content, at least for a while?Oh, for a fortune of his own, that
he might dump it all into the yawning maw of Holy Church, and thus
gain a few years' respite for himself and Carmen!Rosendo inquired, anxiously regarding the priest's
strained features.What could the man do or say, limited, hounded, and without resources?Could he force these simple people to buy Masses?Could he take their
money on a pretext which he felt to be utterly false?Yet Cartagena
_must_ be kept quiet at any hazard!"Rosendo," he asked earnestly, "when you had a priest in Simiti, did
the people have Masses offered for their dead?""_Na_, Padre, we have little money for Masses," replied Rosendo
sadly."At times--long ago--for my first wife, when she died without a
priest, up in the Tigui country.I
couldn't see how Masses said by that drunken priest could please God,
or make Him release souls from purgatory--and Padre Diego was drunk
most of the time.""Rosendo, we _must_ send money to the Bishop in
Cartagena.I _must_ stay here--I _must_!And I can stay only by
satisfying Wenceslas!If I can send him money he will think me too
valuable to remove.It is not the Church, Rosendo, but Wenceslas who
is persecuting me.He is using the
Church for his own evil ends.But I--I
can't make these poor people buy Masses!And--but here, read his
letter," thrusting it into Rosendo's hand.Rosendo shook his head thoughtfully, and a cloud had gathered over his
strong face when he returned the Bishop's letter to Jose."Padre, we will be hard pressed to support the church and you, without
buying Masses.There are about two hundred people here, perhaps fifty
families.Only a few can afford to pay
even a _peso oro_ a month to the schoolmaster to have their children
taught.They may be able to give twenty _pesos_ a month to support you
and the church.It seemed to Jose that his soul must burst under its limitations."Rosendo, let us take Carmen and flee!""How far would we get, Padre?He lapsed into silence-shrouded despair.The sun dropped below the wooded hills, and Cantar-las-horas had sung
his weird vesper song.Dusk was thickening into night, though upon the
distant _Sierras_ a mellow glow still illumined the frosted peaks.Moments crept slowly through the enveloping silence.Then the mental gloom parted, and through it arose the great soul of
the black-faced man sitting beside the despairing priest."Padre"--Rosendo spoke slowly and with deep emotion.Tears trickled
down his swart cheeks--"I am no longer young.More than sixty years of
hardship and heavy toil rest upon me.My parents--I have not told you
this--were slaves.They worked in the mines of Guamoco, under hard
masters.They lived in bamboo huts, and slept on the damp ground.At
four each morning, year after year, they were driven from their hard
beds and sent out to toil under the lash fourteen hours a day, washing
gold from the streams.The gold went to the building of Cartagena's
walls, and to her Bishop, to buy idleness and luxury for him and his
fat priests.When the war came it lasted thirteen years; but we drove
the Christian Spaniards into the sea!Then my father and mother went
back to Guamoco; and there I was born.When I was old enough to use a
_batea_ I, too, washed gold in the Tigui, and in the little streams so
numerous in that region.But they had been pretty well washed out
under the Spaniards; and so my father came down here and made a little
_hacienda_ on the hills across the lake from Simiti.Then he and my
poor mother lay down and died, worn out with their long years of toil
for their cruel masters."He brushed the tears from his eyes; then resumed: "The district of
Guamoco gradually became deserted.Revolution after revolution broke
out in this unhappy country, sometimes stirred up by the priests,
sometimes by political agitators who tried to get control of the
Government.The men and boys went to the wars, and were killed off.Guamoco was again swallowed up by the forest--"

He stopped abruptly, and sat some moments silent."I have been back there many times since, and often I have washed gold
again along the beautiful Tigui," he continued."But the awful
loneliness of the jungle, and the memories of those gloomy days when I
toiled there as a boy, and the thoughts of my poor parents' sufferings
under the Spaniards, made me so sad that I could not stay.And then I
got too old for that kind of work, standing bent over in the cold
mountain water all day long, swinging a _batea_ heavy with gravel."He paused again, and seemed to lose himself in the memory of those
dark days."But there is still gold in the Tigui.It means hard
work--but I can do it.Padre, I will go back there and wash out gold
for you to send to the Bishop of Cartagena, that you may stay here and
protect and teach the little Carmen.Perhaps in time I can wash enough
to get you both out of the country; but it will take many months, it
may be, years."O, you, whose path in life winds among pleasant places, where roses
nod in the scented breeze and fountains play, picture to yourself, if
you may, the self-immolation of this sweet-souled man, who, in the
winter of life, the shadows of eternity fast gathering about him,
bends his black shoulders again to the burden which Love would lay
upon them.Aye, Love, into which all else merged--Love for the unknown
babe, left helpless and alone on the great river's bank--Love for the
radiant child, whose white soul the agents of carnal greed and lust
would prostitute to their iniquitous system.By the light of their single candle the priest and Rosendo
ate their simple fare in silence.Carmen was asleep, and the angels
watched over her lowly bed.The meal ended, Rosendo took up the candle, and Jose followed him into
the bedroom.Reverently the two men approached the sleeping child and
looked down upon her.The priest's hand again sought Rosendo's in a
grasp which sealed anew the pact between them.CHAPTER 8


Like the great Exemplar in the days of his preparation, Jose was
early driven by the spirit into the wilderness, where temptation
smote him sore.But his soul had been saved--"yet so as by fire."Slowly old beliefs and faiths crumbled into dust, while the new
remained still unrevealed.The drift toward atheism which had set in
during his long incarceration in the convent of Palazzola had not
made him yield to the temptation to raise the mask of hypocrisy and
plunge into the pleasures of the world, nor accept the specious
proffer of ecclesiastical preferment in exchange for his honest
convictions.Honor, however bigoted the sense, bound him to his
oath, or at least to a compromising observance of it harmless to the
Church.Pride contributed to hold him from the degradation of a
renegade and apostate priest.And both rested primarily on an
unshaken basis of maternal affection, which fell little short of
obsession, leaving him without the strength to say, "Woman, what
have I to do with thee?"But, though atheism in belief leads almost inevitably to disintegration
of morals, Jose had kept himself untainted.For his vital problems he
had now, after many days, found "grace sufficient."In what he had
regarded as the contemptible tricks of fate, he was beginning to
discern the guiding hand of a wisdom greater than the world's.The
danger threatened by Cartagena was, temporarily, at least, averted
by Rosendo's magnificent spirit.Under the spur of that sacrifice his
own courage rose mightily to second it.Rosendo spent the day in preparation for his journey into the Guamoco
country.He had discussed with Jose, long and earnestly, its probable
effect upon the people of Simiti, and especially upon Don Mario, the
Alcalde; but it was decided that no further explanation should be made
than that he was again going to prospect in the mineral districts
already so familiar to him.As Rosendo had said, this venture,
together with the unannounced and unsolicited presence of the priest
in the town, could not but excite extreme curiosity and raise the most
lively conjectures, which might, in time, reach Wenceslas.On the
other hand, if success attended his efforts, it was more than probable
that Cartagena would remain quiet, as long as her itching palm was
brightened with the yellow metal which he hoped to wrest from the
sands of Guamoco."It is only a chance, Padre," Rosendo said
dubiously."In the days of the Spaniards the river sands of Guamoco
produced from two to ten _reales_ a day to each slave.But the rivers
have been almost washed out."A Spanish _real_ was equivalent
to half a franc.Then ten _reales_ would amount to five francs, the
very best he could hope for as a day's yield."And my supplies and the support of the senora and Carmen must come
out of that," Rosendo added."Besides, I must pay Juan for working the
_hacienda_ across the lake for me while I am away."Possibly ten _pesos oro_, or forty francs, might remain at the end of
each month for them to send to Cartagena.Jose sighed heavily as he
busied himself with the preparations."I got these supplies from Don Mario on credit, Padre," explained
Rosendo."I thought best to buy from him to prevent making him angry.I have coffee, _panela_, rice, beans, and tobacco for a month.He was
very willing to let me have them--but do you know why?He wants me to
go up there and fail.Then he will have me in his debt, and I become
his _peon_--and I would never be anything after that but his slave,
for never again would he let me get out of debt to him."Jose shuddered at the thought of the awful system of peonage prevalent
in these Latin countries, an inhuman custom only a degree removed from
the slavery of colonial times.This venture was, without doubt, a
desperate risk.But it was for Carmen--and its expediency could not be
questioned.Jose penned a letter to the Bishop of Cartagena that morning, and
sent it by Juan to Bodega Central to await the next down-river
steamer.He did not know that Juan carried another letter for the
Bishop, and addressed in the flowing hand of the Alcalde.Jose
briefly acknowledged the Bishop's communication, and replied that he
would labor unflaggingly to uplift his people and further their
spiritual development.As to the Bishop's instructions, he would
endeavor to make Simiti's contribution to the support of Holy
Church, both material and spiritual, fully commensurate with the
population.He did not touch on the other instructions, but closed
with fervent assurances of his intention to serve his little flock
with an undivided heart.Carmen received no lesson that day, and
her rapidly flowing questions anent the unusual activity in the
household were met with the single explanation that her padre
Rosendo had found it necessary to go up to the Tigui river, a
journey which some day she might perhaps take with him.During the afternoon Jose wrote two more letters, one to his uncle,
briefly announcing his appointment to the parish of Simiti, and his
already lively interest in his new field; the other to his beloved
mother, in which he only hinted at the new-found hope which served as
his pillow at night.He did not mention Carmen, for fear that his
letter might be opened ere it left Cartagena.But in tenderest
expressions of affection, and regret that he had been the unwitting
cause of his mother's sorrow, he begged her to believe that his life
had received a stimulus which could not but result in great happiness
for them both, for he was convinced that he had at last found his
_metier_, even though among a lowly people and in a sequestered part
of the world.He hoped again to be reunited to her--possibly she might
some day meet him in Cartagena.And until then he would always hold
her in tenderest love and the brightest and purest thought.He brushed aside the tears as he folded this letter; and, lest regret
and self-condemnation seize him again, hurried forth in search of
Carmen, whose radiance always dispelled his gloom as the rushing dawn
shatters the night.She was not in Rosendo's house, and Dona Maria said she had seen the
child some time before going in the direction of the "shales."These
were broad beds of rock to the south of town, much broken and deeply
fissured, and so glaringly hot during most of the day as to be
impassable.Thither Jose bent his steps, and at length came upon the
girl sitting in the shade of a stunted _algarroba_ tree some distance
from the usual trail."Well, what are you doing here, little one?""I was thinking, Padre," she
made slow reply."But do you have to go away from home to think?""I wanted to be alone; and there was so much going on in the house
that I came out here.""And what have you been thinking about, Carmen?"pursued Jose,
suspecting that her presence in the hot shale beds held some deeper
significance than she had as yet revealed."I--I was just thinking that God is everywhere," she faltered."That He is where padre Rosendo is going, and that He will take care
of him up there, and bring him back to Simiti again.""And were you asking Him to do it, little one?""No, Padre; I was just _knowing_ that He would."The little lip quivered, and the brown eyes were wet with tears.But
Jose could see that faith had conquered, whatever the struggle might
have been.The child evidently had sought solitude, that she might
most forcibly bring her trust in God to bear upon the little problem
confronting her--that she might make the certainty of His immanence
and goodness destroy in her thought every dark suggestion of fear or
doubt."God will take care of him, won't He, Padre?"Jose had taken her hand and was leading her back to the house."You have said it, child; and I believe you are a law unto yourself,"
was the priest's low, earnest reply.The child smiled up at him; and
Jose knew he had spoken truth.That evening, the preparations for departure completed, Rosendo and
Jose took their chairs out before the house, where they sat late, each
loath to separate lest some final word be left unsaid.The tepid
evening melted into night, which died away in a deep silence that hung
wraith-like over the old town.Myriad stars rained their shimmering
lustre out of the unfathomable vault above."_Un canasto de flores_," mused Rosendo, looking off into the infinite
blue."A basket of flowers, indeed," responded Jose reverently."Padre--" Rosendo's brain seemed to struggle with a tremendous
thought--"I often try to think of what is beyond the stars; and I
cannot."But, if we could get out to the last star--what then?""Still no end, no limit," replied Jose."And they are very far away--how far, Padre?""You would not comprehend, even if I could tell you, Rosendo.Others so far that
their light reaches us only after the lapse of centuries."Light from those stars above us travels nearly two hundred
thousand miles a second--"

"_Hombre!_" ejaculated the uncomprehending Rosendo."And yet, even at that awful rate of speed, it is probable that there
are many stars whose light has not yet reached the earth since it
became inhabited by men.""_Caramba!_"

"You may well say so, friend.""But, Padre--does the light never stop?When does it reach an end--a
stopping-place?""There is no stopping-place, Rosendo.Go whichever way you will, you can never reach an end."Rosendo's brow knotted with puzzled wonder: Even Jose's own mind
staggered anew at its concept of the immeasurable depths of space."But, Padre, if we could go far enough up we would get to heaven,
wouldn't we?""And if we went far enough down we
would reach purgatory, and then hell, is it not so?"He dared not answer lest he reveal his
own paucity of ideas regarding these things.Happily the loquacious
Rosendo continued without waiting for reply."Padre Simon used to say when I was a child that the red we saw in the
sky at sunset was the reflection of the flames of hell; so I have
always thought that hell was below us--perhaps in the center of the
earth."For a time his simple mind mused over this puerile idea.Then--

"What do you suppose God looks like, Padre?"Jose's thought flew back to the galleries and chapels of Europe, where
the masters have so often portrayed their ideas of God in the shape of
an old, gray-haired man, partly bald, and with long, flowing beard.how pitifully crude, how lamentably impotent such childish
concepts.For they saw in God only their own frailties infinitely
magnified.Small wonder that they lived and died in spiritual gloom!"Padre," Rosendo went on, "if there is no limit to the universe, then
it is--"

"Infinite in extent, Rosendo," finished Jose."Then whoever made it is infinite, too," Rosendo added hypothetically."An infinite effect implies an infinite cause--yes, certainly," Jose
answered."So, if God made the universe, He is infinite, is He not, Padre?""Then He can't be at all like us," was the logical conclusion.And
scientists agree that it is infinite in extent.Its creator therefore
must be infinite in extent.And as the universe continues to exist,
that which called it into being, and still maintains it, must likewise
continue to exist."Padre, what holds the stars in place?"Rosendo's questions were as
persistent as a child's."They are held in place by laws, Rosendo," the priest replied
evasively.But as he made answer he revolved in his own mind that the
laws by which an infinite universe is created and maintained must
themselves be infinite.But, the priest mused, a power great enough to frame infinite laws
must be itself all-powerful.And if it has ever been all-powerful, it
could never cease to be so, for there could be nothing to deprive it
of its power.Or, what is the
same thing, is all-inclusive.But laws originate, even as among human beings, in mind, for a law is
a mental thing.So the infinite laws which bind the stars together,
and by which the universe was designed and is still maintained, could
have originated only in a mind, and that one infinite."Then God surely must know everything," commented Rosendo, by way of
simple and satisfying conclusion.Certainly the creator of an infinite universe--a universe, moreover,
which reveals intelligence and knowledge on the part of its cause--the
originator of infinite laws, which reveal omnipotence in their
maker--must have all knowledge, all wisdom, at his command.But, on
the other hand, intelligence, knowledge, wisdom, are ever mental
things.What could embrace these things, and by them create an
infinite universe, but an infinite _mind_?Jose's thought reverted to Cardinal Newman's reference to God as "an
initial principle."Surely the history of the universe reveals the
patent fact that, despite the mutations of time, despite growth,
maturity, and decay, despite "the wreck of matter and the crash of
worlds," _something_ endures.Yes, the mind which is the _anima mundi_, the
principle, of all things."But if He is so great, Padre, and knows everything, I don't see why
He made the devil," continued Rosendo; "for the devil fights against
Him all the time."A mind so pure as yours should
give no heed to thoughts of Satan.And the man at your side is now too
deeply buried in the channels which run below the superficiality of
the world's thought to hear your childish question.The cause of
an infinite effect must itself be infinite.The framer of infinite
laws must be an infinite mind.And an infinite mind must contain all
knowledge, and have all power.But were it to contain any seeds or
germs of decay, or any elements of discord--in a word, any evil--it
must disintegrate.Verily, to be
eternal and perfect _it must be wholly good_!"And so," the priest
mused aloud, "we call it God."But, he continued to reflect, when we accept the conclusion that the
universe is the product of an infinite mind, we are driven to certain
other inevitable conclusions, if we would be logical.The minds of men
manifest themselves continually, and the manifestation is in mental
processes and things.Mental activity results in the unfolding of
ideas.Does the activity of an infinite mind differ in this respect?And, if not, can the universe be other than a mental thing?For, if an
infinite mind created a universe, it must have done so _by the
unfolding of its own ideas_!And, remaining infinite, filling all
space, this mind must ever continue to contain those ideas.And the
universe--the creation--is mental.The burden of thought oppressed the priest, and he got up from his
chair and paced back and forth before the house.But still his
searching mind burrowed incessantly, as if it would unearth a living
thing that had been buried since the beginning.In order to fully express itself, an infinite mind would have to
unfold an infinite number and variety of ideas.And this unfolding
would go on forever, since an infinite number is never reached.This
is "creation," and it could never terminate."Rosendo," said Jose, returning to his chair, "you have asked what
God looks like.I cannot say, for God must be mind, unlimited mind.He
has all knowledge and wisdom, as well as all power.He is necessarily
eternal--has always existed, and always will, for He is entirely
perfect and harmonious, without the slightest trace or taint of
discord or evil.""Then you think He does not look like us?""Mind does not look like a human body, Rosendo.And an infinite cause
can be infinite only by being mind, not body.Moreover, He is
unchanging--for He could not change and remain eternal.Carmen insists
that He is everywhere.To be always present He must be what the Bible
says He is spirit.Or, what is the same thing, mind.Rosendo, He
manifests Himself everywhere and in everything--there is no other
conclusion admissible.And to be eternal He has got to be _absolutely
good_!""But, Padre," persisted Rosendo, "who made the devil?""But there is wickedness--"

"No!""God is infinite good, and there
can be no real evil.""But how do you know that, Padre?""I can't say how I know it--it reasons out that way logically.I think
I begin to see the light.Can you not see that for some reason Carmen
doesn't admit the existence of evil?And you know, and I know, that
she is on the right track.I have followed the opposite path all my
life; and it led right into the slough of despond.Now I have turned,
and am trying to follow her.And do you put the thought of Satan out
of your mentality and do likewise.""But, the Virgin Mary--she has power with God?"Rosendo's primitive
ideas were in a hopeless tangle."Good friend, forget the Virgin Mary," said Jose gently, laying his
hand on Rosendo's arm._Hombre!_ Why--she has all power--she works miracles
every hour--she directs the angels--gives commands to God himself!Padre Simon said she was the absolute mistress of heaven and earth,
and that men and animals, the plants, the winds, all health, sickness,
life and death, depended upon her will!He said she did not die as we
must, but that she was taken up into heaven, and that her body was not
allowed to decay and return to dust, as ours will._Hombre!_ She is in
heaven now, praying for us.What would become of us but for her?--for
she prays to God for us--she--!""No, Rosendo, she does nothing of the kind.He could not be moved or influenced by the Virgin Mary or
any one else.He is not angry with us--He
couldn't be, for He could not know anger.Did not Jesus say that God
was Love?Love does not afflict--Love does not need to be importuned
or prayed to.We
suffer when we sin, because we'miss the mark.'But the punishment
lasts only as long as the sin continues.And we suffer only until we
know that God is infinite good, and that there is no evil.That is the
truth, I feel sure, which Jesus came to teach, and which he said would
make us free.From the awful beliefs that use us, and
to which we are now subject, until we learn the facts about God and
His creation.Don't you see that infinite good could never create
evil, nor ever permit evil to be created, nor allow it to really
exist?""That we must wait to learn, Rosendo, little by little.You know, the
Spanish proverb says, 'Step by step goes a great way.'But meantime,
let us go forward, clinging to this great truth: God is infinite
good--He is love--we are His dear children--and evil was _not_ made by
Him, and does not have His sanction.And, being such, it can be overcome, as Jesus said
it could.""_Na_, Padre--"

"Wait, Rosendo!""Carmen is doing just what I
am advising you to do--is she not?""Padre, she knows God better than she knows me," the man whispered."It was you who first told her that God was everywhere, was it not?"And the mind of the child, keenly sensitive and receptive to truth,
had eagerly grasped this dictum and made it the motif of her life.She
knew nothing of Jesus, nothing of current theology.Divine Wisdom had
used Rosendo, credulous and superstitious though he himself was, to
guard this girl's mind against the entrance of errors which were
taught him as a child, and which in manhood held him shackled in
chains which he might not break."Rosendo," Jose spoke low and reverently, "I believe now that you and
I have both been guided by that great mind which I am calling God.I
believe we are being used for some beneficent purpose, and that it has
to do with Carmen.That purpose will be unfolded to us as we bow to
His will.Every way closed against me, excepting the one that led to
Simiti.And now there seems to be but one way open
to you--to go back to Guamoco.And you go, forgetful of self, thinking
only that you serve her.Ah, friend, you are serving Him whom you
reflect in love to His beautiful child.""But, while we accept our tasks gratefully, I feel that we shall be
tried--and we may not live to see the results of our labors.There are
influences abroad which threaten danger to Carmen and to us.But we have given ourselves to her, and
through her to the great purpose with which I feel she is concerned."Rosendo slowly rose, and his great height and magnificent physique
cast the shadow of a Brobdignan in the light as he stood in the
doorway."Padre," he replied, "I am an old man, and I have but few years left.But however many they be, they are hers.And had I a thousand, I would
drag them all through the fires of hell for the child!I cannot follow
you when you talk about God.But this I know, the
One who brought me here and then went away will some day call for
me--and I am always ready."He turned into the house and sought his hard bed.The great soul knew
not that he reflected the light of divine Love with a radiance unknown
to many a boasting "vicar of Christ."CHAPTER 9


At the first faint flush of morn Rosendo departed for the hills.The
emerald coronels of the giant _ceibas_ on the far lake verge burned
softly with a ruddy glow.From the water's dimpling surface downy
vapors rose languidly in delicate tints and drew slowly out in
nebulous bands across the dawn sky.The smiling softness of the
velvety hills beckoned him, and the pungent odor of moist earth
dilated his nostrils.He laughed aloud as the joyousness of youth
surged again through his veins.The village still slumbered, and no
one saw him as he smote his great chest and strode to the boat, where
Juan had disposed his outfit and was waiting to pole him across.Only
the faithful Dona Maria had softly called a final "_adioscito_" to him
when he left his house.A half hour later, when the dugout poked its
blunt nose into the ooze of the opposite shore, he leaped out and
hurriedly divested himself of his clothing.Then he lifted his chair
with its supplies to his shoulders, and Juan strapped it securely to
his back, drawing the heavy band tightly across his forehead.With a
farewell wave of his hand to the lad, the man turned and plunged into
the Guamoco trail, and was quickly lost in the dense thicket.Six days
later, if no accident befell, he would reach his destination, the
singing waters of the crystal Tigui.His heart leaped as he strode, though none knew better than he what
hardships those six days held for him--days of plunging through
fever-laden bogs; staggering in withering heat across open savannas;
now scaling the slippery <DW72>s of great mountains; now swimming the
chill waters of rushing streams; making his bed where night overtook
him, among the softly pattering forest denizens and the swarming
insect life of the dripping woods.His black skin glistened with
perspiration and the heavy dew wiped from the close-growing bush.With
one hand he leaned upon a young sapling cut for a staff.With the
other he incessantly swung his _machete_ to clear the dim trail.His
eyes were held fixed to the ground, to escape tripping over low vines,
and to avoid contact with crawling creatures of the jungle, whose
sting, inflicted without provocation, might so easily prove fatal.His
active mind sported the while among the fresh thoughts stimulated by.his journey, though back of all, as through a veil, the vision of
Carmen rose like the pillar of cloud which guided the wandering
Israel.Toil and danger fled its presence; and from it radiated a warm
glow which suffused his soul with light.When Jose arose that morning he was still puzzling over the logical
conclusions drawn from his premise of the evening before, and trying
to reconcile them with common sense and prevalent belief.In a way, he
seemed to be an explorer, carving a path to hidden wonders.Dona Maria
greeted him at the breakfast table with the simple announcement of
Rosendo's early departure.No sign of sorrow ruffled her quiet and
dignified demeanor.Nor did Carmen, who bounded into his arms, fresh
as a new-blown rose, manifest the slightest indication of anxiety
regarding Rosendo's welfare.Jose might not divine the thoughts which
the woman's placid exterior concealed.But for the child, he well knew
that her problem had been met and solved, and that she had laid it
aside with a trust in immanent good which he did not believe all the
worldly argument of pedant or philosopher could shake.cried Jose joyously, the meal finished."Just a look-in at the church, to get the boys started; and then
to devote the day to you, senorita!"Returning from the church some moments later, Jose found Carmen
bending over the fireplace, struggling to remove a heavy kettle from
the hot stones.he cried in apprehension, hurrying to her
assistance."You will burn your fingers, or hurt yourself!""Not unless you make me, Padre," Carmen quickly replied, rising and
confronting the priest with a demeanor whose every element spelled
rebuke."Well, I certainly shall not _make_ you!"But--"

"And nothing else can, for He is everywhere--isn't He?""Well--perhaps so," the priest retorted impatiently."But somehow
people get burnt and hurt just the same, and it is well to be
careful."Then she said quietly--

"I guess people burn and hurt themselves because they are afraid--don't
they?She tossed her brown curls as if in defiance of the thought of fear.Yet Jose somehow felt that she never really defied evil, but rather
met its suggestions with a firm conviction of its impotence in the
presence of immanent good.He checked the impulse to further
conversation.Bidding the child come to him as soon as possible to
begin the day's work, he went back to his own abode to reflect.He had previously said that this child should be brought up to know no
evil.And yet, was he not suggesting evil to her at every turn?Did
not his insistence upon the likelihood of hurting or burning herself
emphasize his own stalwart belief in evil as an immanent power and
contingency?Was he thus always to maintain a house divided against
itself?But some day she _must_ know, whether by instruction or dire
experience, that evil is a fact to be reckoned with!And as her
protector, it was his duty to--But he had not the heart to shatter
such beautiful confidence!Then he fell to wondering how long that pure faith could endure.Certainly not long if she were subjected to the sort of instruction
which the children of this world receive.But was it not his duty with
proper tutelage to make it last as long as possible?Was it not even
now so firmly grounded that it never could be shaken?He dwelt on the fact that nearly all children at some period early in
life commune with their concept of God.As a very
young child he had even felt himself on such terms of familiarity with
God that he could not sleep without first bidding Him good night.As a
young child, too, he had known no evil.Nor do any children, until
their perfect confidence in good is chilled by the false instruction
of parents and teachers, who parade evil before them in all its
hideous garb.for the baneful belief that years bring wisdom.How pitiable,
and how cruelly detrimental to the child are an ignorant parent's
assumptions of superiority!How tremendous the responsibility that now
lay at his own door!Yet no greater than that which lies at the door
of every parent throughout the world.It is sadly true, he reflected, that children are educated almost
entirely along material lines.Even in the imparting of religious
instruction, the spiritual is so tainted with materialism, and its
concomitants of fear and limitation, that the preponderance of faith
is always on the material side.Jose had believed that as he had grown
older in years he had lost faith.The quantity of his
faith remained fixed; but the quality had changed, through education,
from faith in good to faith in evil.And though trained as a priest of
God, in reality he had been taught wholly to distrust spiritual
power.But how could a parent rely on spiritual power to save a child about
to fall into the fire?Must not children be warned, and taught to
protect themselves from accident and disaster, as far as may be?True--yet, what causes accident and disaster?Has the parent's thought
aught to do with it?Can it be traced to the
universal acceptance of evil as a power, real and operative?Does
mankind's woeful lack of faith in good manifest itself in accident,
sickness, and death?A cry roused Jose from his revery.Hastening to the rear door he saw Dona Maria standing petrified,
looking in wide-eyed horror toward the lake.Jose followed her gaze,
and his blood froze.Carmen had been sent to meet the canoe that daily
supplied fresh water to the village from the Juncal river, which
flowed into the lake at the far north end.It had not yet arrived, and
she had sat down beside her jar at the water's edge, and was lost in
dreams as she looked out over the shimmering expanse.A huge crocodile
which had been lying in the shadow of a shale ledge had marked the
child, and was steadily creeping up behind her.The reptile was but a
few feet from her when Dona Maria, wondering at her delay, had gone to
the rear door and witnessed her peril.In a flash Jose recalled the tale related to him but a few days before
by Fidel Avila, who was working in the church."Padre," Fidel had said, "as soon as the church is ready I shall
offer a candle to good _Santa Catalina_ for protecting my sister.""She protected her from a crocodile a year ago, Padre.The girl had
gone to the lake to get water to wash our clothes, and as she sat in
the stern of the boat dipping the water, a great crocodile rose and
seized her arm.I heard her scream, and I was saying the rosary at the
time.And so I prayed to _Santa Catalina_ not to let the crocodile eat
her, and she didn't.""The crocodile pulled her under the water, Padre, and she was drowned.But he did not eat her; and we got her body and buried her here in the
cemetery._Sancta simplicitas!_ That such childish credulity might be turned
into proper channels!But there were times when fish were scarce in the lake.Then the
crocodiles became bold; and many babes had been seized and dragged off
by them, never to return.And more than one fisherman had asked Jose to invoke the Virgin in his
behalf.Nearer crept the monster toward the unsuspecting girl.Suddenly she
turned and looked squarely at it.She might almost have touched it
with her hand.For Jose it was one of those crises that "crowd
eternity into an hour."The child and the reptile might have been
painted against that wondrous tropic background.The great brute stood
bolt upright on its squat legs, its hideous jaws partly open.The girl
made no motion, but seemed to hold it with her steady gaze.Then--the
creature dropped; its jaws snapped shut; and it scampered into the
water.cried Jose, as he rushed to the girl and clasped her in
his arms."Forgive me if I ever doubted the miracles of Jesus!"Dona Maria turned and quietly resumed her work; but the man was
completely unstrung.Carmen asked in unfeigned surprise."I am not
afraid of crocodiles--are you?You couldn't be, if you knew that God
is everywhere.""But don't you know, child, that crocodiles have carried off--"

He checked himself."Nothing--nothing--I forgot--that's all.A--a--come, let us begin our
lessons now."But his mind refused to be held to the work.Finally he had to ask--he
could not help it."Carmen, what did you do?"Why, no, Padre--crocodiles don't talk!"And throwing her little head
back she laughed heartily at the absurd idea."No, Padre, I did nothing," the child persisted.He saw he must reach her thought in another way."Why did the
crocodile come up to you, Carmen?""Why--I guess because it loved me--I don't know.""And did you love it as you sat looking at it?""Y--yes--that is so, _chiquita_.I--I just thought I would ask you.And "perfect love casteth out
fear."What turned the monster from the girl and drove it into the
lake?Love, again, before which evil falls in sheer impotence?"He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High
shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty."There could be no question about it, _as long as
she knew no evil_.From arithmetic, they turned to the
English lesson.Next to perfection in her own Castilian, Jose felt
that this language was most important for her.And she delighted in
it, although her odd little pronunciations, and her vain attempts to
manipulate words to conform to her own ideas of enunciation brought
many a hearty laugh, in which she joined with enthusiasm.The
afternoon, as was his plan for future work, was devoted to narratives
of men and events, and to descriptions of places.It was a ceaseless
wonder to Jose how her mind absorbed his instruction."How readily you see these things, Carmen," he said, as he concluded
the work for the day.The remark seemed to start a train of thought within her mentality."Padre," she at length asked, "how do we see with our eyes?""It is very simple, _chiquita_," Jose replied."Here, let me draw a
picture of an eye."He quickly sketched a rough outline of the human organ of sight."Now," he began, "you know you cannot see in the dark, don't you?""In order to see, we must have light.""A--a--a--well, nothing--that is, light is just vibrations.The
pendulum of the old clock in Don Mario's store vibrates, you
know--moves back and forth."Now that chair there, for example, reflects
light, just as a mirror does.And these are
all of just a certain length, for vibrations of just that length and
moving up and down just so fast make light.The light enters the eye,
like this," tracing the rays on his sketch."It makes a little picture
of the chair on the back of the eye, where the optic nerve is
fastened.Now the light makes the little ends of this nerve vibrate,
too--move very rapidly.And that movement is carried along the nerve
to some place in the brain--to what we call the center of sight."But, Padre, is the picture of the chair carried on the nerve to the
brain?""Oh, no, _chiquita_, only vibrations.It is as if the nerve moved just
a little distance, but very, very fast, back and forth, or up and
down.""And no picture is carried to the brain?""No, there is just a vibration in the brain.""And that vibration makes us see the chair?"Then--

"Padre dear, I don't believe it.""Well, Padre, what is it that sees the chair, anyway?""Is the mind up there in the brain?""Well--no, we can't say that it is.""A--a--well, no place in particular--that is, it is right here all the
time.""Well, then, when the mind wants to see the chair does it have to
climb up into the brain and watch that little nerve wiggle?"The man was at a loss for an answer.Carmen suddenly crumpled the
sketch in her small hand and smiled up at him."Padre dear, I don't believe our outside eyes see anything.We just
think they do, don't we?"Carmen's weird heron was
stalking in immense dignity past the house."I think Cantar-las-horas is getting ready to sing the Vespers,
_chiquita_.And so Dona Maria probably needs you now.We will talk
more about the eye to-morrow."By the light of his sputtering candle that night Jose sat with elbows
propped on the table, his head clasped in his hands, and a sketch of
the human eye before him.In his confident attempt to explain to
Carmen the process of cognition he had been completely baffled.Certainly, light coming from an object enters the eye and casts a
picture upon the retina.He had often seen the photographic camera
exhibit the same phenomenon.The law of the impenetrability of matter
had to be set aside, of course--or else light must be pure vibration,
without a material vibrating concomitant.Then, too, it was plain that
the light in some way communicated its vibration to the little
projecting ends of the optic nerve, which lie spread out over the rear
inner surface of the eye.And equally patent that this vibration is in
some way taken up by the optic nerve and transmitted to the center of
sight in the brain.He laughed again at Carmen's
pertinent question about the mind climbing up into the brain to see
the vibrating nerve.But was it so silly a presumption, after all?Is
the mind within the brain, awaiting in Stygian darkness the advent of
the vibrations which shall give it pictures of the outside world?Or
is the mind outside of the brain, but still slavishly forced to look
at these vibrations of the optic nerve and then translate them into
terms of things without?What could a vibrating nerve suggest to a
well-ordered mind, anyway?He might as logically wave a piece of meat
and expect thereby to see a world!Why does not the foolish mind leave the brain and look at the picture
on the retina?Or why does it not throw off its shackles and look
directly at the object to be cognized, instead of submitting to
dependence upon so frail a thing as fleshly eyes and nerves?As he mused and sketched, unmindful of the voracious mosquitoes or the
blundering moths that momentarily threatened his light, it dawned
slowly upon him that the mind's awareness of material objects could
not possibly depend upon the vibrations of pieces of nerve tissue, so
minute as to be almost invisible to the unaided sight.Still more
absurd did it appear to him that his own mind, of which he might
justly boast tremendous powers, could be prostituted to such a degree
that its knowledge of things must be served to it on waving pieces of
flesh.And how about the other senses--touch, hearing?Did the ear hear, or
the hand feel?He had always accepted the general belief that man is
dependent absolutely upon the five physical senses for his knowledge
of an outside world.And now a little thought showed that from these
five senses man could not possibly receive anything more than a series
of disconnected vibrations!And, going a step further, anything that
the mind infers from these vibrations is unquestionably inferred
_without a particle of outside authority_!A tremendous idea seemed to be knocking
at the portal of his mentality.Assuredly nothing but the contents of itself.But the contents of mind are thoughts, ideas, mental things.Then the mind knows
not things, but its _thoughts of things_.And instead of seeing,
hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling solid material objects, the
mind sees, hears, smells, tastes, and feels--what?Is only what
the mind _believes_ it to be.But surely his mind saw an outer world
through the medium of his eye!His mind saw only its own concepts
of an outer world--and these concepts, being mental, might take on
whatever hue and tinge his mind decreed.In other words, instead of
seeing a world of matter, he was seeing only a mental picture of a
world.And that picture was in his own mind, _and formed by that
mind_!The man seized his hat and hurried out into the night.He walked
rapidly the full length of the town.His mind was wrestling with
stupendous thoughts.An hour later he returned to his house, and seizing a pencil, wrote
rapidly: Matter is mental.We do not see or feel matter, but we
_think_ it.It is formed and held as a mental concept in every human
mind.The material universe is but the human mind's concept of a
universe, and can only be this mentality's translation to itself of
infinite Mind's purely mental Creation."And so," he commented aloud, sitting back and regarding his writing,
"all my miserable life I have been seeing only my own thoughts!And I
have let them use me and color my whole outlook!"He extinguished the candle and threw himself, fully dressed, upon his
bed.CHAPTER 10


Momentous changes, of far-reaching effect, had come swiftly upon Jose
de Rincon during the last few days, changes which were destined after
much vacillation and great mental struggle to leave a reversed
outlook.But let no one think these changes fortuitous or casual, the
chance result of a new throw of Fate's dice.Jose, seeing them dimly
outlined, did not so regard them, but rather looked upon them as the
working of great mental laws, still unknown, whose cumulative effect
had begun a transformation in his soul.How often in his seminary days
he had pondered the scripture, "He left not Himself without witness."How often he had tried to see the hopeless confusion of good and evil
in the world about him as a witness to the One who is of purer eyes
than to behold evil.And he had at last abandoned his efforts in
despair.Yet that there must be something behind the complex phenomena
which men call life, he knew.Call it what he would--law, force, mind,
God, or even X, the great unknown quantity for which life's intricate
equations must be solved--yet _something_ there was in it all which
endured in an eternal manifestation.But could that something endure
in an expression both good and evil?He had long since abandoned all study of the Bible.But in these last
days there had begun to dawn upon him the conviction that within that
strange book were locked mysteries which far transcended the wildest
imaginings of the human mind.With it came also the certainty that
Jesus had been in complete possession of those sacred mysteries.There
could be no question now that his mission had been woefully
misunderstood, often deliberately misinterpreted, and too frequently
maliciously misused by mankind.His greatest sayings, teachings so
pregnant with truth that, had they been rightfully appropriated by
men, ere this would have dematerialized the universe and revealed the
spiritual kingdom of God, had been warped by cunning minds into crude
systems of theology and righteous shams, behind which the world's
money-changers and sellers of doves still drove their wicked traffic
and offered insults to Truth in the temple of the Most High.Oh, how he now lamented the narrowness and the intellectual
limitations with which his seminary training had been hedged about!The world's thought had been a closed book to him.Because of his
morbid honesty, only such pages reached his eye as had passed the
bigoted censorship of Holy Church.His religious instruction had been
served to him with the seal of infallible authority.Of other systems
of theology he had been permitted only the Vatican's biased
interpretation, for the curse of Holy Church rested upon them.Of
current philosophical thought, of Bible criticism and the results of
independent scriptural research, he knew practically nothing--little
beyond what the explorer had told him in their memorable talks a few
weeks before in Cartagena.But, had he known it, these had unbarred
the portals of his mind to the reception of the new ideas which, under
a most powerful stimulus, were now flowing so steadily through them.To meet with a child of tender years who knows no evil is, after all,
a not uncommon thing.For, did we but realize it, the world abounds in
them.They are its glory, its radiance--until they are taught to heed
the hiss of the serpent.Their pure knowledge of immanent good would
endure--ah, who may say how long?--did not we who measure our wisdom
by years forbid them with the fear-born mandate: "Thus far!"What
manner of being was he who said, "Suffer little children to come unto
me, and forbid them not?"Oh, ye parents, who forbid your little ones
to come to the Christ by hourly heaping up before them the limitations
of fear and doubt, of faith in the power and reality of sin and evil,
of false instruction, and withering material beliefs!Would not the
Christ pray for you to-day, "Father, forgive them, for they know not
what they do"?When Jose met Carmen she was holding steadfastly to her vision--the
immanence and allness of God.Each day she created the morrow; and she
knew to a certainty that it would be happy.Would he, clanking his
fetters of worldly beliefs, be the one to shatter her illusion, if
illusion it be?Nay, rather should he seek to learn of her, if; haply
she be in possession of that jewel for which he had searched a vain
lifetime.Already from the stimulus which his intercourse with the
child had given his mental processes there had come a sudden
liberation of thought.Into his freer mentality the Christ-idea now
flowed.Mankind complain that they cannot "prove" God.But Paul long since
declared emphatically that to prove Him the human mind must be
transformed.In the light of the great ideas which had dawned upon him
in the past few days--the nature of God as mind, unlimited, immanent,
eternal, and good; and the specious character of the five physical
senses, which from the beginning have deluded mankind into the false
belief that through them comes a true knowledge of the cosmos--Jose's
mentality was being formed anew.Hegel, delving for truth in a world of illusion, summed up a lifetime
of patient research in the pregnant statement, "The true knowledge of
God begins when we know that things as they are have no truth in
them."The testimony of the five physical senses constitutes "things
as they are."But--if Jose's reasoning be not illogical--the human
mind receives no testimony from these senses, which, at most, can
offer but insensate and meaningless vibrations in a pulpy mass called
the brain.The true knowledge of God, for which Jose had yearned and
striven, begins only when men turn from the mesmeric deception of the
physical senses, and learn that there is something, knowable and
usable, behind them, and of whose existence they give not the
slightest intimation.The church edifice was so far put in order that Jose
found no reason for not holding service on the morrow.He therefore
announced the fact, and told Carmen that he must devote the day to
preparation.Seeking the
solitude of his house, Jose returned to his Bible.Not, as in the codes
of men, God last, and after every material expedient has been
exhausted--but "to begin with."Jose could not deny that for all that
exists there is a cause.Nor can the human mind object to the
implication that the cause of an existing universe must itself
continue to exist.Even less can it deny that the framer of the
worlds, bound together in infinite space by the unbreakable cables of
infinite laws, must be omnipotent.And to retain its omnipotence, that
cause must be perfect--absolutely good--every whit pure, sound, and
harmonious; for evil is demonstrably self-destructive.And, lastly,
what power could operate thus but an infinite intelligence, an
all-inclusive mind?Now let the human mentality continue its own reasoning, if so be that
it hold fast to fact and employ logical processes.If "like
produces like"--and from thistles figs do not grow--that which mind
creates must be mental.And a good cause can produce only a good
effect.So the ancient writer, "And God saw every thing that He had
made, and, behold, it was very good."Yes, mused Jose, for inspiration is but the flow of truth into one's
mentality--stopped not until he had said, "So God created man in
His own image"--

Wait!--"in the image of God"--not in the image of matter, not in the
likeness of evil--"created He him."But what had now become of that
man?So Jesus, centuries later, "God is spirit," and, "That which is born
of the Spirit is spirit."Or, man--true man--expresses mind, God, and
is His eternal and spiritual likeness and reflection.But, to make
this still clearer to torpid minds, Paul wrote, "For in Him we live,
and move, and have our being."Then he added, "To be spiritually
minded is life."As if he would say, True life is the _consciousness_
of spiritual things only.Is human life aught but a series of states of consciousness?And is
consciousness aught but mental activity?--for when the mind's activity
ceases, the man dies."It is the activity of thought," said Jose aloud, "that makes us
believe that fleshly eyes see and ears hear.We see only our thoughts;
and in some way they become externalized as our environment."Thought builds images, or mental
concepts, within the mind.These are the thought-objects which mankind
believe they see as material things in an outer world.And so the
world is within, not without.Jesus must have known this when he said,
"The kingdom of heaven is within you."Did he not know the tremendous
effects of thought when he said, "For as a man thinketh, so is he"?In
other words, a man builds his own mental image of himself, and conveys
it to the fellow-minds about him.His eye fell upon the
warning of Jeremiah, "Hear, O earth, behold I will bring evil
upon this people, _even the fruit of their thoughts_!"he
needed no warning to show him now the dire results of his own past
wrong thinking.Evil is but wrong thinking wrought out in life
experience.And so the chief of sins is the breaking of the very
first Commandment, the belief in other powers than God, the
infinite mind that framed the spiritual universe."But we simply can't help breaking the Commandment," cried Jose, "when
we see nothing but evil about us!And yet--we are seeing only the
thoughts in our own minds.Jose was quite ready to concede a mental basis for everything; to
believe that even sin is but the thought of sin, false thought
regarding God and His Creation.But, if God is all-inclusive mind, He
must be _the only thinker_.No, for then were God maintaining a
house divided against itself.And that would mean His ultimate
dissolution.Infinite, omnipotent mind is by very logic _compelled_ to be perfect.Then the thoughts issuing from that mind must be good.So it must
follow that evil thoughts come from another source.But if God is
infinite, there is no other source, no other cause.Then there is but
the single alternative left--_evil thoughts must be unreal_.What was it that the explorer had said to him in regard to Spencer's
definition of reality?But, for that matter,
evil seems to be just as enduring as good, and to run its course as
undeviatingly.After all, what is it that says there is evil?But that again reduces to the thought of evil, for
men see only their thoughts.These so-called senses say that the world
is flat--that the sun circles the earth--that objects diminish in size
with distance.Jesus said that evil, or the
"devil," was "a liar and the father of lies."Then the testimony of
the physical senses to evil--and there is no other testimony to its
existence and power--is a lie.Reason has had
to correct sense-testimony in the field of astronomy and show that the
earth is not flat.Where, indeed, has reason not had to correct
sense-testimony?For Jose could now see that all such testimony was
essentially false."Things as they are have no truth in them."In
other words, sense-testimony is false belief.And the
habitat of a lie is--nowhere.Did the world by clinging to evil and
trying to make something of it, to classify it and reduce it to
definite rules and terms, thus tend to make it real?And
as long as the world held evil to be real, could evil be overcome?He believed he was close to the discovery
of that solid basis of truth on which to stand while teaching Carmen.At any rate, her faith, which he could no longer believe to be
baseless illusion, would not be shattered by him.CHAPTER 11


Two weeks after his arrival in Simiti Jose conducted his first
services in the ancient church.After four years of silence, the rusty
bell sent out its raucous call from the old tower that still morning
and announced the revival of public worship.As the priest stepped from the sacristy and approached the altar his
heart experienced a sudden sinking.Before him his little flock bowed
reverently and expectantly.Looking out at them, a lump rose in his
throat.He was their pastor, and daily his love had grown for these
kindly, simple folk.And now, what would he not have given could he
have stretched forth his hands, as did the Master, to heal them of
their ills and lift them out of the shadows of ignorance!Ah, if he
could have thrown aside the mummery and pagan ceremonialism which he
was there to conduct, and have sat down among them, as Jesus was wont
to do on those still mornings in Galilee!Instead, he stood before
them an apostate vassal of Rome, hypocritically using the Church to
shield and maintain himself in Simiti while he reared away from her
the child Carmen.He had heard the call; and he had answered,
"Master, here am I."And now he was occupying, while waiting to be
led, step by step, out of his cruelly anomalous position and into his
rightful domain.Nay, he thought he would
have been a traitor to all that was best and holiest within himself
had he done otherwise.In the name of the Church he would serve these
humble people.And honoring
Christ, he could not dishonor the Church.Jose's conduct of the Mass was perfunctory.Vainly he strove to hold
in thought the symbolism of the service, the offering of Christ as a
propitiation for the world's sins.But gradually the folly of Milton's
extravagant, wild dream, which the poet clothed in such imperishable
beauty, stole over him and blinded this vision.He saw the Holy
Trinity sitting in solemn council in the courts of heaven.He heard
their perplexed discussion of the ravages of Satan in the terrestrial
paradise below.He heard the Father pronounce His awful curse upon
mankind.And he beheld the Son rise and with celestial magnanimity
offer himself as the sacrificial lamb, whose blood should wash away
the serpent-stain of sin.He had seen her, as he looked out over
his people, sitting with Dona Maria, arrayed in a clean white frock,
and swinging her plump bare legs beneath the bench, while wonder and
amazement peered out from her big brown eyes as she followed his every
move.What would such things mean to her, whose God was ever-present
good?What did they mean to the priest himself, who was beginning to
see Him as infinite, divine mind, knowing no evil--the One whose
thoughts are not as ours?He took up the holy water and sprinkled the assemblage."Purge me with
hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than
snow."But how is the human mind purged of error?And does the infinite mind purge the thought of men in any other way?His mind was full as he took up the Missal."_Kyrie Eleison_, _Christe
Eleison_."With a tug he pulled his mind back to the work before
him.But why was he invoking clemency from One who knows no evil?Heretofore he had always thought that God knew evil, that He must
recognize it, and that He strove Himself to overcome it.But if God
knew evil, then evil were real and eternal!Dreamily he began to
intone the _Gloria in Excelsis Deo_.All hail, thou infinite mind,
whose measureless depths mortal man has not even begun to sound!His
soul could echo that strain forever.He turned to the Lesson and read: "But there went up a mist from the
earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.And the Lord God
formed man of the dust of the ground."The mist of error watered the false
thought--the one lie about God--and out of it formed the man of flesh,
the false concept which is held in the minds of mortals.Aye, it was
the lie, posing as the Lord of creation, which had formed its false
man out of the dust of the ground, and had forced it upon the
acceptance of mankind!Jose turned back and read the whole of the
first chapter of Genesis, where he felt that he stood upon truth.The tapers on the altar flickered fitfully.The disturbed bats
blundered among the rafters overhead.Outside, the dusty roads burned
with a white glare.Within, he and the people were worshiping God."God is a spirit, and they that worship Him must
worship Him in spirit and in truth."Jose recited the Nicene creed, with the thought that its man-made
fetters had bound the Christian world for dreary centuries.Then, the
Preface and Canon concluded, he pronounced the solemn words of
consecration which turned the bread and wine before him into the flesh
and blood of Christ Jesus.He looked at the wafer and the chalice long
and earnestly.He--Jose de Rincon--mortal, human, a weakling among
weaklings--could he command God by his "_Hoc est enim corpus meum_" to
descend from heaven to this altar?Could he so invoke the power of the
Christ as to change bread and wine into actual flesh and blood?And
yet, with all the priestly powers which Holy Church had conferred upon
him, he could not heal a single bodily ill, nor avert one human
misfortune!Well have you avenged yourself upon those who wrought
your fall, for in the death conflict you left the taint of your
paganism upon them, and it endures in their sons even to this fair
day!Jose deferred his sermon until the close of the service.He wanted
time to think over again what he could say to these simple people.They sat before him, dull, inert, yet impressionable--bare of feet, or
wearing hempen sandals, and clad in cheap cottons and calicos, with
here and there a flash of bright ribbon among the women, and
occasionally a parasol of brilliant hue, which the owner fondly
clasped, while impatiently awaiting the close of the service that she
might proudly parade it.A few of the men wore starched linen shirts,
but without collars.The Alcalde, with his numerous family, and the
family of Don Felipe Alcozer, sat well in front.The former regarded
Jose expectantly, as the priest turned to deliver his simple sermon."My children," Jose began, "when the good man whom we call the Saviour
sent his disciples out into the world he told them to preach the
gospel and heal the sick.We have no record that he asked them to do
more, for that included his whole mission.And, as I believe myself to have been led to you, so I shall preach
what I believe to be given me by the great Father of us all.I shall
teach you the Christ as I comprehend him.I would I could heal the
sick as well.But the gift of healing which Jesus bestowed has been
lost to mankind."Then he
continued:

"I am your servant, and your friend.I want you to believe that
whatever I do in your midst and whatever I say to you follows only
after I have prayerfully considered your welfare.As time has passed I
have seemed to see things in a clearer light than before.What I may
see in the future I shall point out to you as you are able to
understand me.To that end we must suffer many things to be as they
are for the present, for I am learning with you.I shall give you a
single thought to take with you to-day.Jesus once said, 'As a man
thinketh, so is he.'I want you to remember that, if you would be well
and happy and prosperous, you must think only about good things.Some
day you will see why this is so.But go back now to your _fincas_ and
your fishing, to your little stores and your humble homes, firmly
resolving never to think a bad thought, whether about yourself or your
neighbor.And pray for yourselves and me--"

He looked off into the gloom overhead.Again he seemed to hear the Man
of Galilee: "Ask and ye shall receive.""And, my children--"

He thought suddenly of Carmen and her visits to the shales.His face
shone for a moment with a new light.

"--let your prayers be no mere requests that God will bless us, but
rather let them be statements that He is infinite good, and that He
cannot do otherwise than give us all we need.No, I ask not that you
intercede for me; nor shall I do so for you.But I do ask that you
join with me in trying to realize that God is good; that He loves us
as His dear children; and that He is daily, hourly pouring out His
inexhaustible goodness upon us.We shall all see that goodness when we
learn to think no evil."His eyes rested upon Carmen as he spoke these last words.Then with a
simple invocation he dismissed the congregation.The Alcalde carried Jose off to dinner with him, much against the
inclination of the priest, who preferred to be alone.But the Alcalde
was the chief influence in the town, and it was policy to cultivate
him."The blessed Virgin shows that she has not forgotten Simiti, Padre, by
sending you here," said Don Mario, when they were seated in the shade
of the ample _patio_."Yes, friend," with just a
trace of amusement in his voice."It was doubtless because of the
Virgin that I was directed here," he replied, thinking of Carmen."Excellent advice that you gave the people, Padre; but it is not
likely they understood you, poor fools!Now if Padre Diego had been
preaching he would have ranted like a windstorm; but he would have
made an impression.I am afraid soft words will not sink into their
thick skulls."Dinner was served in the open, during which the Alcalde chattered
volubly.Jose knew that for
some time he had been edging toward the question."_Quien sabe, senor!_" replied the priest, with a careless shrug of
his shoulders.he is old to prospect for gold--and alone, too!""You are all alike when it
comes to money.Padre Diego was up to the same schemes; and before he
left he had a hat full of titles to mines.""But I am not seeking to acquire mineral property!"exclaimed Jose
with some aspersion.Then you had nothing to do with Rosendo's trip?""_Na_, Padre, let us be confidential," said the Alcalde, hitching his
chair closer to the priest."Look, I understand why Rosendo went into
the Guamoco country--but you can trust me to say nothing about it.Only, Padre, if he should find the mine he will have trouble enough
to hold it.You know the denouncement
papers must go through my hands, and I send them to Cartagena for
registration."He sat back in his chair with a knowing look."There is only one man here to be afraid of," he resumed; "and that is
Don Felipe Alcozer; although he may never return to Simiti."Then:

"Now, Padre, let us have some understanding about interests in the
mine, should Rosendo find it.The mine will be useless to us unless we
work it, for there is no one to buy it from us.To work it, we must
have a stamp-mill, or _arrastras_.The Antioquanians are skilled in
the making of wooden stamp-mills; but one would cost perhaps two
thousand _pesos oro_.Nobody here can furnish so much money but Don
Felipe.I will arrange with him for a suitable interest.And I will
fix all the papers so that the title will be held by us three.Rosendo
is only a _peon_.You can pay him for his trouble, and he need not
have an interest."Jose breathed easier while this recital was in progress.So Don Mario
believed Rosendo to have gone in search of the lost mine, La Libertad!Good; for Cartagena would soon get the report, and his own tenure of
the parish would be rendered doubly sure thereby.The monthly greasing
of Wenceslas' palm with what Rosendo might extract from the Guamoco
sands, coupled with the belief that Jose was maintaining a man in the
field in search of Don Ignacio's lost mine, rendered Cartagena's
interference a very remote contingency.He almost laughed as he
replied:

"Rosendo will doubtless prospect for some months, Don Mario, and I am
sure we shall have plenty of time to discuss any arrangement of
interests later, should occasion arise.When the afternoon heat began to wane, Jose left the Alcalde and
returned to his cottage.Since the service of the morning he had been
fighting a constantly deepening sense of depression.An awful
loneliness now gripped his heart, and dank gloom was again sweeping
through the corridors of his soul.God, what a sacrifice, to remain
buried in that dismal town!His continuance in the priesthood of an
abjured faith was violative of every principle of honesty!The time
would come when the mask of hypocrisy would have to be raised, and the
resultant exposure would be worse then than open apostasy now!He entered his dreary little abode and threw himself upon a chair.There had been no reaction like this for days.He looked out into the
deserted street.Mud hovels; ragged, thatched roofs; lowly _peones_
drowsing away life's little hour within!There was scarcely a book in
the town.Few of its inhabitants could even read or write.Culture,
education, refinement--all wanting.Nothing but primal existence--the
barest necessities of real life.He had been a
fool all his years!He would throw everything to the winds and go out
into the world to live his life as it had been intended he should live
it.He would send his resignation to the Bishop to-morrow.Then he
would hire Juan to take him to Bodega Central; and the few _pesos_ he
had left would get him to Barranquilla.There he would work until he
had earned enough for his passage to the great States up north, of
which the explorer had told such wonderful tales.Once there, he could
teach, or--

His thought turned to Rosendo.He saw him, bent with age, and wearied
with toil, alone in the awful solitude of the jungle, standing knee
deep in the cold mountain water, while from early dawn till sunset he
incessantly swung the heavy _batea_ to concentrate the few flakes of
precious gold it might contain.And the old man was facing years of
just such loneliness and heavy toil--facing them gladly.Was she worth such sacrifice as he and Rosendo
were making?If he
betrayed Rosendo's confidence and fled like a coward now, leaving her
to fall into the sooty hands of men like Padre Diego, to be crushed,
warped, and squeezed into the molds of Holy Church, could he ever
again face his fellow-men?he cried in a
voice that echoed through the barren rooms.He smote his chest and
paced the floor.It was the same simple melody she had sung the day he awoke from his
fever.Then--

  "Love took up the harp of life, and smote on all the chords with
        might,
  Smote the chord of self, that, trembling, passed in music out of
        sight."CHAPTER 12


In the days that followed, while at times Jose still struggled
desperately against the depression of his primal environment, and
against its insidious suggestions of license, Carmen moved before him
like the shechinah of Israel, symbolizing the divine presence.When
the dark hours came and his pronounced egoism bade fair to overwhelm
him; when his self-centered thought clung with the tenacity of a
limpet to his dreary surroundings and his unfilled longings; when
self-condemnation and self-pity rived his soul, and despair of solving
life's intricate problems settled again like a pall upon him, he
turned to her.Under the soft influence of her instinct for primitive
good, he was learning, even if slowly, to jettison his heavily laden
soul, and day by day to ride the tossing waves of his stormy thought
with a lighter cargo.Her simple faith in immanent good was working
upon his mind like a spiritual catharsis, to purge it of its clogging
beliefs.Her unselfed love flowed over him like heavenly balm, salving
the bleeding wounds of the spiritual mayhem which he had suffered at
the violent hands of Holy Church's worldly agents.Carmen's days were filled to the brim with a measure of joy that
constantly overflowed upon all among whom she moved.Her slight
dependence upon her impoverished material environment, her contempt
of its _ennui_, were constant reminders to Jose that heaven is but
a state of mind.Even in desolate Simiti, life to her was an
endless series of delightful experiences, of wonderful surprises
in the discovery of God's presence everywhere.Her enthusiasms were
always ardent and inexhaustible.Sparkling animation and abounding
vitality characterized her every movement.Her thought was free,
unstrained, natural, and untrammeled by those inherited and educated
beliefs in evil in which Jose had early been so completely swamped.In worldly knowledge she was the purest novice; and the engaging
_naivete_ with which she met the priest's explanations of historical
events and the motives from which they sprang charmed him beyond
measure, and made his work with her a constant delight.Her sense of
humor was keen, and her merriment when his recitals touched her
risibility was extravagant.She laughed at danger, laughed at the
weaknesses and foibles of men, when he told of the political and
social ambitions which stirred mankind in the outside world.But he
knew that her merriment proceeded not from an ephemeral sense of
the ludicrous, but from a righteous appraisal of the folly and
littleness of those things for which the world so sorely strives.And daily the little maid wrapped herself about his heart.Daily her
wondrous love coiled its soft folds tighter around him, squeezing from
his atrabilious soul, drop by drop, its sad taciturnity and inherent
morbidness, that it might later fill his empty life with a spiritual
richness which he had never known before.On the day following the opening of the church Carmen had asked
many questions.It was the first religious service she had ever
voluntarily attended.To her former queries regarding the function
of the church edifice, Rosendo had vouchsafed but one reply: it was
the house of God, and in it the people used to gather to learn of Him.But she protested that she had no need of the musty, ramshackle,
barn-like old building as a locus in which to center her thought upon
God.She walked with Him, and she much preferred the bright, sunlit
out-of-doors in which to commune with Him.Jose explained the need
of a central gathering place as a shelter from the hot sun.But the
images--the pictures of Saints and Virgin--and the Mass itself?"They are what the people are accustomed to, dear child, to direct
their thought toward God," he explained."And we will use them until
we can teach them something better."He had omitted from the church
service as far as possible the collects and all invocations addressed
to the Virgin and the Saints, and had rendered it short and extremely
simple.Carmen seemed satisfied with his explanation, and with his
insistence that, for the sake of appearance, she attend the Sunday
services.He would trust her God to guide them both.Jose and the child dwelt
together apart from the world, in a universe purely mental.As he
taught her, she hung upon his every word, and seized the proffered
tutelage with avidity.Often, after the day's work, Jose, in his
customary strolls about the little town, would come across the girl in
the doorway of a neighboring house, with a group of wide-eyed
youngsters about her, relating again the wonder-tales which she had
gathered from him.Marvelous tales they were, too, of knight and
_hidalgo_, of court and camp, of fairies, pyxies, gnomes and sprites,
of mossy legend and historic fact, bubbling from the girl's childish
lips with an engaging _naivete_ of interpretation that held the man
enchanted.Even the schoolmaster, who had besought Jose in vain to
turn Carmen over to him, was often a spellbound listener at these
little gatherings.The result was that in a short time a delegation, headed by the
Alcalde himself, waited upon Jose and begged him to lecture to the
people of Simiti in the church building at least two or three evenings
a week upon places and people he had seen in the great world of which
they knew nothing.Jose's eyes were moist as he looked at the great,
brawny men, stout of heart, but simple as children.He grieved to give
up his evenings, for he had formed the habit of late of devoting them
to the study of his Bible, and to meditation on those ideas which had
so recently come to him.But the appeal from these innocent, untutored
people again quenched the thought of self, and he bade them be assured
that their request was granted.The new ideas which had found entrance into Jose's liberated mentality
in the past few days had formed a basis on which he was not afraid to
stand while teaching Carmen; and his entire instruction was
thenceforth  by them.He knew not why, in all the preceding
years, such ideas had not come to him before.But he was to learn,
some day, that his previous tenacious clinging to evil as a reality,
together with his material beliefs and his worldly intellectuality,
had stood as barriers at the portals of his thought, and kept the
truth from entering.His mind had been already full--but its contents
were unbelief, fear, the conviction of evil as real and operative, and
the failure to know God as immanent, omnipotent and perfect mind, to
whom evil is forever unknown and unreal.Pride, egoism, and his morbid
sense of honesty had added their portion to the already impassable
obstruction at the gateway of his thought.And so the error had been
kept within, the good without.The "power of the Lord" had not been
absent; but it had remained unapplied.Thus he had wandered through
the desolate wilderness; but yet sustained and kept alive, that he
should not go down to the pit.Jose's days were now so crowded that he was forced to borrow heavily
from the night.The Alcalde continued his unctuous flattery, and the
priest, in turn, cultivated him assiduously.To that official's query
as to the restitution of the confessional in the church, the priest
replied that he could spare time to hear only such confessions from
his flock as might be necessary to elicit from him the advice or
assistance requisite for their needs.He was there to help them solve
their life problems, not to pry into their sacred secrets; and their
confessions must relate only to their necessities.The Alcalde went away with a puzzled look.Of a truth a new sort of
priest had now to be reckoned with in Simiti--a very different sort
from Padre Diego.In the first days of Jose's incumbency he found many serious matters
to adjust.He had learned from Rosendo that not half the residents of
Simiti were married to the consorts with whom they lived, and that
many of the children who played in the streets did not know who their
fathers were.So prevalent was this evil condition that the custom
among the men of having their initials embroidered upon the bosoms of
their shirts was extended to include the initial of the mother's
family name.Jose had questioned Rosendo as to the meaning of the
letters R. A. S. upon his shirt."The S, Padre, is the initial of my mother's family name.I am Rosendo
Ariza, son of the daughter of Saurez.My parents were married by a
priest.But half the people of Simiti have never been really
married."Fidel Avila was living with
a woman, by whom he had three children.The priest summoned him to the
parish house."Fidel," he questioned sternly, "Jacinta, the woman you live with, is
your wife?""Yes, _Senor Padre_.""But was there a priest here when you began to live with Jacinta?"The _Cura_, Don Diego Polo, was here.""Then why were you not married by him?Do you not know how wicked it
is to live as you are doing?"Yes, Padre, and I asked the _Cura_, Don Diego, to marry us.But he
charged twenty _pesos oro_ for doing it; and I could not afford it.And so we decided to live together without the
marriage."He knew that the Church recognized no marriage
unless it were performed by a priest.The civil magistrate had no
jurisdiction in such a case.And a former priest's rapacity had
resulted in forcing illegitimacy upon half the children of this
benighted hamlet, because of their parents' inability to afford the
luxury of a canonical marriage."Fidel, were your father and mother married?"Only a few people in Guamoco can afford to pay
to be married.The men and women live together, perhaps for all time,
perhaps for only a few months.If a man wishes to leave his woman and
live with another, he does so.If there are children, the woman always
has to keep and care for them.""And could you leave Jacinta if you wished, and live with another
woman?""And she would have to lake care of your children?""_Hombre!_ But that will do, Fidel."Oh, the sordid greed of those who abuse their sacred commission!What
punishment is mete for such as exploit these lowly folk in the name of
religion!Jose strode off to consult the Alcalde."Don Mario, the men in Simiti who are living with women have _got_ to
be married to them!I shall make a canvass of the town
at once!""_Costumbre_, Padre._Costumbre del pais!_ It is a final answer all through South America.No matter how unreasonable a thing may be, if it is the custom of the
country it is a Medean law."But you know this is subversive of Church discipline!""Look you, Don Mario," he added suggestively, "you and I are
to work together, are we not?"The Alcalde blinked his pig eyes, but thought hard about La Libertad._"Cierto, Senor Padre!"Then I demand that you summon before me every man and woman who are
living together unmarried."With a thought single to his own future advantage, the wary Alcalde
complied.Within the week following this interview Jose married twenty
couples, and without charge.These he
took and immediately turned over to Don Mario as treasurer of the
parish.Those couples who refused to be married were forced by the
Alcalde to separate.Packing his few household effects upon his back, and
muttering imprecations against the priest, Gomez set out for the
hills, still followed by his woman, with a babe slung over her
shoulders and two naked children toddling at her bare heels.Verily, the ancient town was being profoundly stirred by the man who
had sought to find his tomb there.Gradually the people lost their
suspicions and distrust, bred of former bitter experience with
priests, and joined heartily with Jose to ameliorate the social status
of the place.His sincere love for them, and his utter selflessness,
secured their confidence, and ere his first month among them closed,
he had won them, almost to a man.Meantime, six weeks had passed since Rosendo had departed to take up
his lonely task of self-renouncing love.Then one day he returned,
worn and emaciated, his great frame shaking like a withered leaf in a
chill blast."It is the _terciana_, Padre," he said, as he sank shuddering upon
his bed.I went as far as Tachi--fifty
leagues from Simiti--and there the fever overtook me.I have been
eight days coming back; and day before yesterday I ran out of
food.Last evening I found a wild melon at the side of the trail.A
coral snake struck at me when I reached for it, but he hit my
_machete_ instead._Caramba!_"

Jose pressed his wet hand, while Dona Maria laid damp cloths upon his
burning forehead."The streams are washed out, Padre," Rosendo continued sadly."I
worked at Colorado, Popales, and Tambora.But I got no more than five
_pesos_ worth.And that will not pay for half of my supplies.It is
there in a little bag," pointing to his soaked and muddy kit.Jose's heart was wrung by the suffering and disappointment of the old
man.Sadly he carried the little handful of gold flakes to Don Mario,
and then returned to the exhausted Rosendo.All through the night the sick man tossed and moaned.Then Jose and Dona Maria became genuinely alarmed.The
toil and exposure had been too much for Rosendo at his advanced age.In his delirium he talked brokenly of the swamps through which he had
floundered, for he had taken the trail in the wet season, and fully
half of its one hundred and fifty miles of length was oozy and all but
impassable bog.Don Mario shook his head
as he stood over him."I have seen many in that condition, Padre, and they didn't wake up!If we had quinine, perhaps he might be saved.But there isn't a flake
in the town.""Then send Juan to Bodega Central at once for it!""I doubt if he would find it there either, Padre.However, Juan cannot make the trip in less than two days.And I fear
Rosendo will not last that long."Dona Maria sat by the bedside, dumb with grief.The Alcalde had dispatched
Juan down to the river to signal any steamer that he should meet, if
perchance he might purchase a few grains of the only drug that could
save the sick man.Carmen had absented herself during the day; but
she returned in time to assist Dona Maria with the evening meal,
after which she went at once to her bed.Late at night, when the sympathizing townsmen had sorrowfully departed
and Jose had induced Dona Maria to seek a few moments rest on her
_petate_ in the living room, Carmen climbed quietly out of her bed and
came to where the priest sat alone with the unconscious Rosendo.Jose was bending over the delirious man."Oh, if Jesus were only here
now!"Jose looked down into the little face beside him.The little head
shook as if to emphasize the words.But he put his arm about the child and drew her to
him."_Chiquita_, why do you say that?""Because God doesn't die, you know," she quickly replied."And we are
like Him, Padre, aren't we?""But He calls us to Him, _chiquita_.And--I guess--He is--is calling
your padre Rosendo now."Does God kill mankind in order to give them life?And--

"Why, no, Padre," returned the innocent child."He is always here; and
we are always with Him, you know.He can not call people away from
where He is, can He?"_Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world._ The
Christ-principle, the saving truth about God and man, is ever present
in an uncomprehending world.Jose knew that there was no material dependence now.Something told
him that Rosendo lay dying.There was no physician, no drug, in the
isolated little town.And He--

But only sinners are taught by priests and preachers to look to God
for help.How much more deplorable, then,
is their condition than that of the wicked!"I told God out on the shales this afternoon that I just knew padre
Rosendo wouldn't die!"The soft, sweet voice hovered on the silence
like celestial melody._If ye ask anything in my name_--in my character--_it shall be given
you_.Carmen asked in the character of the sinless Christ, for her
asking was an assertion of what she instinctively knew to be truth,
despite the evidence of the physical senses.Her petitions were
affirmations of Immanuel--God with us."Carmen," whispered the priest hoarsely, "go back to your bed, and
know, just _know_ that God is here!Know that He did not make padre
Rosendo sick, and that He will not let him die!Know it for him--and
for me!""Why, Padre, I know that now!"The child looked up into the priest's
face with her luminous eyes radiating unshaken trust--a trust that
seemed born of understanding.Yea, she knew that all good was there,
for God is omnipotent.They had but to stretch forth their hands to
touch the robe of His Christ.The healing principle which cleansed the
lepers and raised the dead was even with them there in that quiet
room.Jose had only to realize it, nothing doubting.Carmen had done
her work, and her mind now was stayed on Him.Infinite Intelligence
did not know Rosendo as Jose was trying to know him, sick and dying.God is Life--and there is no death!Jose sat alone, his open Bible before him and
his thought with his God.Oh, for even a slight conception of Him who is Life!Moses worked "as
seeing Him who is invisible."Carmen lived with her eyes on Him,
despite her dreary mundane encompassment.And Jose, as he sat there
throughout the watches of the night, facing the black terror, was
striving to pierce the mist which had gone up from the face of the
ground and was separating him from his God.Through the long, dark
hours, with the quiet of death upon the desolate chamber, he sat mute
before the veil that was "still untaken away."What was it that kept telling him that Rosendo lay dying before him?Do fleshly nerves and
frail bodily organs converse with men?Can the externalization of
thought report back to the thought itself?Nay, the report came to him
from the physical senses--naught else.He
was seeing but his own thoughts of mixed good and evil.And they were
false, because they testified against God.But not as the physical senses were trying to
make Jose know him, sick and dying.Surely the subjective determines
the objective; for as we think, so are we--the Christ said that.From
his human standpoint Jose was seeing his thoughts of a dying mortal.And now he was trying to know that those thoughts did not come from
God--that they had no authority back of them--that they were children
of the "one lie" about God--that they were false, false as hell, and
therefore impotent and unreal.Nothing, for truth is beyond the reach of
personal sense.So God and His ideas, reflected by the real Rosendo,
were beyond the reach of evil.If this were true, then he must clear his own mentality--even as he
now knew Carmen had done out on the shales that afternoon.He was no
longer dealing with a material Rosendo, but with false beliefs about a
son of God.And to the serpent,
error, he was trying to say: "What is your authority?"If man is, then he always has been.And
he was never born--and never passes into oblivion.If two and two make four to-day, they always have done so,
and always will.Rosendo, when
moved by good, had gone into the wilds of Guamoco on a mission of
love.Did evil have power to smite him for his noble sacrifice?No, but a sense of
existence--and a false sense, for it postulates a god of evil opposed
to the one supreme Creator of all that really is.Then the testimony
that said Rosendo must die was cruelly false.And, more, it was
powerless--unless Jose himself gave it power.But she knew
God as Jose had never known Him.And, despite the testimony of the
fleshly eyes, she had turned from physical sense to Him.Jose had begun to see that discord was the result of unrighteousness,
false thought.He began to understand why it was that Jesus always
linked disease with sin.His own paradoxical career had furnished
ample proof of that.Yet his numberless tribulations were not due
solely to his own wrong thinking, but likewise to the wrong thought of
others with respect to him, thought which he knew not how to
neutralize.And the channels for this false, malicious, carnal thought
had been his beloved parents, his uncle, the Archbishop, his tutors,
and, in fact, all with whom he had been associated until he came to
Simiti.And there the false thought had met
a check, a reversal.And he was
slowly awaking to find nothing but good.The night hours flitted through the heavy gloom like spectral
acolytes.The steady roll of the frogs
in the lake at length died away.A flush stole timidly across the
eastern sky."Padre dear, he will not die."It was Carmen's voice that awoke the slumbering priest.The child
stood at his side, and her little hand clasped his.His chest rose and fell with the rhythmic breathing.A great lump came into his throat, and his voice trembled as
he spoke."You are right, _chiquita_.Go, call your madre Maria now, and I will
go home to rest."CHAPTER 13


That day Rosendo left his bed.Two days later he again set out for
Guamoco."There _is_ gold there, and I must, I _will_ find it!"he repeatedly
exclaimed as he pushed his preparations.On its rebound it carried him
over the protest of Dona Maria and the gloomy forebodings of his
fellow-townsmen, and launched him again on the desolate trail.He moved about wrapped in undefinable
awe.For he believed he had seen Rosendo lifted from the bed of death.And no one might tell him that it was not by the same power that long
ago had raised the dead man of Nain.Carmen had not spoken of the
incident again; and something laid a restraint upon Jose's lips.The eyes of the Alcalde bulged with astonishment when Rosendo entered
his store that morning in quest of further supplies."_Caramba!_ Go back to your bed, _compadre_!"he exclaimed, bounding
from his chair."You are walking in your delirium!""_Na, amigo_," replied Rosendo with a smile, "the fever has left me.And now I must have another month's supplies, for I go back to Guamoco
as soon as my legs tremble less.""_

The Alcalde acted as if he were in the presence of a ghost.But at
length becoming convinced that Rosendo was there on matters of
business, and in his right mind, he checked further expression of
wonder and, with a shrug of his fat shoulders, assumed his wonted air
of a man of large affairs."I can allow you five _pesos oro_ on account of the gold which the
_Cura_ brought me yesterday," he said severely."But that leaves you
still owing ten _pesos_ for your first supplies; and thirty if I give
you what you ask for now.If you cannot pay this amount when you
return, you will have to work it out for me."Rosendo well knew what the
threat implied."_Bien, compadre_," he quietly replied, "it will be as you say."Late that afternoon Juan returned from Bodega Central with a half
ounce of quinine.He had made the trip with astonishing celerity, and
had arrived at the riverine town just as a large steamer was docking.The purser supplied him with the drug, and he immediately started on
his return.The Alcalde set out to deliver the drug to Rosendo; but not finding
him at home, looked in at the parish house.Jose and Carmen were deep
in their studies."A thousand pardons, _Senor Padre_, but I have the medicine you
ordered for Rosendo," placing the small package upon the table."You may set it down against me, Don Mario," said Jose.exclaimed the Alcalde, "this must not be charged to the
parish!""I said to me, _amigo_," replied the priest firmly."It is the same thing, Padre!"The priest's anger began to rise, but he restrained it."Padre Diego
is no longer here, you must remember," he said quietly."But the parish pays your debts; and it would not pay the full value
of this and Juan's trip," was the coarse retort."Very well, then, Don Mario," answered Jose."You may charge it to
Rosendo.But tell me first how much you will place against him for
it.""The quinine will be five _pesos oro_,
and Juan's trip three additional.he demanded,
blustering before Jose's steady gaze."If Rosendo had been really sick
it would have saved his life!""Then you do not believe he was dangerously ill?""He couldn't have been really sick and be around to-day--could he?""No," he said slowly, "not _really_ sick."Then he quickly added:

"If you charge Rosendo eight _pesos_ for that bit of quinine, Don
Mario, you and I are no longer working together, for I do not take
base advantage of any man's necessities.""_Na, Senor
Padre_," he said hastily, with a sheepish grin."I will leave the
quinine with you, and do you settle the account with Juan."With which
he beat a disordered retreat.Jose was thankful that, for a few months, at least, he would have a
powerful hold on this man through his rapacity.What would happen
when the Alcalde at length learned that Rosendo was not searching for
Don Ignacio's lost mine, he did not care to conjecture.That matter
was in other hands than his, and he was glad to leave it there.He
asked now only to see each single step as he progressed."Did Don Mario say that stuff would cure padre Rosendo?"asked Carmen,
pointing to the quinine."Why did he say so, Padre?""Because he really believed it, _carita_.""But what is it, Padre--and how can it cure sick people?""It is the bark of a certain tree, little one, that people take as
medicine.It is a sort of poison which people take to counteract
another poison.A great school of medicine is founded upon that
principle, Carmen," he added.And then he fell to wondering if it
really was a principle, after all.But would the world believe that both he and Rosendo had been cured
by--what?By the operation of a great, almost
unknown principle?He saw himself and Rosendo restored, and
that was enough."They think the quinine cures
fever, little one," he resumed.The little face wore an anxious look as she put the
question."They think it does, _chiquita_," replied the priest, wondering what
he should say."But it is just because they think so that they get well, isn't it?""And if they thought right they would be cured without this--is it not
so, Padre dear?""I am sure of it--now," replied the priest."In fact, if they always
kept their thoughts right I am sure they would never be sick.""You mean, if they always thought about God," the child amended.If they knew, _really knew_, that God is
everywhere, that He is good, and that He never makes people sick, they
would always be well."It is only their bad thoughts that make them sick.And even then they are not really sick," the child concluded."They
think they are, and they think they die--and then they wake up and
find it isn't so at all."Had the child made this remark to him a few weeks before, he had
crushed it with the dull, lifeless, conventional formulae of human
belief.To-day in penitent humility he was trying to walk hand in hand
with her the path she trod.For he was learning from her that
righteousness is salvation.A few weeks ago he had lain at death's
door, yearning to pass the portal.Yesterday he believed he had again
seen the dark angel, hovering over the stricken Rosendo.But in each
case _something_ had intervened.Perhaps that "something not ourselves
that makes for righteousness," the unknown, almost unacknowledged
force that ceases not to combat evil in the human consciousness.Clinging to his petty egoisms; hugging close his shabby convictions of
an evil power opposed to God; stuffed with worldly learning and pride
of race and intellect, in due season, as he sank under the burden of
his imaginings, the veil had been drawn aside for a fleeting
moment--and his soul had frozen with awe at what it beheld!For, back of the density of the human concept, the fleeting,
inexplicable medley of good and evil which constitutes the phenomenon
of mortal existence, _he had seen God_!He had seen Him as all-inclusive
mind, omnipotent, immanent, perfect, eternal.He had caught a moment's
glimpse of the tremendous Presence which holds all wisdom, all
knowledge, yet knows no evil.He had seen a blinding flash of that
"something" toward which his life had strained and yearned.With it had
come a dim perception of the falsity of the testimony of physical
sense, and the human life that is reared upon it.And though he
counted not himself to have apprehended as yet, he was struggling,
even with thanksgiving, up out of his bondage, toward the gleam.The
shafts of error hissed about him, and black doubt and chill despair
still felled him with their awful blows.With
his hand in hers, he knew he was journeying toward God.On the afternoon before his departure Rosendo entered the parish house
in apprehension."I have lost my _escapulario_, Padre!""The string caught in the brush, and the whole thing was torn from my
neck.I--I don't like to go back without one," he added dubiously."Ah, then you have nothing left but Christ," replied Jose with fine
irony."But, Padre, it had been blessed by the Bishop!"Why, the Holy Father himself once blessed this
republic of ours, and now it is about the most unfortunate country in
the whole world!But you are a good Catholic, Rosendo, so you need not
fear."Rosendo was, indeed, a good Catholic.He accepted the faith of his
fathers without reserve.Simple,
superstitious, and great of heart, he held with rigid credulity to
all that had been taught him in the name of religion.But until Jose's
advent he had feared and hated priests.Nevertheless, his faith in
signs and miracles and the healing power of blessed images was
child-like.Once when he saw in the store of Don Mario a 
chromo of Venus and Cupid, a cheap print that had come with goods
imported from abroad, he had devoutly crossed himself, believing it to
be the Virgin Mary with the Christ-child."But I will fix you up, Rosendo," said Jose, noting the man's genuine
anxiety."Have Dona Maria cut out a cloth heart and fasten it to a
stout cord.I will take it to the church altar and bless it before the
image of the Virgin.You told me once that the Virgin was the Rincon
family's patron, you know.""_Bueno!_" ejaculated the pleased Rosendo, as he hastened off to
execute the commission.Several times before Rosendo went back to Guamoco Jose had sought to
draw him into conversation about his illness, and to get his view of
the probable cause of his rapid recovery.But the old man seemed loath
to dwell on the topic, and Jose could get little from him.At any
mention of the episode a troubled look would come over his face, and
he would fall silent, or would find an excuse to leave the presence of
the priest."Rosendo," Jose abruptly remarked to him as he was busy with his pack
late the night before his departure, "will you take with you the
quinine that Juan brought?""But what has she to do with it, _amigo_?""I--_Bien_, Padre, I promised her I would
not."Then:

"But if you fell sick up in Guamoco, Rosendo, what could you do?""_Quien sabe_, Padre!Perhaps I could gather herbs and make a tea--I
don't know.Then, in an anxious tone:

"Padre, what can I do?The little Carmen asks me not to take the
quinine, and I can not refuse her.I--I have
always taken medicine when I needed it and could get it.But the only
medicine we have in Simiti is the stuff that some of the women
make--teas and drinks brewed from roots and bark.I have never seen a
doctor here, nor any real medicines but quinine.And even that is hard
to get, as you know.I used to make a salve out of the livers of
_mapina_ snakes--it was for the rheumatism--I suffered terribly when I
worked in the cold waters in Guamoco.But
if I should get the disease now, would Carmen let me make the salve
again?""She says if I trust God I
will not get sick," he at length resumed."She says I must not think
about it._Caramba!_ What has that to do with it?People get sick
whether they think about it or not.Do you believe, Padre, this new
_escapulario_ will protect me?"The man's words reflected the strange mixture of mature and childish
thought typical of these untutored jungle folk, in which longing for
the good is so heavily overshadowed by an educated belief in the power
of evil."Rosendo," said Jose, finding at last his opportunity, "tell me, do
you think you were seriously ill day before yesterday?""_Quien sabe_, Padre!Perhaps it was only the _terciana_, after all.""Well, then," pursuing another tack, "do you think I was very sick
that day when I rushed to the lake--?"But you were turning cold--you hardly breathed--we
all thought you must die--all but Carmen!"the priest asked in a low, steady
voice."Why--Padre, I can not say.""Nor can I, positively, my friend.But I do know that the little
Carmen said I should not die.And she said the same of you when, as I
would swear, you were in the fell clutches of the death angel
himself.""Padre--" Rosendo's eyes were large, and his voice trembled in awesome
whisper--"is she--the little Carmen--is she--an _hada_?"cried Jose, bursting into a laugh at the
perturbed features of the older man."No, _amigo_, she is not an
_hada_!Let us say, rather, as you first expressed it to me, she is an
angel--and let us appreciate her as such."But," he continued, "I tell you in all seriousness, there are things
that such as you and I, with our limited outlook, have never dreamed
of; and that child seems to have penetrated the veil that hides
spiritual things from the material vision of men like us.Let us wait,
and if we value that '_something_' which she seems to possess and know
how to use, let us cut off our right hands before we yield to the
temptation to place any obstacle in the way of her development along
the lines which she has chosen, or which some unseen Power has chosen
for her.It is for you and me, Rosendo, to stand aside and watch,
while we protect her, if haply we may be privileged some day to learn
her secret in full.You and I are the unlearned, while she is filled
with wisdom.The world would say otherwise, and would condemn us as
fools.Thank God we are out of the world here in Simiti!"He choked back the inrush of memories and brushed away a tear."Rosendo," he concluded, "be advised.If Carmen told you not to think
of sickness while in Guamoco, then follow her instructions.It is not
the child, but a mighty Power that is speaking through her.Of that I
have long been thoroughly convinced.And I am as thoroughly convinced
that that same Power has appointed you and me her protectors and her
followers.You and I have a mighty compact--"

"_Hombre!_" interrupted Rosendo, clasping the priest's hand, "my life
is hers--you know it--she has only to speak, and I obey!"Assuredly, Rosendo," returned Jose.Let us
keep solely to ourselves what we have learned of her.I know not
whither we are being led.But we are in the hands of that'something'
that speaks and works through her--and we are satisfied.The next morning Rosendo set his face once
more toward the emerald hills of Guamoco.As the days passed, Jose became more silent and thoughtful.But it was
a silence bred of wonder and reverence, as he dwelt upon the things
that had been revealed to him.Who and what was this unusual child, so
human, and yet so strangely removed from the world's plane of thought?A child who understood the language of the birds, and heard the grass
grow--a child whom Torquemada would have burnt as a witch, and yet
with whom he could not doubt the Christ dwelt.Jose often studied her features while she bent over her work.He spent
hours, too, poring over the little locket which had been found among
her mother's few effects.The portrait of the man was dim and soiled.Jose wondered if the poor woman's kisses and tears had blurred it.The
people of Badillo said she had died with it pressed to her lips.But
its condition rendered futile all speculation in regard to its
original.That of the mother, however, was still fresh and clear.Jose
conjectured that she must have been either wholly Spanish, or one of
the more refined and cultured women of Colombia.And she had
doubtless been very young and beautiful when the portrait was made.With what dark tragedy was that little locket associated?But Carmen's brown curls and light skin--whence came they?And her keen mind, and deep
religious instinct?He could only be sure that they had come
from a source far, far above her present lowly environment.With that
much he must for the present be content.*       *       *       *       *

Another month unfolded its length in quiet days, and Rosendo again
returned.Not ill this time, nor even much exhausted.Nor did the
little leathern pouch contain more than a few _pesos_ in gold dust.But determination was written grim and trenchant upon his black face
as he strode into the parish house and extended his great hand to the
priest."I have only come for more supplies, Padre," he said."I have some
three _pesos_ worth of gold.Most of this I got around Culata, near
Don Felipe's quartz vein, the Andandodias._Caramba_, what veins in
those hills!If we had money to build a mill, and knew how to catch
the gold, we would not need to wash the river sands that have been
gone over again and again for hundreds of years!"But Jose's thoughts were of the Alcalde.He determined to send for him
at once, while Rosendo was removing the soil of travel.Don Mario came and estimated the weight of the gold by his hand.Then
he coolly remarked: "_Bien, Senor Padre_, I will send Rosendo to my
_hacienda_ to-morrow to cut cane and make _panela_.""He owes me thirty _pesos oro_, less
this, if you wish me to keep it.I see no likelihood that he can ever
repay me.And so he must now work out his debt.""How long will that take him, _amigo_?""_Quien sabe?_ _Senor Padre_," the Alcalde replied, his eyes
narrowing.The priest braced himself, and his face assumed an expression that it
had not worn before he came to Simiti."Look you now, my friend," he
began in tones pregnant with meaning."I have made some inquiries
regarding your system of peonage.I find that you pay your _peones_
from twenty to thirty cents a day for their hard labor, and at the
same time charge them as much a day for food.Or you force them to buy
from you tobacco and rum at prices which keep them always in your
debt."_Na_, Padre, you have been misinformed," the Alcalde demurred, with a
deprecating gesture.Lazaro Ortiz is now working for you on that system.And
daily he becomes more deeply indebted to you, is it not so?""But, Padre--"

"It is useless for you to deny it, Don Mario, for I have facts.Let us understand each other clearly, nor attempt to
dissimulate.That iniquitous system of peonage has got to cease in my
parish!""_Caramba_, but Padre Diego had _peones_!""And he was a wicked man," added Jose.Then he continued:

"I know not what information you may have from the Bishop regarding
me, yet this I tell you: I shall report you to Bogota, and I will band
the citizens of Simiti together to drive you out of town, if you do
not at once release Lazaro, and put an end to this wicked practice.It was a bold stroke, and the priest knew that he was standing upon
shaky ground.But the man before him was superstitious, untutored and
child-like.A show of courage, backed by an assertion of authority,
might produce the desired effect.Moreover, Jose knew that he was in
the right.Don Mario glared at him, while an ugly look spread over his coarse
features.The priest went on:

"Lazaro has long since worked out his debt, and you shall release him
at once.As to Rosendo, he must have the supplies he needs to return
to Guamoco."_Caramba!_" Don Mario's face was purple with rage."You think you can
tell me what to do--me, the Alcalde!""You think you can
make us change our customs!_Caramba!_ You are no better than the
priest Diego, whom you try to make me believe so wicked!_Hombre_, you
were driven out of Cartagena yourself!A nice sort to be teaching a
little girl--!"thundered Jose, striding toward him with upraised arm.Don Mario fell back in his chair and quailed before the mountainous
wrath of the priest.For a moment the girl stood looking in wonder at the angry men.Then
she went quickly to the priest and slipped a hand into his.A feeling
of shame swept over him, and he went back to his chair.Carmen leaned
against him, but she appeared to be confused."Cucumbra doesn't fight any more, Padre," the girl at length began in
hesitation."He and the puppy play together all the time now.He has
learned a lot, and now he loves the puppy.""_Bien_," he
said in soft tones, "I think we became a bit too earnest, Don Mario.We are good friends, is it not so?And we are working together for the
good of Simiti.But to have good come to us, we must do good to
others."He went to his trunk and took out a wallet."Here are twenty _pesos_,
Don Mario."It was all he had in the world, but he did not tell the
Alcalde so.Let him have the new
supplies he needs, and I will be his surety.And, friend, you are
going to let me prove to you with time that the report you have from
Cartagena regarding me is false."Don Mario's features relaxed somewhat when his hand closed over the
grimy bills."Do not forget, _amigo_," added Jose, assuming an air of mystery as he
pursued the advantage, "that you and I are associated in various
business matters, is it not so?"The Alcalde's mouth twitched, but finally extended in an unctuous
grin.After all, the priest was a descendant of the famous Don
Ignacio, and--who knew?--he might have resources of which the Alcalde
little dreamed."_Cierto, Padre!_" he cried, rising to depart."And we will yet
uncover La Libertad!_Bien_, he shall
have the supplies.But I think he should take another man with him.It was a gracious and unlooked for condescension."Send Lazaro to me, Don Mario," said Jose."We will find use for him,
I think."And thus Rosendo was enabled to depart a third time to the solitudes
of Guamoco.CHAPTER 14


With Rosendo again on the trail, Jose and Carmen bent once more to
their work.Within a few days the grateful Lazaro was sent to
Rosendo's _hacienda_, biding the time when the priest should have a
larger commission to bestow upon him.With the advent of the dry
season, peace settled over the sequestered town, while its artless
folk drowsed away the long, hot days and danced at night in the
silvery moonlight to the twang of the guitar and the drone of the
amorous canzonet.Jose was deeply grateful for these days of unbroken
quiet, and for the opportunity they afforded him to probe the child's
thought and develop his own.Night after
night he visited the members of his little parish, getting better
acquainted with them, administering to their simple needs, talking to
them in the church edifice on the marvels of the outside world, and
then returning to his little cottage to prepare by the feeble rays of
his flickering candle Carmen's lessons for the following day.He had
no texts, save the battered little arithmetic; and even that was
abandoned as soon as Carmen had mastered the decimal system.Thereafter he wrote out each lesson for her, carefully wording it that
it might contain nothing to shock her acute sense of the allness of
God, and omitting from the vocabulary every reference to evil, to
failure, disaster, sin and death.In mathematics he was sure of his
ground, for there he dealt wholly with the metaphysical.But history
caused him many an hour of perplexity in his efforts to purge it of
the dross of human thought.If Carmen were some day to go out into the
world she _must_ know the story of its past.And yet, as Jose faced
her in the classroom and looked down into her unfathomable eyes, in
whose liquid depths there seemed to dwell a soul of unexampled purity,
he could not bring himself even to mention the sordid events in the
development of the human race which manifested the darker elements of
the carnal mind.Perhaps, after all, she might never go out into the
world.He had not the faintest idea how such a thing could be
accomplished.And so under his tutelage the child grew to know a world
of naught but brightness and beauty, where love and happiness dwelt
ever with men, and wicked thoughts were seen as powerless and
transient, harmless to the one who knew God to be "everywhere."The
man taught the child with the sad remembrance of his own seminary
training always before him, and with a desire, amounting almost to
frenzy, to keep from her every limiting influence and benumbing belief
of the carnal mind.The decimal system mastered, Carmen was inducted into the elements of
algebra."How funny," she exclaimed, laughing, "to use letters for numbers!""They are only general symbols, little one," he explained."Symbols
are signs, or things that stand for other things."Then came suddenly into his mind how the great Apostle Paul taught
that the things we see, or think we see, are themselves but symbols,
reflections as from a mirror, and how we must make them out as best
we can for the present, knowing that, in due season, we shall see the
realities for which these things stand to the human mind.He knew that
back of the mathematical symbols stood the eternal, unvarying,
indestructible principles which govern their use.And he had begun to
see that back of the symbols, the phenomena, of human existence stands
the great principle--infinite God--the eternal mind.In the realm of
mathematics the principles are omnipotent for the solution of
problems--omnipotent in the hands of the one who understands and uses
them aright.And is not God the omnipotent principle to the one who
understands and uses Him aright in the solving of life's intricate
problems?"They are so easy when you know how, Padre dear," said Carmen,
referring to her tasks."But there will be harder ones, _chiquita_."But then I shall know more about the rules that you call
principles.""You do not know what the answer will be, _chiquita_," he ventured.If I use the rule in the right way
I shall get the correct answer, shall I not?she cried
joyfully, as she held up her paper with the completed solution of a
problem."But how do you know that it is correct?""Why--well, we can prove it--can't we?"Then she bent again over her task and worked
assiduously for some moments in silence.I worked it back again to the starting point."And in proving it, little one, you have proved the principle and
established its correctness.Is it not so, _chiquita_?""Yes, Padre, it shows that the rule is right."The child lapsed into silence, while Jose, as was becoming his wont,
awaited the result of her meditation.Then:

"Padre dear, there are rules for arithmetic, and algebra, and--and for
everything, are there not?""Yes, child, for music, for art, for everything.We can do nothing
correctly without using principles.""And, Padre, there are principles that tell us how to live?""What is your opinion on that point, _queridita_?""Just _one_ principle, I guess, Padre dear," she finally ventured,
after a pause.The Apostle John had dwelt
with the Master.What had he urged so often upon the dull ears of his
timid followers?The child looked up at the priest with a smile whose tenderness
dissolved the rising clouds of doubt."And God is--love," he finished softly.The child clapped her little hands and laughed
aloud.Jesus had said, "I and my Father are one."Having seen him, the
world has seen the Father.But Jesus was the highest manifestation of
love that tired humanity has ever known.he had cried in
tones that have echoed through the centuries.Apply the Principle of principles,
Love, to every task, every problem, every situation, every condition!For what is the Christ-principle but Love?All things are possible to
him who loves, for Love casteth out fear, the root of every discord.Men ask why God remains hidden from them, why their understanding of
Him is dim.They forget that to know Him
they must first love their fellow-men.And so the world goes
sorrowfully on, hating, cheating, grasping, abusing; still wondering
dully why men droop and stumble, why they consume with disease, and,
with the despairing conviction that God is unknowable, sinking at last
into oblivion.Jose, if he knew aught, knew that Carmen greatly loved--loved all
things deeply and tenderly as reflections of her immanent God.She had
loved the hideous monster that had crept toward her as she sat
unguarded on the lake's rim.Not so, for the arms of Love
were there about her.She had loved God--good--with unshaken fealty
when Rosendo lay stricken.She had known that Love could not manifest
in death when he himself had been dragged from the lake that burning
afternoon a few weeks before."God is the rule, isn't He, Padre dear?"The child's unexampled eyes
glowed like burning coals."And we can prove Him, too," she continued
confidently._Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open
you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there
shall not be room enough to receive it._

Prove Him, O man, that He is Love, and that Love, casting out hate and
fear, solves life's every problem!But first--_Bring ye all the tithes
into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house._ Bring your
whole confidence, your trust, your knowledge of the allness of good,
and the nothingness of evil.Bring, too, your every earthly hope,
every mad ambition, every corroding fear, and carnal belief; lay them
down at the doorway of mine storehouse, and behold their nothingness!As Carmen approached her simple algebraic problems Jose saw the
working of a rule infinite in its adaptation.She knew not what the
answers should be, yet she took up each problem with supreme
confidence, knowing that she possessed and rightly understood the rule
for correctly solving it.She knew that speculation regarding the
probable results was an idle waste of time.And she likewise knew
instinctively that fear of inability to solve them would paralyze her
efforts and insure defeat at the outset.Nor could she force solutions to correspond to what she might think
they ought to be--as mankind attempt to force the solving of their
life problems to correspond to human views.She was glad to work out
her problems in the only way they could be solved.Love, humility,
obedience, enabled her to understand and correctly apply the principle
to her tasks.The results were invariable--harmony and exceeding joy.Again that little hand had softly
swept his harp of life.And again he breathed in unison with its
vibrating chords a deep "Thank God!"Carmen looked up from a brown study."It stands for nothing, child," the priest made reply, wondering what
was to follow this introduction."And the minus sign in algebra is different from the one in
arithmetic."But, Padre, if God is all, how can you say there is nothing, or less
than nothing?""They are only human ways of
thinking, _chiquita_.The plus sign always represents something
positive; the minus, something negative.The one is the opposite of
the other.""Is there an opposite to everything, Padre?"Then:

"No, _chiquita_--not a _real_ opposite.But," he added hastily, "we
may suppose an opposite to everything.""That is what makes people sick and unhappy,
isn't it, Padre?"Supposing that there can be nothing,
when He is everywhere.Doesn't all trouble come from just supposing
things that are not so?"Whence came such questions to the mind of this child?And why did they
invariably lead to astonishing deductions in his own?Why did he
often give a great start as it dawned again upon him that he was not
talking to one of mature age, but to a babe?He tore a strip from the paper in his hand.Relatively the paper had
lost in size and quantity, and there was a distinct separation.The plus was always
positive and real; the minus was always relative, and stood for
unreality.And so it was throughout the entire realm of thought._Every real thing has its suppositional opposite._ The difficulty is
that the human mind, through long ages of usage, has come to regard
the opposite as just as real as the thing itself.The opposite of love
is hate; of health, disease; of good, evil; of the real, the
counterfeit.His opposite, the negative, is
supposition.Oh, stupid, blundering, dull-eared humanity, not to have
realized that this was just what Jesus said when he defined evil as
the lie about God!No wonder the prophet proclaimed salvation to be
righteousness, right thinking!But would gross humanity have
understood the Master better if he had defined it this way?No, they
would have stoned him on the spot!Jose knew that when both he and Rosendo lay sick unto death Carmen's
thought had been positive, while theirs had been of the opposite sign.And with the prophets before him, whom the
world laughed to scorn?What,
then, is the overcoming of evil but the driving out of entrenched
human beliefs?Again Jose came back to the thought of Principle.Confucius had said
that heaven was principle.Mankind are accustomed to speak lightly and knowingly of
their "principles."But in their search for the Philosopher's Stone
they have overlooked the Principle which the Master used to effect his
mighty works--"that Mind which was in Christ Jesus."The word evil is a comprehensive term, including errors of every sort.And yet, in the world's huge category of evils is there a single one
that stands upon a definite principle?Jose had to admit to himself
that there was not.Errors in mathematics result from ignorance of
principles, or from their misapplication.But are the errors real and
permanent?"Padre, when I make a mistake, and then go back and do the problem
over and get it right, what becomes of the mistake?""But, Padre," she pursued, "there are rules for solving problems; but
there isn't any rule or principle for making mistakes, is there?""And if I always knew the truth about things, I couldn't make
mistakes, could I?""Well, then, God doesn't know anything about mistakes--does He?""Then, Padre dear, nobody can know anything about mistakes.People
just think they can--don't they?""_Chiquita_, can you know that
two and two are seven?""Why, Padre dear, how funny!""Yes--it does seem strange--now.And yet, I used to think I could know
things just as absurd.""Why, what was that, Padre?""I thought, _chiquita_, that I could know evil--something that God
does not and can not know."It is absolutely impossible to know--to really _know_--error
of any sort.""If we knew it, Padre, it would have a rule; or as you say, a
principle, no?""And, since God is everywhere, He would have to be its principle."Now take another of the problems, _chiquita_, and
work on it while I think about these things," he said, assigning
another of the simple tasks to the child.For an idea was running through the man's thought, and he had traced
it back to the explorer in Cartagena.Reason and logic supported the
thought of God as mind; of the creation as the unfolding of this
mind's ideas; and of man as the greatest idea of God.It also seemed
to show that the physical senses afforded no testimony at all, and
that human beings saw, heard and felt only in thought, in belief.On
this basis everything reduced to a mental plane, and man became a
mentality.But what sort of mentality was that which Jose saw all
about him in sinful, sick and dying humanity?The human man is
demonstrably mortal--and he is a sort of mind--ah, yes, that was it!The explorer had said that up in that great country north there were
those who referred to this sort of mentality as "mortal mind."For, if the mortal man is a mind at all,
he assuredly is a _mortal_ mind.And the mortal mind is the opposite of that mind which is the eternal
God.Any so-called opposite to Him
must be a supposition--or, as Jesus defined it, the lie about Him.This lie seems to counterfeit the eternal mind that is God.It seems
to pose as a creative principle, and to simulate the powers and
attributes of God himself.It assumes to create its universe of
matter, the direct opposite of the spiritual universe.And, likewise,
it assumes to create its man, its own idea of itself, and hence the
direct opposite of the real man, the divine idea of God, made in His
own image and likeness."Surely," he murmured low, "the
material personality, called man, which sins, suffers and dies, is not
real man, but his counterfeit, a creation of God's opposite, the
so-called mortal mind.It must be a part of the lie about God, the
'mist' that went up from the ground and watered the whole face of the
earth, leaving the veil of supposition which obscures God from human
sight.It is this sort of man and this sort of universe that I have
always seen about me, and that the world refers to as human beings, or
mortals, and the physical universe.And yet I have been looking only
at my false thoughts of man."At that moment he caught sight of Juan running toward him from the
lake.The lad had just returned from Bodega Central."Padre," he exclaimed breathlessly, "there is war in the country
again!The revolution has broken out, and they are fighting all along
the river!"Jose turned into the house and clasped Carmen in his arms.CHAPTER 15


Juan's startling announcement linked Jose again with a fading past.Standing with his arm about Carmen, while the child looked up
wonderingly at her grimly silent protector, the priest seemed to have
fallen with dizzy precipitation from some spiritual height into a
familiar material world of men and events.Into his chastened
mentality there now rushed a rabble rout of suggestions, throwing into
wild confusion the orderly forces of mind which he was striving to
marshal to meet the situation.He recalled, for the first time in his
new environment, the significant conversation of Don Jorge and the
priest Diego, in Banco.He saw again the dark clouds that were
lowering above the unhappy country when he left Cartagena.And would carnal lust and rapine again drench fair
Colombia with the blood of her misguided sons?Were the disturbance
only a local uprising, headed by a coterie of selfish politicians, it
would produce but a passing ripple.Colombia had witnessed many such,
and had, by a judicious redistribution of public offices, generally
met the crises with little difficulty.On the other hand, if the
disorder drew its stimulus from the deep-seated, swelling sentiment of
protest against the continued affiliation of Church and State, then
what might not ensue before reason would again lay her restraining
hand upon the rent nation!For--strange anomaly--no strife is so
venomous, no wars so bloody, no issues so steeped in deadliest hatred,
as those which break forth in the name of the humble Christ.A buzzing concourse was gathering in the _plaza_ before the church.Leaving Carmen in charge of Dona Maria, Jose mingled with the excited
people.Juan had brought no definite information, other than that
already imparted to Jose, but his elastic Latin imagination had
supplied all lacking essentials, and now, with much gesticulation and
rolling of eyes, with frequent alternations of shrill chatter and
dignified pomp of phrase, he was portraying in a _melange_ of
picturesque and poetic Spanish the supposed happenings along the great
river.Jose forced the lad gently aside and addressed the thoroughly excited
people himself, assuring them that no reliable news was as yet at
hand, and bidding them assemble in the church after the evening meal,
where he would advise with them regarding their future course.He then
sought the Alcalde, and drew him into his store, first closing the
door against the excited multitude."_Bien, Senor Padre_, what are you going to do?"The Alcalde was
atremble with insuppressible excitement."Don Mario, we must protect Simiti," replied the priest, with a show
of calm which he did not possess."_Caramba_, but not a man will stay!The
_guerrillas_ will come, and Simiti will be burned to the ground!""_Na_, and be hacked by the _machetes_ of the _guerrillas_, or lassoed
by government soldiers and dragged off to the war?"The official
mopped the damp from his purple brow."_Caramba!_" he went on."But the Antioquanians will come down the
Simiti trail from Remedios and butcher every one they meet!They
hate us Simitanians, since we whipped them in the revolution of
seventy-six!if we stay here and beat them back,
then the federal troops will come with their ropes and chains and
force us away to fight on their side!_Nombre de Dios!_ I am for the
mountains--_pronto_!"And yet, in the welter of
conflicting thought two objects stood out above the rest--Carmen and
Rosendo.Would he fall afoul
of the bandits who find in these revolutions their opportunities for
plunder and bloodshed?As for Carmen--the priest's apprehensions were
piling mountain-high.He had quickly forgotten his recent theories
regarding the nature of God and man.He had been swept by the force of
ill tidings clean off the lofty spiritual plane up to which he had
struggled during the past weeks.Again he was befouled in the mire of
material fears and corroding speculations as to the probable
manifestations of evil, real and immanent.He
must take the child and fly at once.He would go to Dona Maria
immediately and bid her prepare for the journey."You had best go to Don Nicolas," replied Dona Maria, when the priest
had voiced his fears to her."He lives in Boque, and has a _hacienda_
somewhere up that river."Three hours from Simiti, across the shales.You must start with the
dawn, or the heat will overtake you before you arrive.""Then make yourself ready, Dona Maria," said Jose in relief, "and we
will set out in the morning.""Padre, I will stay here," the woman quietly replied."There will be many women too old to leave the town, Padre.I will
stay to help them if trouble comes.And I would not go without
Rosendo."Shame fell upon the priest like a blanket.He, the _Cura_, was
deserting his charge!And this quiet, dignified woman had shown
herself stronger than the man of God!He took the child by the hand and led her to his
own cottage."Carmen," he said, as she stood expectantly before him, "we--there is
trouble in the country--that is, men are fighting and killing down on
the river--and they may come here.We must--I mean, I think it best
for us to go away from Simiti for a while."The priest's eyes fell
before the perplexed gaze of the girl."The soldiers might come--wicked men might come and harm you,
_chiquita_!""Is it that you think they will,
Padre?""I fear so, little one," he made reply."Because they want to steal and kill," he returned sadly."They can't, Padre--they can't!""You told me
that people see only their thoughts, you know.They only think they
want to steal--and they don't think right--"

"But," he interrupted bitterly, "that doesn't keep them from coming
here just the same and--and--" He checked his words, as a faint memory
of his recent talks with the girl glowed momentarily in his seething
brain."But we can keep them from coming here, Padre--can't we?""By thinking right ourselves, Padre--you said so, days ago--don't you
remember?"The girl came to the frightened man and put her little arm
about his neck.It was an action that had become habitual with her."Padre dear, you read me something from your Bible just yesterday.It
was about God, and He said, 'I am that which was, and is, and is to
come.'But, Padre dear, if He is that which is to
come, how can anything bad come?"Could ye not watch one hour with me--the
Christ-principle?Must ye ever flee when the ghost of evil stalks
before you with his gross assumptions?But he had said those things to her and evolved
those beautiful theories in a time of peace.Now his feeble faith was
flying in panic before the demon of unbelief, which had been aroused
by sudden fear.The villagers were gathering before his door like frightened sheep.They sought counsel, protection, from him, the unfaithful shepherd.Could he not, for their sakes, tear himself loose from bondage to his
own deeply rooted beliefs, and launch out into his true orbit about
God?Was life, happiness, all, at the disposal of physical sense?And could not his love for them cast out his
fear?If the test had come, would he meet it, calmly, even alone with
his God, if need be?--or would he basely flee?But Carmen--she
was only a child, immature, inexperienced in the ways of the world!Yet the great God himself had caused His prophets to see that "a
little child shall lead them."And surely Carmen was now leading in
fearlessness and calm trust, in the face of impending evil.Jose rose from his chair and threw back his shoulders."My children," he said gently, holding out his
arms over them.I shall not leave Simiti, but
remain here to help and protect all who will stay with me.If the
_guerrillas_ or soldiers come we will meet them here, where we shall
be protecting our loved ones and our homes.Come to the church
to-night, and there we will discuss plans.Go now, and remember
that your _Cura_ has said that there shall no harm befall you."The people dispersed; Carmen was called by Dona Maria; and Jose
dropped down upon his bed to strive again to clear his mind of the
foul brood which had swept so suddenly into it, and to prepare for the
evening meeting.Late that night, as he crossed the road from the church to his
little home, his pulse beat rapidly under the stimulus of real joy.He
had conquered his own and the fears of the Alcalde, and that
official had at length promised to stay and support him.The
people's fears of impressment into military service had been calmly
met and assuaged, though Jose had yielded to their wish to form a
company of militia; and had even agreed to drill them, as he had
seen the troops of Europe drilled and prepared for conflict.There
were neither guns nor ammunition in the town, but they could drill
with their _machetes_--for, he repeated to himself, this was but a
concession, an expedient, to keep the men occupied and their minds
stimulated by his own show of courage and preparedness.It was
decided to send Lazaro Ortiz at once into the Guamoco district, to
find and warn Rosendo; while Juan was to go to Bodega Central for
whatever news he might gather, and to return with immediate warning,
should danger threaten their town.Similar instruction was to be
sent to Escolastico, at Badillo.Within a few days a runner should be
despatched over the Guamoco trail, to spread the information as
judiciously as possible that the people of Simiti were armed and
on the alert to meet any incursion from _guerrilla_ bands.The priest would now strive
mightily to keep his own thought clear and his courage alive, to
sustain his people in whatever experience might befall them.Quiet reigned in the little village the next morning, and its people
went about their familiar duties with but a passing thought of the
events of the preceding day.The Alcalde called at the parish house
early for further instructions in regard to the proposed company of
militia.The priest decided to drill his men twice a day, at the
rising and setting of the sun.Carmen's lessons were then resumed, and
soon Jose was again laboring conscientiously to imbibe the spirit of
calm trust which dwelt in this young girl.The Master's keynote before every threatening evil was, "Be not
afraid."Carmen's life-motif was, "_God is everywhere._" Jose strove
to see that the Christ-principle was eternal, and as available to
mankind now as when the great Exemplar propounded it to the dull ears
of his followers.When they have
done this, Christianity will be as scientific and demonstrable to
mankind as is now the science of mathematics.A rule, though
understood, is utterly ineffective if not applied.Yet, how to apply
the Christ-principle?is the question convulsing a world to-day.God, the infinite creative mind, is that principle.Jesus showed
clearly--so clearly that the wonder is men could have missed the mark
so completely--that the great principle becomes available only when
men empty their minds of pride, selfishness, ignorance, and human
will, and put in their place love, humility and truth.This step
taken, there will flow into the human consciousness the qualities of
God himself, giving powers that mortals believe utterly impossible to
them.But hatred must go; self-love, too; carnal ambition must go; and
fear--the cornerstone of every towering structure of mortal
misery--must be utterly cast out by an understanding of the allness of
the Mind that framed the spiritual universe.Jose, looking at Carmen as she sat before him, tried to know that love
was the salvation, the righteousness, right-thinking, by which alone
the sons of men could be redeemed.The world would give such utterance
the lie, he knew.The sons of earth must
be warriors, and valiantly fight!the tired old world has fought
for ages untold, and gained--nothing.He loved his enemies with a love that
understood the allness of God, and the consequent nothingness of the
human concept.Knowing the concept of man as mortal to be an illusion,
Jesus then knew that he had no enemies.The work-day closed, and Carmen was about to leave.A shadow fell
across the open doorway.A man, dressed in clerical
garb, stood looking in, his eyes fixed upon Carmen.Jose's heart
stopped, and he sat as one stunned.the newcomer cried, advancing with
outstretched hands.I ached to think I might not
find you here!can this be my little Carmen, from
whom I tore myself in tears four years ago and more?_Diablo!_ but she
has grown to be a charming _senorita_ already."He bent over and
kissed the child loudly upon each cheek.Jose with difficulty restrained himself from pouncing upon the man as
he watched him pass his fat hands over the girl's bare arms and feast
his lecherous eyes upon her round figure and plump limbs.The child
shrank under the withering touch.Freeing herself, she ran from the
room, followed by a taunting laugh from Diego."_Caramba!_" he exclaimed, sinking into the chair vacated by the girl."But I had the devil's own trouble getting here!And I find everything
quiet as a funeral in this sink of a town, just as if hell were not
spewing fire down on the river!_Dios!_ But give me a bit of rum,
_amigo_.My spirits droop like the torn wing of a heron.""_Hombre!_ With what do you quench your thirst?"Then he added with a fatuous grin:

"No, I have not yet honored the Alcalde with a call.Anxious care
drove me straight from the boat to you; for with you, a brother
priest, I knew I would find hospitality and protection."After a few moments, during which he fanned
himself vigorously with his black felt hat, Diego continued volubly:

"You are consumed to know what brings me here, eh?_Bien_, I will
anticipate your questions.And--you know they do not love priests down that way--well, I saw that
it had come around to my move."But," he continued, "luckily I had screwed plenty of Masses out of
the Banco sheep this past year, and my treasure box was comfortably
full._Bueno_, I hired a canoe and a couple of strapping _peones_, who
brought me by night, and by damnably slow degrees, up the river to
Bodega Central.As luck would have it, I chanced to be there the day
Juan arrived from Simiti.So I straightway caused inquiry to be made
of him respecting the present whereabouts of our esteemed friend, Don
Rosendo.Learning that my worthy brother was prospecting for La
Libertad, it occurred to me that this decaying town might afford me
the asylum I needed until I could make the necessary preparations to
get up into the mountains._Caramba!_ but I shall not stay where a
stray bullet or a badly directed _machete_ may terminate my noble
life-aspirations!""But, how dared you come to Simiti?""You were once forced to leave this town--!""Assuredly, _amigo_," Diego replied with great coolness."And I would
not risk my tender skin again had I not believed that you were here to
shield me.Their most
accessible point is by way of Simiti.From here I can go to the San
Lucas country; eventually get back to the Guamoco trail; and
ultimately land in Remedios, or some other town farther south, where
the anticlerical sentiment is not so cursedly strong.I have money and
two <DW64> boys.The boat I shall have to leave here in your care._Bien_, learning that Rosendo, my principal annoyance and obstruction,
was absent, and that you, my friend, were here, I decided to brave the
wrath of the simple denizens of this hole, and spend a day or two as
guest of yourself and my good friend, the Alcalde, before journeying
farther.Thus you have it all, in _parvo_.But, _Dios y diablo_!that
trip up the river has nearly done for me!We traveled by night and hid
in the brush by day, where millions of gnats and mosquitoes literally
devoured me!_Caramba!_ and you so inhospitable as to have no rum!"Then he resumed:

"A voluptuous little wench, that Carmen!But
don't let our worthy Don Wenceslas hear of her good looks, for he'd
pop her into a convent _presto_!And later he--_Bien_, you had better
get rid of her before she makes you trouble.I'll take her off your
hands myself, even though I shall be traveling for the next few
months.But, say," changing the subject abruptly, "Don Wenceslas
sprung his trap too soon, eh?""I don't follow you," said Jose, consuming with indignation over the
priest's coarse talk."_Diablo!_ he pulls a revolution before it is ripe.It begins as he intended, anticlerical; and so it will run for
a while.But after that--_Bien_, you will see it reverse itself and
turn solely political, with the present Government on top at the last,
and the end a matter of less than six weeks."asked Jose, eagerly grasping at a new hope."_Hombre!_ But I have been too close to
matters religious and political in this country all my life not to
know that Don Wenceslas has this time committed the blunder of being
a bit too eager.Had he waited a few months longer, and then pulled
the string--_Dios y diablo_!there would have been such a fracas as to
turn the Cordilleras bottom up!Now all that is set back for
years--_Quien sabe_?""But," queried the puzzled Jose, "how could Wenceslas, a priest,
profit by an anticlerical war?""_Caramba, amigo!_ But the good Wenceslas is priest only in name!He
is a politician, bred to the game.He lays his plans with the
anticlericals, knowing full well that Church and State can not be
separated in this land of mutton-headed _peones_._Bueno_, the clever
man precipitates a revolution that can have but one result, the closer
union of Rome and the Colombian Government.And for this he receives
the direction of the See of Cartagena and the disposition of the rich
revenues from the mines and _fincas_ of his diocese."And, _amigo_, how long will this disturbance continue?""I have told you, a few weeks at the most," replied Diego with a show
of petulance."But, just the same, as agent of your friend Wenceslas,
I have been a mite too active along the river, especially in the town
of Banco, to find safety anywhere within the pale of civilization
until this little fracas blows over.This one being an abortion, the
next revolution can come only after several years of most painstaking
preparation.But, mark me, _amigo_, that one will not miscarry, nor
will it be less than a scourge of the Lord!"Despite the sordidness of the man, Jose was profoundly grateful to him
for this information.And there could be no doubt of its authenticity,
coming as it did from a tool of Wenceslas himself.Jose became
cheerful, even animated.Now when do you expect to set out for San Lucas?""_Diablo!_ Then I must be off at once!""_Caramba, hermano!_ Why so desirous of my departure?To be sure,
to-morrow, if possible.But I must have a chat with our good friend,
the Alcalde.So do me the inexpressible favor to accompany me to his
door, and there leave me.My _peones_ are down at the boat, and I
would rather not face the people of Simiti alone."At that moment Dona Maria appeared at the door
bearing a tray with Jose's supper.She stopped short as she recognized
Diego."Ah, _Senora Dona Maria_!"The woman looked inquiringly from Diego to Jose.Without a word she
set the tray on the table and quickly departed."H'm, _amigo_, I think it well to visit the Alcalde at once," murmured
Diego."I regret that I bring the amiable senora no greeting from her
charming daughter._Ay de mi!_" he sighed, picking up his hat."The
conventions of this world are so narrow!"Don Mario exclaimed loudly when he beheld the familiar figure of Padre
Diego.Recovering from his astonishment he broke into a loud guffaw
and clapped the grinning priest heartily upon the back.I can forgive all your
wickedness at sight of such nerve!calling to his daughter in
the _patio_."That last _garrafon_ and some glasses!stepping aside
and ceremoniously waving them in."Our friend finds that his supper awaits him," said Diego, laying a
hand patronizingly upon Jose's arm."But I will eat with you, my good
Don Mario, and occupy a _petate_ on your floor to-night._Conque_,
until later, Don Jose," waving a polite dismissal to the latter."If
not to-night, then in the morning _temprano_."The audacity of the man nettled Jose.He would have liked to be
present during the interview between the Alcalde and this cunning
religio-political agent, for he knew that the weak-kneed Don Mario
would be putty in his oily hands.However, Diego had shown him that he
was not wanted.And there was nothing to do but nurse his temper and
await events.But, whatever deplorable results the visit of Diego might entail, he
had at least brought present comfort to Jose in his report of the
militant uprising now in progress, and the latter would sleep this
night without the torment of dread apprehension.The next morning Diego entered the parish house just as master and
pupil were beginning their day's work.he exclaimed, "our parochial school is quite discriminating!_Bien_, are there not enough children in the town to
warrant a larger school, and with a Sister in charge?I will report
the matter to the good Bishop.""There is a school here, as you know,
_amigo_, with a competent master," he replied with what calmness he
could muster.It was perhaps a hasty and unfortunate remark, for Jose knew he had
been jealously selfish with Carmen."A private school, to which the
stubborn beasts that live in this sink will not send their brats!There must be a parochial school in Simiti, supported by the people!Oh, don't worry; there is gold enough here, buried in _patios_ and
under these innocent-looking mud walls, to support the Pope for a
decade--and that," he chuckled, "is no small sum!"His eyes roved over Carmen and he began a mental appraisement of the
girl."_Caramba!_" muttering half to himself, after he had feasted his
sight upon her for some moments, "but she is large for her age--and,
_Dios y diablo!_ a ravishing beauty!"Then an idea seemed to filter
through his cunning brain.His coarse, unmoral face brightened, and
his thick lips parted in an evil smile."Come here, little one," he said patronizingly, extending his arms to
the child."Come, give your good _Padre_ his morning kiss."The girl shrank back in her chair and looked appealingly at Jose.Then I must come and steal it; and when you confess to good Padre
Jose you may tell him it was all my fault."A look of horror came into the child's face and
she sprang from her seat.He seized Diego by the
shoulder and whirled him quickly about.His face was menacing and his
frame trembled.The voice was low, tense, and deliberate."If
you lay a hand on that child I will strike you dead at my feet!"_Cielo!_ was this the timid sheep that had stopped for
a moment in Banco on its way to the slaughter?But there was no
mistaking the spirit manifested now in that voice and attitude.he exclaimed, a foolish grin splitting his ugly
features.It would be well to understand each other more
thoroughly."Heaven knew, he could not afford
to make enemies, especially at this juncture!But he had not misread
the thought coursing through the foul mind of Diego.And yet, violence
now might ruin both the child and himself."I--I was perhaps a little hasty, _amigo_," he began in gentler tones."But, as you see, I have been quite wrought up of late--the news of
the revolution, and--in these past months there have been many things
to cause me worry.I--"

"Say no more, good friend," interrupted the oily Diego, his beady eyes
twinkling."But you will not wonder it struck me odd that a father
should not be permitted to embrace his own daughter."Dead silence, heavy and stifling, fell upon Jose.Slowly his throat
filled, and his ears began to throb.Diego sat before him, smiling and
twirling his fat thumbs.He looked like the images of Chinese gods
Jose had seen in foreign lands.Of course, the strain of
yesterday had been too much for him!His overwrought mind had read
into words and events meanings which they had not been meant to
convey."True, _amigo_," he managed to say, striving to steady his voice."But
we spiritual Fathers should not forget--"

Diego laughed egregiously.Let us get to the meat in
the nut.Why do you think I am in Simiti, braving the wrath of Rosendo
and others?Why have I left my comfortable quarters in Banco, to
undertake a journey, long and hazardous, to this godless hole?"He paused, apparently enjoying the suffering he saw depicted upon
Jose's countenance."But you will keep my confidence, no?We are brother priests, and must hold together.You protect me in
this, and I return the favor in a like indiscretion._Bien_, I
explain: I am here partly because of the revolution, as I told you
yesterday, and partly, as I did not tell you, to see my little girl,
my daughter, Carmen--

"_Caramba_, man!"he cried, bounding to his feet, as he saw Jose
slowly rise before him.Jose dropped back into his chair like a withered leaf in the lull of a
winter's wind."_Dios y diablo_, but it rends me to make this confession, _amigo_!And yet, I look to you for support!The girl, Carmen--_I am her
father!_"

Diego paced dramatically up and down before the scarce hearing Jose
and unfolded his story in a quick, jerky voice, with many a gesture
and much rolling of his bright eyes."Her mother was a Spanish woman of high degree.My
vows prevented me from marrying her, else I should have done so._Caramba_, but I loved her!_Bien_, I was called to Cartagena.She
feared, in her delicate state, that I was deserting her.She tried to
follow me, and at Badillo was put off the boat.There, poor child, she
passed away in grief, leaving her babe.May she rest forever on the
bosom of the blessed Virgin!"Diego bowed reverently and crossed
himself.Two years later I was assigned to the parish of Simiti.Here I saw the
little locket which I had given her, and knew that Carmen was my
child.Ah, _Dios!_ what a revelation to a breaking heart!But I could
not openly acknowledge her, for I was already in disgrace, as you
know.And, once down, it is easy to sink still further.I confess, I
was indiscreet here.Rosendo's daughter followed
me, despite my protests._Bien_, time passed,
and you came.I had hoped you would take the little Carmen under your
protection.God, how I grieved for the child!At last I determined,
come what might, to see her.The revolution drove me to the mountains;
and love for my girl brought me by way of Simiti.And now, _amigo_,
you have my confession--and you will not be hard on me?_Caramba_, I
need a friend!"He sat down, and mopped his wet brow.Jose was staring with unseeing eyes out
through the open doorway.A stream of sunlight poured over the dusty
threshold, and myriad motes danced in the golden flood."_Bien, amigo_," Diego resumed, with more confidence."I had not
thought to reveal this, my secret, to you--nor to any one, for that
matter--but just to get a peep at my little daughter, and assure my
anxious heart of her welfare.But since coming here and seeing how
mature she is my plans have taken more definite shape.I shall leave
at daybreak to-morrow, if Don Mario can have my supplies ready on this
short notice, and--will take Carmen with me."The color had left his face, and
ages seemed to bestride his bent shoulders.His voice quavered as he
slowly spoke.It were better that we should not meet again
until you depart.""But, _amigo_--ah, I feel for you, believe me!You are attached to the
child--who would not be?_Caramba_, what is this world but a cemetery
of bleaching hopes!_Amigo_, send the child to
me at the house of the Alcalde.I would hold her in my arms and feel a
father's joy.And bid the good Dona Maria make her ready for
to-morrow's journey.""You
said--the San Lucas district?""_Quien sabe?_ good friend," Diego made hasty reply."My plans seem
quite altered since coming here.And you will send Carmen to me at once?And bid her bring
her mother's locket._Conque, hasta luego, amigo._"

He went to the door, and seeing his two <DW64> _peones_ loitering near,
walked confidently and briskly to the house of Don Mario.Jose, bewildered and benumbed, staggered into his sleeping room and
sank upon the bed.*       *       *       *       *

"Padre--Padre dear."Carmen stood beside the stricken priest, and her little hand crept
into his."I watched until I saw him go, and then I came in.He has bad
thoughts, hasn't he?But--Padre dear, what is it?Did he make you
think bad thoughts, too?He can't, you know, if you don't want to."She bent over him and laid her cheek against his.Jose stared unseeing
up at the thatch roof."Padre dear, everything has a rule, a principle, you told me.But his thoughts haven't any principle, have they?Any
more than the mistakes I make in algebra.The child kissed the suffering man and wound her arms about his neck."Padre dear, he couldn't say anything that could make you unhappy--he
just couldn't!God is _everywhere_, and you are His child--and I am,
too--and--and there just isn't anything here but God, and we are in
Him.Why, Padre, we are in Him, just like the little fish in the lake!Isn't it nice to know that--to really _know_ it?"Aye, if he had really known it he would not now be stretched upon a
bed of torment.Was he not really yielding to the mesmerism of human events?Why, oh,
why could he not remain superior to them?Why continually rise and
fall, tossed through his brief years like a dry weed in the blast?It was because he _would_ know evil, and yield to its mesmerism.His
enemies were not without, but within.How could he hope to be free
until he had passed from self-consciousness to the sole consciousness
of infinite good?"Padre dear, his bad thoughts have only the minus sign, haven't
they?"Yes, and Jose's now carried the same symbol of nothingness.Carmen was
linked to the omnipresent mind that is God; and no power, be it Diego
or his superior, Wenceslas, could effect a separation.But if Carmen was Diego's child, she must go with him.Jose could no
longer endure this torturing thought.He rose from the bed and sought
Dona Maria."Senora," he pleaded, "tell me again what you know of Carmen's
parents."The good woman was surprised at the question, but could add nothing to
what Rosendo had already told him.study it as he might, the portrait of the man was wholly
indistinguishable.The sweet, sad face of the young mother looked out
from its frame like a suffering.In it he thought he saw a
resemblance to Carmen.As for Diego, the child certainly did not
resemble him in the least.But years of dissipation and evil doubtless
had wrought their changes in his features.He rose and searched
through the house for her.Dona Maria, busy in the kitchen, had not
seen her leave.His search futile, he returned with heavy heart to his
own house and sat down to think._When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee._ Not "if,"
but "when."The sharp experiences of human existence are not to be
avoided.But in their very midst the Christ-principle is available to
the faithful searcher and worker.Jose,
alarmed beyond measure, prepared to set out in search of her.But at
that moment one of Diego's _peones_ appeared at the door with his
master's request that the child be sent at once to him.At least,
then, she was not in his hands; and Jose breathed more freely.It
seemed to him that, should he see her in Diego's arms, he must
certainly strangle him.Only a few
minutes before he had threatened to kill him!Unspeakably wearied with his incessant
mental battle, he threw himself again upon his bed, and at length sank
into a deep sleep.The shadows were gathering when he awoke with a start.Leaping from the bed, he hastened to the door, just
as Rosendo, swaying beneath his pack, and accompanied by Lazaro Ortiz,
rounded the corner and made toward him._"Hola, amigo Cura!"_ Rosendo shouted, his face radiant."Come and bid
me welcome, and receive good news!"At the same moment Carmen came flying toward them from the direction
of the shales.Jose instantly divined the motive which had sent her
out there.He turned his face to hide the tears which sprang to his
eyes.Then he hastened to his
faithful ally and clasped him in his arms.CHAPTER 16


Struggling vainly with his agitation, while the good tidings which he
could no longer hold fairly bubbled from his lips, Rosendo dragged the
priest into the parish house and made fast the doors.Swinging his
chair to the floor, he hastily unstrapped his kit and extracted a
canvas bag, which he handed to Jose."Padre," he exclaimed in a loud whisper, "we have found it!"_Hombre!_ not less
than forty _pesos oro_--and more up there--quien sabe how much!_Caramba!_"

Rosendo fell into a chair, panting with excitement.Jose sat down with
quickening pulse and waited for the full story."Padre--I knew we would find it--but not this way!_Hombre!_ It was
back of Popales.I had been washing the sands there for two days after
my return.There was a town at that place, years ago.The stone
foundations of the houses can still be seen.The Tigui was rich at
that point then; but it is washed out now._Bien_, one morning I
started out at daybreak to prospect Popales creek, the little stream
cutting back into the hills behind the old settlement.There was a
heavy mist over the whole valley, and I could not see ten feet before
my face._Bien_, I had gone up-stream a long distance, perhaps several
miles, without finding more than a few colors, when suddenly the mist
began to clear, and there before me, only a few feet away, stood a
young deer, just as dumfounded as I was."He paused a moment for breath, laughing meanwhile at the memory of his
surprise."_Bueno_, fresh venison looked good to me, Padre, living on salt
_bagre_ and beans.But I had no weapon, save my _machete_.So I let
drive with that, and with all my strength.The big knife struck the
deer on a leg.The animal turned and started swiftly up the mountain
side, with myself in pursuit._Caramba_, that was a climb!But with
his belly chasing him, a hungry man will climb anything!Through palms
and ferns and high weeds, falling over rocks and tripping on ground
vines we went, clear to the top of the hill.Then the animal turned
and plunged down a glen.On the descent it traveled faster, and in a
few minutes had passed clean from my sight."The glen," he continued, "ran down for perhaps a hundred yards, and
then widened into a clearing.I have been in the Popales country many
times, Padre, but I had never been to the top of this mountain, nor
had I ever seen this glen, which seemed to be an ancient trail.So I
went on down toward the clearing.As I approached it I crossed what
apparently was the bed of an ancient stream, dry now, but with many
pools of water from the recent rains, which are very heavy in that
region._Bien_, I turned and followed this dry bed for a long
distance, and at last came out into the open.I found myself in a
circular space, surrounded by high hills, with no opening but the
stream bed along which I had come.At the far end of the basin-shaped
clearing the creek bed stopped abruptly; and I then knew that the
water had formerly come over the cliff above in a high waterfall, but
had flowed in a direction opposite to that of Popales creek, this
mountain being the divide."_Bueno_; now for my discovery!I several times filled my _batea_ with
gravel from the dry bed and washed it in one of the pools.But as I dug along the margin of the bed I
noticed what seemed to be pieces of adobe bricks.I went on up one
side of the bowl-shaped glen, and found many such pieces, and in some
places stones that had served as foundations for houses at one time.So I knew that there had been a town there, long, long ago.But it
must have been an Indian village, for had it been known to the
Spaniards I surely would have learned of it from my parents.The
ground higher up was strewn with the broken bricks.I picked up many
of the pieces and examined them.Almost every one showed a color or
two of gold; but not enough to pay washing the clay from which they
had been made.But--and here is the end of my story--I have said that
this open space was shaped like a bowl, with all sides dipping sharply
to the center.It occurred to me that in the years--who knows how
many?--that have passed since this town was abandoned, the heavy rains
that had dissolved the mud bricks also must have washed the mud and
the gold it carried down into the center of this basin, where, with
great quantities of water sweeping over it every rainy season, the
clay and sand would gradually wash out, leaving the gold concentrated
in the center."The old man stopped to light the thick cigar which he had rolled
during his recital."_Caramba!_ Padre, it was a lucky thought!I located the center of the
big bowl as nearly as possible, and began to dig.I washed some of the
dirt taken a foot or two below the surface.it left a string
of gold clear around the _batea_!I became so excited I could scarcely
dig.Every batea, as I got deeper and deeper, yielded more and more
gold!I hurried back to the Tigui for my supplies; and then camped up
there and washed the sand and clay for two weeks, until I had to come
back to Simiti for food.Forty _pesos oro_ in fifteen days!_Caramba!_
And there is more.And all concentrated from the mud bricks of that
old, forgotten town in the mountains, miles back of Popales!May the
Virgin bless that deer and mend its hurt leg!"One hundred and sixty francs in shining gold flakes!And who knew how
much more to be had for the digging!"Ah, Padre," mused Rosendo, "it is wonderful how things turn out--that
is, when, as the little Carmen says, you think right!I thought I'd
find it--I knew it was right!_Caramba!_"

At the mention of Carmen's name Jose again became troubled.Rosendo as
yet did not know of Diego's presence in Simiti.Rosendo would learn of it soon enough; and Jose
dared not cast a blight upon the happiness of this rare moment.As they sat reunited at the supper table in Rosendo's house, a
constant stream of townspeople passed and repassed the door, some
stopping to greet the returned prospector, others lingering to witness
Rosendo's conduct when he should learn of Diego's presence in the
town, although no one would tell him of it.The atmosphere was tense
with suppressed excitement, and Jose trembled with dread.Dona Maria
moved quietly about, giving no hint of the secret she carried.Carmen
laughed and chatted, but did not again mention the man from whose
presence she had fled to the shales that morning.Who could doubt that
in the midst of the prevalent mental confusion she had gone out there
"_to think_"?And having performed that duty, she had, as usual, left
her problem with her immanent God."I will go up and settle with Don Mario this very night," Rosendo
abruptly announced, as they rose from the table."Lazaro has told you of the
revolution; and we have many plans to consider, now that we have found
gold.We
can slip out through the rear door, and so avoid these curious people."My honest debts first, _buen Cura_," he said
sturdily.And throwing back his shoulders he strutted about the room
with the air of a plutocrat.With his bare feet, his soiled, flapping
attire, and his swelling sense of self-importance he cut a comical
figure."But, Rosendo--" Jose was at his wits' end.I want to make you captain of the militia we
are forming, and I must talk with you alone first!"The childish egotism of the old man was instantly touched.He slapped his chest and
strode proudly around the room.Capitan Don Rosendo Ariza,
S!_ Ha!Shall I carry a sword and wear gold braid?--But these fellows
are mighty curious," he muttered, looking out through the door at the
loitering townsfolk."The shales, then, Padre!Close the front door,
Carmencita."Jose scarcely breathed until, skirting the shore of the lake and
making a detour of the town, he and Rosendo at length reached the
shale beds unnoticed."Rosendo, the gold deposit that you have discovered--is it safe?And no one would think of looking
there for gold.I discovered it by the merest chance, and I left no
trace of my presence.Besides, there are no gold hunters in that
country, and very few people in the entire district of Guamoco.""And how long will it take you to wash out the deposit, do you
think?""_Quien sabe?_ Padre."But you cannot return to Guamoco until the revolution is over.""_Bien_, Padre, I will remain in Simiti a week or two.We may then
know what to expect of the revolution.""Rosendo, about the gold for Cartagena: how can we send it, even when
peace is restored?""Juan might go down each month," Rosendo suggested.The expense would be greater than the amount shipped.Besides, our work must be done with the utmost
secrecy.No one but ourselves must know of your discovery.And no one
else in Simiti must know where we are sending the gold.Rosendo, it is
a great problem."Then:

"Rosendo, the little Carmen makes great progress.""_Por supuesto!_ I knew she would."Have you no idea, Rosendo, who her parents might have been?""Has it ever occurred to you, Rosendo, that, because of her deeply
religious nature, possibly her father was a priest?""_Caramba, no!_" ejaculated Rosendo, turning upon Jose."What puts
that into your head, _amigo_?""As I have said, Rosendo," Jose answered, "her religious instinct.""_Bien, Senor Padre_, you forget that priests are not religious.""But some are, Rosendo," persisted Jose in a tone of protest.But those who are do not have children," was Rosendo's
simple manner of settling the argument.Its force appealed to Jose, and he felt a shade of relief.But, if
Diego were not the father of Carmen, what motive had he for wishing to
take her with him, other than to train her eventually to become his
concubine?"But, Padre, we came out here to talk about the militia of which I am
to be captain._Bien_, we must begin work to-morrow._Hombre_, but the
senora's eyes will stand out when she sees me marching at the head of
the company!""And now that we have gold, Padre, I must send to Cartagena for a gun."You probably could not obtain one, Rosendo.The Government is so
afraid of revolutions that it prohibits the importation of arms.But
even if you could, it would cost not less than fifty _pesos oro_."_Caramba!_" exclaimed the artless fellow.But now let us name those who will form the company."By dwelling on the pleasing theme, Jose managed to keep Rosendo
engaged until fatigue at length drove the old man to seek his bed.The
town was wrapped in darkness as they passed through its quiet streets,
and the ancient Spanish lantern, hanging crazily from its moldering
sconce on the corner of Don Felipe's house, threw the only light into
the black mantle that lay upon the main thoroughfare.*       *       *       *       *

At sunrise, Jose was awakened by Rosendo noisily entering his house.A glance at the old man showed that he was laboring under strong
emotion."What sort of friendship is this," he demanded curtly, "that you keep
me from learning of Diego's presence in Simiti?It was a trick you
served me--and friends do not so to one another!"He stood looking
darkly at the priest."There, comfort yourself, Padre," replied Rosendo, a sneer curling his
lips."Your friend is safe--for the present.He and his <DW64> rascals
fled before sunrise."_Bueno_, then across the lake,
toward the Juncal.Don Mario stocked their boat last night, while you
kept me out on the shales._Buen arreglo, no?_"

"Yes, Rosendo," replied Jose gladly, "an excellent arrangement to keep
you from dipping your hands in his foul blood.Have you no thought of Carmen and her future?"he has spread the report that he is her father!_Caramba!_ For that I would tear him apart!He robbed me of one child;
and now--_Caramba_!Why did you let him go?--why did you, Padre?"Rosendo paced the floor like a caged lion, while great tears rolled
down his black cheeks."But, Rosendo, if you had killed him--what then?Imprisonment for you,
suffering for us all, and the complete wreck of our hopes."_Na_, Padre, but I would have escaped to Guamoco, to the gold I have
discovered.And you would have kept
me supplied; and I would have given you the gold I washed to care for
her--"

The man sank into a chair and buried his head in his hands."_Caramba!_" he moaned."But he will return when I am gone--and the
Church is back of him, and they will come and steal her away--"

How childish, and yet how great he was in his wonderful love, thought
Jose.He pitied him from the bottom of his heart; he loved him
immeasurably; yet he knew the old man's judgment was unsound in this
case."Come, Rosendo," he said gently, laying a hand upon the bent head."This is a time when expediency bids us suffer an evil to remain for a
little while, that a much greater good may follow."Then--"You do not think Diego is her father?""He the father
of that angel-child?_Cielo!_ His brats would be serpents!But I am
losing time--" He turned to the door.What
are you--"

"I am going after Diego!Before sundown
that devil's carcass will be buzzard meat!"If you kill Diego
nothing can save her from Wenceslas!Rosendo, for God's sake,
listen!"But the old man, with his huge strength, tossed the frail priest
lightly aside and rushed into the street.Blind with rage, he did not
see Carmen standing a short distance from the door.The child had been
sent to summon him to breakfast.Unable to check his momentum, the big
man crashed full into her and bore her to the ground beneath him.As
she fell her head struck the sharp edge of an ancient paving stone,
and she lay quite still, while the warm blood slowly trickled through
her long curls.Uttering a frightened cry, Jose rushed to the dazed Rosendo and got
him to his feet.Then he picked up the child, and, his heart numb with
fear, bore her into the house.Clasping Carmen fiercely in his arms, Jose tried to aid Dona Maria in
staunching the freely flowing blood.Rosendo, crazed with grief, bent
over them, giving vent to moans which, despite his own fears, wrung
the priest's heart with pity for the suffering old man.cried Rosendo, kneeling and showering kisses upon her
hands._"Loado sea el buen Dios!"_

"Padre Rosendo," the girl murmured, smiling down at him, "your
thoughts were driving you, just like Benjamin drives his oxen.And
they were bad, or you wouldn't have knocked me over."Rosendo went to the doorway and squatted down upon the dirt
floor in the sunlight."_Caramba_, but they were
murder-thoughts!""And they tried to make you murder me, didn't they, padre dear?""But it didn't really happen, anyway," she added.Rosendo buried his head in his hands and groaned aloud.Carmen slipped
down from Jose's lap and went unsteadily to the old man."They were not yours, those thoughts, padre dear," putting her arms
around his neck."But they were whipping you hard, just as if you
belonged to them.And see, it just shows that bad thoughts can't do
anything.Rosendo reached out and clasped her in his long arms."_Chiquita_," he
cried, "if you were not, your old padre Rosendo would throw himself
into the lake!"She laughed and held up a warning
finger."But I was to tell you the _desayuno_ was ready; and see, we
have forgotten all about it!"Her merry laugh rang through the room
like a silver bell.After breakfast Jose took Rosendo, still shaking, into the parish
house."I think," he said gravely, "that we have learned another
lesson, have we not, _amigo_?"Rosendo's head sank upon his great chest."And, if we are wise, we will profit by it--will we not, _compadre_?"He waited a moment, then continued:

"I have been seeing in a dim way, _amigo_, that our thought is always
the vital thing to be reckoned with, more than we have even suspected
before.I believe there is a mental law, though I cannot formulate it,
that in some way the thoughts we hold use us, and become externalized
in actions.You were wild with fear for Carmen, and your thoughts of
Diego were murderous.Bien, they almost drove you to murder, and they
reacted upon the very one you most love.Can you not see it,
_amigo_?""Padre--I am almost afraid to
think of anything--now.""Ah, _amigo_," said Jose with deep compassion, "I, too, have had a
deep lesson in thinking these past two days.I had evolved many
beautiful theories, and worked out wonderful plans during these weeks
of peace.Then suddenly came the news of the revolution, and, presto!Is it
because she is too young to fear?I think not, _amigo_, I think not.I
think, rather, that it is because she is too wise.""But--she is not of the earth, Padre."The old man shook his head
dubiously.But in some way she
has learned a great truth, and that is that wrong thinking brings all
the discord and woe that afflict the human race.We know this is true,
you and I. In a way we have known it all our lives.But why, _why_ do
we not practice it?Why do I yield so readily to fear; and you to
revenge?I rather think if we loved our enemies we would have none,
for our only enemies are the thoughts that become externalized in
wrong thought-concepts.And even this externalization is only in our
own consciousness.It is there, and only there, that we see evil.""_Quien sabe?_ Padre," replied Rosendo, slowly shaking his head."We
know so little--so little!""But, Rosendo, we know enough to try to be like Carmen--"

"_Caramba_, yes!But whenever danger
threatens her, the very devils seize me, and I am no longer myself."Jose spoke with the conviction of right, however
inconsistent his past conduct might have been."True, Padre--and I must try to love Diego--I know--though I hate him
as the devil hates the cross!Carmen would say that he was used by bad
thoughts, wouldn't she?"She would not see the man, but the impersonal thought that
seems to use him.And I believe she knows how to meet that kind of
thought."_Bien_, I must try to love him.And--Padre, whenever he comes into my mind I will try to think of him
as God's child--though I know he isn't!""_Hombre!_" he exclaimed."You must not
think of the human Diego as God's child!You must always think of the
_real_ child of God for which this human concept, Diego, stands in
your consciousness.And--_Bien_, now let us talk about the company of militia._Caramba!_ what does he want?"With much oily ceremony and show of affection, Don Mario greeted the
pair."I bring a message from Padre Diego," he announced pompously, after
the exchange of courtesies."Bien, it is quite unfortunate that our
friend Rosendo feels so hard toward him, especially as Don Diego has
so long entrusted Carmen to Rosendo's care.But--his letter, _Senor
Padre_," placing a folded paper in Jose's hand.Silently, but with swelling indignation, Jose read:

  "Dear Brother in Christ: It is, as you must know, because of
  our good Rosendo's foolish anger that I relieve him of the
  embarrassment of my presence in Simiti.Not that I fear bodily
  harm, but lest his thoughtlessness urge him to attempt injury
  upon me; in which case nothing but unhappiness could result, as my
  two <DW64> servants would protect me with their own lives.I
  rather choose peace, and to that end quietly depart.But I
  leave behind my bleeding heart in the little Carmen; and I beg
  that you will at once hand her over to the excellent Don Mario,
  with whom I have made arrangements to have her sent to me in
  due season, whether in Banco or Remedios, I can not at present
  say.I am minded to make an excellent report of your parish to
  Don Wenceslas, and I am sure he will lend you support in your
  labors for the welfare of the good folk of Simiti.Do not forget
  to include the little locket with Carmen's effects when you
  deliver her to Don Mario.I assure you of my warm affection for
  you, and for Rosendo, who mistakes in his zeal to persecute
  me, as he will some day learn; and I commend you both to the
  protecting care of our blessed Mother Mary."I kiss your hand, as your servant in Christ,
                                           "DIEGO GUILLERMO POLO."Jose looked long and fixedly at the Alcalde."Don Mario," he finally
said, "do you believe Diego to be the father of Carmen?""_Cierto_, Padre, I know it!""And what are they, may I ask?""I do not know, Padre; only that he has them.Surely the child is his,
and must be sent to him when he commands.Meantime, you see, he gives
the order to deliver her to me.He has kindly arranged to relieve you
and Rosendo of further care of the girl.""Don Mario," said Jose with terrible earnestness, "I will give you the
benefit of the doubt, and say that Diego has basely deceived you."_Hombre!_ But I can not help if you disbelieve him.Still, you must
comply with his request; otherwise, the Bishop may compel you to do
so."Jose realized the terrible possibility of truth in this statement.For
an instant all his old despair rushed upon him.Rosendo was holding his wrath in splendid check."_Bien_, Don Mario," resumed Jose, after a long meditation."Let us
ask our good Rosendo to leave us for a little moment that we may with
greater freedom discuss the necessary arrangements._Bien, amigo!_"
holding up a hand to check Rosendo, who was rising menacingly before
the Alcalde.He threw Rosendo a significant
look; and the latter, after a momentary hesitation, bowed and passed
out of the room."_A proposito, amigo_," resumed Jose, turning to the Alcalde and
assuming utter indifference with regard to Carmen."As you will
recall, I stood security for Rosendo's debts.The thirty _pesos_ which
he owes you will be ready this evening."The Alcalde smiled genially and rubbed his fat palms together."_Muy
bien_," he murmured.Then:

"But, Don Mario, with regard to Carmen, justice must be done, is it
not so?""_Cierto_, Padre; and Padre Diego has the proofs--"

"Certainly; I accept your word for your conviction in the matter.But
you will agree that there is something to be said for Rosendo.He has
fed, clothed, and sheltered the girl for some eight years.Let us see,
at the rate you charge your _peones_, say, fifty pesos a day, that
would amount to--"

He took paper and pencil from the table and made a few figures.

"--to just fourteen hundred and sixty _pesos oro_," he concluded."This, then, is the amount now due Rosendo for the care of Diego's
child.You say he has made arrangements with you to care for her until
he can send for her._Bien_, we will deliver her to you for Diego,
but only upon payment of the sum which I have just mentioned.Otherwise, how will Rosendo be reimbursed for the expense of her
long maintenance?""_Ca--ram--ba!_ Fourteen hundred and sixty _pesos oro_!ejaculated the outwitted Alcalde, his eyes bulging over his
puffy cheeks."And," continued Jose calmly, "if we deliver the girl to you to-day, I
will retain the thirty _pesos oro_ which Rosendo owes you, and you
will stand surety for the balance of the debt, fourteen hundred and
thirty, in that case.""_Diablo!_ but I will do nothing of the kind!""_Caramba!_ let Diego come and look after his own brat!""Then we shall consider the interview at an end, no?""But my thirty _pesos oro_?"We are still
working together, are we not, Don Mario?"Jose in Simiti with money discounted a million Diegos fleeing through
the jungle.The Alcalde's heavy face melted in a foolish grin."_Cierto, buen Padre!_ and--La Libertad?""I have strong hopes," replied Jose with bland assurance, while a
significant look came into his face.Then he rose and bowed the
Alcalde out."And, Don Mario--"

He put a finger on his lips.

""_Cierto, Padre, cierto!_ I am the grave itself!"As the bulky official waddled off to his little shop, Jose turned back
into his house with a great sigh of relief.Another problem had been
met--temporarily.CHAPTER 17


Within the month Juan brought from Bodega Central the glad news of the
revolution's utter collapse.The anticlerical element, scenting
treachery in their own ranks, and realizing almost from the outset
that the end was a matter of only a few weeks, offered to capitulate
on terms which they felt would be less distressing to their pride than
those which their victors might dictate after inflicting a crushing
defeat.The conservatives did not take advantage of the _fiasco_, but
offered conciliation in the way of reapportioning certain minor public
offices, and a show of somewhat lessened clerical influence.The fires of Jacobinism and popery were again
banked, while priest and politician, statesman and orator set up the
board and rearranged the pawns for the next play.Nothing further had been heard of Padre Diego during the month,
excepting that he had arrived at the settlement of Juncal in a state
of extreme agitation, and had hurriedly set out that same day along
the trail to the San Lucas district.Rosendo, meanwhile, assured that
Diego would not return in the immediate future, yielded to Jose's
persuasion and departed at once for Guamoco on the news of the
revolution's close.Simiti had remained unmolested; and now, with the
assurance of indefinite peace, the old town dropped quickly back into
her wonted state of listless repose, and yielded to the drowsy, dreamy
influences that hover always about this scene of mediaeval romance.Jose had recovered his equipoise; and even when Juan, returning from
his next trip down to the river, brought the priest another sharp
letter from Wenceslas, written in the Bishop's name, he read it
without a tremor.The letter complained of Jose's silence, and
especially of his failure to assist the Catholic cause in this crisal
hour by contributions of Peter's Pence.Nor had any report been
received in Cartagena relative to the state of the parish of Simiti,
its resources and communicants; and not a _peso_ had been offered to
the support of their so dear citadel at a time when its enemies
threatened its gates.Jose smiled happily as he penned his reply, for
he knew that with Rosendo's next return their contributions to
Cartagena would begin.That meant the quieting of Wenceslas,
regardless of whatever report Diego might make.And it was evident
from this letter that neither Diego nor the Alcalde had as yet
communicated anything of a startling nature to Wenceslas regarding
those things to which the priest had consecrated himself in Simiti.To his
little flock he was now preaching the Word of God only as he could
interpret it to meet their simple needs.Gradually, as he got closer
to them, he sought to enlighten them and to draw them at least a
little way out of the dense materialism of their present religious
beliefs.He also strove to give them the best of his own worldly
knowledge, and to this end was talking to them three nights a week in
the church building, where the simple people hung upon his words like
children enwrapped in fairy lore.He was holding regular Sunday
services, and offering Masses during the week for those of his
parishioners who requested them, and who would have been shocked,
puzzled, and unhappy had he refused to do so, or attempted to prove
their uselessness.He was likewise saying diurnal Masses for the
little Maria, to whom, as she lay breathing her last in his arms in
Cartagena, he had given the promise to offer them daily in her behalf
for, a year.Nor was this the extent of his loving sacrifice for the girl.He had
already sent a small sum of money to Catalina by Captain Julio, who
promised to arrange at Calamar for its transmission, and for the safe
convoy of a similar small packet monthly to Cartagena and into the
hands of the two women who were caring for the infant son of Wenceslas
and the ill-fated Maria.He had promised her that night that he would
care for her babe.And his life had long since shown what a promise
meant to him.He knew he would be unable to learn of the child's
progress directly from these women, for they were both illiterate.But
Captain Julio brought an encouraging message from them, and assured
Jose that he would always make inquiry for the babe on his trips down
the river.Jose's long-distance dealings with the genial captain had
been conducted through Juan, who had constituted himself the priest's
faithful servant and the distant worshiper of the child Carmen."Padre Jose," Juan had said one day, striving vainly to hide his
embarrassment, "the little Carmen grows very beautiful.She is like
the Pascua-flower, that shines through the ferns in the _cano_.She is
like the great blue butterfly, that floats on the sunbeams that sift
through the forest trees.""Yes, Juan, she is very beautiful.""Padre, you love her much, is it not so?""And I, Padre, I, too, love her."He paused and dug the hard ground
with his bare toes."Padre," he resumed, "the little Carmen will marry--some day, will she
not?"After all, she was human, and-- But, no, he could not, he would not,
think of it!"Why, Juan--I--cannot say--"

"But, Padre, she will.""And--and, Padre,
I--I should like it if she would marry me.Ah, _Senor Padre_, already
I adore her!"And the
girl would reach the marriageable age of that country in all too short
a time."But, Juan," he remonstrated, "you are too young!And Carmen--why, she
is but a child!"But I am seventeen--and I will wait for her.Only say
now that she shall be mine when the time comes.Jose was deeply touched by the boy's earnest pleading.He put his arm
affectionately about the strong young shoulders."Wait, Juan, and see what develops.And, meanwhile, do you serve her, faithfully, as you see
Rosendo and me doing.""Padre," he exclaimed, "I am her
slave!"Jose went back to his work with Carmen with his thought full of
mingled conjecture and resolve.He had thus far outlined nothing for
the girl's future.Nor had he the faintest idea what the years might
bring forth.But he knew that, in a way, he was aiding in the
preparation of the child for something different from the dull, animal
existence with which she was at present surrounded, and that her path
in life must eventually lead far, far away from the shabby, crumbling
town which now constituted her material world.His task he felt to be
tremendous in the responsibility which it laid upon him.What had he
ever known of the manner of rearing children!He had previously given
the question of child-education but scant consideration, although he
had always held certain radical ideas regarding it; and some of these
he was putting to the test.But had his present work been forecast
while he lay sunken in despair on the river steamer, he would have
repudiated the prediction as a figment of the imagination.Yet the
gleam which flashed through his paralyzed brain that memorable day in
the old church, when Rosendo opened his full heart to him, had roused
him suddenly from his long and despondent lethargy, and worked a quick
and marvelous renovation in his wasted life.Following the lead of
this unusual child, he was now, though with many vicissitudes, slowly
passing out of his prison of egoism, and into the full, clear sunlight
of a world which he knew to be far less material than spiritual.With the awakening had come the almost frenzied desire to realize in
Carmen what he had failed to develop within himself; a vague hope that
she might fill the void which a lifetime of longing had expressed.A
tremendous opportunity now presented.Already the foundation had been
well laid--but not by earthly hands.His task was to build upon it;
and, as he did so, to learn himself.He had never before realized more
than faintly the awful power for good or evil which a parent wields
over a child.He had no more than the slightest conception of the
mighty problem of child-education.And now Carmen herself had shown
him that real education must be reared upon a foundation _wholly
spiritual_.Yet this, he knew, was just what the world's educators did
not do.He could see now how in the world the religious instinct of
the child is early quenched, smothered into complete or partial
extinction beneath the false tutelage of parents and teachers, to whom
years and adult stature are synonymous with wisdom, and who themselves
have learned to see the universe only through the opaque lenses of
matter and chance."If children were not falsely educated to know all manner of evil," he
mused, "what spiritual powers might they not develop in adult life,
powers that are as yet not even imagined!But their primitive
religious instinct is regarded by the worldly-wise parent as but a
part of the infant existence, which must soon give place to the more
solid and real beliefs and opinions which the world in general regards
as established and conventional, even though their end is death.And
so they teach their children to make evil real, even while admonishing
them to protect themselves against it and eventually so to rise as to
overcome it, little realizing that the carnal belief of the reality of
evil which a child is taught to accept permeates its pure thought like
an insidious poison, and becomes externalized in the conventional
routine existence of mind in matter, soul in body, a few brief years
of mingled good and evil, and then darkness--the end here certain; the
future life a vague, impossible conjecture."Jose determined that Carmen's education should be spiritual, largely
because he knew, constituted as she was, it could not well be
otherwise.And he resolved that from his teachings she should glean
nothing but happiness, naught but good.With his own past as a
continual warning, he vowed first that never should the mental germ of
fear be planted within this child's mind.He himself had cringed like
a coward before it all his desolate life.And so his conduct had been
consistently slavish, specious, and his thought stamped with the brand
of the counterfeit.He knew not how much longer he must struggle with
it.But he knew that, if he would progress, the warfare must go on,
until at length he should put it under his feet.His mind still bore
the almost ineradicable mold of the fear deeply graven into it by the
ignorant opinions, the worldly, material, unspiritual beliefs of his
dear but unwise parents.His life had been hedged with baleful shadows
because of it; and over every bright picture there hung its black
draping.As he looked back over the path along which he had come, he
could see every untoward event, every unhappiness and bitter
disappointment, as the externalization of fear in some form, the germ
of which had been early planted in the fertile soil of his plastic
brain.Without it he might have risen to towering heights.Under its
domination he had sunk until the swirling stream of life had eddied
him upon the desolate shores of Simiti.In the hands of the less
fearful he had been a puppet.In his own eyes he was a fear-shaped
manikin, the shadow of God's real man.The fear germ had multiplied
within him a billionfold, and in the abundant crop had yielded a
mental depression and deep-seated melancholy that had utterly stifled
his spirit and dried the marrow of his bones.But now Jose could draw from
them something salutary, something definite to shape and guide his
work with Carmen.She, at least, should not grow up the slave of
fearsome opinions and beliefs born of dense ignorance.Nor should the
baseless figments of puerile religious systems find lodgment within
her clear thought.The fear element, upon which so much of so-called
Christian belief has been reared, and the damnable suggestions of hell
and purgatory, of unpardonable sin and endless suffering, the
stock-in-trade of poet, priest and prelate up to and overlapping our
present brighter day, should remain forever a closed volume to this
child, a book as wildly imaginative and as unacceptable as the fabled
travels of Maundeville."I believe," he would murmur to himself, as he strolled alone in the
dusk beside the limpid lake, "that if I could plant myself firmly on
the Scriptural statement that God is love, that He is good; and if I
could regard Him as infinite mind, while at the same time striving to
recognize no reality, no intelligence or life in things material, I
could eventually triumph over the whole false concept, and rise out of
beliefs of sickness, discord, and death, into an unalterable
consciousness of good only."He had made a beginning when he strove to realize that man is not
separated from God; that God is not a far-off abstraction; and that
infinite mind is, as Carmen insisted, "everywhere.""It is only the five physical senses that tell us evil is real," he
reflected."Indeed, without their testimony we would be utterly
unconscious of evil!And I am convinced that their testimony is
specious, and that we see, hear, and feel only in thought, or in
belief.We think the sensations of seeing, hearing, and feeling come
to us through the medium of these senses as outward, fleshly
contrivances, which in some way communicate with the mind and bridge
the gulf between the material and the mental.In reality, we do but
see, hear and feel _our own thoughts_!The philosophers, many of them,
said as much centuries ago.But--the human mind has been
mesmerized, simply mesmerized!"These things he pondered day by day, and watched to see them wrought
out in the life of Carmen."Ah, yes," he would sometimes say, as
spiritual ideas unfolded to him, "you evolve beautiful theories, my
good Jose, and you say many brave things.But, when the day of
judgment comes, as it did when Juan brought you the news of the
revolution, then, alas!your theories fly to pieces, and you find
yourself very human, very material, and your God hidden behind the
distant clouds.When the test comes, you find you cannot prove your
beliefs."Yet the man did not often indulge in self-condemnation, for somehow he
knew his ideas were right.When he realized the character and specious
nature of evil, and realized, too, that "by thy words thou shalt be
justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned," he knew that the
stirring up of evil by good, and the shaking of the ancient
foundations of carnal belief within his mentality, might mean fiery
trials, still awaiting him.And yet, the crown was for him who should
overcome.The false opinions of mankind, the ignorant
beliefs in matter and evil.For what, after all, is responsible for
all the evil in this world of ours?"And if I keep my nose buried forever in matter, how can I hope to see
God, who is Spirit?And how can I follow the Christ unless I think as
he thought?"But it was in the classroom with Carmen that he always received his
greatest stimulus."See, Padre dear," she said one day, "if I erase a wrong figure and
then set down the right one instead, I get the right answer.And it is
just like that when we think.If we always put good thoughts in the
place of the bad ones, why, everything comes out right, doesn't it?""Of course, _chiquita_," he
replied."Only in your algebra you know which are the right figures to
put down.But how do you know which thoughts are right?"I can't make even the least mistake about the
thoughts.Why, it is easier to mistake with figures than it is with
thoughts.""Because, if you always think God _first_, you can never think wrong.And if you think of other things first you are almost
sure to think of the wrong thing, is it not so, Padre?"The priest had to admit the force of her statement."And, you know, Padre dear," the girl went on, "when I understand the
right rule in algebra, the answer just comes of itself.Well, it is so
with everything when we understand that God is the right rule--you
call Him principle, don't you?--well, when we know that He is the only
rule for everything, then the answers to all our problems just come of
themselves."Aye, thought Jose, the healing works of the great Master were only the
"signs following," the "answers" to the people's problems, the sure
evidence that Jesus understood the Christ-principle."And when you say that God is the right rule for everything, just what
do you mean, _chiquita_?""That He is everywhere," the girl replied."That He is infinite and omnipresent good, then?""He is good--and everywhere," the child repeated firmly."And the necessary corollary of that is, that there is no evil," Jose
added."I don't know what you mean by corollary, Padre dear.It's a big word,
isn't it?""I mean--I think I know how you would put it, little one--if God is
everywhere, then there is nothing bad.He saw that a fact can have no real opposite; that
any predicated opposite must be supposition.And evil is the
supposition; whereas good is the fact.The latter is "plus," and the
former "minus."No wonder the origin of evil has never been found,
although humanity has struggled with the problem for untold ages!He gave it the minus sign, the sign of
nothingness.The world has tried to make it positive, something.From
the false sense of evil as a reality has come the equally false sense
of man's estrangement from God, through some fictitious "fall"--a
curse, truly, upon the human intellect, but not of God's infliction.For false belief always curses with a reign of discord, which endures
until the belief becomes corrected by truth.From the beginning, the
human race has vainly sought to postulate an equal and opposite to
everything in the realm of both the spiritual and material.It has
been hypnotized, obsessed, blinded, by this false zeal.The resultant
belief in "dualism" has rendered hate the equal and opposite of Love,
evil the equal and opposite of Good, and discord the eternal opponent
of Harmony.To cope with evil as a reality is to render it immortal in
our consciousness.To know its unreality is to master it."Throughout life," Jose mused, "every positive has its negative, every
affirmation its denial.And, moreover,
the positive always dispels the negative, thus proving the specious
nature of the latter.Darkness flees before the light, and ignorance
dissolves in the morning rays of knowledge.The
positive alone bears the stamp of immortality.Carmen has but one
fundamental rule: _God is everywhere_.This gives her a sense of
immanent power, with which all things are possible."Thus with study and meditation the days flowed past, with scarcely a
ripple to break their quiet monotony.He
brought back at the end of his first month's labors on the newly
discovered deposit some ninety _pesos_ in gold.He had reached the
bedrock, and the deposit was yielding its maximum; but the yield would
continue for many months, he said.His exultation overleaped all
bounds, and it was with difficulty that Jose could bring him to a
consideration of the problems still confronting them."I think, Rosendo," said the priest, "that we will send, say, thirty
_pesos_ this month to Cartagena; the same next month; and then
increase the amount slightly.This method is sure to have a beneficial
effect upon the ecclesiastical authorities there.""And how will you send it, Padre?""We cannot send the gold direct to the
Bishop, for that would excite suspicion.Masses, you know, are not
paid for in gold dust and nuggets.Nor could we
get the gold exchanged for bills here in Simiti, even if we dared run
the risk of our discovery becoming known."For the Alcalde was already nosing about in an effort to ascertain the
source of the gold with which Rosendo had just cancelled his debt and
purchased further supplies.Jose now saw that, under existing
conditions, it would be utterly impossible for Rosendo to obtain
titles to mineral properties through Don Mario.He spent hours seeking
a solution of the involved problem.Then, just before Rosendo departed
again for the mountains, Jose called him into the parish house."Rosendo, I think I see a way.Bring me one of the paper boxes of
candles which you have just purchased from Don Mario."Padre," queried the surprised Rosendo, as he returned with
the box, "and what is this for?""I merely want to get the name of the firm which sold the candles.The
Empresa Alemania, Barranquilla.I have a method that
is roundabout, but certainly promises much.I will write to the firm,
appointing them my agents while I pose as Jose Rincon, miner.The
agency established, I will send them our gold each month, asking them
to return to me its equivalent in bills, deducting, of course, their
commission.Then I will send these bills, or such part as we deem
wise, to Wenceslas.Each month Juan, who will be sworn to secrecy,
will convey the gold to Bodega Central in time to meet Captain Julio's
boat.The captain will both deliver the gold to the Empresa Alemania,
and bring back the bills in exchange.Then, from Simiti, and in the
regular manner, I will send the small packet of bills to Wenceslas as
contributions from the parish.We thus throw Don Mario off the scent,
and arouse no suspicion in any quarter.As I receive mail matter at
various times, the Alcalde will not know but what I also receive
consignments of money from my own sources.And so, as it was arranged, it worked out.Juan reveled in the honor
of such intimate relations with the priest and Rosendo, and especially
in the thought that he was working in secret for the girl he adored.By the time Rosendo returned again from Guamoco, Jose had sent his
first consignment of money to the Bishop, carefully directing it to
Wenceslas, personally, and had received an acknowledgment in a letter
which caused him deep thought."To further stimulate the piety of your communicants," it read,
  "and arouse them to more generous contributions to our glorious
  cause, you will inform them that, if their monetary contributions
  do not diminish in amount for the coming year, they will be made
  participants in the four solemn Novenas which will be offered
  by His Grace, the Bishop of Cartagena.Moreover, if their
  contributions increase, the names of the various contributors will
  be included in the one hundred Masses which are to be offered
  in December at the Shrine of Our Lady of Chiquinquia for their
  spiritual and temporal welfare.Contributors will also have a High
  Mass after death, offered by one of His Grace's assistants, as
  soon as the notification of death is received here.In addition
  to these, His Grace, always mindful of the former importance of
  the parish of Simiti, and acknowledging as its special patron
  the ever blessed Virgin, has arranged to bestow the episcopal
  blessing upon an image of the Sacred Heart, which will be shipped
  to his faithful children in Simiti when the amount of their
  contributions shall have met the expense thereof.Let us keep ever
  in mind the pious words of the Bl.Margaret Mary, who has
  conveyed to us the assurance which she received directly from Our
  Blessed Lord that He finds great joy in beholding His Sacred
  Heart visibly represented, that it may touch the hard hearts
  of mankind.Our blessed Saviour promised the gracious Margaret
  Mary that He would pour out abundantly of His rich treasure upon
  all who honor this image, and that it shall draw down from heaven
  every blessing upon those who adore and reverence it.Inform your
  parishioners that the recital of the offering, 'O, Sacred Heart
  of Jesus, may it be everywhere adored!'carries a hundred days'
  indulgence each time."You will bear in mind that the General Intention for this month
  is The Conversion of America.Though our Church is founded on the
  Rock, and is to last forever, so that the gates of hell shall
  never prevail against her, nevertheless she has been called upon
  to withstand many assaults from her enemies, the advocates of
  _modernism_, in the land of liberal thought to our north.These
  assaults, though painful to her, can never be fatal to her
  spiritual life, although they unfortunately are so to many of her
  dear children, who yield to the insidious persuasions of the
  heretics who do the work of Satan among the Lord's sheep.New and
  fantastic religions are springing up like noxious weeds in America
  of the north, and increasing infidelity is apparent on every hand.The Christ prayed that there might be one fold and one shepherd.It is for us this month to pray for the great day when they will
  be accomplished.But we must be united over the interests of the
  Sacred Heart.Therefore, liberal plenary indulgences will be
  granted to those of the faithful who contribute to this glorious
  cause, so dear to the heart of the blessed Saviour.We enclose
  leaflets indicating the three degrees, consisting of the Morning
  Offering, Our Father and ten Hail Marys daily, for the Pope and
  his interests, and the degree of reparation, by which a plenary
  indulgence may be gained."Stimulate your parishioners to compete joyfully for the statue of
  the Blessed Virgin, which we mentioned to you in our former
  communication.Teach them, especially, their entire dependence on
  Mary, on her prayers to God for their deliverance and welfare.Reveal to them her singularly powerful influence in the shaping of
  all great historical events of the world; how never has she
  refused our prayers to exert her mighty influence with her
  all-potent Son, when she has been appealed to in sincerity, for it
  rejoices the Sacred Heart of Jesus to yield to the requests of His
  Blessed Mother.Mary is omnipotent, for she can ask no favor of
  her Son that He will not grant.Competition for possession of this
  sacred image, which carries the potent blessing of His Holiness,
  should be regarded a privilege, and you will so impress it upon
  the minds of your parishioners."Finally, His Grace requests that you will immediately procure
  whatever information you may regarding the mineral resources of
  the district of Guamoco, and indicate upon a sketch the location
  of its various mines, old or new, as known to its inhabitants.Diligent and careful inquiry made by yourself among the people of
  the district will reveal many hidden facts regarding its
  resources, which should be made known to His Grace at the earliest
  possible moment, in view of the active preparations now in
  progress to forestall the precipitation of another political
  uprising with its consequent strain upon our Holy Church.""One would think the Christ had
established his Church solely for gold!"He folded the letter and looked out through the rear door to where
Carmen sat, teaching Cucumbra a new trick.He realized then that never
before had he been so far from the Holy Catholic faith as at that
moment.he muttered, as his eyes rested upon the child."If the
Church should get possession of Carmen, what would it do with her?Would it not set its forces to work to teach her that evil is a
reality--that it is as powerful as good--that God formed man and the
universe out of dust--that Jesus came down from a starry heaven that
he might die to appease the wrath of a man-like Father--that Mary
pleads with the Lord and Jesus, and by her powerful logic induces them
to spare mankind and grant their foolish desires--all the dribble and
rubbish of outlandish theology that has accumulated around the nucleus
of pure Christianity like a gathering snowball throughout the ages!To
make the great States up north dominantly Catholic, Rome must--simply
_must_--have the children to educate, that she may saturate their
absorbent minds with these puerile, undemonstrable, pagan beliefs
before the child has developed its own independent thought.How wise
is she--God, how worldly wise and cunning!And I still her priest--"

Carmen came bounding in, followed pellmell by Cucumbra.Cantar-las-horas
stalked dignifiedly after her, and stopped at the threshold, where he
stood with cocked head and blinking eyes, wondering what move his
animated young mistress would make next.she exclaimed, "the sun is down, and it is time for our
walk!"She seized his hand and drew him out into the road.The play of her
expression as she looked up and laughed into his face was like the
dance of sunbeams on moving water.They turned down the narrow street
which led to the lake.As was her wont, in every object about her, in
every trifling event, the child discovered rich treasures of
happiness.The pebbles which she tossed with her bare toes were mines
of delight.The pigs, which turned up their snouts expectantly as she
stooped to scratch their dusty backs--the matronly hens that followed
clucking after her--the black babies that toddled out to greet the
_Cura_--all yielded a wealth of delight and interest.She seemed to
Jose to uncover joy by a means not unlike the divining rod, which
points to hidden gold where to the eye there is naught but barren
ground.Near the margin of the lake they stopped at the door of a cottage,
where they were awaited by the matron who displayed a finger wrapped
in a bit of cloth."_Senor Padre_," she said, "this morning I had the misfortune to cut
my finger while peeling yuccas, and I am not sure whether a piece of
the skin went into the pot or not._Bueno_, the yuccas are all cooked;
and now my man says he will not eat them, for this is Friday, and
there may be meat with the yuccas.Was it wicked to
cook the yuccas, not knowing if a bit of the skin from my finger had
fallen into the pot?"Jose stood dumfounded before such ignorant credulity.Then he shook
his head and replied sadly, "No, senora, it was not wicked.Tell your
man he may eat the yuccas."The woman's face brightened, and she hastened into the house to
apprise her spouse of the _Cura's_ decision."Two thousand years of
Christianity, and still the world knows not what Jesus taught!""But you told me he had good thoughts, Padre dear," said the little
voice at his side, as he walked slowly away with bended head."Because, Padre, if he had good thoughts, he thought about God--didn't
he?And if he thought about God, he always thought of something good.And if we always think about good--well, isn't that enough?"She almost invariably framed her
replies with an interrogation, and, whether he would or not, he must
perforce give answers which he knew in his heart were right, and yet
which the sight of his eyes all too frequently denied."Padre, you are not thinking about God now--are you?""Well--perhaps you are thinking _about_ Him; but you are not thinking
_with_ Him--are you?--the way He thinks.You know, He sends us His
thoughts, and we have to pick them out from all the others that aren't
His, and then think them.If the senora and her man had been thinking
God's thoughts, they wouldn't have been afraid to eat a piece of meat
on Friday--would they?"Cucumbra, forgetting his many months of instruction, suddenly yielded
to the goad of animal instinct and started along the beach in mad
pursuit of a squealing pig.As Jose watched
her lithe, active little body bobbing over the shales behind the
flying animals, she seemed to him like an animated sunbeam sporting
among the shadows."Why should life," he murmured aloud, "beginning in radiance, proceed
in ever deepening gloom, and end at last in black night?Why, but for
the false education in evil which is inflicted upon us!The joys, the
unbounded bliss of childhood, do indeed gush from its innocence--its
innocence of the blighting belief in mixed good and evil--innocence of
the false beliefs, the undemonstrable opinions, the mad worldly
ambitions, the carnal lust, bloated pride, and black ignorance of men!It all comes from not knowing God, to know whom is life eternal!The
struggle and mad strife of man--what does it all amount to, when 'in
the end he shall be a fool'?Do we in this latest of the centuries,
with all our boasted progress in knowledge, really know so much, after
all?"Come, Padre," cried Carmen, returning to him, "we are going to just
try now to have all the nice thoughts we can.Let's just look all
around us and see if we can't think good thoughts about everything.And, do you know, Padre dear, I've tried it, and when I look at things
and something tries to make me see if there could possibly be anything
bad about them--why, I find there can't!Try it, and see for
yourself."He knew that the minds of men are so profaned by
constantly looking at evil that their thoughts are tinged with it.But in doing so he was combating a habit
grown mighty by years of indulgence."When you always think good about a thing," the girl went on, "you
never can tell what it will do.If things look bad, I just say, 'Why look,
here's something trying to tell me that two and two are seven!'"Your purity and goodness resist evil involuntarily, little one," said
Jose, more to himself than to the child."Why, Padre, what big words!""No, little one, it is just the meaning of the words that is big," he
replied.Then:

"Padre dear, I never thought of it before--but it is true: we don't
see the meaning of words with the same eyes that we see trees and
stones and people, do we?""I don't quite understand what you mean,
_chiquita_," he was finally forced to answer."Well," she resumed, "the meaning of a word isn't something that we
can pick up, like a stone; or see, as we see the lake out there.""No, Carmen, the meaning is spiritual--mental; it is not physically
tangible.It is not seen with the fleshly eyes.""The meaning of a word is the inside of it, isn't it?""Yes, it is the inside, the soul, of the word.""And we don't see the word, either, do we?"She shook her brown curls
in vigorous negation."No, little one, we see only written or printed symbols; or hear only
sounds that convey to us the words."But, Padre dear," she
continued, "the inside, or soul, of everything is mental.The things we think we see are only symbols."Padre, they don't stand for anything!""Padre, the real things are the things we don't see.And the things we
think we see are not real at all!"Jose had ere this learned not to deny her rugged statements, but to
study them for their inner meaning, which the child often found too
deep for her limited vocabulary to express."The things we think we see," he said, though he was addressing his
own thought, "are called the physical.The things we do not see or
cognize with the physical senses are called mental, or spiritual.he queried, looking down again into the serious little face."Padre, the very greatest things are those that we don't see at all!"Love, life, joy, knowledge, wisdom, health,
harmony--all these are spiritual ideas.The physical sometimes
manifests them--and sometimes does not.And in the end, called death,
it ceases altogether to manifest them.""But--these things--the very greatest things there are--are the souls
of everything--is it not so, Padre dear?""It must be, _chiquita_.""And all these things came from God, and He is everywhere, and so He
is the soul of everything, no?""Padre--don't you see it?--we are not seeing things all around us!We
don't see real things that we call trees and stones and people!We see
only what we _think_ we see.We see things that are not there at all!We see--"

"Yes, we see only our thoughts.And we think we see them as objects
all about us, as trees, and houses, and people.But in the final
analysis we see only thoughts," he finished."But these thoughts do not come from God," she insisted."No," he replied slowly, "because they often manifest discord and
error.I think I grasp what is struggling in your mind _chiquita_.God
is--"

"Everywhere," she interrupted."He is everywhere, and therefore He is the soul--the inside--the heart
and core--of everything.He is mind, and His thoughts are real, and
are the only real thoughts there are.But, in reality, truth cannot have an opposite.And so the thought that we seem to
see externalized all about us, and that we call physical objects, is
supposition only.And, a supposition being unreal, the whole physical
universe, including material man, is unreal--is a supposition, a
supposition of mixed good and evil, for it manifests both.And, since a lie has no real existence, this human
concept of a universe and mankind composed of matter is utterly
unreal, an image of thought, an illusion, existing in false thought
only--a belief--a supposition pure and simple!"As he talked he grew more and more animated.He seemed to forget the
presence of the child, and appeared to be addressing only his own
insistent questionings.They walked along together in silence for some moments.Then the girl
again took up the conversation."Padre," she said, "you know, you taught me to prove my problems in
arithmetic and algebra.Well, I have proved something about thinking,
too.If I think a thing, and just keep thinking it, pretty soon I see
it--in some way--outside of me."A light seemed to flash through Jose's mental chambers, and he
recalled the words of the explorer in Cartagena.Yes, that was exactly
what he had said--"every thought that comes into the mind tends to
become _externalized_, either upon the body as a physical condition,
or in the environment, or as an event, good or bad."It was a law,
dimly perceived, but nevertheless sufficiently understood in its
workings to indicate a tremendous field as yet all but unknown.The
explorer had called it the law of the externalization of thought."As
a man thinketh in his heart, so is he," said the Master, twenty
centuries before.Had his own wrong thinking, or the
wrong thought of others, been the cause of his unhappiness and acute
mental suffering?What difference whether it
be called his, or the Archbishop's, or whose?Let it suffice that it
was false thought, undirected by the Christ-principle, God, that had
been externalized in the wreckage which he now called his past life.He again stood face to face with the most momentous question ever
propounded by a waiting world: the question of causation.And he knew
now that causation was wholly spiritual."Padre dear, you said just now that God was mind.But, if that is
true, there is only one mind, for God is everywhere.""It must be so, _chiquita_," dreamily responded the priest."Then He is your mind and my mind, is it not so?""Yes--"

"Then, if He is my mind, there just isn't anything good that I can't
do."Twilight does not linger in the tropics, and already the shadows that
stole down through the valley had wrapped the man and child in their
mystic folds."Padre, if God is my mind, He will do my thinking for me.And all I
have to do is to keep the door open and let His thoughts come in."Her sweet voice lingered on the still night air.There was a pensive
gladness in the man's heart as he tightly held her little hand and led
her to Rosendo's door.CHAPTER 18


The next morning Jose read to Rosendo portions of the communication
from Wenceslas."Chiquinquia," commented the latter."I remember that Padre Diego
collected much money from our people for Masses to be said at that
shrine.""Why, there
is not a shrine in the whole of Colombia that works so many cures as
this one.Your grandfather, Don Ignacio, knew the place.And it was
from him that my--that is, I learned the legend when I was only a boy.It is said that a poor, sick young girl in the little Indian village
of Chiquinquia, north of Bogota, stood praying in her shabby little
cottage before an old, torn picture of the blessed Virgin."Then he resumed:

"_Bueno_, while the girl prayed, the picture suddenly rose up in the
air; the torn places all closed; the faded colors came again as fresh
as ever; and the girl was cured of her affliction.The people of the
village immediately built a shrine, over which they hung the picture;
and ever since then the most wonderful miracles have been performed by
it there.""You don't believe that, do you, Rosendo?"Did
not Don Felipe go there when the doctor in Mompox told him the little
white spot on his hand was leprosy?Jose started as if he had received a blow.He looked
furtively at the scar on his own hand, the hand which the leper in
Maganguey had lacerated that dreadful night, and which often burned
and ached as if seared by a hot iron.He had never dared to voice the
carking fear that tightened about his heart at times.But often in the
depths of night, when dread anticipation sat like a spectre upon his
bed, he had risen and gone out into the darkness to wrestle with his
black thoughts.All the gladness and joy left his heart, and
a pall of darkness settled over his thought.He turned back into his
cottage and tried to find forgetfulness in the simple duties that lay
at hand."Why is it," he asked himself, as he sat wearily down at his little
table, "that I always think of evil first; while Carmen's first
thought is invariably of God?"He looked at the ugly scar on his hand.What thought was externalized
in the loathsome experience which produced that?Was it
the summation of all the fear, the weakness, the wrong belief, that
had filled his previous years?And now why was he finding it so
difficult to practice what Carmen lived, even though he knew it was
truth?he murmured aloud, "it was the seminary that did it.For there
my thought was educated away from the simple teachings of Jesus.To
Carmen there is no mystery in godliness.Though she knows utterly
nothing about Jesus, yet she hourly uses the Christ-principle.It is
the children who grasp the simple truths of God; while the lack of
spirituality which results from increasing years shrinks maturer minds
until they no longer afford entrance to it.For godliness is broad;
and the mind that receives it must be opened wide."As he sat with his bowed head clasped in his hands, a sweet, airy
voice greeted him."Why, Padre dear--ah, I caught you that time!--you were thinking that
two and two are seven, weren't you?"She shook a rebuking finger at
him.Framed in the doorway like an old masterpiece, the sunlight bronzing
her heavy brown curls, the olive-tinted skin of her bare arms and legs
flushing with health, and her cheap calico gown held tightly about
her, showing the contour of her full and shapely figure, the girl
appeared to Jose like a vision from the realm of enchantment.And he
knew that she did dwell in the land of spiritual enchantment, where
happiness is not at the mercy of physical sense."He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord
require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk
humbly with thy God?""The Lord our God is a right-thinking God, and right-thinking is what
He desires in His people."Jose thought of this as he looked at Carmen.This barefoot girl, who
walked humbly, trustingly, with her God, had she not supplied him with
a working formula for his every problem, even to the casting out of
the corroding fear planted in his heart by that awful experience in
Maganguey?Though he had suffered much, yet much had been done for
him.The brusque logic of the explorer had swept his mind clear of its
last vestige of theological superstition, and prepared it for the
truth which, under the benign stimulus of this clear-minded child,
would remake his life, if he could now yield himself utterly to it.He
must--he would--ceaselessly strive, even though he fell daily, to make
his life a pattern of hers, wherein there was no knowledge of evil!The girl came to the priest and leaned fondly against him.Then a
little sigh escaped her lips, as she looked down into his face with
pitying affection."Padre dear," she said, in a tone that echoed a strain of sadness,
"I--I don't believe--you love God very much."The man was startled, and resentment began to well in his heart."What
a thing to say, Carmen!"The girl looked up at him with great, wondering eyes."But, Padre,"
she protested, "were you not thinking of things that are not true when
I came in?""No--I was--I was thinking of the future--of--well, _chiquita_, I was
thinking of something that might happen some day, that is all."He
stumbled through it with difficulty, for he knew he must not lie to
the child.Would she ever trust him again if he did?"And, Padre, were you afraid?"Yes, _chiquita_, I was."Carmen looked at him reproachfully."Then, Padre, I was right--for, if
you loved God, you would trust Him--and then you couldn't be afraid of
anything--could you?"Ah, child," he murmured, "you will find that
out in the world people don't love God in this day and generation.At
least they don't love Him that way.""They don't love Him enough to trust him?""Nobody trusts Him, not even the
preachers themselves.When things happen, they rush for a doctor, or
some other human being to help them out of their difficulty.They
don't turn to Him any more.she asked slowly, her voice sinking to a
whisper.Then:

"What made them forget Him, Padre?""I guess, _chiquita_, they turned from Him because He didn't answer
their prayers.You mean--"

"I asked Him for things--to help me out of trouble--I asked Him to
give me--"

"Why, Padre!What are you
trying to tell me, child?""Why, He is everywhere, and He is right here all the time.And so
there couldn't be any real trouble for Him to help you out of; and He
couldn't give you anything, for He has already done that, long ago.We
are in Him, don't you know?And so when you asked Him for things it showed that you didn't believe
He had already given them to you.And--you know what you said last
night about thinking, and that when we think things, we see them?Well, He has given you everything; but you thought He hadn't, and so
you saw it that way--isn't it so?"But
before he could reply she resumed:

"Padre dear, you know you told me that Jesus was the best man that
ever lived, and that it was because he never had a bad thought--isn't
that so?""Well, did he pray--did he ask God for things?"Why, he was always praying--the New Testament is full of
it!"Acting on a sudden impulse, he rose and went into the sleeping room
to get his Bible.Sandra travelled to the hallway.The child's face took on an expression of
disappointment as she heard his words.Her brow knotted, and a
troubled look came into her brown eyes.Jose returned with his Bible and seated himself again at the table.Opening the book, his eyes fell upon a verse of Mark's Gospel.He
stopped to read it; and then read it again.Suddenly he looked up at
the waiting girl.He read the verse again; then he scanned the child
closely, as if he would read a mystery hidden within her bodily
presence.Abruptly he turned to the book and read aloud:

"'Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye
pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.'"The girl drew a long breath, almost a sigh, as if a weight had been
removed from her mind."Yes--at least it is so reported here," he answered absently."Well--_he_ knew, didn't he?""Why, Padre, he told the people to know--just _know_--that they
already had everything--that God had given them everything good--and
that if they would _know_ it, they would see it."Yes; or rather, the externalization of
truth.Jose fell into abstraction, his eyes glued to the page.There
it stood--the words almost shouted it at him!And there it had stood
for nearly two thousand years, while priest and prelate, scribe and
commentator had gone over it again and again through the ages, without
even guessing its true meaning--without even the remotest idea of the
infinite riches it held for mankind!He turned reflectively to Matthew; and then to John.He remembered the
passages well--in the past he had spent hours of mortal agony poring
over them and wondering bitterly why God had failed to keep the
promises they contain."And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye
shall receive."All things--when ye ask _believing_!But that Greek word surely held
vastly more than the translators have drawn from it.Nay, not
believing only, but _understanding_ the allness of God as good, and
the consequent nothingness of evil, all that seems to oppose Him!How
could the translators have so completely missed the mark!And
Carmen--had never seen a Bible until he came into her life; yet she
knew, knew instinctively, that a good God who was "everywhere" could
not possibly withhold anything good from His children.It was the
simplest kind of logic.But, thought Jose again, if the promises are kept, why have we fallen
so woefully short of their realization?Then he read again, "If ye
abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and
it shall be done unto you."The promise carries a condition--abiding
in his words--obeying his commands--keeping the very _first_
Commandment, which is that "Ye shall have no other gods before me"--no
gods of evil, sickness, chance, or death.The promises are fulfilled
only on the condition of righteousness--right-thinking about God and
His infinite, spiritual manifestation."_Chiquita_," he said tenderly, "you never ask
God to give you things, do you?""Why, no, Padre; why should I?He gives me everything I need, doesn't
He?""Yes--when you go out to the shales, you--"

"I don't ask Him for things, Padre dear.I just tell Him I _know_ He
is everywhere.""I see--yes, you told me that long ago--I understand, _chiquita_."His spirit bowed in humble reverence before such divine faith.This
untutored, unlearned girl, isolated upon these burning shales, far,
far from the haunts of men of pride and power and worldly lore--this
barefoot child whose coffers held of material riches scarce more than
the little calico dress upon her back--this lowly being knew that
which all the fabled wealth of Ind could never buy!Her prayers were
not the selfish pleadings that spring from narrow souls, the souls
that "ask amiss"--not the frenzied yearnings wrung from suffering,
ignorant hearts--nor were they the inflated instructions addressed
to the Almighty by a smug, complacent clergy, the self-constituted
press-bureau of infinite Wisdom.Her prayers, which so often drifted
like sweetest incense about those steaming shales, were not
petitions, but _affirmations_.She simply _knew_ that He had already met her needs.And that righteousness--right-thinking--became externalized in her
consciousness in the good she sought.Jesus did the same thing, over
and over again; but the poor, stupid minds of the people were so
full of wrong beliefs about his infinite Father that they could not
understand, no, not even when he called Lazarus from the tomb."Ask in my name," urged the patient Jesus.But the poor fishermen
thought he meant his human name to be a talisman, a sort of "Open
Sesame," when he was striving all the time, by precept and deed, to
show them that they must ask in his _character_, must be like him, to
whom, though of himself he could do nothing, yet all things were
possible.Jose's heart began to echo the Master's words: "Father, I thank Thee
that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
revealed them unto babes."He put his arm about Carmen and drew her to
him."Little one," he murmured, "how much has happened in these past few
weeks!"Carmen looked up at him with an enigmatical glance and laughed."Well,
Padre dear, I don't think anything ever really _happens_, do you?""Mistakes happen, as in solving my algebra problems.But good things
never happen, any more than the answers to my problems happen.You
know, there are rules for getting the answers; but there are no rules
for making mistakes--are there?But when anything comes out according
to the rule, it doesn't happen.And the mistakes, which have no rules,
are not real--the answers are real, but the mistakes are not--and so
nothing ever really happens."Surely, I see," he acquiesced.Then, while he held the girl close to
him, he reflected: Good is never fortuitous.It results from the
application of the Principle of all things.The answer to a
mathematical problem is a form of good, and it results from the
application of the principle of mathematics.Mistakes, and the various
things which "happen" when we solve mathematical problems, do not have
rules, or principles.They result from ignorance of them, or their
misapplication.And so in life; for chance, fate, luck, accident and
the merely casual, come, not from the application of principles, but
from not applying them, or from ignorance of their use.The human mind
or consciousness, which is a mental activity, an activity of thought,
is concerned with mixed thoughts of good and evil.But _it operates
without any principle whatsoever_.For, if God is infinite good, then
the beliefs of evil which the human mind holds must be false beliefs,
illusions, suppositions.A supposition has no principle, no rule.And
so, it is only the unreal that happens.And even that sort of
"happening" can be prevented by knowing and using the principle of all
good, God.A knowledge of evil is not knowledge at all.But we are neglecting our work," he
hastily added, as he roused himself."What are the lessons for to-day?And arranging his papers, and bidding
Carmen draw up to the table, he began the morning session of his very
select little school.*       *       *       *       *

More than six months had elapsed since Jose first set foot upon the
hot shales of Simiti.In that time his mentality had been turned over
like a fallow field beneath the plowshare.After peace had been
established in the country he had often thought to consecrate himself
to the task of collecting the fragmentary ideas which had been evolved
in his mind during these past weeks of strange and almost weird
experience, and trying to formulate them into definite statements of
truth.Then he would enter upon the task of establishing them by
actual demonstration, regardless of the years that might be required
to do so.He realized now that the explorer had done a great work in
clearing his mind of many of its darker shadows.But it was to
Carmen's purer, more spiritual influence that he knew his debt was
heaviest.Let it not seem strange that mature manhood and extensive travel had
never before brought to this man's mind the truths, many of which have
been current almost since the curtain first arose on the melodrama
of mundane existence.Well nigh impassable limitations had been
set to them by his own natal characteristics; by his acutely morbid
sense of filial love which bound him, at whatever cost, to observe
the bigoted, selfish wishes of his parents; and by the strictness
with which his mind had been hedged about both in the seminary and
in the ecclesiastical office where he subsequently labored.The
first rays of mental freedom did not dawn upon his darkened thought
until he was sent as an outcast to the New World.Then, when his
greater latitude in Cartagena, and his still more expanded sense of
freedom in Simiti, had lowered the bars, there had rushed into his
mentality such a flood of ideas that he was all but swept away in the
swirling current.It is not strange that he rose and fell, to-day strong in the
conviction of the immanence of infinite good, to-morrow sunken in
mortal despair of ever demonstrating the truth of the ideas which were
swelling his shrunken mind.His line of progress in truth was an
undulating curve, slowly advancing toward the distant goal to which
Carmen seemed to move in a straight, undeviating line.What though
Emerson had said that Mind was "the only reality of which men and all
other natures are better or worse reflectors"?Jose was unaware of the
sage's mighty deduction.What though Plato had said that we move as
shadows in a world of ideas?Even if Jose had known of it, it had
meant nothing to him.What though the Transcendentalists called the
universe "a metaphore of the human mind"?Jose's thought was too
firmly clutched by his self-centered, material beliefs to grasp it.Doubt of the reality of things material succumbed to the evidence of
the physical senses and the ridicule of his seminary preceptors.True,
he believed with Paul, that the "things that are seen are temporal;
the things that are unseen, are eternal."But this pregnant utterance
conveyed nothing more to him than a belief of a material heaven to
follow his exit from a world of matter.It had never occurred to him
that the world of matter might be the product of those same delusive
physical senses, through which he believed he gained his knowledge of
it.It is true that while in the seminary, and before, he had insisted
upon a more spiritual interpretation of the mission of Jesus--had
insisted that Christian priests should obey the Master's injunction,
and heal the sick as well as preach the gospel.But with the advent of
the troubles which filled the intervening years, these things had
gradually faded; and the mounting sun that dawned upon him six months
before, as he lay on the damp floor of his little cell in the
ecclesiastical dormitory in Cartagena, awaiting the Bishop's summons,
illumined only a shell, in which agnosticism sat enthroned upon a
stool of black despair.And her beautiful love, which enfolded
him like a garment, and her sublime faith, which moved before him like
the Bethlehem star to where the Christ-principle lay, were, little by
little, dissolving the mist and revealing the majesty of the great
God.In assuming to teach the child, Jose early found that the outer world
meant nothing to her until he had purged it of its carnal elements.Often in days past, when he had launched out upon the dramatic recital
of some important historical event, wherein crime and bloodshed had
shaped the incident, the girl would start hastily from her chair and
put her little hand over his mouth."God didn't do
it, and it isn't so!"And thereby he learned to differentiate more closely between those
historical events which sprang from good motives, and those which
manifested only human passion, selfish ambition, and the primitive
question, "Who shall be greatest?"Moreover, he had found it best in
his frequent talks to the people in the church during the week to omit
all reference to the evil methods of mankind in their dealings one
with another, and to pass over in silence the criminal aims and low
motives, and their externalization, which have marked the unfolding of
the human mind, and which the world preserves in its annals as
historical fact.The child seemed to divine the great truth that
history is but the record of human conduct, conduct manifesting the
mortal mind of man, a mind utterly opposed to the mind that is God,
and therefore unreal, supposititious, and bearing the "minus" sign.Carmen would have none of it that did not reflect good.She refused
utterly to turn her mental gaze toward recorded evil."Padre," she once protested, "when I want to see the sun rise, I don't
look toward the west.And if you want to see the good come up, why do
you look at these stories of bad men and their bad thoughts?"Jose admitted that they were records of the mortal mind--and the mind
that is mortal is _no_ mind."I am learning," he frequently said to himself, after Carmen had left
at the close of their day's work."But my real education did not
commence until I began to see, even though faintly, that the Creator
is mind and infinite good, and that there is nothing real to the
belief in evil; that the five physical senses give us _no_ testimony
of any nature whatsoever; and that real man never could, never did,
fall."Thus the days glided swiftly past, and Jose completed his first year
amid the drowsy influences of this little town, slumbering peacefully
in its sequestered nook at the feet of the green _Cordilleras_.No
further event ruffled its archaic civilization; and only with rare
frequency did fugitive bits of news steal in from the outer world,
which, to the untraveled thought of this primitive folk, remained
always a realm vague and mysterious.Quietly the people followed the
routine of their colorless existence.Each morn broke softly over the
limpid lake; each evening left the blush of its roseate sunset on the
glassy waters; each night wound its velvety arms gently about the
nodding town, while the stars beamed like jewels through the clear,
soft atmosphere above, or the yellow moonbeams stole noiselessly down
the old, sunken trail to dream on the lake's invisible waves.Each month, with unvarying regularity, Rosendo came and went.At times
Jose thought he detected traces of weariness, insidious and
persistently lurking, in the old man's demeanor.At times his limbs
trembled, and his step seemed heavy.Once Jose had found him, seated
back of his cottage, rubbing the knotted muscles of his legs, and
groaning aloud.But when he became aware of Jose presence, the groans
ceased, and the old man sprang to his feet with a look of such grim
determination written across his face that the priest smothered his
apprehensions and forbore to speak.Rosendo was immolating himself
upon his love for the child.Jose knew it; but he would not, if he
could, prevent the sacrifice.Each month their contributions were sent to Cartagena; and as
regularly came a message from Wenceslas, admonishing them to greater
efforts.With the money that was sent to the Bishop went also a
smaller packet to the two women who were caring for the unfortunate
Maria's little babe.The sources of Jose's remittances to Cartagena
were never questioned by Wenceslas.But Simiti slowly awakened to the
mysterious monthly trips of Rosendo; and Don Mario's suspicion became
conviction.He bribed men to follow Rosendo secretly.They came back,
footsore and angry.Rosendo had thrown them completely off the scent.Then Don Mario outfitted and sent his paid emissary after the old man.He wasted two full months in vain search along the Guamoco trail.But
the fever came upon him, and he refused to continue the hunt.The
Alcalde counted the cost, then loudly cursed himself and Rosendo for
the many good _pesos_ so ruthlessly squandered.Then he began to ply
Jose and Rosendo with skillfully framed questions.He worried the
citizens of the village with his suggestions.Finally he bethought
himself to apprise the Bishop of his suspicions.But second
consideration disclosed that plan as likely to yield him nothing but
loss.He knew Rosendo was getting gold from some source.But, too, he
was driving a good trade with the old man on supplies.He settled back
upon his fat haunches at last, determined to keep his own counsel and
let well-enough alone for the present, while he awaited events.Rosendo's vivid interest in Carmen's progress was almost pathetic.When in Simiti he hung over the child in rapt absorption as she worked
out her problems, or recited her lessons to Jose.Often he shook his
head in witness of his utter lack of comprehension.But Carmen
understood, and that sufficed.His admiration for the priest's
learning was deep and reverential.He was a silent worshiper, this
great-hearted man, at the shrine of intellect; but, alas!he himself
knew only the rudiments, which he had acquired by years of patient,
struggling effort, through long days and nights filled with toil.His
particular passion was his Castilian mother-tongue; and the precision
with which he at times used it, his careful selection of words, and
his wide vocabulary, occasioned Jose no little astonishment.One day,
after returning from the hills, he approached Jose as the latter was
hearing Carmen's lessons, and, with considerable embarrassment,
offered him a bit of paper on which were written in his ample hand
several verses.Jose read them, and then looked up wonderingly at the
old man."Why, Rosendo, these are beautiful!"I--they are mine, Padre," replied Rosendo, his face glowing with
pleasure.Nights, up in Guamoco, when I had finished my work, and
when I was so lonely, I would sometimes light my candle and try to
write out the thoughts that came to me."He turned his head, that Rosendo
might not see them.Of the three little poems, two were indited to the
Virgin Mary, and one to Carmen.He lingered over one of the verses of
the latter, for it awoke responsive echoes in his own soul:

       "Without you, the world--a desert of sadness;
           But with you, sweet child--a vale of delight;
       You laugh, like the sunbeam--my gloom becomes gladness;
           You sing--from my heart flee the shadows of night.""I--I have written a good deal of poetry during my life, Padre.I will
show you some of it, if you wish," Rosendo advanced, encouraged by
Jose's approbation."And to think,
without instruction, without training!"Yes, Padre, when I think of the blessed Virgin or the little Carmen,
my thoughts seem to come in poetry."He stooped over the girl and
kissed her.The child reached up and clasped her arms about his black
neck."Padre Rosendo," she said sweetly, "you are a poem, a big one, a
beautiful one.""Aye," seconded Jose, and there was a hitch in his voice, "you are an
epic--and the world is the poorer that it cannot read you!"But, though showing such laudable curiosity regarding the elements
which entered into their simple life in Simiti, Rosendo seldom spoke
of matters pertaining to religion.Yet Jose knew that the old faith
held him, and that he would never, on this plane of existence, break
away from it.He clung to his _escapulario_; he prostrated himself
before the statue of the Virgin; he invoked the aid of Virgin and
Saints when in distress; and, unlike most of the male inhabitants of
the town, he scrupulously prayed his rosary every night, whether at
home, or on the lonely margins of the Tigui.He had once said to Jose
that he was glad Padre Diego had baptised the little Carmen--he felt
safer to have it so.And yet he would not have her brought up in the
Holy Catholic faith.Let her choose or formulate her own religious
beliefs, they should not be influenced by him or others."You can never make me believe, Padre," he would sometimes say to the
priest, "that the little Carmen was not left by the angels on the
river bank.""You have Escolastico's
account, and the boat captain's."Even the blessed Saviour was born of a woman;
and yet he came from heaven.The angels brought him, guarded him as he
lay in the manger, protected him all his life, and then took him back
to heaven again.And I tell you, Padre, the angels brought Carmen, and
they are always with her!"Jose ceased to dispute the old man's contentions.For, had he been
pressed, he would have been forced to admit that there was in the
child's pure presence a haunting spell of mystery--perhaps the mystery
of godliness--but yet an undefinable _something_ that always made him
approach her with a feeling akin to awe.And in the calm, untroubled seclusion of Simiti, in its mediaeval
atmosphere of romance, and amid its ceaseless dreams of a stirring
past, the child unfolded a nature that bore the stamp of divinity, a
nature that communed incessantly with her God, and that read His name
in every trivial incident, in every stone and flower, in the sunbeams,
the stars, and the whispering breeze.In that ancient town, crumbling
into the final stages of decrepitude, she dwelt in heaven.To her, the
rude adobe huts were marble castles; the shabby rawhide chairs and
hard wooden beds were softest down; the coarse food was richer than a
king's spiced viands; and over it all she cast a mantle of love that
was rich enough, great enough, to transform with the grace of fresh
and heavenly beauty the ruins and squalor of her earthly environment."Can a child like Carmen live a sinless life, and still be human?"Jose often mused, as he watched her flitting through the sunlit hours.Ah, yes; but he was born of a virgin,
spotless herself.Jose
often wondered, wondered deeply, as he gazed at her absorbed in her
tasks.Might he not, in the absence of
definite knowledge, accept Rosendo's belief--accept it because of its
beautiful, haunting mystery--that she, too, was miraculously born of a
virgin, and "left by the angels on the river bank"?For, as far as he
might judge, her life was sinless.It was true, she did at rare
intervals display little outbursts of childish temper; she sometimes
forgot and spoke sharply to her few playmates, and even to Dona Maria;
and he had seen her cry for sheer vexation.And yet, these were but
tiny shadows that were cast at rarest intervals, melting quickly when
they came into the glorious sunlight of her radiant nature.But the mystery shrouding the child's parentage, however he might regard
it, often roused within his mind thoughts dark and apprehensive.Only one communication had come from Padre Diego, and that some four
months after his precipitous flight.He had gained the Guamoco trail,
it said, and finally arrived at Remedios.He purposed returning to
Banco ultimately; and, until then, must leave the little Carmen in the
care of those in whom he had immovable confidence, and to whom he
would some day try, however feebly, to repay in an appropriate manner
his infinite debt of gratitude."_Caramba!_" muttered Rosendo, on reading the note."Does the villain
think we are fools?"But none the less could the old man quiet the fear that haunted him,
nor still the apprehension that some day Diego would make capital of
his claim.What that claim might accomplish if laid before Wenceslas,
he shuddered to think.And so he kept the girl at his side when in
Simiti, and bound Jose and the faithful Juan to redoubled vigilance
when he was again obliged to return to the mountains.The care-free children of this tropic realm drowsed
through the long, hot days and gossiped and danced in the soft airs of
night.Rosendo held his unremitting, lonely vigil of toil in the
ghastly solitudes of Guamoco.Jose, exiled and outcast, clung
desperately to the child's hand, and strove to rise into the spiritual
consciousness in which she dwelt.And thus the year fell softly into
the yawning arms of the past and became a memory.Then one day Simiti awoke from its lethargy in terror, with the
spectre of pestilence stalking through her narrow streets.CHAPTER 19


Feliz Gomez, who had been sent to Bodega Central for merchandise which
Don Mario was awaiting from the coast, had collapsed as he stepped
from his boat on his return to Simiti.When he regained consciousness
he called wildly for the priest.he cried, when Jose arrived, "it is _la plaga_!Ah,
_Santisima Virgen_--I am dying!--dying!"He writhed in agony on the
ground.The priest bent over him, his heart throbbing with apprehension."Padre--" The lad strove to raise his head."The innkeeper at Bodega
Central--he told me I might sleep in an empty house back of the
inn._Dios mio!_ There was an old cot there--I slept on it two
nights--_Caramba!_ Padre, they told me then--Ah, _Bendita Virgen_!_Carisima Virgen_, don't let me die!_Ah,
Dios--!_"

His body twisted in convulsions.Jose lifted him and dragged him to
the nearby shed where the lad had been living alone.A terror-stricken
concourse gathered quickly about the doorway and peered in wide-eyed
horror through the narrow window."Feliz, what did they tell you?"cried Jose, laying the sufferer upon
the bed and chafing his cold hands."They told me--a Turk, bound for Zaragoza on the Nechi river--had
taken the wrong boat--in Maganguey.He had been sick--terribly sick
there._Ah, Dios!_ It is coming again, Padre--the pain!_Caramba!_
_Dios mio!_ Save me, Padre, save me!"cried Jose, turning to the stunned
people."Bring cloths--hot water--and send for Don Mario.Dona Lucia,
prepare an _olla_ of your herb tea at once!""Padre"--the boy had become quieter--"when the Turk learned that he
was on the wrong boat--he asked to be put off at the next town--which
was Bodega Central.The innkeeper put him in the empty house--and
he--_Dios_!he died--on that bed where I slept!""Padre, he died--the day before I arrived there--and--ah_, Santisima
Virgen_!they said--he died--of--of--_la colera_!"At the mention of the
disease a loud murmur arose from the people, and they fell back from
the shed."Padre!--_ah, Dios_, how I suffer!Give me the sacrament--I cannot
live--!Ah, Padre, shall I go--to heaven?He stood with eyes riveted in horror upon the
tormented lad."Padre"--the boy's voice grew weaker--"I fell sick that day--I started
for Simiti--I died a thousand times in the _cano_--_ah, caramba_!But,
Padre--promise to get me out of purgatory--I have no money for Masses._Caramba!_ I cannot stand it!Padre--quick--I have not
been very wicked--but I stole--_Dios_, how I suffer!--I stole two
pesos from the innkeeper at Bodega Central--he thought he lost
them--but I took them out of the drawer--Padre, pay him for me--then I
will not go to hell!_Dios!_"

Rosendo at that moment entered the house.cried Jose, turning upon him in wild apprehension."Keep away, for God's sake, keep away!"In sullen silence Rosendo disregarded the priest's frenzied appeal.His eyes widened when he saw the boy torn with convulsions, but he did
not flinch.Only when he saw Carmen approaching, attracted by the
great crowd, he hastily bade one of the women turn her back home.Hour after hour the poor sufferer tossed and writhed.Again and again
he lapsed into unconsciousness, from which he would emerge to
piteously beg the priest to save him."_ he pleaded,
extending his trembling arms to Jose, "can you do nothing?_Santisima Virgen_, how I suffer!"Then, when the evening shadows were gathering, the final convulsions
seized him and wrenched his poor soul loose.Jose and Rosendo were
alone with him when the end came.The people had early fled from the
stricken lad, and were gathering in little groups before their homes
and on the corners, discussing in low, strained tones the advent of
the scourge.Those who had been close to the sick boy were now cold
with fear.Women wept, and children clung whimpering to their skirts.The men talked excitedly in hoarse whispers, or lapsed into a state of
terrified dullness.Jose went from the death-bed to the Alcalde.Don Mario saw him coming,
and fled into the house, securing the door after him."For the love of the Virgin
do not come here!_Caramba!_"

"But, Don Mario, the lad is dead!"Come, you are the
Alcalde.Let us talk about--"

"_Caramba!_ Do what you want to!_Nombre de Dios!_ If
I live through the night I shall go to the mountains to-morrow!""But we must have a coffin to bury the lad!shrilled Don Mario, jumping up and
down in his excitement."Bury him in a blanket--anything--but keep
away from my house!"Jose turned sadly away and passed through the deserted streets back to
the lonely shed."_Bien, Padre_," he said
quietly, "we are exiled."I might carry the disease to the
senora and the little Carmen.And," he added, "you
too, Padre."he exclaimed, pointing
toward the bed."When it is dark, Padre," replied Rosendo, "we will take him out
through the back door and bury him beyond the shales._Hombre!_ I must
see now if I can find a shovel."Jose sank down upon the threshold, a prey to corroding despair, while
Rosendo went out in search of the implement.The streets were dead,
and few lights shone from the latticed windows.The pall of fear had
settled thick upon the stricken town.Those who were standing before
their houses as Rosendo approached hastily turned in and closed their
doors.Jose, in the presence of death in a terrible form, sat mute."No shovel, Padre," he announced."But I crept up back of my house and
got this bar which I had left standing there when I came back from the
mountains.I can scrape up the loose earth with my hands.He was but a tool in the hands of a man to whom
physical danger was but a matter of temperament.He absently helped
Rosendo wrap the black, distorted corpse in the frayed blanket; and
then together they passed out into the night with their grewsome
burden."Why not to the cemetery, Rosendo?"asked Jose, as the old man took an
opposite course."The cemetery is on shale, and I could
not dig through it in time.We must get the body under ground at once._Caramba!_ If we put it in one of the _bovedas_ in the cemetery the
buzzards will eat it and scatter the plague all over the town.The
_bovedas_ are broken, and have no longer any doors, you remember."So beyond the shales they went, stumbling through the darkness, their
minds freighted with a burden of apprehension more terrible than the
thing they bore in their arms.The shales crossed, Rosendo left the
trail, cutting a way through the bush with his _machete_ a distance of
several hundred feet.Then, by the weird yellow light of a single
candle, he opened the moist earth and laid the hideous, twisted thing
within."And now, Padre," said Rosendo, at length breaking the awful silence,
"where will you sleep to-night?I cannot let you go back to your
house.It is too near the senora and Carmen.No man in town will let
you stay in his house, since you have handled the plague.Will you
sleep in the shed where the lad died?I
called to the senora when I went after the bar, and she will lay two
blankets out in the _plaza_ for us.And in the morning she will put
food where we can get it.His mind had congealed with the horror of the
situation."Come, Padre," he said gently."The hill up back of the second church is high, and no one lives near.I will get the blankets and we will pass the night out there."Is it--_la
colera_?""_Quien sabe?_ Padre," returned Rosendo."There has been plague
here--these people, some of them, still remember it--but it was long
ago.There have been cases along the river--and brought, I doubt not,
by Turks, like this one.""And do you think that it is now all along the river?That Bodega
Central is being ravaged by the scourge?"_Quien sabe?_ Padre.All I do know is that the people of Simiti are
terribly frightened, and the pestilence may wipe away the town before
it leaves.""Nothing, Padre--but stay and meet it," the man replied quietly.Then Rosendo wrapped himself in one
of the blankets which he had picked up as he passed through the
_plaza_, and lay down upon the shale.The warm, sluggish air lay about him,
mephitic in its touch.The great vampire bats that soughed through it
symbolized the "pestilence that walketh in darkness."Lonely calls
drifted across the warm lake waters from the dripping jungle like the
hollow echoes of lost souls.Rosendo tossed fitfully, and now and then
uttered deep groans.He
struggled to his feet and paced gloomily back and forth along the brow
of the hill.The second church stood near, deserted, gloomy, no longer
a temple of God, but a charnel house of fear and black superstition.In the distance the ghostly white walls of the Rincon church glowed
faintly in the feeble light that dripped from the yellow stars.There
was now no thought of God--no thought of divine aid.Jose was riding
again the mountainous billows of fear and unbelief; nor did he look
for the Master to come to him through the thick night across the
heaving waters.The tardy dawn brought Dona Maria to the foot of the hill, where she
deposited food, and held distant converse with the exiles.Don Mario
had just departed, taking the direction across the lake toward San
Lucas.He had compelled his wife to remain in Simiti to watch over the
little store, while he fled with two boatmen and abundant supplies.Others likewise were preparing to flee, some to the Boque river, some
up the Guamoco trail.Dona Maria was keeping Carmen closely, nor would
she permit her to as much as venture from the house."Why should not the senora take Carmen and go to Boque, Rosendo?""Then you and I could occupy our own houses until we knew
what the future had in store for us."Carmen would be safe in the protecting care of
Don Nicolas.From the
hilltop Jose could descry the Alcalde's boat slowly wending its way
across the lake toward the Juncal.Rosendo, having finished his
morning meal, prepared to meet the day."_Bien_, Padre," he said, "when the sun gets high we cannot stay here."Why not in the old church, Rosendo?""_Hombre!_ that old church is
haunted!"Jose could never understand the nature of this man, so brave in the
face of physical danger, yet so permeated with superstitious dread of
those imaginary inhabitants of the invisible realm."Padre," suggested Rosendo at length."We will go down there, nearer
the lake, to the old shack where the blacksmith had his forge.He died
two years ago, and the place has since been empty.""Go then, Rosendo, and I will follow later," assented Jose, who now
craved solitude for the struggle for self-mastery which he saw
impending.While Rosendo moved off toward the deserted shack, the priest
continued his restless pacing along the crest of the hill.The morning
was glorious--but for the blighting thoughts of men.The vivid green
of the dewy hills shone like new-laid color.The lake lay like a
diamond set in emeralds.The dead town glowed brilliantly white in the
mounting sun.Jose knew that the heat would soon drive him from the
hill.He walked toward it;
then mounted the broken steps.The hinges, rusted and broken, had let
the heavy door, now bored through and through by _comejen_ ants, slip
to one side.Through the opening thus afforded, Jose could peer into
the cavernous blackness within.The sun shot its terrific heat at him,
and the stone steps burned his sandaled feet.Then through the opening he entered the dusty,
ill-smelling old edifice.When his eyes had become accustomed to the dimness within, he saw that
the interior was like that of the other church, only in a more
dilapidated state.There were but few benches; and the brick altar,
poorer in construction, had crumbled away at one side.Dust, mold, and
cobwebs covered everything; but the air was gratefully cool.Jose
brushed the thick dust from one of the benches.Then he lay down upon
it, and was soon sunk in heavy sleep.*       *       *       *       *

The sun had just crossed the meridian.Jose awoke, conscious that he
was not alone.The weird legend that hung about the old church
filtered slowly through his dazed brain.Rosendo had said that an
angel of some kind dwelt in the place.And surely a presence sat on
the bench in the twilight before him!He roused up, rubbed his sleepy
eyes, and peered at it."I looked all around for the bad angel that padre Rosendo said lived
here, and I didn't find anything but you.""Why, Padre--what is it?First, madre
Maria tells me I must go to Boque with her.And now you will not let
me come near you.And I love you so--" Tears choked her voice, and she
sat looking in mute appeal at the priest.He passed his hand dully
across his brow as if to brush the mist from his befogged brain."Padre dear,
when madre Maria told me I had to go to Boque, I went to your house to
ask you, and--and you weren't there.And I couldn't find padre Rosendo
either--and there wasn't anybody in the streets at all--and I came up
here.Then I saw the blanket out on the hill, and I kept hunting for
you--I wanted to see you _so_ much.And when I saw the door of the
church broken, I thought you might be in here--and so I came in--and,
oh, Padre dear, I was _so_ glad to find you--but I wouldn't wake you
up--and while you were sleeping I just _knew_ that God was taking care
of you all the time--"

Jose had sunk again upon the bench.Carmen came flying to him across the darkness and threw
her arms about his neck.I just couldn't stand it to
leave you!"The flood-gates opened wide, and the girl sobbed upon his
shoulder.But his own tears were mingling freely with hers.The
strain of the preceding night had left him weak.He strove feebly to
loosen the tightly clasped arms of the weeping girl.Then he buried
his drawn face in her thick curls and strained her to his heaving
breast.What this might mean to Carmen he knew full well.If she preceded him into the dark vale, it would be for
only a little while.The sobs died away, and the girl looked up at the suffering man."Padre dear, you will not send me away--will you?"Then she drew herself closer to
him and whispered softly, "Padre dear--I love you."he cried, "have you the heart
to let evil attack such a one as this!""Why, Padre dear--what is it?Did--er--did your madre Maria say why you
must go to Boque?""She said Feliz Gomez died last night of the plague, and that the
people were afraid they would all get sick and die too.And she
said--Padre dear, she said you were afraid I would get sick, and so
you told her to take me away.She
didn't understand you, did she?You can't
be, you know, can you?We
_know_--don't we, Padre dear?""Why--why, we know that God is _everywhere_!"She looked at him
wonderingly.What could she understand of a nature so wavering?--firm
when the sun shone bright above--tottering when the blasts of
adversity whirled about it?He had said such beautiful things to her,
such wonderful things about God and His children only yesterday.Why again this sudden lowering of
standards?he
muttered grimly, forgetful of the child's presence.she pleaded, passing her little hand tenderly over
his cheek."You are just trying to think that two and two are
seven--and you can't prove it--and so you'd better stop trying!"She
broke into a little forced laugh.Her voice was full of plaintive tenderness."You have
talked so much about that good man Jesus.What would he say if he saw
you trying to make two and two equal seven?And if he had been here
last night--would he have let Feliz die?"None was required when Carmen put her
questions."Why didn't _you_ cure Feliz?""You have told me, often, that Jesus cured sick people.And you said
he even made the dead ones live again--didn't you, Padre dear?""Yes," he murmured; "they say he did.""And you read to me once from your Bible where he told the people that
he gave them power over everything.And you said he was the great
rule--you called him the Christ-principle--and you said he never went
away from us.Well, Padre dear," she concluded with quick emphasis,
"why don't you use him now?"Then, when no reply came--

"Feliz didn't die, Padre.""_Hombre!_ It's all the same--he's gone!"he cried in a tone of sullen
bitterness."You think he is gone, Padre dear.And
so now you both see it that way--that's all.If you would see things
the way that good man Jesus told you to--well, wouldn't they be
different--wouldn't they, Padre dear?""No doubt they would, child, no doubt.But--"

She waited a moment for him to express the limitation which the
conjunctive implied.Then:

"Padre dear, how do you think he did it?How did he cure sick people,
and make the dead ones live again?""I--I don't know, child--I am not sure.That knowledge has been lost,
long since.""You _do_ know, Padre," she insisted; "you _do_!"He classed it with all evil under the one heading--a lie--a lie about
God.""But when a person tells a lie, he doesn't speak the truth, does he?""And a lie has no rule, no principle?""And so it isn't anything--doesn't come from anything true--hasn't any
real life, has it?""No, a lie is utterly unreal, not founded on anything but supposition,
either ignorant or malicious.""Then Jesus said sickness was a supposition, didn't he?""And God, who made everything real, didn't make suppositions."Well, Padre dear, if you _know_ all that, why don't you act as if you
did?"That which is real--life, not
death--immortality, not oblivion--love, not hate--good, not evil!"_Chiquita_--" His voice was thick."You--you believe all that, don't
you?""No, Padre dear"--she smiled up at him through the darkness--"I don't
believe it, I _know_ it.""But--how--how do you know it?"The trouble is, you believe it, but I don't think you ever try to
_prove_ it.If you believed my problems in algebra could be solved,
but never tried to prove it--well, you wouldn't do very much in
algebra, would you?"Jose's straining eyes were peering straight ahead.Through the thick
gloom he saw the mutilated figure of the Christ hanging on its cross
beside the crumbling altar.It reflected the broken image of the
Christ-principle in the hearts of men.And was he not again crucifying
the gentle Christ?Did not the world daily crucify him and nail him
with their false beliefs to the cross of carnal error which they set
up in the Golgotha of their own souls?And were they not daily paying
the awful penalty therefor?Aye, paying it in agony, in torturing
agony of soul and body, in blasted hopes, crumbling ambitions, and
inevitable death!"Padre dear, what did the good man say sickness came from?"Carmen's
soft voice brought him back from his reflections."Wrong conduct, based on wrong thinking.And wrong thinking is based
on wrong beliefs, false thought.""But to believe that there is anything but God, and the things He
made, is sin, isn't it, Padre dear?""Sin is--yes, to believe in other powers than God is to break the very
first Commandment--and that is the chief of sins!""Well, Padre dear, can't you make yourself think right?Do you know
what you really think about God, anyway?"Jose rose and paced up and down through the dark aisle."I try to think," he answered, "that He is mind; that He is infinite,
everywhere; that He is all-powerful; that He knows all things; and
that He is perfect and good.I try not to think that He made evil, or
anything that is or could be bad, or that could become sick, or decay,
or die.Whatever He made must be real, and real things last forever,
are immortal, eternal.I strive to think He did make man in His image
and likeness--and that man has never been anything else--that man
never 'fell.'""Only an old, outworn theological belief.But, to resume: I believe
that, since God is mind, man must be an idea of His.Since God is
infinite, man must exist in Him.I know that any number of lies can be
made up about true things.And any number of falsities can be assumed
about God and what He has made.I am sure that the material universe
and man are a part of the lie about God and the way He manifests and
expresses Himself in and through His ideas.The mental realm includes all truth, all fact.But there may be all sorts of supposition about this fact.And yet,
while fact is based upon absolute and undeviating principle--and I
believe that principle to be God--supposition is utterly without any
rule or principle whatsoever.It is wholly subject to truth, to
Principle, to God.Hence, bad or wrong thought is absolutely subject
to good or real thought, and must go down before it.The mortal man is
a product of wrong thought.He is a supposition; and so is the
universe of matter in which he is supposed to live.We have already
learned that the things he thinks he hears, feels, tastes, smells, and
sees are only his own thoughts.And these turn out to be suppositions.I--I don't think
I understand all you say.But, anyway, I guess it is right."he exclaimed, forgetting that he was talking
to a child."Evil, which includes sickness and death, is only a false
idea of good.It is a misinterpretation, made in the thought-activity
which constitutes what we call the human consciousness.And that is
the opposite--the suppositional opposite--of the mind that is God.Evil, then, becomes a supposition and a lie."But, Padre--I don't see why you don't act as if you really believed
all that!"It has not yet been eradicated from my thought," he
answered slowly."But, Padre, what will drive it out?""Love, child--love only, for 'perfect love casteth out fear.'""Oh, then, Padre dear, I will just love it all out of you, every bit!"she exclaimed, clasping her arms about him again and burying her face
in his shoulder."Ah, little one," he said sadly, "I must love more.I must love my
fellow-men and good more than myself and evil.If I didn't love myself
so much, I would have no fear.If I loved God as you do, dearest
child, I would never come under fear's heavy shadow.""You _do_ love everybody--you have got to, for you are God's child.And now," she added, getting down and drawing him toward the door,
"let us go out of this smelly old church.We've got to have our lessons, you know.""But--child, the people will not let me come near them--nor you
either, now," he said, holding back."They think we may give them the
disease."She looked up at him with a tender, wistful smile."Padre dear, I love you," she said, "but you make me lots of
trouble.But--we are going to love all the fear away, and--" stamping
her little bare foot--"we are going to get the right answer to your
problem, too!"The priest took her hand, and together they passed out into the
dazzling sunlight.On the brow of the hill stood Rosendo, talking excitedly, and with
much vehement gesticulation, to Dona Maria, who remained a safe
distance from him.The latter and her good consort exclaimed in horror
when they saw Carmen with the priest."_ cried Rosendo, darting toward them."I could kill you for
this, Padre!_Hombre!_ How came the child here, and with you?_Dios
mio!_ Have you no heart, but that, when you know you may die, you
would take her with you?"He swung his long arms menacingly before the
priest, and his face worked with passion.she cried, seizing
one of his hands in both of her own.And he isn't going to die--nor I,
either!"Dona Maria approached and quietly joined the little group."_ cried the distressed Rosendo, turning upon her.Dios y diablo!_ will you all die?"He stamped the ground and
tore his hair in his impotent protest."_Na_, Rosendo," said the woman placidly, "if you are in danger, I
will be too.If you must die, so will I. I will not be left alone.""_Bien_," he said, "we have all been exposed to the plague now, and we
will stand together.Rosendo's anger soon evaporated, but his face retained traces of deep
anxiety."Maria tells me, Padre," he said, "that Amado Sanchez fell
sick last night with the flux, and nobody will stay with him,
excepting his woman.""Let us go to him, then," replied the priest."Dona Maria, do you and
Carmen return to your house, whilst Rosendo and I seek to be of
service to those who may need us."Together they started down the main street of the town.Many of the inhabitants had fled to the hills.But
there were still many whose circumstances would not permit of flight.As they neared Rosendo's house the little party were hailed from a
distance by Juan Mendoza and Pedro Cardenas, neighbors living on
either side of Rosendo and the priest."_Hola_, Padre and Don Rosendo!"they called; "you cannot return to
your homes, for you would expose us to the plague!We will burn the houses over your heads if you return!""But, _amigos_--" Jose began."_Na_, Padre," they cried in tense excitement, "it is for the best!We will supply you with food and blankets--but you
must not come here!Amado Sanchez is sick; Guillermo Hernandez is
sick.The attitude of the
frightened, desperate men was threatening.Jose saw that it would be
unwise to resist them."_Bien, compadres_, we will go," he said, his heart breaking with
sorrow for these children of fear.Then, assembling his little family,
he turned and retraced his steps sadly through the street that burned
in lonely silence in the torrid heat.Carmen's eyes were big with wonder; but a happy idea soon drove all
apprehension from her thought.she exclaimed, "we will live
in the old church, and we will play house there!"She clapped her
hands in merriment.na!_" he insisted, when they reached
the steps, "do you go in if you wish; but I will stay outside in the
shadow of the building."Nor would the combined entreaties of Carmen
and Jose induce him to yield.Dona Maria calmly and silently prepared
to remain with him."Pull off the old door, Padre!"There goes the bad angel that padre
Rosendo was afraid of!"A number of bats, startled at the noise and
the sudden influx of light, were scurrying out through the open door."Like the legion of demons which Jesus sent into the swine," said
Jose."I will tell you the story some day, _chiquita_," he said, in
answer to her look of inquiry.The day passed quickly for the child, nor did she seem to cast another
thought in the direction of the cloud which hung over the sorrowing
town.At dusk, Mendoza and Cardenas came to the foot of the hill with
food and blankets."Amado Sanchez has just died," they reported."No, Padre, he had been ailing for many days--but it may have been the
plague just the same.Perhaps it was with us before Feliz brought it.But we have not exposed ourselves to the disease and--Padre--there is
not a man in Simiti who will bury Amado."_Bien, amigo_," he replied.To-night Rosendo and I will come and bury him."Jose had sent Carmen and Dona Maria beyond the church, that they might
not hear the grewsome tidings.When the men had returned to their
homes, the little band on the hilltop ate their evening meal in
silence.Then a bench was swept clean for Carmen's bed, for she
insisted on sleeping in the old church with Jose when she learned that
he intended to pass the night there.Again, as the heavy shadows were gathering, Jose and Rosendo descended
into the town and bore out the body of Amado Sanchez to a resting
place beside the poor lad who had died the day before.To a man of
such delicate sensibilities as Jose, whose nerves were raw from
continual friction with a world with which he was ever at variance,
this task was one of almost unendurable horror.He returned to the old
church in a state bordering on collapse."Rosendo," he murmured, as they seated themselves on the hillside in
the still night, "I think we shall all die of the plague.I am tired, utterly tired of striving to live against such
odds."Courage, _compadre_!"urged Rosendo, putting his great arm about the
priest's shoulders."We must all go some time, and perhaps now; but
while we live let us live like men!""No--what is it that the old history of mine says?'Death is not
departing, but arriving.'But the little Carmen--I
wish that she might live.She--ah, Padre, she could do much good in
the world._Bien_, we are all in the hands of the One who brought us
here--and He will take us in the way and at the time that He
appoints--is it not so, Padre?"No, he could not say that it was
so.The thoughts which he had expressed to Carmen that morning still
flitted through his mind.The child was right--Rosendo's philosophy
was that of resignation born of ignorance.And he did not really think that Carmen would be smitten of the
plague.Something seemed to tell him that it was impossible.But, on
the other hand, he would himself observe every precaution in regard to
her.No, he would not sleep in the church that night.He had handled
the body of the plague's second victim, and he could not rest near the
child.Perhaps exposure to the night air and the heavy dews would
serve to cleanse him.And so he wrapped himself in the blanket which
Dona Maria brought from within the church, and lay down beside the
faithful pair.In the long hours of that lonely night Jose lay beneath the shimmering
stars pondering, wondering.Down below in the smitten town the poor
children of his flock were eating their hearts out in anxious dread
and bitter sorrow.Was it through any fault of theirs that this thing
had come upon them, like a bolt from a cloudless sky?No--except that
they were human, mortal.And if the thing were real, it came from the
mind that is God; if unreal--but it seemed real to these simple folk,
terribly so!His heart yearned toward them as his thought penetrated the still
reaches of the night and hovered about their lonely vigil.What balm could he extend to those wearing out weary
hours on beds of agony below?True religion, if they could
but understand it; but not again the empty husks of the faith that had
been taught them in the name of Christ!Where did scholastic theology
stand in such an hour as this?Did it offer easement from their
torture of mind and body?Strength to bear in patience their heavy
burden?Not of this life--nay, naught but the thread-worn,
undemonstrable promise of a life to come, if, indeed, they might
happily avoid the pangs of purgatory and the horrors of the quenchless
flames of hell!God, what had not the Church to answer for!And yet, these ignorant children were but succumbing to the
evidence of their material senses--though small good it would do to
tell them so!Could they but know--as did Carmen--that rejection of
error and reception of truth meant life--ah, could they but know!Could he himself but know--really _know_--that God is neither the
producer of evil, nor the powerless witness of its ravages--could
he but understand and prove that evil is not a self-existing
entity, warring eternally with God, what might he not accomplish!For Jesus had said: "These signs"--the cure of disease, the rout of
death--"shall follow them that believe," that understand, that
know.Why could he not go down to those beds of torture and say
with the Christ: "Arise, for God hath made thee whole"?He knew
why--"without faith it is impossible to please Him: for he that
cometh of God must believe"--must _know_--"that He is a rewarder of
them that diligently seek Him."The suffering victims in the town
below were asleep in a state of religious dullness.The task of
independent thinking was onerous to such as they.Gladly did they
leave it to the Church to do their thinking for them.And thus did
they suffer for the trust betrayed!But truth is omnipotent, and "one with God is a majority."Jesus gave
few rules, but none more fundamental than that "with God all things
are possible."If so, he might arise
and go down into the stricken town and bid its frightened children be
whole.If he fully recognized "the Father" as all-powerful,
all-good, and if he could clearly see and retain his grasp on the
truth that evil, the supposititious opposite of good, had neither
place nor power, except in the minds of mortals receptive to it--ah,
then--then----

A soft patter of little feet on the shales broke in upon his thought.He turned and beheld Carmen coming through the night."Padre dear," she whispered, "why didn't you come and sleep in the
church with me?"He had not the heart nor the
courage to send her away.He put out his arm and drew her to him."Padre dear," the child murmured, "it is nice out here under the
stars--and I want to be with you--I love you--love you--" The whisper
died away, and the child slept on his arm.CHAPTER 20


Dawn brought Juan Mendoza and Pedro Cardenas again to the hill, and
with them came others."Mateo Gil, Pablo Polo, and Juanita Gomez are
sick, Padre," announced Mendoza, the spokesman."They ask for the last
sacrament.You could come down and give it to them, and then return to
the hill, is it not so?""Yes," assented Jose, "I will come.""And, Padre," continued Mendoza, "we talked it over last night, after
Amado Sanchez died, and we think it would help if you said a Mass for
us in the church to-day.""I will do so this afternoon, after I have visited the sick," he
replied pityingly.Then--

"We think, too, Padre, that if we held a procession--in honor of Santa
Barbara--perhaps she would pray for us, and might stop the sickness.We could march through the town this evening, while you stood here and
prayed as we passed around the hill.But the anxious faces
directed toward him melted his heart."Yes, children," he replied gently, "do as you wish.Keep your houses
this afternoon while I visit the sick and offer the Mass.I will leave
the _hostia_ on the altar.Carry it
with you in your rogation to Santa Barbara this evening, and I will
stand here and pray for you."The people departed, sorrowing, but grateful.Hope revived in the
breasts of some.But most of them awaited in trembling the icy touch
of the plague."Padre," said Rosendo, when the people had gone."I have been thinking
about the sickness, and I remember what my father told me he learned
from a Jesuit missionary.It was that the fat from a human body would
cure rheumatism.And then the missionary laughed and said that the fat
from a plump woman would cure all diseases of mind and body.If that
is so, Padre, and Juanita Gomez dies--she is very plump, Padre--could
we not take some of the fat from her body and rub it on the sick--"

"God above, Rosendo!cried Jose recoiling in
horror."Would you not try everything
that might possibly save these people?"No, my faithful ally," replied Jose."You did not get the sense in
which he said it.Neither human fat nor medicine of any kind will help
these people.Nothing will be accomplished for them until their fear
has been removed.For, I--well, the symptoms manifested by poor Feliz
may have been those of Asiatic cholera.And as
for Sanchez--_Bien_, we do not know--not for certain."He stopped and
pondered the question."Padre," pursued Rosendo, "I have used the liver of a lizard for
toothache, and it was very good.""I have no doubt of it, Rosendo," replied Jose, with a smile."And in
days past stranger remedies than that were used by supposedly wise
people.When the eyesight was poor, they rubbed wax from the human ear
upon the eyes, and I doubt not marvelous restorations of sight were
made.So also dogs' teeth were ground into powder and taken to
alleviate certain bodily pains.Almost everything that could be
swallowed has been taken by mankind to cure their aches and torments.But they still ache to-day; and will continue to do so, I believe,
until their present state of mind greatly changes."When the simple midday meal of corn _arepa_ and black coffee was
finished, Jose descended into the quiet town."It is absurd that we
should be kept on the hill," he had said to Rosendo, "but these dull,
simple minds believe that, having handled those dead of the plague, we
have become agents of infection.They forget that they themselves are
living either in the same house with it, or closely adjacent.But it
humors them, poor children, and we will stay here for their sakes.""_Caramba!_ and they have made us their sextons!"The clammy hand of fear again reached for his heart.He turned to Carmen, who was busily occupied in the shade of the old
church."Your lessons, _chiquita_?"he queried, going to her for a moment's
abstraction."No, Padre dear," she replied, smiling up at him, while she quickly
concealed the bit of paper on which she had been writing."Then what are you doing, little one?""Padre dear--don't--don't always make me tell you everything," she
pleaded, but only half in earnest, as she cast an enigmatical glance
at him."But this time I insist on knowing; so you might as well tell me.""Well then, if you must know," she replied, her face beaming with a
happiness which seemed to Jose strangely out of place in that tense
atmosphere, "I have been writing a question to God."I have done that for a long, long time.When I
want to know what to do, and think I don't see just what is best, I
write my question to God on a piece of paper.Then I read it to Him,
and tell Him I know He knows the answer and that He will tell me.And
then I put the paper under a stone some place, and--well, that's all,
Padre.She beamed at him like a glorious noonday
sun.The priest stood before her in wonder and admiration."And does He
tell you the answers to your questions, _chiquita_?"Not always right away--but He never fails--never!""Will you tell me what you are asking Him now?"His eyes dimmed as he read:

  "Dear, dear Father, please tell your little girl and her dear
  Padre Jose what it is that makes the people think they have to die
  down in the town.""And where will you put the paper, little girl?"he asked, striving to
control his voice."Why, I don't know, Padre.Oh, why not put it under the altar in this
old church?"she exclaimed, pleased with the thought of such a novel
hiding place.assented Jose; and together they entered the building.After much stumbling over rubbish, much soiling of hands and
disturbing of bats and lizards, while Carmen's happy laugh rang
merrily through the gloomy old pile, they laid the paper carefully
away behind the altar in a little pocket, and covered it with an adobe
brick."Now we will wait for the
answer."Jose went down into the ominous silence of the town with a lighter
heart.The sublime faith of the child moved before him like a beacon.To the sick he spoke words of comfort, with the vision of Carmen
always before him.At the altar in the empty church, where he offered
the Mass in fulfillment of his promise to the people, her fair form
glowed with heavenly radiance from the pedestal where before had stood
the dilapidated image of the Virgin.He prepared the sacred wafer and
left a part of it on the altar for the people to carry in their
procession to Santa Barbara.The other portion he took to the sick
ones who had asked for the sacrament.Mateo Gil, he thought, could
not live the night through.He knelt at the loathsome bedside of the
suffering man and prayed long and earnestly for light.He tried not to
ask, but to know.While there, he heard a call from the street,
announcing the passing of Guillermo Hernandez.The plague was upon them in all its cruel virulence.Sadly he returned to the hill, just as the sun tipped the highest
peaks of the _Cordilleras_.Standing on the crest, he waited with
heavy heart, while the mournful little procession wended its sad way
through the streets below.An old, battered wooden image of one of the
Saints, rescued from the oblivion of the _sacristia_, had been dressed
to represent Santa Barbara.This, bedecked with bits of bright 
ribbon, was carried at the head of the procession by the faithful
Juan.Following him, Pedro Gonzales, old and tottering, bore a dinner
plate, on which rested the _hostia_, while over the wafer a tall young
lad held a soiled umbrella, for there was no canopy.A slow chant rose from the lips of the people like a dirge.It struck
the heart of the priest like a chill wind."_ Tears streamed from his eyes while he gazed upon his stricken
people.Slowly, wearily, they wound around the base of the hill, some
sullen with despair, others with eyes turned beseechingly upward to
where the priest of God stood with outstretched hands, his full heart
pouring forth a passionate appeal to Him to turn His light upon these
simple-minded children.When they had gone back down the road, their
bare feet raising a cloud of thick dust which hid them from his view,
Jose sank down upon the rock and buried his face in his hands."I know--I think I know, oh, God," he murmured; "but as yet I have not
proved--not yet.But grant that I may soon--for their sakes.""There is another body to bury to-night,
Padre.*       *       *       *       *

Standing over the new grave, in the solemn hush of night, the priest
murmured: "I am the resurrection and the life."But the mound upon
which Rosendo was stolidly heaping the loose earth marked only another
victory of the mortal law of death over a human sense of life.And
there was no one there to call forth the sleeping man."Behold, I give you power over all things," said the marvelous Jesus.The wondrous, irresistible power which he exerted in behalf of
suffering humanity, he left with the world when he went away."Still here," sighed the sorrowing priest, "still here--lo, always
here--but we know it not.Sunken in materiality, and enslaved to the
false testimony of the physical senses, we lack the spirituality that
alone would enable us to grasp and use that Christ-power, which is the
resurrection and the life.""Padre," said Rosendo, when they turned back toward the hill,
"Hernandez is now with the angels.You gave him the sacrament, did you
not?""_Bien_, then you remitted his sins, and he is doubtless in paradise.But," he mused, "it may be that he had first to pass through
purgatory._Caramba!_ I like not the thought of those hot fires!""Your mental wanderings at
times are puerile!Do not be
deceived, Hernandez is still the same man, even though he has left his
earthly body behind.Do not think he has been lifted at once into
eternal bliss.The Church has taught such rubbish for ages, and has
based its pernicious teachings upon the grossly misunderstood words of
Jesus.The Church is a failure--a dead, dead failure, in every sense
of the word!And that man lying there in his grave is a ghastly proof
of it!"Rosendo looked wonderingly at the excited priest, whose bitter words
rang out so harshly on the still night air."The Church has failed utterly to preserve the simple gospel of the
Christ!It has basely, wantonly betrayed its traditional trust!It has
fought and slain and burned for centuries over trivial, vulnerable
non-essentials, and thrown its greatest pearls to the swine!It no
longer prophesies; it carps and reviles!It no longer heals the sick;
but it conducts a purgatorial lottery at so much a head!It has become
a jumble of idle words, a mumbling of silly formulae, a category of
stupid, insensate ceremonies!Its children are taught to derive their
faith from such legends as that of the holy Saint Francis, who, to
convince a heretic, showed the _hostia_ to an ass, which on beholding
the sacred dough immediately kneeled!"_Ca-ram-ba!_ But you speak hard words, Padre!"muttered Rosendo,
vague speculations flitting through his brain as to the priest's
mental state.continued Jose heatedly, "the Church has fought truth
desperately ever since the Master's day!It has fawned at the feet of
emperor and plutocrat, and licked the bloody hand of the usurer who
tossed her a pittance of his foul gains!In the great world-battles
for reform, for the rights of man, for freedom from the slavery of man
to man or to drink and drugs, she has come up only as the smoke has
cleared away, but always in time to demand the spoils!She has filched
from the systems of philosophy of every land and age, and after
bedaubing them with her own gaudy colors, has foisted them upon
unthinking mankind as divine decrees and mandates!She has foully
insulted God and man!--"

"_Caramba_, Padre!_Hombre_, we must get back to the
hill!You voice the Church's stock complaint of every
man who exposes her shams: 'He hath a devil!'"Jose went on more excitedly:

"You ask if Hernandez is in paradise or purgatory.He is in a state no
better nor worse than our own, for both are wholly mental.We are now
in the fires of as great a purgatory as any man can ever experience!Yes, there is a purgatory--right here on earth--and it follows us
after death, and after every death that we shall die, until we learn
to know God and see Him as infinite good, without taint or trace of
evil!The flames of hell are eternal to us as long as we eat of 'the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil'--as long as we believe in
other powers than God--as long as we believe sin and disease and evil
to be as real and as potent as good!When we know these things as
awful human illusions, and when we recognize God as the infinite mind
that did not create evil, and does not know or behold it, then, and
then only, will the flames of purgatory and hell in this state of
consciousness which we mistakenly call life, and in the states of
consciousness still to come, begin to diminish in intensity, and
finally die out!"Then he turned to Rosendo
and put his hand affectionately upon the old man's shoulder."My good
friend," he said more calmly, "I speak with intense feeling, for I
have suffered much through the intolerance, the unspirituality, and
the worldly ambition of the agents of Holy Church.I suffer, because I
see what she is, and how widely she has missed the mark.But, worse, I
see how blindly, how cruelly, she leads and betrays her trusting
children--and it is the thought of that which at times almost drives
me mad!Do you but look to Carmen for your faith.She knows God, and she will lead you straight to Him.And
as you follow her, your foolish ideas of purgatory, hell, and
paradise, of wafers and virgins--all the tawdry beliefs which the
Church has laid upon you, will drop off, one by one, and melt away as
do the mists on the lake when the sun mounts high."Carmen and Dona Maria sat against the wall of the old church, waiting
for them.The child ran through the darkness and grasped Jose's hand."I wouldn't go to sleep until you came, Padre!""I
wanted to be sure you wouldn't sleep anywhere else than right next to
me.""Padre," admonished Rosendo anxiously, "do you think you ought to let
her come close to you now?The plague--"

Jose turned to him and spoke low."There is no power or influence that
we can exert upon her, Rosendo, either for good or evil.She is
obeying a spiritual law of which we know but little.""Just this, Rosendo: _'Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind
is stayed on thee.'_"

The late moon peeped timidly above the drowsing treetops.Its yellow
beams stole silently across the still lake and up the hillside to the
crumbling church.When they reached the four quiet figures, huddled
close against the ghostly wall, they filtered like streams of liquid
gold through the brown curls of the little head lying on the priest's
shoulder.And there they dwelt as symbols of Love's protecting care
over the trusting children of this world, until the full dawn of the
glorious sun of Truth.CHAPTER 21


Jose rose from his hard bed stiff and weary.Depression sat heavily
upon his soul, and he felt miserably unable to meet the day.Dona
Maria was preparing the coffee over a little fire back of the church.The odor of the steaming liquid drifted to him on the warm morning air
and gave him a feeling of nausea.Was the plague's cold hand settling upon him?Giddiness seized him, and he sat down again upon the rocks.In the road below a cloud of dust was rising, and across the distance
a murmur of voices floated up to his ears.He
wondered dully what additional trouble it portended.Rosendo came to
him at that moment."_Muy buenos dias, Padre._ I saw a boat come across the lake some
minutes ago.Jose struggled to his feet and
went forth to meet them."_Hola, Senor Padre Jose!_ _Dios mio_, but your hill is steep!"The man quickly gained the
summit, and hurried to grasp the bewildered priest's hand.don't you know me, _Senor Padre_?"he cried,
slapping Jose roundly upon the back.The light of recognition slowly came into the priest's eyes.The man
was Don Jorge, his erstwhile traveling companion on the Magdalena
river."And now a cup of that coffee, if you will do me the favor, my good
_Cura_.And then tell me what ails you here," he added, seating
himself."_Caramba_, what a town!Diego was right--the devil himself
made this place!But they say you have all taken to dying!_Caramba_, I do not wonder!Such a God-forsaken
spot!_Caramba!_ so they told me down below, and I would not
believe them!"One of our men brought it from Bodega Central."There isn't a trace of
cholera in the place, as far as I know!You have all gone crazy--but
small wonder!"His ears
were reporting things basely false."You say--" he began in
bewilderment."I say what I have said, _amigo_!There is no more cholera in Bodega
Central than there is in heaven!I arrived there day before yesterday,
and left before sunrise this morning.Jose sank weakly down at the man's side."But--Don Jorge--Feliz Gomez
returned from there three nights ago, and reported that a Turk, who
had come up from the coast, had died of the plague!"Don Jorge's brows knit in perplexity."I recall now," he said slowly,
after some moments of study."The innkeeper did say that a Turk had
died there--some sort of intestinal trouble, I believe.When I told
him I was bound for Simiti, he laughed as if he would split, and then
began to talk about the great fright he had given a man from here.Said he scared the fellow until his black face turned white.But I was
occupied with my own affairs, and paid him little attention.But come,
tell me all about it."With the truth slowly dawning upon his clouded thought, Jose related
the grewsome experiences of the past three days.But, was Feliz Gomez sick before he went to Bodega Central?""Yes, senor," interposed Rosendo."He and Amado Sanchez both had bowel
trouble.Their women told my wife so, after you and I, Padre, had come
up here to the hill.We have it here often, as you
know.""True," assented Jose, "but we have never given it any serious
thought."Don Jorge leaned back and broke into a roar of laughter."_Por el amor
del cielo!_ You are all crazy, _amigo_--you die like rats of fear!Did
you ever put a mouse into a bottle and then scare it to death with a
loud noise?_Hombre!_ That is what has happened to you!"The hill
reverberated with his loud shouts.But Jose could not share in the merriment.The awful consequences of
the innkeeper's coarse joke upon the childish minds of these poor,
impressionable people pressed heavily upon his heart.Bitter tears
welled to his eyes."We must go down and tell these people the
truth!"Don Jorge joined them, and they all hastened down into the town.Ramona Chaves met them in the _plaza_, her eyes streaming."Padre," she wailed, "my man Pedro has the sickness!loudly cried Jose; "there is no cholera
here!"He hastened to the bedside of the writhing Pedro.There
is no cholera in Simiti!He and Amado had only a touch of the flux, and they died
of fear!"The priest's ringing words acted upon the man like magic.He roused up
from his lethargy and stared at the assemblage.Don Jorge repeated the
priest's words, and added his own laughing and boisterous comments.Pedro rose from his bed, and stood staring.Together, their little band augmented at every corner by the startled
people, they hurried to the homes of all who lay upon beds of
sickness, spreading the glad tidings, until the little town was in a
state of uproar.Like black shadows before the light, the plague fled
into the realm of imagination from which it had come.By night, all
but Mateo Gil were up and about their usual affairs.But even Mateo
had revived wonderfully; and Jose was confident that the good news
would be the leaven of health that would work a complete restoration
within him in time.The exiles left the hilltop and the old church,
and returned again to their homes.Don Jorge took up his abode with
Jose."_Bien_," he said, as they sat at the rear door of the priest's house,
looking through the late afternoon haze out over the lake, "you have
had a strange experience--_Caramba_!most strange!--and yet one from
which you should gather an excellent lesson.You are dealing with
children here--children who have always been rocked in the cradle of
the Church.But--" looking archly at Jose, "do I offend?For, as I
told you on the boat a year ago, I do not think you are a good
priest.""_Bien_," he added, "I will correct that.You are good--but not a priest, is it not so?""I have some views, Don Jorge, which differ radically from those of
the faith," Jose said cautiously."_Caramba!_ I should hope so!""But," interposed Jose, anxious to direct the conversation into other
channels, "may I ask how and where you have occupied yourself since I
left the boat at Badillo?"said Don Jorge, shaking his head, although his eyes
twinkled."I have wandered ever since--and am poorer now than when I
started.I left our boat at Puerto Nacional, to go to Medellin; and
from there to Remedios and Guamoco.But while in the river town I met
another _guaquero_--grave hunter, you know--who was preparing to go to
Honda, to investigate the 'castles' at that place.There is a strange
legend--you may have heard it--hanging over those rocks.It appears
that a lone hermit lived in one of the many caverns in the great
limestone deposits rising abruptly from the river near the town of
Honda.Day after day, year after year,
he labored in his cave, extending it further into the hillside.People
laughed at him for tunneling in that barren rock, for gold has never
been found anywhere in it.But the fellow paid them no attention; and
gradually he was accepted as a harmless fanatic, and was left
unmolested to dig his way into the hill as far as he would.No one knew how the fellow lived, for he held no human
intercourse.Kind people often brought food and left it at the mouth
of his cavern, but he would have none of it.They brought clothes, but
they rotted where they were left.At last some good soul planted a fig tree near the cave, hoping that
the fruit in time would prove acceptable to him.One day they found
the tree cut down._Bien_, time passed, and he was forgotten.One day
some men, passing the cave, found his body, pale and thin, with long,
white hair, lying at the entrance.when they buried
the body they found it was that of a woman!"He paused to draw some leaves of tobacco from his wallet and roll a
thick cigar.The sudden turn of his story drew an expression of
amazement from the priest."_Bien_," he resumed, "where the woman came from, and who she was,
never was learned.But of course some one must have
supplied her with food and clothes all these years.Perhaps she was
some grand dame, with a dramatic past, who had come there to escape
the world and do penance for her sins.What sorrow, what black tragedy
that cave concealed, no one may ever know!Nor am I at all interested
in that.The point is, either she found gold there, or had a quantity
of it that she brought with her--at least so I thought at the time.So, when the _guaquero_ at Puerto Nacional told me the story, nothing
would do but I must go with him to search the cave._Caramba!_ We
wasted three full months prying around there--and had our labor for
our pains!"He tilted his chair back and puffed savagely at his cigar."Well, then I got on the windy side of another legend, a wild tale of
buried treasure in the vicinity of Mompox.Spent six months pawing the hot dirt around that old town.Fell in
with your estimable citizen, Don Felipe, who swindled me out of a
hundred good _pesos oro_ on a fraudulent location and a forged map.Then I cursed him and the place and went up to Banco."Don Jorge went on:

"Your genial friend Diego is back there.Told me about his trip to
Simiti to see his little daughter.""What did he say about her, _amigo_?""Not much--only that he expected to send for her soon.You know,
Rosendo's daughter is living with him."But, Don Jorge," pursued Jose anxiously, "what think you, is the
little Carmen Diego's child?""_Hombre!_ How should I know?"She does not look like him," asserted Jose, clinging to his note of
optimism._Caramba_, but he looks like an imp
from sheol!"Jose saw that little consolation was to be derived from Don Jorge as
far as Carmen was concerned."_Bien_," continued Don Jorge, whose present volubility was in
striking contrast to his reticence on the boat the year before, "I had
occasion to come up to Bodega Central--another legend, if I must
confess it.And there Don Carlos Norosi directed me here.""Yes, no doubt it appears so to you, _Senor Padre_," replied Don
Jorge."And yet my business, that of treasure hunting, has in times
past proved very lucrative.The Indian graves of Colombia have yielded
enormous quantities of gold.The Spaniards opened many of them; and in
one, that of a famous chieftain, discovered down below us, near
Zaragoza, they found a solid gold pineapple, a marvelous piece of
workmanship, and of immense value.it never would have reached him if I had been there!"But," he resumed, "we have no idea of the amount of treasure that has
been buried in various parts of Colombia.This country has been, and
still is, enormously rich in minerals--a veritable gold mine of
itself.And since the time of the Spanish conquest it has been in a
state of almost constant turmoil.And, up to very recent times, whenever the people collected a bit of
gold above their daily needs, they promptly banked it with good Mother
Earth.Then, like as not, they got themselves killed in the wars, and
the treasure was left for some curious and greedy hunter like myself
to dig up years after.The Royalists and Tories buried huge sums all
over the country during the War of Independence.Why, it was only a
year or so ago that two men came over from Spain and went up the
Magdalena river to Bucaramanga.They were close-mouthed fellows,
well-dressed, and evidently well-to-do.But they had nothing to say to
anybody.The innkeeper pried around until he discovered that they
spent much time in their room poring over maps and papers.Then they
set off alone, with an outfit of mules and supplies to last several
weeks._Bueno_, they came back at last with a box of good size, made
of mahogany, and bound around with iron bands._Caramba!_ They did not
tarry long, you may be sure.And I learned afterward that they sailed
away safely from Cartagena, box and all, for sunny Spain, where, I
doubt not, they are now living in idleness and gentlemanly ease on
what they found in the big coffer they dug up near that old Spanish
city."To him, cooped up for a year and more in the
narrow confines of Simiti, the ready flow of this man's conversation
was like a fountain of sparkling water to a thirsty traveler.He urged
him to go on, plying him with questions about his strange avocation."_Caramba_, but the old Indian chiefs were wise fellows!""They seemed to know that greedy vandals like myself would
some day poke around in their last resting places for the gold that
was always buried with them--possibly to pay their freight across the
dark river.And so they dug their graves in the form of an L, in the
extreme tip of which the royal carcasses were laid.In this way they
have deceived many a grave-hunter, who dug straight down without
finding the body, which was safely tucked away in the toe of the L. I
have gone back and reopened many a grave that I had abandoned as
empty, and found His Royal Highness five or six feet to one side of
the straight shaft I had previously sunk.""I suppose," mused Jose, "that you now follow this work because of its
fascination--for you must have found and laid aside much treasure in
the years that you have pursued it.""_ ejaculated the _guaquero_."I have been rich and poor,
like the rising and setting of the sun!What I find, I spend again
hunting more.The man who has enough money
never knows it.And his greed for more--more that he needs not, and
cannot possibly spend on himself--generally results, as in my case, in
the loss of what he already has.But there are reasons aside from the
excitement of the chase that keep me at it."He fell strangely silent, and Jose knew that there were aroused within
him memories that seared the tissues of the brain as they entered."_Amigo_," Don Jorge resumed."There are some things which I am trying to forget.This exciting and
dangerous business of mine keeps my thought occupied.I care nothing
now for the treasure I may discover."Surely, good friend," replied Jose quickly; "and I ask pardon for
recalling those things to you.""_ said Don Jorge, with a gesture of deprecation.Then: "I told you on the boat that I had lost a wife and girl.I tell you this because I know you, too, have
grievances against her._Caramba!_ Yet I will tell you only a part.I
lived in Maganguey, where my wife's brother kept a store and did an
excellent commission business.I was mining and hunting graves in the
Cauca region, sometimes going up the Magdalena, too, and working on
both sides of the river.Maganguey was a convenient place for me to
live, as it stands at the junction of the two great rivers.Besides,
my wife wished to remain near her own people._Bien_, we had a
daughter.And then, one day, the priest
told my wife that the girl was destined to a great future, and must
enter a convent and consecrate herself to the Church._Caramba!_ I am
not a Catholic--was never one!My parents were patriots, and both took
part in the great war that gave liberty to this country.But they were
liberal in thought; and I was never confirmed to the Church._Bien_,
the priest made my life a hell--my wife became estranged from me--and
one day, returning from the Cauca, I found my house deserted.Wife and
girl and the child's nurse had gone down the river!"The man's face darkened, and hard lines drew around his mouth."They had taken my money chest, some thousands of pesos.He laughed at me, and--_Caramba_!I struck him such a blow
between his pig eyes that he lay senseless for hours!"Jose glanced at the broad shoulders and the great knots of muscle on
the man's arms.He was of medium height, but with a frame of iron."_Bien, Senor Padre_, I, too, fled wild and raving from Maganguey that
night, and plunged into the jungle.Months later I drifted down the
river, as far as Mompox.And there one day I chanced upon old
Marcelena, the child's nurse.Like a _cayman_ I seized her and dragged
her into an alley.She confessed that my wife and girl were living
there--the wife had become housekeeper for a young priest--the girl
was in the convent._Caramba!_ I hurled the woman to the ground and
turned my back upon the city!"Jose's interest in the all too common recital received a sudden
stimulus."Your daughter's name, Don Jorge, was--"

"Maria, _Senor Padre_.""And--she would now be, how old, perhaps?""Fair--complexion light, like her mother's.Maria was a beautiful
child--and good as she was beautiful.""But--the child's nurse remained with her?"The woman was
old and ugly--but she loved the child.""Did you not inquire for them when you were in Mompox a few months
ago?""I made slight inquiry through the clerk in the office of the
Alcalde.I did not intend to--but I could not help it._Caramba!_ He
made further inquiry, but said only that he was told they had long
since gone down to Cartagena, and nothing had been heard from them."The gates of memory's great reservoir opened at the touch of this
man's story, and Jose again lived through that moonlit night in
Cartagena, when the little victim of Wenceslas breathed out her life
of sorrow and shame in his arms.He heard again the sobs of Marcelena
and the simple-minded Catalina.He saw again the figure of the
compassionate Christ in the smoke that drifted past the window.And
now the father of that wronged girl sat before him, wrapped in the
tatters of a shredded happiness!Should he say
that he had cared for this man's little grandson since his advent into
this sense of existence that mortals call life?For there could be no
doubt now that the little Maria was his daughter."Don Jorge," he said, "you have suffered much.And yet--"

"_Na_, Padre, there is nothing to do.Were I to find my family I could
only slay them and the priests who came between us!""But, Don Jorge," cried Jose in horror, "you surely meditate no such
vengeance as that!""_Senor Padre_," he returned coldly, "I am
Spanish.The blood of the old cavaliers flows in my veins.I have been
betrayed, trapped, fooled, and my honored name has been foully soiled._Caramba!_
The priest of Maganguey who poured the first drop of poison into my
wife's too willing ears--_Bien_, I have said enough!""_Hombre!_ You don't mean--"

"I mean, _Senor Padre_, that I drifted down the river, unseen, to
Maganguey one night."_Na_, Padre, not God, but Satan!Don Jorge leaned forward and laid a hand
upon his knee."My friend," he said evenly, "you are young--how old,
may I ask?"_Bien_, you have much to learn.I took to you on
the boat because I knew you had made a mess of things, and it was not
entirely your fault.You are no more in
the Church than I am."I--I have--work here, senor," he replied."True," said Don Jorge, "a chance to do much for these poor people--if
the odds are not too strong against you.But--are you working for them
alone?Or--does Diego's child figure in the case?No offense, I assure
you--I have reason to ask."The man looked squarely into his own,
and the priest found no deception in their black depths."I--senor, she cannot be Diego's child--and I--I would save her!""_Bien_," he said, "to-morrow I leave for
San Lucas.After the evening meal the _guaquero_ spread his _petate_ upon the
floor and disposed himself for the night.He stubbornly refused to
accept the priest's bed."_ he muttered, after he had lain
quiet for some time, "why does not the Church permit its clergy to
marry, like civilized beings!Do you know, _Senor Padre_, I once met a
woman in Bogota and held some discussion with her on this topic.She
said, as between a priest who had children, and a married minister,
she would infinitely prefer the priest, because, as she put it, no
matter how dissolute the priest, the sacraments from his hands would
still retain their validity--but never from those of a married
minister!_Caramba!_ what can you do against such bigotry and awful
narrowness, such dense ignorance!The following morning, before sunrise, Don Jorge and his boatmen were
on the lake, leaving Jose to meditate on the vivid experiences of the
past few days, their strange mental origin, and the lesson which they
brought.CHAPTER 22


"Padre dear," said Carmen, "you know the question that we put under
the altar of the old church?Well, God answered it, didn't He?""I--why, I had forgotten it, child.You asked Him to tell
us why the people thought they had to die, did you not?"Why, He told us that they were frightened to death, you know."They paid the
penalty of death for believing that Feliz Gomez had slept on a bed
where a man had died of the plague.They died because they--"

"Because they didn't know that God was everywhere, Padre dear,"
interrupted Carmen.And yet," he
added sadly, "how are we going to make them know that He is
everywhere?""Why, Padre dear, by showing them in our talk and our actions that we
know it--by proving it, you know, just as we prove our problems in
algebra.""Yes, poor Feliz, and Amado, and Guillermo died because they sinned,"
he mused."They broke the first Commandment by believing that there
was another power than God.And that sin brought its inevitable wage,
death.They'missed the mark,' and sank into the oblivion of their
false beliefs.that I could keep my own mentality free from
these same carnal beliefs, and so be a true missionary to suffering
humanity!But you, Carmen, you are going to be such a missionary.And
I believe," he muttered through his set teeth, "that I am appointed to
shield the girl until God is ready to send her forth!But what, oh,
what will she do when she meets that world which lies beyond her
little Simiti?""The deposit will not last much
longer," he said to Jose, shaking his head dubiously."And then--"

"Why, then we will find another, Rosendo," replied the priest
optimistically."_ exclaimed the old man, starting for the trail.The day after Don Jorge's departure the Alcalde returned.He stole
shamefacedly through the streets and barricaded himself in his house.He cruelly abused his
long-suffering spouse, and ended by striking her across the face.After which he sat down and laboriously penned a long letter to Padre
Diego, in which the names of Jose and Carmen figured plentifully.For Don Jorge had met the Alcalde in Juncal, and had roundly jeered
him for his cowardly flight.He cited Jose and Rosendo as examples of
valor, and pointed out that the Alcalde greatly resembled a captain
who fled at the smell of gunpowder.Don Mario swelled with indignation
and shame.His spleen worked particularly against Rosendo and the
priest.Come what might, it was time Diego and his superiors in
Cartagena knew what was going on in the parish of Simiti!A few days later an unctuous letter came to Jose from Diego,
requesting that Carmen be sent to him at once, as he now desired to
place her in a convent and thus supplement the religious education
which he was sure Jose had so well begun in her.The priest had
scarcely read the letter when Don Mario appeared at the parish house."_Bien, Padre_," he began smoothly, but without concealing the malice
which lurked beneath his oily words, "Padre Diego sends for the little
Carmen, and bids me arrange to have her conveyed at once to Banco.I
think Juan will take her down, is it not so?""No, senor," he said in a voice
that trembled with agitation, "it is not so!""_ exclaimed Don Mario, swelling with suppressed rage."You
refuse to give Diego his own child?""No, _senor_, but I refuse to give him a child that is not his.""_Caramba!_ but she is--he has the proofs!And I shall send her to him
this day!"The Alcalde shrilled forth his rage like a ruffled parrot.Jose seized
him by the shoulders and, turning him swiftly about, pushed him out
into the road.He then entered the rear door of Rosendo's house and
bade Dona Maria keep the child close to her.A few minutes later Fernando Perez appeared at Jose's door.He was
municipal clerk, secretary, and constable of Simiti, all in one.He
saluted the priest gravely, and demanded the body of the child Carmen,
to be returned to her proper father.What could he do against the established
authority?"_Bien, Padre_," said Fernando, after delivering his message, "the
hour is too late to send her down the river to-day.But deliver her to
me, and she shall go down at daybreak.""Listen," Jose pleaded desperately, "Fernando, leave her here
to-night--this is sudden, you must acknowledge--she must have time to
take leave of Dona Maria--and--"

"_Senor Padre_, the Alcalde's order is that she go with me now.Scarce knowing what he did, he
quickly stepped back through the rear door, and going to Rosendo's
house, seized a large _machete_, with which he returned to face the
constable."Look you, Fernando," he cried, holding the weapon menacingly aloft,
"if you lay a hand on that girl, I will scatter your brains through
yonder _plaza_!""_ muttered the constable, falling back."_Bien_," he
hastily added, "I will make this report to the Alcalde!"But he hastily arose and went into Rosendo's
house.he cried excitedly, "leave Carmen with me, and do
you hurry through the town and see if Juan is here, and if Lazaro
Ortiz has returned from the _hacienda_.Bid them come to me at once,
and bring their _machetes_!"Jose seized his _machete_ firmly in
one hand, and with the other drew Carmen to him.the child asked, her eyes big with wonder.I wish you wouldn't always go around thinking
that two and two are seven!""Carmen, child--you do not understand--you are too young, and as yet
you have had no experience with--with the world!"I do _not_ trust you, Padre," she said sadly."I can't trust anybody
who always sees things that are not so.""Carmen--you are in danger--and you do not comprehend--" cried the
desperate man."I am _not_ in danger--and I _do_ understand--a great deal better than
you do, Padre.People who are afraid
die of the plague!"The irony of her words sank into his soul."No, senor," the lad replied."She is searching for you--have you your _machete_?""Yes, Padre, I have just come back from the island, where I was
cutting wood."He went to the door and looked eagerly down the street.he
exclaimed with relief, "here come Dona Maria and Lazaro!Now,
friends," he began, when they were assembled before him, "grave danger
threatens--"

"Padre!"he cried, "go at once to the Boque trail!Let no one pass
that way with Carmen, if your life be the penalty!If either of you see her, call loudly, and I will come!Dona
Maria, start through the town!*       *       *       *       *

The afternoon dragged its interminable length across the valley.Jose
wearily entered his house and threw himself upon a chair.He had not
dared call at the Alcalde's house, for fear he might do that official
violence.But he had seen Fernando in the street, and had avoided him.Then, of a sudden, a thought came to him from out the darkness.He
sprang to his feet and hurried off toward the shales.There, beneath
the stunted _algarroba_ tree, sat the child.He rushed to her and clasped her in his arms."Padre," she replied, when she could get her breath, "I had to come
out here and try to know for you the things you ought to know for
yourself."He said nothing; but, holding her hand tightly, he led her back to the
house.That evening Jose sent for Don Mario, the constable, and Juan and
Lazaro.Assembling them before him in his living room, he talked with
them long and earnestly."_Compadres_," he said, "this week we have passed through a sad
experience, and the dark angel has robbed us of three of our beloved
friends.Is it your wish that death again visit us?"The Alcalde scowled darkly at
the priest beneath his heavy brows.Jose continued:

"_Bien_, it is planned to seize the little Carmen by force, and send
her down the river to Padre Diego--"

_"Dios y diablo!The Alcalde shrank back in his chair."Padre Diego sends for her by
letter--is it not so, Don Mario?"Juan wheeled about and stared menacingly at the
bulky official."Now, friends," Jose pursued, "it has not been shown that Carmen
belongs to Diego--in fact, all things point to the conclusion that she
is not his child.My wish is to be just to all concerned.But shall we
let the child go to him, knowing what manner of man he is, until it is
proven beyond all doubt that he is her father?""And I am of the opinion that the majority of our citizens would
support us in the contention."Every man in Simiti, Padre," replied Lazaro earnestly."Don Mario," said Jose, turning to the Alcalde, "until it is
established that Diego has a parent's claim to the girl, Juan and
Lazaro and I will protect her with our lives.Is it not so, _amigos_?""_Hombre!_ Let me see a hand laid upon her!"I
know you to be q good man--not like Padre Diego.I know not what claim
he may have on the girl, but this I say: I will follow and support you
until it is shown me that you are in the wrong."Then, to the town officials:

"_Bien, amigos_, we will let the matter rest thus, shall we not?If harm comes to the child, the death
angel will again stalk through this town, and--" he looked hard at Don
Mario, whilst that official visibly shrank in size--"_Bien_," he
concluded, "a sharp watch will be kept over the child.We will submit
to proofs--but to nothing less.cried Don Mario, at last finding his voice."If
Diego has the Bishop back of him, he will force us to deliver the
girl--or the Bishop will have the government soldiers sent here!I can
ask for them--and if necessary I will!"Don Mario,
seeing that his words had taken effect, quickly followed up the
advantage."Now you, Juan and Lazaro, do you think the little whelp
worth that?"The words were scarcely out of his mouth when Juan leaped across the
floor and fell upon him.Jose seized the lad and, with Fernando's
help, tore him loose.Lazaro held his _machete_ aloft, ready to
strike.Jose's voice rang out sharply:

"Hold, men!Juan, do you stay here
with me!"The lad faced the Alcalde and shook his fist."_Bien_," he sputtered,
"send for the soldiers, fat dog that you are!But when I see them
crossing the lake, I will come first to your house and cut open that
big belly!"shrilled the Alcalde, shaking with rage."I will cut off the hand that is laid on Juan!"And for
God's sake think twice before you make any further move!"Don Mario and his constable departed in sullen silence.Jose let
Lazaro out through the rear door, while he bade Juan pass the night in
the parish house.A consultation was held with Dona Maria, and it was
arranged that Carmen should sleep in the room with Jose, with Juan
lying before the door, until Rosendo should return from the mountains.Then Jose sat down and wrote to the Bishop.*       *       *       *       *

No reply came from Cartagena until Rosendo returned at the end of the
month.Meanwhile, Jose had never for a moment permitted Carmen to
leave his side.The child chafed under the limitation; but Jose and
Dona Maria were firm.Juan lived with the priest; and Lazaro lurked
about the parish house like a shadow.The Alcalde and his constable
remained discreetly aloof.But with Rosendo's return came letters from both Wenceslas and Diego.The latter had laid aside his unction, and now made a curt and
peremptory demand upon Jose for the child.The letter from Wenceslas
was noncommittal, stating only that he was quite uninformed of Diego's
claim, but that an investigation should be made.Jose wondered if he
had blundered in laying the case before him."_ ejaculated Rosendo, when he heard Jose's story.And now the Bishop has the matter in hand!_Caramba!_ We
shall lose her yet!"And, Padre," he added, "the deposit is played out.And, now that we shall have none to send to the Bishop
each month, Carmen's fate is settled--unless we go away.He hung his head
and sat in gloomy dejection.For more than a year Rosendo had panned the isolated alluvial deposit,
and on his regular monthly returns to Simiti he and the priest had
sent from thirty to ninety _pesos_ gold to Wenceslas.To this Jose
sometimes added small amounts collected from the people of Simiti,
which they had gratuitously given him for Masses and for the support
of the parish.Wenceslas, knowing the feeble strength of the parish,
was surprised, but discreet; and though he continually urged Jose to
greater efforts, and held out the allurements of "indulgences and
special dispensations," he made no inquiries regarding the source of
the monthly contributions.For many days following, Rosendo and the priest went about as in a
thick, black cloud."Rosendo," said Jose at length, "go back to the
mountains and search again.Have we any reason
to doubt Him now?""And leave Carmen here, exposed to the danger that always hangs over
her?I would not go back now even if the deposit were
not worked out!Jose knew it would be futile to urge him.Carmen came to the priest that same day."Padre, I heard you and padre
Rosendo talking this morning."Why, child--there seems to be a need just at present," he replied
lightly."But we might--well, we might send another of your questions
to God.she cried delightedly, turning at once and hurrying away
for pencil and paper."Now," she panted, seating herself at the table."Let us see; we want
Him to give us _pesos_, don't we?""Well, you know, Padre dear," she replied seriously, "we can't ask for
too much--for we already have everything, haven't we?After all, we
can only ask to see what we really already have."Say 'yes,' Padre dear," she pleaded, looking up appealingly at him
staring silently at her.Oh, if she could only impart to him even a
little of her abundant faith!"Well, here it is," she said, holding out the paper.He took it and read--"Dear, dear God: Padre Jose needs _pesos_--lots
of them."And now," she continued, "shall we put it under the altar of the old
church?"He smiled; but immediately assumed an expression of great seriousness."Why not in the church here, the one we are using?"But--no, we will go where we went before," she concluded firmly.Taking matches and a piece of candle, he set off
with the girl in a circuitous route for the hill, which they gained
unobserved.Within the musty old church he struck a light, and they
climbed over the _debris_ and to the rear of the crumbling altar."Here is my other question that He
answered!She drew the old paper from beneath the adobe brick."Let us put this question in a new place," she said."Look,
up there, where the bricks have fallen out," pointing to the part of
the altar that had crumbled away.His thought was far
off, even in Cartagena, where sat the powers that must be held quiet
if his cherished plans were not to fail.He reached out and grasped
one of the projecting bricks to steady himself.As he did so, the
brick, which was loose, gave way with him, and he fell, almost across
Carmen, followed by a shower of rubbish, as another portion of the old
altar fell out."_ he ejaculated, picking himself up."What good luck that
the candle was not extinguished!And now, senorita, are you willing
that we should bury this important question here on the floor; or must
I again try to put it in the altar itself?""Up there," insisted the child, laughing and still pointing above.He rose and looked about, searching for a convenient place to deposit
the paper.Then something attracted his attention, something buried in
the altar, but now exposed by the falling out of the fresh portion.It
was metal, and it glittered in the feeble candle light.He reached in
and hastily scraped away more of the hard mud.Then, trembling with
suppressed excitement, he pulled out another brick.Clearly, it was a
box that had been buried in there--who knows when?He gave the candle
to Carmen and bade her stand up close.Then with both hands he
carefully removed the adjacent bricks until the entire box was in
view."A box to put our question in,
Padre!"muttered the excited priest,
straining and tugging away at it."Now--" He gave a final pull.A crash of falling bricks
followed; the candle was extinguished; and both he and the child were
precipitated to the floor.called the priest, choking with dust, "are you hurt?""No, Padre dear," came the laughing answer through the darkness."But
I'm pretty full of dust.It lay near, a small, wooden coffer,
bound about with two narrow bands of steel.He dragged it out and bore
it down the aisle to the door, followed by Carmen.He dusted it off and examined it carefully in the fast fading light.It was some twelve inches square by three deep, well made of mahogany,
and secured by a small, iron padlock.On the top there was a crest of
arms and the letters, "I de R," burned into the wood.Night had closed in, and the priest and girl made their way hurriedly
back home by way of the lake, to avoid being seen.Under his cassock
Jose carried the box, so heavy that it chafed the skin from his hip as
they stumbled along."Carmen, say nothing--but tell your padre Rosendo to come to me at
once!"With the doors secured, and Carmen and Dona Maria standing guard
outside to apprise them of danger, Jose and Rosendo covertly examined
the discovery.pondered Rosendo, studying the box.Then--"_Caramba!_
Padre--_Caramba!_ It is _Ignacio de Rincon!_ _Hombre!_ And the
crest--it is his!I have seen it before--years and years ago!_Caramba!_ _Caramba!_" The old man danced about like a child.he kept exclaiming, his eyes
big as saucers.Then, hastening out to get his iron bar, he returned
and with a blow broke the rusty padlock.Tearing open the hinged
cover, he fell back with a loud cry.Before their strained gaze, packed carefully in sawdust, lay several
bars of yellow metal.Rosendo took them out with trembling hands and
laid them upon the floor._Caramba!--_

"Hold these, Padre!"hurrying out and returning with a pair of
homemade wooden balances.Again and again he carefully weighed the
bars.It seemed to Jose that the old man
wasted hours arriving at a satisfactory result."Padre," he finally announced in tones which he strove vainly to
control, "there cannot be less than six thousand _pesos oro_ here!""Six thousand _pesos_--twenty-four thousand
francs!The trembling old man replaced the bars and carried them to Jose's
bed.The priest opened the door and called to Carmen."What was in the old box, Padre?"she asked happily, bounding into the
room.He stooped and picked her up, almost crushing her in his arms."The
answer to your question, _chiquita_.'Before they call I will answer:
and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.'"CHAPTER 23


When Jose awoke the next morning he quickly put his hand under his
pillow.He
drew it forth and raised the cover.The yellow bars glittered in the
morning rays sifting through the overhanging thatch at the window.He
passed his hand gently across them.His heart leaped within him as he hastily threw on his scant
attire and went out into the balsamic air of the tropical morning.Rosendo had gone to the village of Boque, starting before sun-up, so
Dona Maria announced.Some sudden impulse had seized him, and he had
set out forthwith, not stopping to discuss the motive with his
faithful consort.Jose concluded his _desayuno_, and then summoned
Carmen to the parish house for the day's lessons.She came with a song
on her lips."Don't stop, _chiquita_!Sing it again--it is beautiful; and my soul
drinks it in like heavenly dew!"he cried, as the child danced up to
him and threw her plump arms about his neck.She turned about and sat down on the dusty threshold and repeated the
little song.The glittering sunlight streamed through her rich curls
like stringers of wire gold.Cucumbra came fawning to her and nestled
at her little bare feet, caressing them at frequent intervals with his
rough tongue.Cantar-las-horas approached with dignified tread, and,
stopping before his adored little mistress, cocked his head to one
side and listened attentively, his beady eyes blinking in the dazzling
light.Had
either of her parents been so gifted?And yet, it was
only the voicing of a soul of stainless purity--a conscience clear as
the light that gilded her curls--a trust, a faith, a knowledge of
immanent good, that manifested daily, hourly, in a tide of happiness
whose far verge melted into the shore of eternity.As he sat with
closed eyes the adobe hut, with its dirt floor and shabby furnishings,
expanded into a castle, hung with richest tapestries, rarest pictures,
and glittering with plate of gold.The familiar odors of garlic and
saffron, which penetrated from the primitive kitchen of Dona Maria,
were transmuted into delicate perfumes.The sun drew nearer, and
suffused him with its glittering flood.The girl became a white-robed
vision, and her song a benediction, voicing "Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace among men of good will."The song ended, and left the thought with him: "To men of good will?"Yes, to men of God's will--the will that is good--to men of sound
mind--that mind which was in Christ Jesus--the mind that knows no
evil!"_Chiquita_," the priest said gently, when the girl returned to him."Your question was quickly answered yesterday, was it not?""It was answered, Padre, before we asked
it.God has the answers to all questions that could ever be asked.We
would always know the answers if we thought the way He does.""But--tell me, _chiquita_, do you think He put that little box up
there in the altar purposely for us?""No, Padre--I guess it was hidden there by some man, long ago, who was
afraid he would lose it.And since he was afraid he would lose it,
why--he did, for now we have it.""Yes, the thing that he greatly feared came upon him.But what is your
idea regarding the way we happened to find it?"God leads to everything good, Padre dear," was the simple response.But, in this particular case--would we have been led to
the little box if you had not asked your question of God?"People are always led right when they think right.""And so thinking right was the cause of this discovery, was it?"he
pursued, relentlessly probing her thought to its depths."Why--yes, Padre--of course.We had to have money--you said so, you
know.And you told me to ask for lots of _pesos_.Well, we both knew
that God had already given us more _pesos_ than we could ever know
what to do with--He always does.He just can't help giving Himself to
everybody.And He gave Himself to us--why, we have always had Him!We
are _in_ Him, you know.And when anybody just knows that--why, he sees
nothing but good everywhere, and he always has all that he needs.""All that he wants, you mean, _chiquita_?""No, Padre, not all that he wants.You might
want all the gold in the world--but you wouldn't need it.""No, that would be only a selfish, human want.But--you still think we were led right to the little box, do you?""I know it, Padre dear," she replied emphatically."When we think
good, we see good.It is just as sure as
getting the right answers to my problems in algebra when I think right
about them.""And thinking right about them means using the right rule, does it
not?"If I didn't use the right rule--why, what sort of
answers would I get?But still," vigorously pursuing the subject,
"you don't think we happened upon the little box just by good luck?""Padre," she shook her curls insistently, "things never happen,
_never_!"Yes, there surely does seem to be a definite law of cause and effect.But you did not think gold yesterday, _chiquita_.""Oh, Padre dear, what a bother you are!No, I didn't think gold
yesterday.And that is
gold and everything else that we need.And it wasn't
just because I thought good yesterday, but because I think good every
day, that I saw the gold.It was because we needed it, and God had
already given us all that we needed.And I knew that it just _had_ to
come.Then, because we really needed it, and knew that
it was right and that it must come--well, it did.Her
little face was very serious as she looked up appealingly into his."Yes, _chiquita_, yes, I see.I just wanted to know how you would
explain it.It becomes clearer to me every day that there are no such
things as miracles--never were!Christ Jesus _never_ performed
miracles, if by that we mean that he set aside God's laws for the
benefit of mankind.But he acted in perfect accord with those
laws--and no wonder the results seemed miraculous to dull-witted human
minds, who had always seen only their coarse, material thought
externalized in material laws and objects, in chance, mixed good and
evil, and a God of human characteristics!""Yes--I--guess so, Padre dear--only, I don't understand your big
words.""Ah, _chiquita_, you understand far, far better than I do!Why, I am
learning it all from you!And Jose had learned by this time, too, that between merely
recognizing righteousness as right-thinking, and actually practicing
it--putting it to the test so as to "prove" God--there is a vast
difference.Things cannot be "thought" into existence, nor evils
"thought" away--the stumbling block of the mere tyro in the study of
mental cause and effect.A vast development in spirituality must
precede those "signs following" before mankind shall again do the
works of the Master.Jose knew this; and he bowed in humble
submission, praying for daily light.*       *       *       *       *

At dusk Rosendo returned."_Bien_, Padre, I have it now, I think!"he
cried excitedly, pacing back and forth in the little room.Come, while we eat I will tell you!"The little group gathered about the table, while Rosendo unfolded his
theory."I went to Boque this morning to talk with Dona Lucia.She is very
aged, the oldest inhabitant in these parts._Bien_, I knew that she
had known Don Ignacio, although she was not his slave.Her story
brought back to me also the things my father had often told me about
Don Ignacio's last trip to Simiti.Putting all these things together,
I think I now know how the little box came to be hidden in the altar
of the old church."The old man's eyes sparkled with happiness, while his auditors drew
closer about him to drink in his dramatic recital.For Rosendo, like a
true Latin, reveled in a wonder-tale.And his recitals were always
accompanied by profuse gesticulation and wonderful facial expressions
and much rolling of the eyes."_Bien_," he continued, "it was this way.Don Ignacio's possessions in
Guamoco were enormous, and in the then prosperous city of Simiti he
had stores and warehouses and much property.When the War of
Independence neared its end, and he saw that the Royalist cause was
lost, he made a last and flying trip to Simiti, going up the Magdalena
river from Cartagena in his own _champan_, propelled by some of his
still faithful slaves."_Bien_, he found that one of his foremen had just returned from the
mountains with the final clean-up from La Libertad _arrastras_.These
had been abandoned, for most of the slaves had deserted, or gone to
fight the Spaniards.But the foreman, who was not a slave, but a
faithful employe, had cleaned up the _arrastras_ and hidden the
amalgam until he could find a favorable opportunity to come down to
Simiti with it."Now, when Don Ignacio arrived here, he found the town practically
deserted.So he and the foreman retorted the amalgam and melted the
gold into bars.But, just as they had completed their task, a
messenger came flying to town and reported that a body of Royalist
soldiers were at Badillo, and that they had learned that Simiti was
the _bodega_ of the rich Guamoco district, and were preparing to come
over and sack the town.They were fleeing down the river to the coast,
to get away to Spain as soon as possible, but had put off at Badillo
to come over here.Fortunately, they had become very intoxicated, and
their expedition was for that reason delayed."_Bueno_, at the news the foreman dropped everything and fled for his
life.A few people gathered with the priest in the Rincon church, the
one you are using now, Padre.The priest of the other old church on
the hill fled._Caramba_, but he was a coward--and he got well paid
for it, too!"Don Ignacio's _champan_ was at Badillo, and he had come across to
Simiti by canoe._Bien_, he dared not take this gold back with him;
and so he thought of hiding it in one of the churches, for that is
always a sacred place.There were people in his own church, and so he
hurried to the one on the hill.Evidently, as he looked about in the
deserted building for a place to hide the bars, he saw that some of
the bricks could easily be removed from the rear of the altar.A
couple of hours sufficed to do the work of secreting the box.Then he
fled across the shales to the town of Boque, where he got a canoe to
take him down to the Magdalena; and there he waited until he saw the
soldiers come across and enter the _cano_.Don Nicolas, son of Dona Lucia, was his boatman, and he says that he
remained with your grandfather at that place over night, and that
there they received the report that the Royalists had been terribly
whipped in the battle--the battle of--_Caramba_!I forget--"

"Of Ayacucho," suggested Jose."_Bien_, there was nothing for the poor
man to do but hasten down the river to Cartagena as fast as possible,
for he knew not what might have befallen his family.He did not dare
go back to Simiti then for the box.And so the gold was left in the
altar.""Now I understand what he meant by that
note in his old diary, which we had in my father's house, in Spain!Arriving in Cartagena he went at once to the Department of
Mines and tore out all the pages of the register that contained
descriptions of his mineral properties.He intended some day to return
to Guamoco and again locate them.And meantime, he protected himself
by destroying all the registered locations.It was easy for him to do
this, influential as he was in Cartagena.And doubtless at that stormy
time the office of the Department of Mines was deserted.This note,
Rosendo, I have read in his old diary, many times, but never knew to
what it referred.""_Bueno_, the soldiers sacked Simiti
and slaughtered all the people they could find.Then they set fire to
the town, and left."But now for the old church and the picture of the Virgin that was
lost during the terrible storm when the priest fell dead.We will have
to guess that later, when peace had been restored, the priest of the
old church in prying around the altar discovered the loose bricks and
the box behind them._Bueno_, the night of the awful storm he had gone
secretly to the church to remove the box.I remember that my father
said the priest had arranged for my father to take him down to Bodega
Central the very next day.You see, he was going to flee with the
gold, the rogue!_Bien_, while he was in the church taking out the
loose bricks, that storm broke--and, from what I remember, it was
terrible!The heavens were ablaze with lightning; the thunder roared
like cannon; and the lake rose right out of its bed!_Caramba!_ The
door of the church crashed open, and the wind whistled in and blew out
the candles on the altar.The wind also tore loose a beautiful picture
of the Virgin that was hanging near the altar.The picture was blown
out of its frame and swept off to the hills, or into the lake.It was
never seen again, although the frame was found just outside the door.Perhaps it was the extinguishing of the candles and the falling of the
picture that frightened the old priest so terribly.At any rate he ran
from the church to his house, and when he reached his door he fell
dead of apoplexy."_Bueno_, after that you could never get any of the Simiti people to
enter the church again.They closed the doors and left it, just as it
was, for they thought the curse of God had fallen upon it because it
had been erected by the enemies of the Rincon family, whose patron
saint was the blessed Virgin herself.Well, the old altar began to
crumble, and parts of it fell away from time to time.And when the
people heard the bricks falling they said it was the bad angel that
the Virgin had locked in there--the angel of Satan that had
extinguished the candles on the altar that night of the storm._Caramba!_ And I believed it, too!I am a fool, Padre, a fool!""We are all fools, Rosendo, when we yield ourselves to superstition
and false belief," said Jose solemnly."But you have worked out a very
ingenious story, and I doubt not you have come very near to accounting
in the right way for the presence of the little box in the altar.But
now, _amigo_, come with me to my house."It is this, Rosendo," he said, when they were alone."We now have
gold, and the way has been providentially opened.Carmen is in great
danger here.What say you, shall we take her and leave Simiti?""Padre," he said at length, "you are right.It would be best for her
if we could get her away.But--you would have to leave the country.I
see now that neither she nor you would be safe anywhere in Colombia if
you left Simiti.""And I am sure that no country
offers the asylum that America does--the America of the north.I
have never been there, _amigo_; but of all countries I learn that it
is the most tolerant in matters religious.And it offers the
greatest opportunities to one, like Carmen, just entering upon life.And, Rosendo, prepare yourself and Dona Maria at
once, for we had best start without delay.""No, Padre," he said slowly.I could
not go to the North with you; nor could Maria."exclaimed the priest impatiently, "why?""_Bien_, Padre, we are old.And we know not the language of those up
there.We could not adapt ourselves to their ways of
life--no, not at our age.You tell me they have cold, ice, snow, up there."_Bien_, Padre, do you go, and take the girl.Bring her up to be a
power for good in that great land.We--Maria and I--will remain in
Simiti.It is not permitted that we should ever leave.This has always
been our home, and here we will die.""No, Padre, we could not make so great a change.Anywhere in Colombia
would be but little different from Simiti.But up north--in that great
country where they do those wonderful things you have told me
about--no, Padre, Maria and I could not make so great a change."But, Padre," he continued, "what will you do--leave the Church?Or
will you still be a priest up there?"In the great joy which the
discovery of the gold had stimulated, and in the thought of the
possibilities opened by it, he had given no heed to his status
respecting the Church.Yet, if he remained in the Church, he could not
make this transfer without the approval of the Vatican.And that, he
well knew, could not be obtained.No, if he went, he must leave behind
all ecclesiastical ties.And with them, doubtless, the ties which
still bound him to his distant mother and the family whose honored
name he bore.It was not so easy a matter to take the girl and leave
Simiti, now that he gave the project further consideration.And yet he could not abandon the idea, however great his present sense
of disappointment.He would cling to it as an ideal, some day to be
realized, and to be worked up to as rapidly as might be, without
exciting suspicion, and without abruptly severing the ties which, on
serious reflection, he found he was not morally strong enough as yet
to break."_Bien_, Rosendo," he concluded in chastened tones."We will think it
over, and try to devise ways to accomplish the greatest good for the
child."The way will be shown us some time,
Padre!""And while we wait, we will keep our eyes open,
no?"Yes, Jose would keep his eyes open and his heart receptive.After
all, as he meditated the situation in the quiet of his little cottage
that evening, he was not sorry that circumstances kept him longer in
Simiti.For he had long been meditating a plan, and the distraction
incident upon a complete change of environment certainly would delay,
if not entirely defeat, its consummation.He had planned to
translate his Testament anew, in the light of various works on
Bible criticism which the explorer had mentioned, and which the
possession of the newly discovered gold now made attainable.He had
with him his Greek lexicon.He would now, in the freedom from
interruption which Simiti could and probably would afford for the
ensuing few months, give himself up to his consecrated desire to
extract from the sacred writings the spiritual meaning crystallized
within them.The vivid experiences which had fallen to him in
Simiti had resulted in the evolution of ideas--radically at variance
with the world's materialistic thought, it is true--which he was
learning to look upon as demonstrable truths.The Bible had slowly
taken on a new meaning to him, a meaning far different from that
set forth in the clumsy, awkward phrases and expressions into which
the translators so frequently poured the wine of the spirit, and
which, literally interpreted, have resulted in such violent
controversies, such puerile ideas of God and His thought toward man,
and such religious hatred and bigotry, bloodshed, suffering, and
material stagnation throughout the so-called Christian era.He would
approach the Gospels, not as books of almost undecipherable
mystery, not as the biography of the blessed Virgin, but as
containing the highest human interpretation of truth and its relation
to mankind."I seek knowledge," he repeated aloud, as he paced back and forth
through his little living room at night; "but it is not a knowledge
of Goethe, of Kant, or Shakespeare; it is not a knowledge of the
poets, the scientists, the philosophers, all whom the world holds
greatest in the realm of thought; it is a knowledge of Thee, my
God, to know whom is life eternal!Men think they can know Homer,
Plato, Confucius--and so they can.But they think they can _not_
know Thee!And yet Thou art nearer to us than the air we breathe, for
Thou art Life!What is there out in the world among the multifold
interests of mankind that can equal in importance a demonstrable
knowledge of Thee?Not the unproven theories and opinions, the
so-called 'authority' of the ancient Fathers, good men though they
may have been; not modern pseudo-science, half-truths and relative
facts, saturated with materialism and founded on speculation and
hypothesis; but real knowledge, a knowledge of Thee that is as
demonstrable as the simplest rule in mathematics!that men
should be so mesmerized by their own beliefs as to say Thou canst
not be known.for the burden which such thinkers as Spencer
have laid upon the shoulders of stumbling mankind.For God _can_ be
known, and proven--else is Jesus responsible for the most cruel lie
ever perpetrated upon the ignorant, suffering world!"And so, putting aside a portion of his gold--his by right of
inheritance as well as discovery--for the future purchase of such
books and aids as he might require, Jose set his house in order and
then plunged into such a search of the Scriptures as rendered him
oblivious to all but the immediate interests of Carmen and her
foster-parents.The great world again narrowed into the rock-bound
confines of little Simiti.Each rushing morn that shot its fiery glow
through the lofty treetops sank quickly into the hush of noon, while
the dust lay thick, white, and hot on the slumbering streets of the
ancient town; each setting sun burned with dreamy radiance through the
afternoon haze that drew its filmy veil across the seething valley;
each night died into a stillness, lonely and awful.Nature changed her
garb with monotonous regularity; the drowsing children of this tropic
region passed their days in dull torpidity; Jose saw nothing of it
all.At times a villager would bring a tale of grievance to pour into
his ears--perhaps a jaguar had pounced upon his dog on his little
_finca_ across the lake, or a huge snake had lured a suckling pig into
its cavernous maw.At times a credulous woman would stop before his
open door to dilate upon the thick worms that hung upon the leaves of
the _algarrobas_ and dropped their wool-like fibers upon the natives
as they passed below, causing intermittent fevers.Perhaps an anxious
mother would seek him for advice regarding her little son, who had
eaten too much dirt, and was suffering from the common "_jipitera_,"
that made his poor little abdomen protrude so uncomfortably.Again,
Rosendo might steal in for a few moments' mysterious, whispered talk
about buried treasure, or the fables of El Dorado and Parime.Jose had
time for them all, though as he listened his thought hovered ever
about the green verge of Galilee.By his side worked Carmen, delving assiduously into the mysteries
of mathematics and the modern languages.When the day's work closed
for them both, he often asked her to sing to him.And then, leaning
back with closed eyes, he would yield himself to the soft dreams
which her sweet voice called up from his soul's unfathomed depths.Often they walked together by the lake on a clear night; and on
these little excursions, during which they were never beyond
Rosendo's watchful eye, Jose reveled in the girl's airy gaiety and
the spontaneous flow of her sparkling thought.He called her his
domestic sunbeam; but in his serious moments--and they were
many--he studied her with a wistful earnestness, while he sought to
imbibe her great trust, her fearlessness, her unswerving loyalty to
the Christ-principle of immanent Good.He would never permit
restraint to be imposed upon her, even by Rosendo or his good wife.She knew not what it was to be checked in the freest manifestation
of her natural character.But there was little occasion for
restraint, for Carmen dwelt ever in the consciousness of a spiritual
universe, and to it paid faithful tribute.She saw and knew only
from a spiritual basis; and she reaped the rewards incident thereto.His life and hers were such as fools might label madness, a
colorless, vegetative existence, devoid of even the elemental
things that make mundane existence worth the while.But the
appraisal of fools is their own folly.Jose knew that the torrid
days which drew their monotonous length over the little town were
witnessing a development in both himself and the child that some day
would bear richest fruit.So far from being educated to distrust
spiritual power, as are the children of this world, Carmen was
growing up to know no other.Instead of the preponderance of her
belief and confidence being directed to the material, she was
developing the consciousness that the so-called evidence of the
physical senses is but mortal thought, the suppositional opposite of
the thought of the infinite God who says to mankind: "For I know the
thoughts that I think toward you, thoughts of peace and not of
evil, to give you an expected end."Jose knew that his method of
education was revolutionary.But he also knew that it was not
wholly his; that the child had really taken this course herself,
as if led thereto by a power beyond them both.And so he watched her, and sought to learn from her as from Christ's
own loving and obedient disciple.It was because of his obedience to
God that Jesus was able to "prove" Him in the mighty works which we
call miracles.He said, "If any man will do His will, he shall know of
the doctrine, whether it be of God."And Carmen
did do His will; she kept the very first Commandment; she walked by
faith, and not by the sight of the human senses.She had been called
an "_hada_," a witch, by the dull-witted folk of Simiti; and some day
it would be told that she had a devil.But the Master had borne the
same ignominy.And so has every pioneer in Truth, who has dared to lay
the axe at the roots of undemonstrable orthodox belief and entrenched
human error.Jose often trembled for the child when he thought of the probable
reception that awaited her in the world without, in case she ever
left Simiti.Would her supreme confidence in good ever be weakened by
an opposite belief in evil?Would her glorious faith ever be
neutralized or counterbalanced by faith in a power opposed to God?And sometimes in the fits of abstraction resulting from
these thoughts, the girl would steal up to him and softly whisper,
"Why, Padre, are you trying to make two and two equal seven?"Then he
would laugh with her, and remember how from her algebraic work she had
looked up one day and exclaimed, "Padre--why, all evil can be reduced
to a common denominator, too--_and it is zero_!"As recreation from the task of retranslating his Greek Testament, Jose
often read to Carmen portions from the various books of the Bible, or
told her the old sacred stories that children so love to hear.But
Carmen's incisive thought cut deep into them, and Jose generally found
himself hanging upon the naive interpretations of this young girl.When, after reading aloud the two opposing accounts of the Creation,
as given in the first and second chapters of Genesis, she asked, "But,
Padre, why did God change His mind after He made people and gave them
dominion over everything?"Jose was obliged to say that God had not
made a mistake, and then gone back afterward to rectify it; that the
account of the Creation, as given in Genesis, was not His, but was a
record of the dawning upon the human thought of the idea of the
spiritual Creation; that the "mist" which went up from the earth was
suppositional error; and that the record of the Creation which follows
after this was only the human mind's interpretation of the real,
spiritual Creation, that Creation which is the ever unfolding of
infinite Mind's numberless, perfect ideas.The book of Genesis has
been a fetish to human minds; and not until the limitations imposed by
its literal interpretation were in a measure removed did the human
mentality begin to rise and expand.And when, reading from Isaiah, the
grandest of the ancient prophets, the ringing words, "Cease ye from
man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be
accounted of?"the child asked him if that did not refer to the very
kind of people with whom they had daily intercourse, he had been
obliged to say that it did, and that that sort of man was far, very
far, from being the man of God's own creating."The mist, child, which is mentioned in the second chapter of Genesis,
is said to have gone up from the ground.That is, it went up from
matter.And so it is typical of materialism, from which all evil
comes.The material is the direct opposite of the spiritual.Every bit
of evil that men think they can see, or know, or do, comes as
testimony of the five material senses.These might well be called the
'ground' senses.In the book of Genesis, you will notice that the
account of the real comes first; then follows the account of its
opposite, the unreal man of dust.""The plus sign is followed by a minus
sign, isn't it?And the man made of dust is the real man with a minus
sign before him.""The man of dust is the human mind's interpretation of the spiritual
man, dear child," returned Jose."All human beings are interpretations
by the mortal, or human, mind of infinite Mind, God, and His spiritual
Creation.The interpretation is made in the human mind, and remains
there.The human mind does not see these interpretations outside of
itself--it does not see real men, and houses, and trees, outside of
itself--but it sees its mental interpretations of God, which it calls
men, and houses, and trees, and so on.These things are what we might
call _mental concepts_.They are the man and the creation spoken of in
the second chapter of Genesis after the mist went up from matter, from
the ground, from materialism, resulting in the testimony of the
physical senses.""But, Padre, they are not real--these mental concepts?"They are formed in mentalities that are
themselves wrong interpretations of the infinite Mentality, called
God.They are made up
of false thoughts, false opinions, beliefs of power opposed to God,
beliefs in evil, in sickness, disaster, loss, and death.They are the
results of educated and inherited and attached beliefs.They are
largely made up of fear-beliefs.The human mentalities see these
various beliefs combined in what it calls men and women, houses,
animals, trees, and so on, all through the material so-called
creation.It is this wrong interpretation that has caused all the
suffering and sorrow in the world.And it is this false stuff that the
good man Jesus finally said he had overcome.""How did he do it, Padre?""By knowing its nothingness, and by knowing the Allness of his Father,
infinite Mind.He called this false stuff a lie about God.And he
overcame that lie by knowing the truth--just as you overcome the
thought that you cannot solve your algebraic problems by knowing the
truth that will and does solve them.""But, Padre, you said once that Jesus was the best man that ever
lived.That is, the human minds all about him saw their
mental concepts of him as a man.But he was a human concept that most
clearly represented God's idea of Himself.Mortal, human minds are
like window-panes, _chiquita_.When a window-pane is very dirty, very
much covered with matter, only a little light can get through it.Some
human minds are cleaner, less material, than others, and they let more
light through.Jesus was the cleanest mind that was ever with us.He
kept letting more and more light--Truth--through himself, until at
last all the matter, even the matter composing the material concept
that people called his earthly body, dissolved in the strong light,
and the people saw him no more."And--Padre, don't we have to do that way, too?"We must, every one of us, do exactly as Jesus
did.We must wash ourselves clean--wash off the dirty beliefs of power
apart from God; we must wash off the beliefs of evil as a power,
created in opposition to Him, or permitted by Him to exist and to use
His children; we must wash off beliefs of matter as real and created
by Him.We must know that matter and all evil, all that decays and
passes away, all discord and disease, everything that comes as
testimony of the five physical senses, is but a part of the lie about
Him, the stuff that has the minus sign before it, making it less than
nothing.We must know that it is the suppositional opposite of the
real--it is an illusion, seeming to exist, yet evaporating when we try
to define it or put a finger on it, for it has no rule or principle by
which it was created and by which it continues to exist.No, Jose assured himself, the Gospels are not "loose, exaggerated,
inaccurate, credulous narratives."They are the story of the clearest
transparency to truth that was ever known to mortals as a human being.They preserve the life-giving words of him whose mission it was to
show mankind the way out of error by giving them truth.They contain
the rule given by the great Mathematician, who taught mankind how to
solve their life-problems.They tell the world plainly that there
seems to exist a lie about God; that every real idea of the infinite
Mind seems to have its suppositional opposite in a material illusion.They tell us plainly that resisting these illusions with truth renders
them nugatory.They tell us clearly that the man Jesus was so filled
with truth that he proved the nothingness of the lie about God by
doing those deeds that seemed marvelous in the eyes of men, and yet
which he said we could and should do ourselves.And we must do them,
if we would throw off the mesmerism of the lie.The human concept of
man and the universe must dissolve in the light of the truth that
comes through us as transparencies.And it were well if we set about
washing away the dirt of materialism, that the light may shine through
more abundantly.Jesus did not say that his great deeds were accomplished contrary to
law, but that they fulfilled the law of God.Ignorance of
spiritual law permits the belief in its opposite, material law, or
laws of matter.False, human beliefs, opinions, and theories, material
speculations and superstitions, parade before the human mind as laws.Jesus swept them all aside by knowing that their supposed power lay
only in human acceptance.The human mind is mesmerized by its own
false thought.Even Paul at times felt its mesmerism and exclaimed:
"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with
me."The very idea of good stirs up its opposite in the human
consciousness.But Paul rose above it and saw its nothingness.Then
he cried: "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made
me free from the law of sin and death."He recognized the spiritual
law that Jesus employed; and with it he overcame the mesmerism of
the lie."To be a Christian, then," said Jose, "means not merely taking the
name of Christ, and, while morally opposing sin, succumbing to every
form of mesmerism that the lie about God exerts.It means recognizing the nature of God and His Creation,
including Man, to be wholly spiritual--and the nature of the material
creation and mankind as their opposite, as mental concepts, existing
as false interpretations of the spiritual Universe and Man, and as
having their place only in the false human consciousness, which itself
is a mental activity concerned only with false thought, the
suppositional opposite of God's thought.It means taking this Truth,
this spiritual law, as we would take a mathematical rule or principle,
and with it overcoming sin, sickness, discord of every name and
nature, even to death itself.What, oh, what have so-called Christians
been doing these nearly two thousand years, that they have not ere
this worked out their salvation as Jesus directed them to do?they have been mesmerized--simply mesmerized by the lie.The
millennium should have come long, long ago.It would come to-day if
the world would obey Jesus.But it will not come until it does obey
him."Day after day, week after week, month after month, Jose delved and
toiled, studied and pondered.The books which he ordered through the
Empresa Alemania, and for which for some two months he waited in
trembling anticipation and fear lest they be lost in transit, finally
arrived.When Juan brought them up from Bodega Central, Jose could
have wept for joy.Except for the very few letters he had received at
rare intervals, these were the only messages that had penetrated the
isolation of Simiti from the outside world in the two long years of
his exile.They afforded
his first introduction to that fearlessly critical thought regarding
things religious which has swept across the world like a tidal wave,
and washed away so many of the bulwarks of superstition and ignorance
bred of fear of the unknown and supposedly unknowable.And yet they were not really his first introduction to that
thought, for, as he pored over these books, his heart expanded
with gratitude to the brusque explorer whom he had met in Cartagena,
that genial, odd medley of blunt honesty, unquibbling candor, and
hatred of dissimulation, whose ridicule of the religious fetishism
of the human mentality tore up the last root of educated orthodox
belief that remained struggling for life in the altered soil of his
mind.But, though they tore down with ruthless hand, _these books did not
reconstruct_.He could understand why the trembling heart, searching wearily for
truth, turned always from such as they with sinking hope.They were
violently iconoclastic--they up-rooted--they overthrew--they swept
aside with unsparing hand--but they robbed the starving mortal of his
once cherished beliefs--they snatched the stale and feebly nourishing
bread from his mouth, and gave nothing in return.They emptied his
heart, and left it starving.What did it boot to tell a man that the
orthodox dream of eternal bliss beyond the gates of death was but a
hoax, if no substitute be offered?Why point out the fallacies, the
puerile conceptions, the worse than childish thought expressed in the
religious creeds of men, if they were not to be replaced by
life-sustaining truth?If the demolition of cherished beliefs be not
followed by reconstruction upon a sure foundation of demonstrable
truth, then is the resulting state of mind worse than before, for the
trusting, though deceived, soul has no recourse but to fall into the
agnosticism of despair, or the black atheism of positive negation."Happily for me," he sighed, as he closed his books at length, "that
Carmen entered my empty life in time with the truth that she hourly
demonstrates!"CHAPTER 24


Days melted into weeks, and these in turn into months.Simiti, drab
and shabby, a crumbling and abandoned relique of ancient Spanish pride
and arrogance, drowsed undisturbed in the ardent embrace of the
tropical sun.Don Jorge returned, unsuccessful, from his long quest in
the San Lucas mountains, and departed again down the Magdalena river."It is a marvelous country up there," he told Jose."I do not wonder
that it has given rise to legends.I felt myself in a land of
enchantment while I was roaming those quiet mountains.When, after
days of steady traveling, I would chance upon a little group of
natives hidden away in some dense thicket, it seemed to me that they
must be fairies, not real.I came upon the old trail, Padre, the
_Camino Real_, now sunken and overgrown, which the Spaniards used.It used to lead down to Cartagena."Ah, Padre, what quartz veins I saw in that country!Gold
will be discovered there without measure some day!This map which Don Carlos gave me is much in error.Jose regretfully saw
him depart, for he had grown to love this ruggedly honest soul.Meantime, Don Mario sulked in his house; nor during the intervening
year would he hold anything more than the most formal intercourse with
the priest.Events move with
terrible deliberation in these tropic lands, and men's minds are heavy
and lethargic.Jose assumed that Don Mario had failed in the support
upon which he had counted; or else Diego's interest in Carmen was
dormant, perhaps utterly passed.Each succeeding day of quiet
increased his confidence, while he rounded out month after month in
this sequestered vale on the far confines of civilization, and the
girl attained her twelfth year.Moreover, as he noted with marveling,
often incredulous, mental gaze her swift, unhindered progress, the
rapid unfolding of her rich nature, and the increasing development of
a spirituality which seemed to raise her daily farther above the plane
on which he dwelt, he began to regard the uninterrupted culmination of
his plans for her as reasonably assured, if not altogether certain.Juan continued his frequent trips down to Bodega Central as general
messenger and transportation agent for his fellow-townsmen, meanwhile
adoring Carmen from a distance of respectful decorum.Rosendo and
Lazaro, relaxing somewhat their vigilance over the girl, labored
daily on the little _hacienda_ across the lake.The dull-witted
folk, keeping to their dismally pretentious mud houses during the
pulsing heat of day, and singing their weird, moaning laments in the
quiet which reigned over this maculate hollow at night, followed
undeviatingly the monotonous routine of an existence which had no
other aim than the indulgence of the most primitive material wants."Ah, Padre," Rosendo would say of them, "they are so easy!They love
idleness; they like not labor.They fish, they play the guitar, they
gather fruits.Padre, it is sad, is
it not?"Aye, thought the priest, doubly sad in its mute answer to the
heartlessly selfish query of Cain.No one, not even the Church, was
the keeper of these benighted brothers.He alone had constituted
himself their shepherd.And as they learned to love him, to confide
their simple wants and childish hopes to him, he came to realize the
immense ascendency which the priests of Colombia possess over the
simple understanding of the people.An ascendency hereditary and
dominant, capable of utmost good, but expressed in the fettering of
initiative and action, in the suppression of ambition, and the
quenching of every impulse toward independence of thought.How he
longed to lift them up from the drag of their mental encompassment!Yet how helpless he was to afford them the needed lustration of soul
which alone could accomplish it!"I can do little more than try to set them a standard of thought,"
he would muse, as he looked out from the altar over the camellia-like
faces of his adult children when he conducted his simple Sunday
services."I can only strive to point out the better things of
this life--to tell them of the wonders of invention, of art, of
civilization--I can only relate to them tales of romance and
achievement, and beautiful stories--and try to omit in the recital all
reference to the evil methods, aims, and motives which have manifested
in those dark crimes staining the records of history.The world
calls them historical incident and fact.I must call them 'the mist
that went up from the ground and watered the face of the earth.'"But Jose had progressed during his years in Simiti.It had been
hard--only he could know how hard!--to adapt himself to the narrow
environment in which he dwelt.It had been hard to conform to these
odd ways and strange usages.But he now knew that the people's
reserve and shyness at first was due to their natural suspicion of
him.For days, even weeks, he had known that he was being weighed and
watched.It is true, the dull staring of the natives of this unkempt town had
long continued to throw him into fits of prolonged nervousness.They
had not meant to offend, of course.But at hardly any hour of the day or night could he look up
from his work without seeing dark, inquisitive faces peering in
through the latticed window or the open door at him, watchful of the
minutest detail of his activity.And he
had grown used to their thoughtless intrusion upon him at any hour.He
had learned, too, not to pale with nausea when, as was their wont of
many centuries, the dwellers in this uncouth town relentlessly pursued
their custom of expectorating upon his floor immediately they entered
and stood before him.He had accustomed himself to the hourly
intrusion of the scavenger pigs and starving dogs in his house.And he
could now endure without aching nerves the awful singing, the maudlin
wails, the thin, piercing, falsetto howls which rose almost nightly
about him in the sacred name of music.For these were children with
whom he dwelt.And he was trying to show them that they were children
of God.Already Jose had
been obliged to supplement his oral instruction with texts purchased
for her from abroad.Her grasp of the English language was his daily
wonder.After two years of study she spoke it readily.She loved it,
and insisted that her conversations with him should be conducted
wholly in it.French and German likewise had been taken up; and her
knowledge of her own Castilian tongue had been enriched by the few
books which he had been able to secure for her from Spain.Jose's anomalous position in Simiti had ceased to cause him worry.What mattered it, now that he had endeared himself to its people, and
was progressing undisturbed in the training of Carmen?And he, in
turn, knew that upon his observance of them depended his tenure of the
parish.And he wanted to remain among them, to lead them, if possible, at
least a little way along what he was daily seeing to be the only path
out of the corroding beliefs of the human mind.He knew that his
people's growth would be slow--how slow might not his own be, too!Who
could say how unutterably slow would be their united march heavenward!And yet, the human mind was expanding with wonderful rapidity in
these last days.What acceleration had it not acquired since that
distant era of the Old Stone Man, when through a hundred thousand
years of darkness the only observable progress was a little greater
skill in the shaping of his crude flint weapons!To Padre Diego's one or two subsequent curt demands that Carmen be
sent to him, Jose had given no heed.And perhaps Diego, absorbed in
his political activities as the confidential agent of Wenceslas, would
have been content to let his claim upon the child lapse, after many
months of quiet, had not Don Jorge inadvertently set the current of
the man's thought again in her direction.For Don Jorge was making frequent trips along the Magdalena river.It
was essential to his business to visit the various riverine towns and
to mingle freely with all grades of people, that he might run down
rumors or draw from the inhabitants information which might result in
valuable clues anent buried treasure.Returning one day to Simiti from
such a trip, he regaled Jose with the spirited recital of his
experience on a steamboat which had become stranded on a river bar."_Bien_," he concluded, "the old tub at last broke loose.Then we saw
that its engines were out of commission; and so the captain let her
drift down to Banco, where we docked.I was forced, not altogether
against my will, to put up with Padre Diego.But I had much amusement at his expense when I twitted him about his
daughter Carmen, and his silly efforts to get possession of her!"he cried, "why can
you not let sleeping dogs alone?Diego is not the man to be bearded
like that!Would that you had kept away from the subject!And what did
you say to him about the girl?"I only told him how beautiful she was, and how large
for her few years._Bien_, I think I said she was the most beautiful
and well-formed girl I had ever seen.But was there anything wrong in
telling the truth, _amigo_?""No," replied Jose bitterly, as he turned away; "you meant no harm.But, knowing the man's brutal nature, and his assumed claim on the
girl, why could you not have foreseen possible misfortune to her in
dwelling thus on her physical beauty?_Hombre_, it is too bad!""_Na_, _amigo_," said Don Jorge soothingly, "nothing can come of it.But when Don Jorge again set out for
the mountains he left the priest's heart filled with apprehension.A few weeks later came what Jose had been awaiting, another demand
upon him for the girl.Failure to comply with it, said Diego's letter,
meant the placing of the case in the hands of the civil and
ecclesiastical authorities for action.Rosendo's face grew hard when he read the note."There is a way,
Padre.Let my woman take the girl and go up the Boque river to Rosa
Maria, the clearing of Don Nicolas.It is a wild region, where tapirs
and deer roam, and where hardly a man has set foot for centuries.The
people of Boque will keep our secret, and she can remain hidden there
until--"

"No, Rosendo, that will not do," replied Jose, shaking his head in
perplexity."The girl is developing rapidly, and such a course would
result in a mental check that might spell infinite harm.She and Dona
Maria would die to live by themselves up there in that lonely region."Then do you go too, Padre," suggested Rosendo."No, _amigo_, for that would cause search to be instituted by the
Bishop, and we certainly would be discovered.But, to take her
and flee the country--and the Church--how can I yet?He shook his head dolefully, while his thoughts flew
back to Seville and the proud mother there."_Bien_, Padre, let us increase our contributions to Don Wenceslas.Let us send him from now on not less than one hundred _pesos oro_ each
month.Will not that keep him quiet, no matter what Diego says?""At any rate, we will try it."They still
had some three thousand _pesos_ gold left.*       *       *       *       *

"Padre," said Rosendo, some days later, as they sat together in the
parish house, "what do you think Diego wants of the girl?""I think, Rosendo--" he began.But could even a human
mind touch such depths of depravity?And yet--"I think," he continued
slowly, "that Diego, having seen her, and now speculating on her
future beauty of face and form--I think he means to place her in a
convent, with the view of holding her as a ready substitute for the
woman who now lives with him--"

"_Dios_!And, if I mistake not, Diego also would like to
repay the score he has against you, for driving him from Simiti and
holding the threat of death over him these many years.He can most
readily do this by getting Carmen away from you--as he did the other
daughter, is it not so?"His face was strained with
fearful anxiety."Padre," he said in a low voice, "I shall end this
matter at once.I go to Banco to-morrow to kill Diego.""Why--Rosendo, it would mean your own death, or lifelong
imprisonment!""I
have nothing that is not hers, even to my life.Gladly would I give it
for her.Let me die, or spend my remaining days in the prison, if that
will save her.Such a price for her safety would be low."While he was speaking, Fernando, the town constable, entered.He
saluted the men gravely, and drew from his pocket a document to which
was attached the Alcalde's official seal."Senores," he said with much dignity, as if the majesty of his little
office weighed upon him, "I am commanded by Senor, the Alcalde, to
exercise the authority reposing in him and place Don Rosendo Ariza
under arrest.You will at once accompany me to the _carcel_," he
added, going up to the astonished Rosendo and laying a hand upon his
shoulder.cried the old man, stepping
back."_Bien_, _amigo_, I do not find it my duty to tell you.The Senor
Alcalde hands me the document and commands me to execute it.As for
the cause--_Bien_, you must ask him.""Come," said Jose, the first to recover from his astonishment, "let us
go to him at once."He at any rate had now an opportunity to confront
Don Mario and learn what plans the man had been devising these many
months.The Alcalde received the men in his little _patio_, scowling and
menacing.He offered them no greeting when they confronted him."Don Mario," asked Jose in a trembling voice, "why have you put this
indignity upon our friend, Rosendo?"Ask, rather, _Senor Padre_," replied the Alcalde, full of wrath,
"what alone saves you from the same indignity.Only that you are a
priest, _Senor Padre_, _nada mas_!His arrest is ordered by Padre
Diego.""And why, if I may beg the favor?"pursued Jose, though he well knew
the sordid motive.Why lay the hands of the law upon those who deprive a
suffering father of his child!_Bien_, _Fernando_," turning to the
constable, "you have done well.Take your prisoner to the _carcel_.""No, Don Mario, I will not go to
the jail!I will--"

"_Caramba!_" shouted the Alcalde, his face purple."I set your trial
for to-morrow, in the early morning.But this night you will spend in
the jail!_Hombre!_ I will see if I am not Alcalde here!And look you,
_Senor Padre_, if there is any disturbance, I will send for the
government soldiers!Then they will take Rosendo to the prison in
Cartagena!Jose knew that, if Diego had the support of the Bishop, this was no
idle threat."What shall I
do, Padre?""It is best that you go to the jail to-night, Rosendo," said Jose with
sinking heart."But, Don Mario," turning menacingly to the Alcalde,
"mark you, his trial takes place in the morning, and he shall be
judged, not by you alone, but by his fellow-townsmen!""Have I not said so, senor?"returned Don Mario curtly, with a note of
deep contempt in his voice.As in most small Spanish towns, the jail was a rude adobe hut, with no
furnishings, save the wooden stocks into which the feet of the hapless
prisoners were secured.Thus confined, the luckless wight who chanced
to feel the law's heavy hand might sit in a torturing position for
days, cruelly tormented at night by ravenous mosquitoes, and wholly
dependent upon the charity of the townsfolk for his daily rations,
unless he have friends or family to supply his needs.In the present
instance Don Mario took the extra precaution of setting a guard over
his important prisoner.Jose, benumbed by the shock and bewildered by the sudden precipitation
of events, accompanied Rosendo to the jail and mutely watched the
procedure as Fernando secured the old man's bare feet in the rude
stocks.And yet, despite the situation, he could not repress a sense
of the ridiculous, as his thought dwelt momentarily on the little
_opera bouffe_ which these child-like people were so continually
enacting in their attempts at self-government.But it was a play that
at times approached dangerously near to the tragic.The passions of
this Latin offshoot were strong, if their minds were dull and
lethargic, and when aroused were capable of the most despicable, as
well as the most grandly heroic deeds.And in the present instance,
when the fleeting sense of the absurd passed, Jose knew that he was
facing a crisis.Something told him that resistance now would be
useless.True, Rosendo might have opposed arrest with violence, and
perhaps have escaped.But that would have accomplished nothing for
Carmen, the pivot upon which events were turning.Jose had reasoned
that it were better to let the Alcalde play his hand first, in the
small hope that as the cards fell he might more than match his
opponent's strength with his own."_Na_, Padre, do not worry," said Rosendo reassuringly."It is for her
sake; and we shall have to know, as she does, that everything will
come out right.My friends will set me free to-morrow, when the trial
takes place.And then"--he drew the priest down to him and whispered
low--"we will leave Simiti and take to the mountains."Arriving at Rosendo's house, he
saw the little living room crowded with sympathetic friends who had
come to condole with Dona Maria.That placid woman, however, had not
lost in any degree her wonted calm, even though her companions held
forth with much impassioned declamation against the indignity which
had been heaped upon her worthy consort.She was not with her foster-mother, nor did his inquiry reveal her
whereabouts.He smiled sadly, as he thought of her out on the shales,
her customary refuge when storms broke.He started in search of her;
but as he passed through the _plaza_ Manuela Cortez met him."Padre,"
she exclaimed, "is the little Carmen to go to jail, too?""Manuela--why do you say that?"he asked
hurriedly, his heart starting to beat like a trip-hammer."Because, Padre, I saw the constable, Fernando, take her into Don
Mario's house some time ago."Jose uttered an exclamation and started for the house of the Alcalde.Don Mario stood at the door, his huge bulk denying the priest
admission."Carmen--you have her here?"Fernando, who had been sitting just within the door, rose and came to
his chief's side.Fernando stepped
outside and took his arm.The Alcalde's unlovely face expanded in a
sinister leer."It is permissible to place even a priest in the
stocks, if he becomes _loco_," he said significantly.Fernando spoke quickly:

"It was necessary to take the girl in custody, too, Padre.But do not
worry; she is safe.""But--you have no right to take her--"

"There, _Senor Padre_, calm yourself.What right had you to separate
her from her father?"And, Don Mario, you have no
authority but his--"

"You mistake, _Senor Padre_," calmly interrupted the Alcalde.he muttered, scarce hearing
his own words."The Bishop's, _Senor Padre_," answered Don Mario, with a cruel grin.But--the old man--"

"_Na_, _Senor Padre_, but the Bishop is fairly young, you know.That
is, the new one--"

"The new one!""To be sure, _Senor Padre_, the new Bishop--formerly Senor Don
Wenceslas Ortiz."Jose beat the air feebly as his hand sought his damp brow."_Bien_, _Senor Padre_," put in Fernando gently, pitying the priest's
agony.The old Bishop of Cartagena died suddenly some days ago, and Don
Wenceslas at once received the temporary appointment, until the
vacancy can be permanently filled.There is talk of making Cartagena
an archbishopric, and so a new bishop will not be appointed until that
question is settled.Meanwhile, Don Wenceslas administers the affairs
of the Church there.""And he--he--" stammered the stunned priest."To be sure, _Senor Padre_," interrupted Don Mario, laughing aloud;
"the good Don Wenceslas no doubt has learned of the beautiful Carmen,
and he cannot permit her to waste her loveliness in so dreary a place
as Simiti.And so he summons her to Cartagena, in care of his agent,
Padre Diego, who awaits the girl now in Banco to conduct her safely
down the river.At least, this is what Padre Diego writes me._Bien_,
it is the making of the girl, to be so favored by His Grace!"Jose staggered and would have fallen, had not Fernando supported him.But as he went he spitefully hurled
back:

"_Bien_, _Senor Padre_, whom have you to blame but yourself?Mary moved to the office.You keep
a child from her suffering father--you give all your time to her,
neglecting the other poor children of your parish--you send Rosendo
into the mountains to search for La Libertad--you break your
agreement with me, for you long ago said that we should work
together--is it not so?You find gold in the mountains, but you do
not tell me._Na_, you work against me--you oppose my authority as
Alcalde--_Bien_, you opposed even the authority of the good
Bishop--may he rest with the Saints!You have not made a good priest
for Simiti, _Senor Padre_--_na_, you have made a very bad one!And
now you wonder that the good Don Wenceslas takes the girl from you,
to bring her up in the right way.if it is not already too
late to save her from your bad teachings!"His voice steadily rose
while he talked, and ended in a shrill pipe.Jose made as if to reach him; but Fernando held him back.The Alcalde
got quickly within the house and secured the door."Go now to your
home, Padre," urged Fernando; "else I shall call help and put you in
the stocks, too!"shouted
Jose desperately, struggling to gain the Alcalde's door.cried Fernando, holding to the frenzied man."The little Carmen--she is not in there!"Then where is she, Fernando?--for God's sake tell
me!"Great beads of perspiration stood
upon his face, and tears rolled down his drawn cheeks."_Bien_, Padre," he said gently;
"come away.I give you my word that the girl is not in the house of
the Alcalde.But I am not permitted to say where she is.""Then I will search every house in Simiti!""_Na_, Padre, you would not find her.He took Jose's arm again and led him, blindly stumbling, to the parish
house.By this time the little town was agog with excitement.People ran from
house to house, or gathered on the street corners, discussing the
event."_Caramba!_" shrilled one wrinkled beldame, "but Simiti was very quiet
until the _Cura_ came!""_Na_, senora," cried another, "say, rather, until that wicked little
hada was brought here by Rosendo!""_Cierto_, she is an _hada_!"put in a third; "she cured Juanita of
goitre by her charms!I myself saw her come from
the old church on the hill one day!_Bien_, what was she doing?I say,
she was talking with the bad angel which the blessed Virgin has locked
in there!""Yes, and I have seen her coming from the cemetery.She talks with the
buzzards that roost on the old wall, and they are full of evil
spirits!""And she brought the plague two years ago--who knows?"But it was not the real plague, anyway.""_Bueno_, and that proves that she caused it, no?""_Cierto_, _senora_, she cast a spell on the town!"Jose sat in his little house like one in a dream.Dona Maria had gone to the jail to see Rosendo.Juan had
returned that morning to Bodega Central, and Lazaro was at work on the
plantation across the lake.Jose thought bitterly that the time had
been singularly well chosen for the _coup_.Don Mario's last words
burned through his tired brain like live coals.In a sense the Alcalde
was right.He had been selfishly absorbed in the girl.But he alone,
excepting Rosendo, had any adequate appreciation of the girl's real
nature.To the stagnant wits of Simiti she was one of them, but with
singular characteristics which caused the more superstitious and less
intelligent to look upon her as an uncanny creature, possessed of
occult powers.Moreover, Jose had duped Don Mario with assurances of cooeperation.He
had allowed him to believe that Rosendo was searching for La Libertad,
and that he should participate in the discovery, if made.Had his
course been wholly wise, after all?it was all to save an innocent child from the blackest
of fates!If he had been stronger himself, this never could have
happened.Or, perhaps, if he had not allowed himself to be lulled to
sleep by a fancied security bred of those long months of quiet, he
might have been awake and alert to meet the enemy when he returned to
the attack.the devil had left him for a season, and Jose had
laid down "the shield of faith," while he lost himself in the
intellectual content which the study of the new books purchased with
his ancestral gold had afforded.But evil sleeps not; and with a
persistency that were admirable in a better cause, it returned with
unbated vigor at the moment the priest was off his guard.*       *       *       *       *

Dawn broke upon a sleepless night for Jose.The Alcalde had sent word
that Fernando must remain with the priest, and that no visits would be
permitted to Rosendo in the jail.Jose had heard nothing from Carmen,
and, though often during the long night he sought to know, as she
would, that God's protection rested upon her; and though he sought
feebly to prove the immanence of good by knowing no evil, the morning
found him drawn and haggard, with corroding fear gnawing his desolate
heart.Fernando remained mute; and Dona Maria could only learn that
the constable had been seen leading the girl into Don Mario's house
shortly after Rosendo's arrest.At an early hour the people, buzzing with excitement, assembled for
the trial, which was held in the town hall, a long, empty adobe house
of but a single room, with dirt floor, and a few rough benches.The
Alcalde occupied a broken chair at one end of the room.The trial
itself was of the simplest order: any person might voice his opinion;
and the final verdict was left to the people.In a shaking voice, his frame tremulous with nervous agitation,
Rosendo recounted the birth of the child at Badillo, and the manner of
her coming into his family.He told of Diego's appointment to Simiti,
and of the loss of his own daughter.Waxing more and more energetic as
his recital drew out, he denounced Diego as the prince of liars, and
as worthy of the violent end which he was certain to meet if ever that
renegade priest should venture near enough for him to lay his hands
upon him.The little locket was produced, and all present commented on
the probable identity of the girl's parents.Many affected to detect a
resemblance to Diego in the blurred photograph of the man.Don Mario swore loudly that it could be no other.Diego had often talked to him, sorrowfully, and in terms of deepest
affection, about the beautiful woman whose love he had won, but whom
his vows of celibacy prevented from making his lawful wife.The
Alcalde's recital was dramatic to a degree, and at its close several
excitedly attempted to address the multitude at the same time.Oratory flowed on an ever rising tide, accompanied by much violent
gesticulation and expectoration by way of emphasis.At length it was
agreed that Diego had been, in times past, a bad man, but that the
verbal proofs which he had given the Alcalde were undoubtedly valid,
inasmuch as the Bishop stood behind them--and Don Mario assured the
people that they were most certainly vouched for by His Grace.The day
was almost carried when the eloquent Alcalde, in glowing rhetoric,
painted the splendid future awaiting the girl, under the patronage of
the Bishop.How cruel to retain her in dreary little Simiti, even
though Diego's claim still remained somewhat obscure, when His Grace,
learning of her talents, had summoned her to Cartagena to be educated
in the convent for a glorious future of service to God!Ah, that a
like beautiful career awaited all the children of Simiti!Jose at length forced himself before the people and begged them to
listen to him.But, when he opened his mouth, the words stumbled and
halted.To tell these people that he was
striving to educate the girl away from them was impossible.To say
that he was trying to save her from the Church would be fatal.And to
reiterate that Diego's claim was a fabrication, added nothing of value
to the evidence, for what did he know of the child's parentage?He
feebly begged them to wait until Diego's claim had been either
corroborated or annulled.But no; they had the Bishop's corroboration,
and that sufficed.cried Don Mario, interrupting the
priest in a loud voice, "if we oppose the Bishop, then will he send
the government soldiers to us--and you know what--"

"_Cielo_, yes!"The case now
rested with her God.The people drew apart in little groups to discuss the matter.Don
Mario's beady eyes searched them, until he was certain of the way the
tide was flowing."_Bueno_, _amigos y amigas_," he began with immense dignity; "what say
you if we sum up the case as follows: The proofs have the support of
the Bishop, and show that the girl is the daughter of Padre Diego.Rosendo is guilty of having kept her from her own father, and for that
he should be severely punished.Let him be confined in the jail for
six months, and be forced to pay to us a fine of one thousand _pesos
oro_--"

"_Caramba_!but he has no such sum," cried the people with mouths
agape."_Bien_, I say he can get it!"retorted the Alcalde, looking meaningly
at Jose."And he should pay it for depriving the child of a father's
love and the religious instruction which he would have given her!""Will you not remember that more than that amount is due Rosendo for
the care of the child?The whimsical, fickle people broke into excited exclamations."_Cierto!_"

"The _Cura_ is right!""Let Rosendo pay no fine--he has no gold, anyway!"The Alcalde saw that he had gone a bit too far."_Bueno_, then," he
amended."We will cancel both the fine and Padre Diego's debt to
Rosendo, and the sentence shall be reduced to--what say you all?""A month in the jail, Don Mario, no more," suggested one.An exclamation of approval from the crowd drowned the protest which
Jose sought vainly to voice.Rosendo rose quickly; but Fernando and
others seized him."_Bien_, it is approved," bawled the Alcalde, waving his thick arms."Take the prisoner to the _carcel_, _Senor Policia_," turning to the
constable."And the girl, Senor the Alcalde--when will you send her to her
father?""Yes, Don Mario, she must be taken to Padre Diego at once," piped a
woman's shrill voice."_Bien_," shouted the Alcalde, following his words with a long, coarse
laugh, "I was wise enough to know what you would decide, and sent the
girl down the river last night!"CHAPTER 25


The candles and smoky oil lamps of Banco threw a fitful shimmer out
upon the great river, casting huge, spectral shadows across its muddy,
swirling waters, and seeming rather to intensify the blackness that
lay thick and menacing upon its restless bosom.Rivermen who follow
their hazardous calling along the Magdalena do not lightly risk the
dangers of travel by night in their native canoes, when at any moment
a false stroke, a sudden crash against a tossing forest tree, and a
cry through the inky blackness, might sound to the straining ears of
hushed listeners on the distant banks the elements of another of the
mighty river's grim nocturnal tragedies.But on the night following the trial of Rosendo in distant Simiti a
canoe stole like a thing ashamed through the heavy shadows along the
river's margin, and poked its blunt nose into the ooze at the upper
edge of the town.Its two scantily clad _bogas_, steaming with
perspiration and flecked with mud from the charged waters, sprang
lightly from the frail craft and quickly made it fast to one of the
long stilts upon which a ramshackle frame house rested.Then they
assisted the third occupant of the canoe, a girl, to alight; and
together they wended their way up the slippery bank and toward the
town above."_Caramba_, _compadre_!"ejaculated one of the men, stumbling into a
deep rut, "it is well you know where we go.but I travel no
more on the river by night.And, _compadre_, we had best ask Padre
Diego to offer a candle to the Virgin for our safe arrival, no?"Don Diego has much
influence with virgins.""_Bien, amigo_, what would you?You are well paid; and besides, you
score against that baby-faced priest, Jose, who drove you out of
Simiti because you were not married to your woman.You cannot
complain, _compadre_.""_Caramba!_ I have yet to see the color of the _pesos_.I do not much
trust your Padre Diego.""_Na, amigo_, a bit of rum will put new life into your soaked gizzard._Cierto_, this trip down the river was a taste of purgatory; but you
know we may as well get used to it here, for when we _pobres_ are dead
who will buy Masses to get us out?""_Caramba!_" muttered the other sullenly, as he stumbled on through
the darkness, "but if we have no money the priests will let us burn
forever!"The girl went along with the men silently and without complaint, even
when her bare feet slipped into the deep ruts in the trail, or were
painfully bruised and cut by the sharp stones and bits of wood that
lay in the narrow path.The man addressed as Julio
assisted her to her feet.The other broke into a torrent of profane
abuse."_Na, Ricardo,_" interrupted Julio, "hold your foolish tongue and let
the girl alone!You and I have cursed all the way from Simiti, but she
has made no complaint._Caramba_, I wish I were well
out of this business!"A few minutes later they struck one of the main thoroughfares.Then
the men stopped to draw on their cotton shirts and trousers before
entering the town.The road was better here, and they made rapid
progress.The night was far spent, and the streets were deserted.In
the main portion of the town ancient Spanish lamps, hanging
uncertainly in their sconces against old colonial houses, threw a
feeble light into the darkness.Before one of the better of these
houses Julio and the girl were halted by their companion."_Bien_," he said, "it is here that the holy servant of God lives._Caramba_, but may his _garrafon_ be full!"They entered the open door and mounted the stone steps.On the floor
above they paused in the rotunda, and Ricardo called loudly.A side
door opened and a young woman appeared, holding a lighted candle
aloft."_El Senor Padre, senorita
Ana?_" he said, bowing low."You will do us the favor to announce our
arrival, no?"The woman stared uncomprehendingly at the odd trio."The Padre is not
here," she finally said."_Dios y diablo!_" cried Ricardo, forgetting his courtesy."But we
have risked our skins to bring him the brat, and he not here to
receive and reward us!_Caramba!_"

"But--Ricardo, he is out with friends to-night--he may return at any
moment.She stepped
forward, holding the candle so that its light fell full upon her face.As she did this the girl darted toward her and threw herself into the
woman's arms.she cried, her voice breaking with emotion, "Anita--I am
Carmen!The little Carmen,
my father's--"

"Yes, Anita, I am padre Rosendo's Carmen--and yours!"Ana clasped the girl in her arms.What brings
you here, of all places?""As you may see, senorita, it is
we who have brought her here, at the command of her father, Padre
Diego."And, since you say he is not in, we must wait until he
returns."Carmen clung to her, while
Ricardo stood looking at them, with a foolish leer on his face.Julio
drew back into the shadow of the wall."_Bien, senorita_," said Ricardo, stepping up to the child and
attempting to take her arm, "we will be held to account for the girl,
and we must not lose her._Caramba!_ For then would the good Padre
damn us forever!"Julio emerged swiftly from the shadow and
laid a restraining hand on Ricardo.The woman tore Carmen from his
grasp and thrust the girl behind herself."_Cierto_, friend Ricardo,
we are all responsible for her," she said quickly."But you are tired
and hungry--is it not so?Let me take you to the _cocina_, where you
will find roast pig and a bit of red rum.""_Caramba!_ my throat is like the ashes
of purgatory!""Come, then," said the woman, holding Carmen tightly by the hand and
leading the way down the steps to the kitchen below.Arriving there,
she lighted an oil lamp and hurriedly set out food and a large
_garrafon_ of Jamaica rum."There, _compadre_, is a part of your reward.And we will now wait
until Padre Diego arrives, is it not so?"While the men ate and drank voraciously, interpolating their actions
at frequent intervals with bits of vivid comment on their river trip,
the woman cast many anxious glances toward the steps leading to the
floor above.From time to time she replenished Ricardo's glass, and
urged him to drink.Physical exhaustion
and short rations while on the river had prepared him for just what
the woman most desired to accomplish, and as glass after glass of the
fiery liquor burned its way down his throat, she saw his scant wit
fading, until at last it deserted him completely, and he sank into a
drunken torpor.Then, motioning to Julio, who had consumed less of the
rum, she seized the senseless Ricardo by the feet, and together they
dragged him out into the _patio_ and threw him under a _platano_
tree."But, senorita--" began Julio in remonstrance, as thoughts of Diego's
wrath filtered through his befuddled brain."Not a word, _hombre_!""If you lay a
hand upon this child my knife shall find your heart!""How much did Padre Diego say he would give you?""Three _pesos oro_--and rations," replied the man thickly."Wait here, then, and I will bring you the money."Still retaining Carmen's hand, she mounted the steps, listening
cautiously for the tread of her master.Reaching the rotunda above,
she drew Carmen into the room from which she had emerged before, and,
bidding her conceal herself if Diego should arrive, took her wallet
and hastily descended to where the weaving Julio waited."There, _amigo_," she said hurriedly, handing him the money."Now do
you go--at once!And do not remain in Banco, or Padre Diego will
surely make you trouble.She
pointed to the door; and Julio, impressed with a sense of his danger,
lost no time in making his exit.Returning to Carmen, the woman seated herself and drew the girl to
her.she cried, trembling, as her eyes searched the
girl."I do not know, Anita dear," murmured the girl, nestling close to the
woman and twining an arm about her neck; "except that day before
yesterday the Alcalde put padre Rosendo into the jail--"

"Into the jail!"And then, when I was going to see him, Fernando ran
out of Don Mario's house and told me I must go in and see the Alcalde.Julio Gomez and this man Ricardo were there talking with Don Mario in
the _patio_.Then they threw a _ruana_ over me and carried me out
through the _patio_ and around by the old church to the Boque trail.When we got to the trail they made me walk with them to the Inanea
river, where they put me into a canoe.They paddled fast, down to the
Boque river; then to the Magdalena; and down here to Banco.They did
not stop at all, except when steamboats went by--oh, Anita, I never
saw a steamboat before!But Padre
Jose had often told me about them.And when the big boats passed us
they made me lie down in the canoe, and they put the _ruana_ over me
and told me if I made any noise they would throw me into the river.But I knew if I just kept still and knew--really _knew_--that God
would take care of me, why, He would.And, you see, He did, for He
brought me to you."A tired sigh escaped her lips as she laid her head
on the woman's shoulder."But--oh, _Santa Maria_!"moaned the woman, "you are not safe here!What can I do?--what can I do?""Well, Anita dear, you can know that God is here, can't you?I knew
that all the way down the river.And, oh, I am so glad to see you!Why, just think, it is eight years since you used to play with me!And
now we will go back to Simiti, will we not, Anita?""Pray to the Virgin to help us, child!You may have influence with
her--I have none, for my soul is lost!""Why, Anita dear, that is not true!You and I are both God's children,
and He is right here with us.All we have to do is to know it--just
really _know_ it.""But, tell me, quick--Diego may be here any moment--why did he send
Ricardo for you?""Anita dear, Padre Diego says I am his
child.""Yes--his daughter--that he is my father.But--is it really so,
Anita?""_Madre de Dios!_" cried the woman.He
saw you in Simiti when he was last there--and you are now a
beautiful--No, child, you are not his daughter!The wretch lies--he is
a sink of lies!"Why, no, Anita dear, he is not a beast--we must love him, for he is
God's child, too," said Carmen, patting the woman's wet cheek with her
soft hand."_Carita_, he
is Satan himself!"I don't mean that what you think you see is God's child, Anita dear;
but that what you think you see stands for God's child, and isn't
real.And if we know that, why, we will see the real child of God--the
real man--and not what you call a beast."Carmen
looked about the room."Oh, Anita," she exclaimed, "what a beautiful
place, and what beautiful things you have!"She rubbed the tile floor
with her bare foot."Why, Anita dear, it is just like the palaces
Padre Jose has told me about!"She walked around the room, touching
the various toilet articles on the dresser, passing her hands
carefully over the upholstered chairs, and uttering exclamations of
wonder and delight.The woman looked up with a wan smile."_Chiquita_, they are nothing.They are all cheap trinkets--nothing compared with what there is in
the big world beyond us.You poor dear, you have lived all your life
in miserable little Simiti, and you haven't the slightest idea of what
there is in the world!""But, Anita dear, Simiti is beautiful," the girl protested.You have seen only this poor room, and you think it wonderful.I have
been to Barranquilla and Cartagena with Padre Diego, and have seen
houses a thousand times more beautiful than this.And yet, even those
are nothing to what there is in the world outside."Carmen went to the bed and passed her hand over the white counterpane."Anita--why, is this--is this your--"

"Yes, _chiquita_, it is my bed.You have never seen a real bed, poor
little thing.""But--" the child's eyes were wide with wonder--"it is so soft--you
sink way into it--oh, so soft--like the heron's feathers!I didn't
sleep at all in the canoe--and I am so tired."cried the woman, springing up and clasping the
girl in her arms.When he returns, he may come
right up here!_Santa Maria_, help me!--what shall I do?""Anita--let me sleep in your bed--it is so soft--but--" looking down
dubiously at her muddy feet.The woman's face had set in grim determination.She went to the dresser and took out a small stiletto, which she
quickly concealed in the bosom of her dress."Get right in, just as you
are!I will take care of Diego, if he comes!_Santa Maria_, I will--"

"Anita dear," murmured the girl, sinking down between the white
sheets, "you and I will just _know_ that God is everywhere, and
that He will take care of us, and of Padre Diego too."With a sigh
of contentment the child closed her eyes."Anita dear," she
whispered softly, "wasn't He good to bring me right to you?And
to-morrow we will go back to Simiti--and to padre Rosendo--and Padre
Jose--and--and Cantar-las-horas--you haven't seen him for such a long
time--such a long--long--Anita dear, I--love--you--"

The child dropped asleep, just as a heavy step fell outside the door.Ana sprang up and extinguished the lamp, then went quickly out into
the rotunda.Padre Diego was standing on the top step, puffing and
weaving unsteadily.The woman hurried to him and passed an arm about
his waist.she exclaimed in a tone of feigned solicitation."I feared you
had met with an accident!My heart beats like the patter of rain!Why
do you stay out so late and cause me worry?"The bloated face of the man leered like a Jack-o'-lantern."Spiritual
retreat, my love--spiritual retreat," he muttered thickly."Imbibing
the spirits, you know."The woman gave him a look of inexpressible disgust."But you are home
safe, at any rate," she said in a fawning voice; "and my fear is
quieted.Come now, and I will help you into bed.she
cried, as he lurched toward the door of the room where Carmen lay; "in
your own room to-night!"He swayed to and fro before her, as she stood with her back against
the door."_Nombre de Dios_!"he muttered, "but you grow daily more unkind to
your good Padre!_Bien_, it is well that I have a fresh little
housekeeper coming!"He made again as if to enter the room.The woman
threw her arms about his neck."Padre dear," she appealed, "have you ceased to love your Anita?She
would spend this night alone; and can you not favor her this once?"he croaked in peevish suspicion, "but I think you have a
paramour in there._Bien_, I will go in and shrive his wicked soul!"cried the desperate woman, her hand
stealing to the weapon concealed in her dress."Pepito came this
evening with the case of _Oporto_ which you ordered long ago from
Spain.I put it in your study, for I knew you would want to sample it
the moment you returned."he cried, turning upon her, "why do you not tell me
important things as soon as I arrive?I marvel that you did not wait
until morning to break this piece of heavenly news!_Bien_, come to
the study, and you shall open a bottle for me.but my throat
is seared with Don Antonio's vile rum!My parched soul panteth for the
wine of the gods that flows from sunny Spain!_Caramba_, woman, give
yourself haste!"Suffering himself to be led by her, he staggered across the rotunda
and into the room where long before he had entertained for a brief
hour Don Jorge and the priest Jose.Ana quickly broke the neck of a
bottle of the newly arrived wine and gave him a generous measure.murmured the besotted priest, sinking into a
chair and sipping the beverage; "it is the nectar of Olympus--triple
distilled through tubes of sunlight and perfumed with sweet airs and
the smiles of voluptuous _houris_!Ah, Lord above, you are good to
your little Diego!Another sip, my lovely Ana--and bring me the
cigarettes.And come, fat lass, do you sit beside me and twine your
graceful arms about my neck, while your soft breath kisses my old
cheek!Ah, _Dios_, who would not be human!the good God may
keep His heaven, if He will but give me the earth!"Ana drew his head against her bosom and murmured hypocritical words of
endearment in his ear, while she kept his glass full.Diego babbled
like a child.He nodded; struggled to keep awake; and at length fell
asleep with his head on her shoulder.Then she arose, and, assured
that he would be long in his stupor, extinguished the light and
hurried to her own room.The woman bent over her with the
lighted candle and looked long and wistfully.she
prayed, "if you will but save her, you may do what you will with me!"Tears flowed freely down her cheeks as she turned to the door and
threw the bolt.Coming back to the bed, she again bent over the
sleeping girl._Dios mio_--and that beast, he has seen her, and he would--ah,
_Dios_!"Going again to the dresser, she took from a drawer a sandalwood
rosary.Then she returned to the bed and knelt beside the child."Blessed Virgin," she prayed, while her hot tears fell upon the beads,
"I am lost--lost!Ah, I have not told my beads for many years--I
cannot say them now!_Santa Virgen_, pray for me--pray for me--and if
I kill him to-morrow, tell the blessed Saviour that I did it for the
child!Ah, _Santa Virgen_, how beautiful she is--how pure--what
hair--she is from heaven--_Santa Virgen_, you will protect her?""_Madre de Dios_--she is so beautiful, so
pure--"

Carmen moved slightly, and the woman rose hastily from her knees."Anita dear," murmured the child, "Jesus waked Lazarus--out of
his--sleep.she murmured when Carmen again
slept, "I am too wicked to sleep with so pure an angel!--no, I can
not!She spread a light shawl upon the tile floor near the window and lay
down upon it, drawing a lace _mantilla_ over her face to protect it
from the mosquitoes."_Santa Virgen_", she murmured repeatedly, "pray
the blessed Saviour to protect her to-morrow--pray for her, _Madre de
Dios_--pray for her!"*       *       *       *       *

The piercing shriek of a steamboat whistle roused the woman just as
the first harbingers of dawn spread over the river a crimson flush
that turned it into a stream of blood.Ana bent
over her and left a kiss on her forehead.Then she stole out of the
room and into the study.Padre Diego lay sunk in his chair like a
monster toad.The woman threw him a look of utter loathing, and then
hastily descended into the _patio_.Ricardo lay under the _platano_
tree, sleeping heavily."Padre Diego sends
you this money, and bids you go.She held out a roll of _pesos_.The man, after much vigorous persuasion, got heavily to his feet."_Caramba, senorita_!""That last
_tragito_--it was a bit too much, no?But--_Bien_, I would see the
good Padre.But, senorita, do me
the great favor to ask the good Padre to see me one little moment.He fumbled in his wallet and drew
out an envelope.He--"

"_Caramba_!"ejaculated the man loudly, as his senses returned."But I
believe there is something wrong here!_Bien_, now I shall see the
Padre!He pushed the woman aside and entered
the house.Ana started after him, and seized his arm.A scuffle ensued, and
Ricardo's voice was loud and shrill as they reached the stairs."Ricardo--anything you ask--double the
amount, if you will go!Leave the house--I will tell the Padre--I will
give him the letter--"

"_Caramba_, but I will see him myself!"shouted the lightheaded
Ricardo."_Bien,
enamorada_, is this the paramour whom you hid in your room last night?_Caramba_, you might have chosen a handsomer one!"Ana sank down with a moan and buried her face in her hands.Diego
heavily descended the stairs."_Bien_, so it is you!"I do not know, Padre," cried the man excitedly."Senorita Ana, she
made me drunk last night.I brought the girl--I waited for you, but
the senorita--"

"_Caramba_, I understand!"Ana had risen and was making for the stairs.Diego sprang to her and
seized her by the wrist.With her free hand she drew the stiletto from
her bosom and raised it to strike.Ricardo saw the movement, and threw
himself upon her.cried Diego, as Ricardo felled the woman and wrenched the
weapon from her grasp."My pretty angel, you have the venom of a
serpent!did you think to deceive your doting Padre?But--_Dios nos guarde_!"Carmen, awakened by the noise, had left her bed, and now stood at the
head of the stairs, looking with dilated eyes at the strange scene
being enacted below.Ana lay on the ground, her eyes strained
toward the girl.Ricardo bent over her, awaiting his master's command.He knew now that she had forever lost her power over the priest.Diego
stood like a statue, his eyes riveted upon Carmen.The girl looked
down upon them from the floor above with an expression of wonder, yet
without fear.Diego was the first to find his voice.At last you come to your lonely padre!Wait for me, _hermosissima_!"screamed Ana in a
voice of horror.Ricardo clapped his hand heavily over her mouth.he panted, feasting his eyes upon her, while a thrill
passed through his coarse frame."_Madre de Dios_, but you have grown
beautiful!Don Mario was right--you are surely the most voluptuous
object in human form that has ever crossed my path._Bien_, the
blessed God is still good to his little Diego!"He started away with her, but was detained by the loud voice of
Ricardo."_Bien_, Padre, my pay!""_Cierto, hombre_!"But--a
father's joy--ah!_Bien_, come to me to-morrow--"

"_Na, Senor Padre_, but to-day--now!I have risked my life--and I have
a wife and babes!"_Caramba_, ugly beast, but I will consign you to hell!There are more convenient seasons than this for your
business!"And, still holding tightly to the girl's hand, he led her
into the study.The woman turned upon Ricardo with the fury of a tiger."This will cost your life, for you have
put into his dirty hands the soul of an angel, and he will damn it!If you had only taken the money I brought you--"

"Demon-tongue, I will take it now!"He snatched the roll of bills from
her hand and bolted through the door.With a low moan the woman sank
to the ground, while oblivion drew its sable veil across her mind.Reaching the study, Diego pushed Carmen into the room and then
followed, closing the door after him and throwing the iron bolt.Turning about, he stood with arms akimbo upon his bulging hips and
gazed long and admiringly at the girl as she waited in expectant
wonder before him.A smile of satisfaction and triumph slowly spread
over his coarse features.Then it faded, and his heavy jowls and deep
furrows formed into an expression, sinister and ominous, through which
lewdness, debauchery, and utter corruption looked out brazenly,
defiantly, into the fair, open countenance of the young girl before
him.A sense of weariness and dull pain then seemed to follow.He
shook his heavy head and passed a hand across his brow, as if to brush
aside the confusion left by the previous night's potations.he muttered, falling heavily into a chair, "but had
I known you were here, little rosebud, I should have tried to keep
sober."He reached out to grasp her; but she eluded him and went
quickly to the open window, where she stood looking down into the
street below.The morning sunlight, streaming into the room, engulfed
her in its golden flood and transmuted the child of earth into a
creature divinely radiant, despite the torn gown and stains of river
travel."_Bien, carisima_," the man wheedled in a small, caressing voice,
"where is your greeting to your glad padre?he muttered,
his eyes roving over her full figure, "but the Virgin herself was
never more lovely!Come, daughter," he purred, extending his arms;
"come to a father's heart that now, praise the Saints!shall ache no
more for its lost darling."The girl faced about and looked at him for a few moments.What her
glance conveyed, the man was utterly incapable of understanding.Then
she drew up a chair that stood near the window, and sinking into it,
buried her face in her hands."_Caramba_, my smile of heaven!chirped Diego,
affecting surprise."Is it thus you celebrate your homecoming?Or are
these, perchance, fitting tears of joy?_Bien_, your padre's doting
heart itself weeps that its years of loneliness are at last ended."He
held the sleeve of his gown to his eyes and sniffed affectedly."_Bien_, and what then?""I was just knowing," she answered slowly, "that I was not afraid--that
God was everywhere, even right here--and that He would not let any
harm come to me."and you ask Him to protect you from your adoring father!He again held
out his arms to her."I am not afraid--now," she answered softly."But--I do not think God
will let me come to you.If you were really my father, He would."The man's mouth gaped in astonishment.A fleeting sense of shame
swept through his festering mind.Then the lustful meanness of his
corrupted soul welled up anew, and he laughed brutally.The idea
was delightfully novel; the girl beautifully audacious; the situation
piquantly amusing.He would draw her out to his further enjoyment."So," he observed parenthetically, "I judge you are on quite familiar
terms with God, eh?"The joke was excellent, and he roared with mirth.he
commented, reaching over and uncorking with shaking hand the bottle
that stood on the table.Then, filling a glass, "Suppose you thank Him
for sending his little Diego this estimable wine and your own charming
self, eh?Whereat he guffawed loudly and
slapped his bulging sides.The girl had already bowed her head again in her hands.Diego's beady eyes devoured the beautiful creature before him."_Bien_, little Passion flower," he
interrupted, "if you have conveyed to Him my infinite gratitude,
perhaps He will now let you come to me, eh?""I have thanked
Him, Padre--for you and for me," she said; "for you, that you really
are His child, even if you don't know it; and for me that I know He
always hears me.That was what the good man Jesus said, you know, when
he waked Lazarus out of the death-sleep.And so I
kept thanking Him all the way down the river."Diego's eyes bulged as if they would pop from his head, and his mouth
fell open wide, but no sound issued therefrom.The girl went on
quietly:

"I was not afraid on the river, Padre.And I was not afraid to come in
here with you.I knew, just as the good man Jesus did at the tomb of
Lazarus, that God had heard me--He just couldn't be God if He hadn't,
you know.And then I remembered what the good man said about not
resisting evil; for, you know, if we resist evil we make it real--and
we never, _never_ can overcome anything real, can we?So I resisted
evil with good, just as Jesus told us to do.I just _knew_ that God
was everywhere, and that evil was unreal, and had no power at all.And
so the _bogas_ didn't hurt me coming down the river.And you--you will
not either, Padre."Then, very seriously:

"Padre, one reason why I was not afraid to come in here with you was
that I thought God might want to talk to you through me, and I could
help you.The man settled back in his chair and stared stupidly at her.His face
expressed utter consternation, confusion, and total lack of
comprehension.Once he muttered under his breath, "_Caramba_!she is
surely an _hada_!"Absorbed in her
mission, she went on earnestly:

"You know, Padre, we are all channels through which God talks to
people--just like the _asequia_ out there in the street through which
the water flows.We are all channels for divine love--so Padre Jose
says."The priest sat before her like a huge pig, his little eyes blinking
dully, and his great mouth still agape."We are never afraid of real things, Padre, you know; and so I
couldn't be afraid of the real 'you,' for that is a child of God.And
the other 'you' isn't real.But such thoughts are not really ours, you know, for they don't come
from God.But," she laughed softly, "when I saw you coming up the
steps after me this morning--well, lots of fear-thoughts came to
me--why, they just seemed to come pelting down on me like the rain.I turned right on them, just as I've
seen Cucumbra turn on a puppy that was nagging him, and I said, 'Here,
now, I know what you are; I know you don't come from God; and anything
that doesn't come from God isn't really anything at all!'And so they
stopped pelting me.The good man Jesus knew, didn't he?That's why he
said so often, 'Be not afraid.'"Her big eyes sparkled, and her
face glowed with celestial light.Diego raised a heavy arm and,
groping for the bottle, eagerly drained another glass of wine."You think that wine makes you happy, don't you, Padre?"she observed,
watching him gulp down the heavy liquor.It just
gives you what Padre Jose calls a false sense of happiness.And when
that false sense passes away--for everything unreal has just _got_ to
pass away--why, then you are more unhappy than you were before.he
ejaculated, "will you rein that runaway tongue!""No, Padre," she replied evenly, "for it is God who is talking to you.You ought to, for you are a priest.You ought to
know Him as well as the good man Jesus did.Padre, can you lay your
hands on the sick babies and cure them?"The man squirmed uncomfortably for a moment, and then broke into
another brutal laugh.but we find it easier
to raise new babies than to cure sick ones!do _hadas_ have such voluptuous bodies, such plump legs!_Madre de Dios_, girl, enough of your preaching!"No, Padre," she answered quietly, "I do not want to come to you.But
I want to talk to you--"

"_Dios y diablo_!with a Venus before
me do you think I yearn for a sermon?delay it, delay it--"

"Padre," she interrupted, "you do not see _me._ You are looking only
at your bad thoughts of me."His laugh resembled the snort of an animal."Yes, Padre--and they are _very_ bad thoughts, too--they don't come
from God, and you are _so_ foolish to let them use you the way you do.And you know you see around
you only the thoughts that you have been thinking.Why don't you think
good thoughts, and so see only good things?""Can it be
that I don't see a plump little witch before me, but only my bad
thoughts, eh?_Bien_, then," he
coaxed, "come to your poor, deluded padre and let him learn that you
are only a thing of thought, and not the most enchanting little piece
of flesh that ever caused a Saint to fall!"Her smile had fled, and in its place
sadness and pity were written large upon her wistful face."Come, my little bundle of thought," he coaxed, holding out his fat,
hairy arms."No, Padre," the girl answered firmly."_Na_, then, still afraid, eh?""No, Padre; to be afraid would mean that I didn't understand God."Then come to me and prove that you do understand Him, eh?"Are
you invoking curses on the bald pate of your desolate father?""No, Padre; I am thanking God all the time that He is here, and that
He will not let you hurt me."The man's lust-inflamed eyes narrowed and the expression on his evil
face became more sinister.he growled, "will you come
hither, or must I--"

"No."She shook her head slowly, and her heavy curls glistened in the
sunlight."No, Padre, God will not let me come to you."Panting and cursing softly, the man got slowly to his feet."_Madre de
Dios_!"he muttered; "then we will see if your God will let me come to
you!"Her lips moved rapidly, though no
sound came from them.They were forming the words of the psalmist, "In
God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto
me."It was a verse Jose had taught her long since, when his own heart
was bursting with apprehension.She turned quickly as if to
flee.He thrust out his hand and clutched her dress.The flimsy
calico, frayed and worn, tore its full length, and the gown fell to
the floor.Her white body
glistened in the clear sunlight like a marble statue._"Por el amor de Dios_!"ejaculated the priest, straightening up and
regarding her with dull, blinking eyes.Then, like a tiger pouncing
upon a fawn, he seized the unresisting girl in his arms and staggered
back to his chair.he exclaimed, holding her with one arm about her
waist, and with his free hand clumsily pouring another glass of wine.Bien_, pretty thought,
drink with me this thought of wine!"He laughed boisterously at his
crude wit, and forced the glass between her lips."I--am not afraid--I am not afraid," she whispered, drinking."It
cannot hurt me--nor can you.he panted, setting down the glass and mopping his hot
brow, as he settled back into the chair again."You--do--not--love--me, Padre!""You have--only a wrong thought--of me--of love--of everything!""_Bien_--but you love me, pretty creature, is it not so?"he mocked,
holding up her head and kissing her full on the mouth."I--I love the _real_ 'you'--for that is God's image," she murmured,
struggling to hold her face away from his fetid breath."But--I do
not--love the way that image is--is translated--in your human mind!"he threw himself back and gave noisy vent to his
risibility.For the moment the girl seemed to forget that she was in the fell
clutches of a demon incarnate.Her thought strayed back to little
Simiti, to Cucumbra, to Cantar-las-horas, to--ah, was _he_ searching
for her now?And would he come?--

"It was Padre Jose; he taught me," she whispered sadly.The curse of God blast him, the monkey-faced
_mozo!You have a new master
now to give you a few needed lessons, _senorita mia_, and--"

"Padre Diego!"her tense voice checked further expression of his low
thought.You have no power to
harm me, or to teach me anything!She gasped again as his clutch
tightened about her.He
roughly drew the girl up on his knees."To be sure He will protect
you, my _mariposa._ And He is using me as the channel, you see--just
as you said a few moments ago, eh?"His rude laugh again echoed
through the room."He is not--using you--at all!""Evil thoughts are--are
using you.And all--they can do--is to kill themselves--and you!"Is such a sad fate in store for me, my beautiful
_hada_?"He chuckled and reached out again for the bottle."Another
little thought of wine, my love.I must remember to tell Don Antonio of this!--_Maldita_!"Struggling to save its
contents, he relaxed his hold on Carmen.Like a flash she wormed her
supple body out under his arm, slid to the floor, and gained the
window.shrilled Diego, aflame with
wrath.when I lay these hands again on you--!"Struggling to his feet, he made for the girl.But at the first step
the light rug slid along the smooth tiles beneath his uncertain tread.He threw out an arm and sought to grasp the table.But as he did so,
his foot turned under him.With a
groan the heavy man sank to the floor.For a moment Carmen stood as if dazed.Then the
girl picked up her torn dress and approached him carefully."It was
his bad thoughts," she whispered; "he slipped on them; they threw him!I knew it--I just _knew_ it!"Passing to one side, she gained the door, threw back the bolt, and
hurried out into the rotunda.Crouched on the floor, the stiletto
clasped in her hand, sat Ana, her face drenched with tears, and her
chest heaving.When she saw the girl she sprang to her feet.I could not save you;
I could not break through the heavy door; but I can punish him!"She
burst into a flood of tears and started into the room.cried the girl, throwing herself into the woman's arms.He did not hurt me--God would not let him!she whispered in awed tones,
"did God strike him dead?""I don't know, Anita--but come!clinging to the woman's skirt;
"Anita dear, do not go in there!The woman's eyes were wild, her hair loose and disheveled.she cried, "but we will make sure that the beast is dead before we
go!And if we leave this blade in his heart, it may be a warning to
others of his kind!"Your
murder-thoughts will kill you if you do!Listen--it is a
steamboat whistle!Oh, Anita--if it is going up the river--we can take
it--"

Ana hesitated.He may--"

"Yes, Anita, yes; leave him with God!""Come away, Anita--"

"But where, child?"Why--why, my father would kill me!""No, Anita dear; he loves you; he prays for you; he wants you!It is right--it is just what God has planned, I know!Pin
my dress together, and then hurry!"Mechanically she descended the
stairs and left the house, her hand tightly clasped by Carmen.Dully
she suffered herself to be led hurriedly to the river.A boat,
up-bound, was just docking.The captain stood leaning over the rail
and shouting his commands.murmured the weeping woman, hurrying up the gang
plank with the child.She hastened past the astonished passengers to
the captain and drew him to one side."The child--" she gasped, "Rosendo Ariza's--of Simiti--leave her at
Badillo--they will take her over--"

"Wait, senora," interrupted the captain tenderly."Is it not time for
you to go home, too?"He laid a hand on her shoulder and looked down
into her streaming eyes.And, leading them
down the deck, he opened the door of a vacant cabin and bade them
enter."You can tell me your story when we are under way," he said,
smiling as he closed the door."_Bien_," he muttered, his brow
clouding as he strode off."I have been looking for this for some
time.But--the child--Ariza's--ah, the priest Diego!I think I
see--_Caramba_!A few minutes later the big boat, her two long funnels vomiting
torrents of smoke and sparks, thrust her huge wheel into the thick
waters and, swinging slowly out into mid-stream, turned her flat nose
toward the distant falls of Tequendama.In one of her aft cabins a
woman lay on a cot, weeping hysterically.Over her bent a girl, with a
face such as the masters have sought in vain.The tenderly whispered
words might have been the lingering echo of those voiced in the little
moonlit death-chamber of Cartagena long agone."Anita dear, He is with us, right here.And He says, 'Anita, come!'"CHAPTER 26


"But, Padre dear, why are you so surprised that Padre Diego did not
hurt me?I would have been much more surprised if he had.You are
always so astonished when evil doesn't happen--don't you ever look for
good?Why, I don't ever look for anything else!How could I when I
know that God is everywhere?""The sense of evil--it overwhelms
me at times, _carita_--"

"But, Padre dear, why don't you know right then that it is nothing?If
you did, it would fade away, and only good would overwhelm you."She
nestled closer to the man and clasped her arms more tightly about his
neck."Why, Padre," she resumed, "I was not a bit surprised when
Captain Julio came and told us we were near Bodega Central, and that
he could see you and Juan and Lazaro sitting on the steps of the
inn.""Yes, _chiquita_, we were resting for a moment.If a down-river boat
came by we were going to take it.If not, we expected to go in the
canoe.""Padre dear, what did you intend to do in Banco?""Don't speak of it, child--we--"

"Juan and Lazaro have knives."I?--_chiquita_--"

"Padre dear, God never fights with knives.Anita had a knife; but God
wouldn't let her use it.I don't
know what happened to Padre Diego, except that he fell over his wicked
thoughts.You know, Padre dear, somewhere in the Bible you read to me
that 'With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to
help us, and to fight our battles.'I thought of that when Padre Diego
had his arm around me and held me so tight that I could hardly
breathe.It was only an arm of flesh, after, all, and it couldn't hold
me.""_Bien_, Padre," interrupted Juan, coming up from the boat, "if we are
to reach Simiti to-night we must start at once.""_Bueno_, then let us set out," returned Jose, rising.A muffled sob
reached his ears.He turned to the woman huddled in the shadow of the
door."Come, Ana," he said cheerily; "to-night you will again be home.""No, Padre--I do not go with you.In an instant Carmen's arms were around her."When padre
Rosendo sees us, you and me, why--"

"_Carisima_!"The woman's tears flowed fast while she hugged the girl
to her bosom."No--no--he would drive me from his house!I will get work in the _posada_, perhaps.Or Captain Julio
will take me to Honda on his next trip, and get me a place--"

"Then we must ask him to get a place for us both," interrupted Carmen,
sitting calmly down beside her."And think, Anita, how sad padre
Rosendo will be when he sees the men come back without us!"cried the sorrowing
woman, rising."You don't know what it is--"

"Yes, I do, Anita," returned the girl quickly; "it is nothing--just
zero--and you can't drown it!If it would do any good we would both
jump into the river--that is, if God told us to--wouldn't we?But it
doesn't help any to die, you know, for then we would have it all to do
over again.""Ana," said Jose, laying a hand on the woman's shoulder, "you do not
understand her--neither do I, wholly.But if she tells you to go with
us to Simiti, why, I think I would go.He took her hand and led her, weeping, but no longer resisting, down
to the canoe.Carmen followed, dancing like an animated sunbeam."What
fun, oh, what fun!"she chirped, clapping her hands."And just as soon
as we get home we will go right up to the _carcel_ and let padre
Rosendo out!""_Na, chiquita_," said Jose, shaking his head mournfully; "we have no
power to do that.""Well, then, God has," returned the girl, nothing daunted.Juan pushed the heavily laden canoe from its mooring, and set its
direction toward Simiti.Silence drew over the little group, and the
hours dragged while the boat crept slowly along the margin of the
great river.The sun had passed its meridian when the little craft
turned into the _cano._ To Jose the change brought a most grateful
relief.For, though his long residence in Simiti had somewhat inured
him to the intense heat of this low region, he had not yet learned to
endure it with the careless indifference of the natives.Besides, his
mind was filled with vivid memories of the horrors of his first river
trip.And he knew that every future experience on the water would be
tinged by them.In the shaded _cano_ the sunlight, sifting through the interlocking
branches of ancient palms and _caobas_, mellowed and softened into a
veil of yellow radiance that flecked the little stream with splashes
of gold.Juan in the prow with the pole labored in silence.At times
he stopped just long enough to roll a huge cigar, and to feast his
bright eyes upon the fair girl whom he silently adored.Lazaro, as
_patron_, sat in the stern, saturnine and unimpassioned.The woman,
exhausted by the recent mental strain, dozed throughout the journey.Carmen alone seemed alive to her environment.Every foot of advance
unfolded to her new delights.She sang; she chirped; she mimicked the
parrots; she chattered at the excited monkeys.It was with difficulty
that Jose could restrain her when her sharp eyes caught the glint of
brilliant Passion flowers and orchids of gorgeous hue clinging to the
dripping trees.she exclaimed, "they are in us, you know.We see our thoughts of them--and lots of people wouldn't
see anything beautiful about them at all, just because their thoughts
are not beautiful.Padre, we see--what you said to me once--we see our
interpretations of God's ideas, don't we?That is what I told Padre
Diego.But--well, he will just _have_ to see some day, won't he, Padre
dear?But now let us talk in English; you know, I haven't spoken it
for such a long time."What a rare interpretation of the
mind divine was this child!But he wondered why one so pure and
beautiful should attract a mind so carnal as that of Diego.he mused, "it is again that law.Good always stirs up its
suppositional opposite.And the most abundant good and the greatest
purity stir up the most carnal elements of the human mind.The greater the degree of good, the greater the seeming
degree of evil aroused.The perfect Christ stirred the hatred of a
world.Carmen arouses Diego simply because of her purity.Yet she
knows that he can not harm her."His eyes met the girl's, and she answered his unspoken thought in the
tongue which she was fast adopting."We _have_ to love him, you know,
Padre dear."Oh, not the 'him' that
the human mind looks at, but the real 'him,' you know--the 'him' that
is God's image.And you know there just isn't any other 'him,' now is
there?"murmured Jose, "if I could but keep my thought as
straight as she does!""But, Padre dear, your thought _is_ straight.You know, God's thought
is the only thought there really is.Any other thought has the minus
sign, and so it is zero.If we will always think of the real Padre
Diego, and love that, why, the unreal one will fade away from our
thought.""Do you suppose, _chiquita_, that if we love him we will make him
repent?"The child pondered the question for a moment.Then:

"Padre, what did you tell me once about the word'repent'?""It comes from the Greek word '_metanoia_.'""Yes," she reflected; "but what did you say that--"

"Oh, yes, I told you it meant a complete and radical change of
thought."It was heaven to have this girl before him
and to drink in the naive expressions of her active mind."Padre dear, when John the baptiser said, 'Repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand,' did he mean to tell the people that they must have
a complete change of thought?""_Chiquita_," he answered, "I
have no doubt he meant just that.For you have taught me that there
can be no salvation without such a complete and radical change.""No," she said with quick emphasis; "for God is mind, you know.And
His thought is the only real thought there is or can be.The thoughts
of mortals are the opposites of His thoughts, and so they are
illusions, and, like all lies, must pass away.If people want to be
immortal, they must think as God thinks, for He is immortal.They must
stop thinking that there is any power but God.They must stop letting
in thoughts of sickness, of sin, of wickedness, and all those things
that in English you call 'discord.'God says in the Bible, 'As the
heavens are higher than the earth, so are my thoughts higher than your
thoughts.'And if we want to be
like Him we must think His thoughts."I see, _chiquita_--sometimes very clearly--and
then again I don't see," he said slowly.she insisted, getting up on her knees and facing him.And if you hold this thought always, why, it
will--it will be--"

"Externalized; is that what you are trying to say?"Jesus said, 'As a man thinketh in his heart, so is
he.'""But, Carmen--I-- What you say is doubtless true in essence--but I
think you have not grasped it all--there are so many gaps that your
simple little system of religion does not fill in--so many great
questions that you do not answer.I see, in part--and then, again, I
don't see at all.And when you were stolen away from Simiti I saw
nothing but the evil--and it nearly killed me!"The man had always been an
enigma to her.She could not understand a nature that soared into the
spiritual empyrean one moment, and in the next fell floundering into
the bottomless pit of materialism.The undulating curve which
marked the development of the Rincon mind was to her a thing
incomprehensible."Padre dear," she said at length, a little sadly."When you look at
the first chapter in the Bible and read there how God made everything,
and man in His image, in the image of Mind, you see, and are very
happy.But when you go on to the second chapter and read how the Lord
God--not God, but the _Lord_ God--made a man of dirt, and how this
dirt man listened to his false thoughts and fell, why, then you are
unhappy.Can't you see that
one is a story of the real creation; and the other is the human mind's
interpretation of the creation--an interpretation made according to
the way the human mind thinks the creating _ought_ to have been in
matter?And the second chapter shows how
far the human mind can go--it shows how limited it is.The human mind
couldn't get any farther than that--couldn't make a man out of
anything but dirt.And
so it made a creation of its own.It couldn't understand God; and so
it made a Lord God, just like itself.And if you see, can't you _stick_ to it and _live_ it, until all
the unreal passes away?""I will never cease to try,
_chiquita_," he said."But we were talking about loving Diego, weren't
we?Yes, you are right, we must try to love him, for the good Jesus
said we must love our enemies.""But, if we love everybody, then we haven't any enemies.You can't
love a real enemy--and so there aren't any real ones.We see in other
people only what is in our own thought.If we see evil as real, why,
then we will see bad men and women all around us, for we only look at
our thoughts.But, if we look only at God's thoughts--Padre dear, I
didn't see anything but God's thought when Padre Diego had me in his
arms.I knew it wasn't real, but was just the human way of looking at
things.And I knew that love was the great principle of everything,
and that it just couldn't fail, any more than the principle of algebra
could fail to solve my problems.Well," she concluded with a little
sigh, "it didn't.""Dear little girl, you must be patient, very patient, with your
blundering old Padre Jose.He is groping for the light--"

In an instant, throwing the canoe into imminent danger of upsetting,
the impulsive girl had hurled herself into his lap and clasped her
arms about his neck.Juan and Lazaro by a quick and skillful effort
kept the craft upright.she cried, "I didn't mean to say a word that would
make you unhappy--Padre dear, I love you so!Padre, look at your
little girl, and tell her that you love her!"he murmured, "I--I must
not--and--yet--_chiquita_--I adore you!"He buried his face in her
shoulder.Juan made a wry mouth as he looked at the girl in the priest's arms.Then he suggested that a separation would more evenly balance the
boat.Carmen laughed up at him, but slipped down into the keel and sat
with her head propped against Jose's knees."Padre dear," she said, looking up at him with twinkling eyes, "I
heard Lazaro say a little while before we started that he had lived
many years in Simiti, and that it had always been very quiet until you
came.""_Ay de mi!_" sighed Jose."I can readily believe that the whole world
was quiet until I entered it.""But, Padre, perhaps you had to come into it to shake it up.""_Chiquita_," he said, "if ever you go out into it, with
your radical views regarding God and man; and if the stupid old world
will give ear to you, there will be such a shaking up as it has never
experienced since--"

"Padre dear," she interrupted, "I am not going out into the world.I
shall stay in Simiti--with you."He looked down at her, tenderly, wistfully.And then, while her words
still echoed through his mind, a great sigh escaped him.Dusk had closed in upon them when the canoe emerged into the quiet
lake.Huge vampire bats, like demons incarnate, flouted their faces as
they paddled swiftly toward the distant town.Soft evening calls
drifted across the placid waters from the slumbering jungle.Carmen's
rich voice mingled with them; and Juan and Lazaro, catching the
inspiration, broke into a weird, uncanny boating song, such as is
heard only among these simple folk.As they neared the town the song
of the _bogas_ changed into a series of loud, yodelling halloos; and
when the canoe grated upon the shaly beach, Dona Maria and a score of
others were there to welcome the returned travelers.At the sight of Ana, a murmur ran through the crowd."It is Anita, madre dear," Carmen quickly announced, as she struggled
out of Dona Maria's arms and took the confused Ana by the hand.The light of recognition came into Dona Maria's eyes.Quietly, and
without demonstration, she went to the shrinking woman and, taking the
tear-stained face in her hands, impressed a kiss upon each cheek."_Bien_," she said in a low, tender voice, "we have waited long for
you, daughter.*       *       *       *       *

The glow of dawn had scarce begun to creep timidly across the arch of
heaven when Fernando knocked at the portal of Rosendo's house and
demanded the custody of Carmen."And now, Fernando," demanded the priest, "what new outrage is this?""_Na_, Padre, a thousand
pardons--but it is the order of the Alcalde, and I only obey.But--you
may knock me down," he added eagerly, "and then I can return to him
and say that I could not take the girl, even by force!"The honest
fellow, ashamed of his mission, hung his head.he cried, "what say the people of Simiti?"They would demand Rosendo's release, if
there were proof that the girl--"

"Good, then!"Yes, the guard informed him this morning.The Alcalde, you know,
permits no one to approach the prisoner.""And does he know that Ana is here?""The guard did not tell him, for fear of exciting the old man._Hombre!_ I think there is no one in town who would venture to tell
Rosendo that.""_Bien pues_, Fernando, I think the time has come!Go quietly back and
summon every one to a meeting in the town hall at once.Tell them--"

"_Bien_, Padre, I shall know what to tell them.But," anxiously, "Don
Mario has the power to--"

"And we have a greater power," quickly replied the priest, his thought
dwelling on Carmen.An hour later the town hall was a babel of clacking tongues.Men,
women and children hurried, chattering, to and fro, exchanging diverse
views and speculating eagerly on the probable outcome of the meeting.Jose stood before them, with Carmen's hand clasped tightly in his.Don
Mario, purple and trembling with rage, was perched upon a chair,
vainly trying to get the ear of the people.In the midst of the hubbub a hush fell suddenly over the concourse.All heads turned, and all eyes fastened upon Ana, as she entered the
room and moved timidly toward Jose.The people fell back to make a
passage for her.Her shoulders were bent, and her face was covered
with a black _mantilla_.Don Mario, as his glance fell upon her, again attempted to address the
multitude.A strong arm from behind
pushed him from the chair.His craven heart began to quake, and he
cast anxious glances toward the single exit.Gently removing the _mantilla_ from the face of the woman, Jose turned
her toward the people.he said in a loud, penetrating
voice, "behold the work of Diego!"He paused for the effect which he knew would be made upon this
impressionable people.Then, when the loud murmur had passed, he drew
Carmen out before him and, pointing to her, said dramatically, "And
shall we also throw this innocent child to the wolf?"Fists were shaken under the Alcalde's
nose, and imprecations were hurled at him from all sides.Don Mario
drew his soiled handkerchief and mopped his steaming brow.Then his
voice broke out in a shriek: "The soldiers--this day I shall summon
them--it is a riot!""_Caramba!_ He speaks truth!"_Caramba!_ Let Diego have his child!""_

"Who says it is not his?"Clasping Jose's arm to steady herself, she had turned to
confront the excited assembly.Then:

"The priest Diego had a child--a girl.Her name--it was--Carmen."_Caramba!_ girl, how know you that?""I know, because I--was--its--mother!"Pandemonium burst upon the room at the woman's words.Don Mario
started for the door, but found his way blocked.he shouted; "and this girl is one of them!""I have lived with him eight
years!I know from his own lips that I speak the truth!"We will write to the President at Bogota!"_Caramba!_ Such an Alcalde!""Let him send for the soldiers, if he wishes to die!"As a unit the fickle people streamed from the room and started for the
jail.Don Mario was borne along on the heaving tide.Jose and Carmen
followed; but Ana fell back and returned to the house of Rosendo.The guard at the jail, seeing the concourse approaching, threw down
his _machete_ and fled.Rosendo's eyes were big with speculation,
though his heart beat apprehensively.The people jammed into the small
hut until it swayed and threatened to collapse."The key to the lock--_Caramba_!Juan quickly produced a long iron bar, and with a few lusty efforts
sprung the stocks.A dozen hands lifted the cramped Rosendo out and
stood him upon his feet.Carmen squirmed through the crowd and threw
herself into his arms.Then, with shouts and gesticulations, a triumphal procession quickly
formed, and the bewildered and limping Rosendo was escorted down the
main street of the town and across the _plaza_ to his home.At the
door of the house Jose turned and, holding up a hand, bade the people
quietly disperse and leave the liberated man to enjoy undisturbed the
sacred reunion with his family.With a parting shout, the people
melted quickly away, and quiet soon reigned again over the ancient
town."_Bien_, Padre," said Rosendo, pausing before his door to clasp anew
the priest's hand, "you have not told me what has caused this.Was it
the little Carmen--"

He stopped short.Glancing in at the door, his eyes had fallen upon
Ana.To Jose, hours seemed suddenly compressed into that tense
moment.Slowly Rosendo entered the house and advanced to the shrinking woman.Terror spread over her face, and she clutched her throat as the big
man stalked toward her.Then, like a flash, Carmen darted in front of
her and faced Rosendo."It is Anita, padre dear," she said, looking up into his set face, and
clasping his hand in both of hers."_Bien_, outcast, is your lover with you, that I may strangle him,
too?"cried Carmen, putting both her hands against him.snarled the angry man, still addressing the cowering
woman."Did you tire of him, that you now sneak home?as Ana rose and stood before him, "you come here that your illegal
brat may be born!he shouted, raising his clenched
fist as if to strike her.Carmen turned swiftly and threw herself upon the woman.Looking over
her shoulder, she addressed the raging man:

"Padre Rosendo!He only lets you
have it, because He is good to you!Shame on you, for daring to drive
Anita away--your own little girl!"Her voice rose shrill, and her
words cut deep into the old man's embittered heart."Shame on you, padre Rosendo!""If
God were like you He would drive you from the house, too!Are you so
much better than the good Jesus that you can drive away a woman who
sins?Are you better than the good father who was
so glad to see his prodigal son?If God were to punish you for your
sins, would He even let you live?Did He not set you free this very
morning?And do you now thank Him by driving your little girl from her
own home?Do you know that it was Anita who made you free, and who
brought me here?And is this the way you
thank Him?Then you will lose us both, for we will not stay with
you!"Jose stepped up and took Rosendo's arm.Carmen turned about and
continued her scoriation:

"Padre Rosendo, if the good, pure God was willing to use Anita to save
me from Padre Diego and bring me back to you, are you so wicked and so
ungrateful that you throw His love back in His face?"_Caramba!_" cried Rosendo, tears bursting from his eyes."She has
fouled my name--it was a good name, though my parents were slaves--it
was a good name--and she blackened it--she--"

"Padre Rosendo, there are only two names that have never been
blackened!Your human name is nothing--it is zero--it counts for
foolishness with God!You yourself are making your name blacker now
than Anita ever did!She repents, and comes to her father; and he is
so much more wicked than she that he drives her out!--"

"Enough, Carmen, child!""Come, Rosendo; go into the
parish house!Then a smile lighted up her face, and she reached up
and took Rosendo's hand.Together they passed silently out and into
the priest's house.Ana sank to the floor, where she buried her face in her hands and wept
violently."Wait, Ana," said Jose, tenderly stroking the unhappy woman's hair.And you shall remain here, where you
belong."Then Jose, wondering, went quietly to the door of
his house and looked in.Rosendo sat at the table, with Carmen on his
knees."And, padre," the child was saying, "the good Jesus told the woman not
to sin any more; and she went away happy.Padre, God has told Anita
not to sin any more--and she has come to us to be happy.We are going
to make her so, aren't we?Padre Diego couldn't hurt me, you know, for
God wouldn't let him.And he hasn't hurt Anita--God wouldn't let him
keep her--wouldn't let her stay with him.And we
have got to be like Him--we _are_ like Him, really.But now we have
got to show it, to prove it, you know."Rosendo's head was bent over the girl.The
child went on with increased animation:

"And, padre dear, God sends us Anita's little baby for us to love and
protect.Oh, padre, if the little one is a boy, can't we call it
Jose?""Yes, _chiquita_," Jose heard the old man murmur brokenly."And--padre, if it is a girl--what shall we call it?""We--we will call it--Carmencita,"
he whispered."Can't you see, padre, that God sends us
Anita's baby so that Padre Diego shall not have it?And now let's go
and tell her so, right away!"Jose slipped quickly back and stood beside the woman when Carmen and
Rosendo entered the room.The old man went directly to his daughter,
and, taking her in his brawny arms, raised her from the floor and
strained her to his breast.Tears streamed down his swart cheeks, and
the words he would utter choked and hung in his throat."Padre," whispered the delighted child, "shall I tell her our names
for the baby?"Divine Love was there, and
its dazzling effulgence blinded him.In the quiet of his own chamber
he sought to understand the marvelous goodness of God to them that
serve Him.CHAPTER 27


The reversal of a life-current is not always effected suddenly, nor
amid the din of stirring events, nor yet in an environment that we
ourselves might choose as an appropriate setting.It comes in the
fullness of time, and amid such scenes as the human mind which
undergoes the transformation may see externalized within its own
consciousness by the working of the as yet dimly perceived laws of
thought.Perhaps some one, skilled in the discernment of mental laws and their
subtle, irresistible working, might have predicted the fate which
overtook the man Jose, the fulsome details of which are herein being
recounted.Perhaps such a one might say in retrospect that the
culmination of years of wrong thinking, of false beliefs closely
cherished, of attachment to fear, to doubt, and to wrong concepts of
God, had been externalized at length in eddying the man upon this far
verge of civilization, still clinging feebly to the tattered fragments
of a blasted life.But it would have been a skilled prognostician,
indeed, who could have foreseen the renewal of this wasted life in
that of the young girl, to whom during the past four years Jose de
Rincon had been transferring his own unrealized hopes and his vast
learning, but without the dross of inherited or attached beliefs, and
without taint of his native vacillation and indecision of mind.For what he had been striving to fit her, he knew not.But in a
vaguely outlined way he knew that he was being used as a tool to shape
in some degree the mental development of this strange girl.Nor,
indeed, as the years passed, did she continue to seem so strange to
him.On the contrary, he now thought it more marvelous by far that the
world, after nineteen centuries of Christianity, did not think and act
more as did this girl, whose religious instruction he knew to have
been garnered at the invisible hand of God.That she must some day
leave him, despite her present earnest protestations, he felt to be
inevitable.And the thought pierced his soul like a lance.But he
could not be certain that with maturity she would wish to remain
always in the primitive environment in which she had been nurtured.Nor could he, even if she were willing, immolate her upon the barb of
his own selfishness.As for himself, the years had but seemed to increase the conviction
that he could never leave the Church, despite his anomalous position
and despite his renewed life--unless, indeed, she herself cast him
forth.Each tenderly hopeful letter from his proud, doting mother only
added to this conviction by emphasizing the obstacles opposing such a
course.Her declining years were now spent among the mental pictures
which she hourly drew upon the canvas of her imagination, pictures in
which her beloved son, chastened and purified, had at length come into
the preferment which had always awaited loyal scions of the house of
Rincon.Hourly she saw the day draw nearer when he should be restored
to her yearning arms.Each dawn threw its first rays upon his
portrait, which hung where her waking eyes might open upon it.Each
night the shadow cast by the candle which always burned beneath it
seemed to her eager sight to crown that fair head with a bishop's
mitre--a cardinal's hat--aye, at times she even saw the triple crown
of the Vicar of Christ resting upon those raven locks.If her own pen did not always correctly delineate her towering hopes,
his astute uncle did not fail to fill in whatever hiatus remained.And
the pressure of filial devotion and pride of race at times completely
smothered within him the voice of Truth which Carmen continually
sounded, and made him resolve often that on the day when she should
leave him he would bury his head in the lap of Mother Church and
submit without further resistance to the sable veil of assumed
authority which he knew she would draw across his mind.Convincing as
were the proofs which had come to him of the existence of a great
demonstrable principle which the Christ had sought to make a dull
world recognize, nevertheless he had as yet failed to rise permanently
above the mesmerism of human belief, which whispered into his
straining ears that he must not strive to progress beyond his
understanding, lest, in the attempt to gain too rapidly, he lose all.To sink into the arms of Mother Church and await the orderly
revelation of Truth were less dangerous now than a precipitate
severance of all ties and a launching forth into strange seas with an
untried compass.True, they
reasoned, he had seemed to see the working of mental law in his own
restoration to health when he had first come to Simiti.He had seemed
to see Rosendo likewise restored.But these instances, after all,
might have been casual.That Carmen had had aught to do with them, no
one could positively affirm.True, he had seen her protected in
certain unmistakable ways.But--others were likewise protected, even
where there had been no thought of an immanent, sheltering God.True,
the incident of the epidemic in Simiti two years before had impressed
upon him the serious consequences of fear, and the blighting results
of false belief.But he could not hope
suddenly to empty his mentality of its content of human thought; nor
did wisdom advise the attempt.He had at first tried to rise too
rapidly.His frequent backsliding frightened and warned him.Thus, while the days sped by, did the priest's thought ebb and flow.As morn broke, and the gallant sun drove the cowardly shadows of night
across the hills, his own courage rose, and he saw in Carmen the pure
reflection of the Mind which was in Christ Jesus.As night fell, and
darkness slunk back again and held the field, so returned the legion
of fears and doubts that battled for his soul.Back and forth in the
arena of his consciousness strove the combatants, while he rushed
irresolutely to and fro, now bearing the banner of the powers of
light, now waving aloft, though with sinking heart, the black flag of
the carnal host.For a while after his arrival in Simiti he had seemed
to rise rapidly into the consciousness of good as all-in-all.But the
strain which had been constantly upon him had prevented the full
recognition of all that Carmen saw, and each rise was followed by a
fall that left him for long periods immersed in despair.Following the return of Carmen and the ripple of excitement which her
abduction had spread over the wonted calm of Simiti, the old town
settled back again into its accustomed lethargy, and Jose and the girl
resumed their interrupted work.From Ana it was learned that Diego had
not voiced the command of Wenceslas in demanding the girl; and when
this became known the people rose in a body to her support.Don Mario,
though he threatened loudly, knew in his heart he was beaten.He knew,
likewise, that any further hostile move on his part would result in a
demand by the people for his removal from office.He therefore retired
sulking to the seclusion of his _patio_, where he sat down patiently
to await the turn of events.Rosendo, his great heart softened toward his erring daughter, again
rejoiced in the reunion of his broken family circle.But his soul
burned within him as, day after day, he saw Ana move silently about
like a sorrow incarnate.At times, when perchance he would come upon
her huddled in a corner and weeping quietly, he would turn away,
cursing deeply and swearing fulsome vengeance upon the lecherous beast
who had wrought her ruin."Padre," he one day said to Jose, "I shall kill him--I know it.The
girl's suffering is breaking my heart.He is like an evil cloud
hanging always over my family.I hate him, as the devil
hates the light!And Jose offered
no remonstrance, for the case lay not in his hands.Carmen again entered upon her interrupted studies with ardent
enthusiasm.And her first demand was that she be allowed to plunge
into a searching study of the Bible."Padre," she exclaimed, "it is a
wonderful book!Why--do the people in the world know what a book this
is?For if they did, they would never be sick or unhappy again!"Here it is--the
whole thing!'Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man
his _thoughts_.'But--don't the people know what that means?""Well, _chiquita_, and what does it mean?""Why--the unrighteous man is the man who thinks wrong thoughts--thoughts
of power opposed to God--thoughts of sin, of sickness, of accidents,
and all sorts of evil things--beliefs that these things are real, and
that God made or caused them!""_Bien_, and you think the Bible speaks truth?"Why, it says right here that it is given
by inspiration!That means that the men or women who wrote it thought
God's thoughts!""No, but that those who wrote it were--well, were cleaner window-panes
than other people--that they were so clean that the light shone
through them better than it did through others.""And what do you think now about Jesus?""Why, as you once said, that he was the very cleanest window-pane of
all!"From that hour the Bible was the girl's constant companion.Daily she
pored over it, delighted, enraptured.Jose marveled at her immediate
spiritual grasp.Instead of the world's manner of looking upon it as
only a collection of beautiful promises and admonitions, she saw
within it the statement of a principle that offered itself as a mighty
tool with which to work out humanity's every-day problems here and
now.From the first she began to make out little lists of collated
scriptural verses, so arranging them that she could read in them a
complete expression of an idea of God.These she would bring to Jose
and, perching herself upon his lap, would expound them, to her own
great delight and the wonder of the man who listened."See, Padre," she said, holding up one of these lists, "it says that
'in that day' whatever we ask of him will be given to us.Well, 'that
day' means when we have washed our window-panes clean, and the light
shines through so clear that we can ask in His name.It means when we
have stopped saying that two and two are seven.""Which means," Jose interpolated, "asking in his character.""Yes," she replied, "for then we will be just like him.And then
whatever we ask 'believing' will be given to us, for believing'
will then be 'understanding,' will it not?When we know--really
_know_--that we have things, why--why, we have them, that's all!"She did not wait for his reply, but went on enthusiastically:

"You know, Padre, in order to be like him we have got to'seek first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness'--His right-thinking.Well,
Jesus said the kingdom of God was within us.Of course it is, for it
is all a question of right-thinking.When we think right, then our
right thoughts will be--what you said--"

"Externalized," he supplied.We will see them all around us, instead of seeing, as we do now,
a lot of jumbled-up thoughts of good and evil which we call people and
things.And then will be the time when
'God shall wipe away all tears.'It is, as you say in English, 'up to
us' to bring this about.It is not for God to do it at all.Don't you
see that He has already done His part?He has made everything, and
'behold it was very good.'Well, He doesn't have to do it all over
again, does He?But we have got to wash our windows clean and let
in the light that comes from Him.That light comes from Him all the
time, just as the beams come from the sun, without ever stopping.We
never have to ask the sun to shine, do we?And neither do we have to
ask God to be good to us, nor tell Him what we think He ought to do
for us.We only have to _know_ that He is good, to us and to
everything, all the time.""Yes, _chiquita_, we must be truly baptised.""That is what it means to be baptised, Padre--just washing our
window-panes so clean that the light will come in.""And that light, little one, is truth.It certainly is a new way of
looking at it, at least, _chiquita_.""But, Padre, it is the _only_ way," she persisted."_Bien_, I would not say that you were mistaken, Carmen.""No, Padre, for we can prove it.And, look here," she continued,
referring to her list."If the kingdom of heaven is within us, then
everything that comes to us in life comes from within, and not from
without.And so, things never happen, do they?"I see," he replied seriously, "that from the mouths of babes and
sucklings comes infinite wisdom.""Well, Padre dear, wisdom is God's light, and it comes through any one
who is clean.It doesn't make any difference how old or young that
person is."How can you say that, _chiquita_?""Why, Padre, is God old?""Well, the unreal 'we' is already zero.Didn't you yourself say that
the human, mortal man was a product of false thought, thought that was
the opposite of God's thought, and so no thought at all?Didn't you
say that such thought was illusion--the lie about God and what He has
made?Then isn't the human 'we' zero?""Well--but--_chiquita_, it is often hard for me to see anything but
this sort of 'we,'" returned the man dejectedly.she entreated, "why will you not try to look at something
else than the human man?Look at God's man, the image of infinite
mind.You have _got_ to do it, you know, some time.He
said that every man would have to overcome.That means turning away
from the thoughts that are externalized as sin and sickness and evil,
and looking only at God's thoughts--and, what is more, _sticking to
them_!""Yes," dubiously, "I suppose we must some time overcome every belief
in anything opposed to God.""Well, but need that make you unhappy?It is just because you still
cling to the belief that there is other power than God that you get so
discouraged and mixed up.Why, I would try
it even if a whole mountain fell on me!"And Jose could but clasp the earnest girl in his arms and vow that he
would try again as never before.*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, while Jose and his little student-teacher were delving into
the inexhaustible treasury of the Word; while the peaceful days came
into their lives and went out again almost unperceived, the priest
Diego left the bed upon which he had been stretched for many weeks,
and hobbled painfully about upon his scarcely mended ankle.While a
prisoner upon his couch his days had been filled with torture.Try as
he might, he could not beat down the vision which constantly rose
before him, that of the beautiful girl who had been all but his.He
cursed; he raved; he vowed the foulest vengeance.And then he cried
piteously, as he lay chained to his bed--cried for something that
seemed to take human shape in her.He protested that he loved her;
that he adored her; that without her he was but a blasted cedar.Only Don
Antonio was found low enough in thought to withstand the flow of foul
language which issued from the baffled Diego's thick lips while he
moved about in attendance upon the unhappy priest's needs.Then came from the acting-Bishop, Wenceslas, a mandate commissioning
Diego upon a religio-political mission to the interior city of
Medellin.The now recovered priest smiled grimly when he read it."Prepare yourself, _amigo_," he said, "for a work of the Lord.You accompany me as far as Badillo, where we
disembark for stinking Simiti.And, _amigo_, do you secure a
trustworthy companion.Meantime, my blessing
and absolution."Then he sat down and despatched a long letter to Don Mario.CHAPTER 28


"Rosendo," said Jose one morning shortly thereafter, as the old man
entered the parish house for a little chat, "a Decree has been issued
recently by the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office whereby,
instead of the cloth scapulary which you are wearing, a medal may be
substituted."_Cierto_, Padre--but," he hesitated, "is the new one just as--"

"To be sure, _amigo_.But I
have arranged it to wear about the neck."Rosendo knelt reverently and crossed himself while Jose hung the new
scapulary over his head."_Caramba!_" he
exclaimed, rising, "but I believe this one will keep off more devils
than that old cloth thing you made for me!"admonished Jose, repressing a smile, "did I not bless
that one before the altar?""_Cierto_, Padre, and I beg a thousand pardons.It was the blessing,
wasn't it?But this one," regarding it reverently,
"this one--"

"Oh, yes, this one," put in Jose, "carries the blessing of His Grace,
acting-Bishop Wenceslas.""And a Bishop is always very holy, is he not, Padre?""It makes no difference who he is, for the office makes him holy, is
it not so, Padre?""Oh, without doubt," returned Jose, his thought reverting to the
little Maria and the babe which for four years he had been supporting
in distant Cartagena."_Na_, Padre," remonstrated Rosendo, catching the insinuation, "we
must not speak ill of the Bishop, lest he be a Saint to-morrow!But,
Padre," he went on, changing the topic, "I came to tell you that Don
Luis has given me a contract to cut wood for him on the island._Hombre!_ I shall earn much money by its terms.I set
out to-morrow morning before daybreak."The man's words aroused within him a faint suspicion.Don Luis and the Alcalde were boon companions.Jose wondered if in
this commission he could see the gloved hand of Don Mario.But he gave
no hint of his thought to Rosendo.The next morning, long before sun-up, a mist lay thick over the
valley, so thick that Rosendo, as he made his way down to the lake,
scarce could distinguish the road ahead of him.The dry season had
passed, and the rains were now setting in.As he hurried along, the
old man mused dubiously on the contract which Don Luis had made with
him.To cut wood in the rainy season!--but, after all, that was no
concern of his.And yet--why had Padre Jose grown suddenly quiet when
he learned of the contract yesterday?His bare feet fell softly upon
the shales, and he proceeded more cautiously as he neared the water's
edge."_Hombre!_" he muttered, striving to penetrate the mist; "only a
_loco_ ventures out on the lake in such weather!"He reached the boat, and placed in it the rope and axe which he had
brought.Then, still troubled in thought, he sat down on the edge of
the canoe and dropped into a puzzled meditation.But fishermen do not go out on the lake in dense
fogs, he remembered.Then through the mist loomed the thick body of a man.Straining his
eyes, Rosendo recognized Padre Diego.With a bound the old man was upon his feet.His thick arm shot out
like a catapult; and his great fist, meeting Diego squarely upon the
temple, felled him like an ox.For a moment Rosendo stood over the prostrate priest, like a lion
above its prey.Then he reached into the canoe and drew out the axe.Holding it aloft, he stood an instant poised above the senseless man;
then with a mighty swing he whirled about and hurled it far out into
the lake.Incoherent
muttering issued from his trembling lips.He looked about in
bewilderment.He took the rope from
the boat and quickly bound Diego hand and foot.This done, he picked
up the unconscious priest and tossed him into the canoe as if he had
been a billet of wood.Jumping in after him, he hastily pushed off
from the shore and paddled vigorously in the direction of the island.Why he was doing this he had not the faintest idea.It was all the work of a few seconds; yet when his reason came again
Rosendo found himself far out in the thick fog, and his prisoner
moaning softly as consciousness slowly returned.The sense of
direction which these sons of the jungle possess is almost infallible,
and despite the watery cloud which enveloped him, the old man held his
course undeviatingly toward the distant isle, into the low, muddy
shore of which his boat at length forced its way under the impulse of
his great arms.The island, a low patch a few acres in extent, lay far out in the lake
like a splotch of green paint on a plate of glass.Its densely wooded
surface, rising soft and oozy only a few feet above the water, was
destitute of human habitation, but afforded a paradise for swarms of
crawling and flying creatures, which now scattered in alarm at the
approach of these early visitors coming so unexpectedly out of the
heavy fog.When the canoe grounded, Rosendo sprang out and pulled it well up into
the mud.Then he lifted the priest out and staggered into the thick
brush, where he threw his burden heavily upon the ground.Leaving his
prisoner for a moment, he seized his _machete_ and began to cut back
into the brush.Returning
to the now conscious Diego, he grasped the rope which bound him and
dragged him along the newly opened trail into a little clearing which
lay beyond.There he propped him up against a huge cedar.As he did
this, Diego's mouth opened wide and a piercing scream issued.The cry echoed dismally across the desolate island.In an instant
Rosendo was upon him, with his knife clutched in his fist."Repeat
that, _cayman_," he cried furiously, "and this finds your wicked
heart!"The craven Diego shook with fear; but he fell silent before the threat
of the desperate man into whose hands he had so unwittingly fallen.Rosendo stepped back and stood before his captive, regarding him
uncertainly.Diego's quick intuition did not fail to read the old
man's perplexity; and his own hope revived accordingly.It was a
pretty trick, this of Rosendo's--but, after all, he would not dare too
much.He even smiled unctuously
at his captor."_Bien, amigo_," he said at length, "is this your customary reception
to visitors in your village?_Caramba!_ but what will the good Bishop
say when he learns that you have thus mistreated his trusted agent?"His thought was confused, and
it moved slowly.In the cries of the disturbed birds he seemed now to
hear the warning voice of Carmen.In the watery vapor that rolled over
him he seemed to feel the touch of her soft, restraining hand."_Bien, compadre_," purred Diego, "would it not be well for you to
loosen this bit of thread, that we may make our way back to the
village?_Caramba!_ but it cuts sore--and I am soft, my friend, for I
have been ill.""What made you ill, _cayman_?"he
shouted, drawing nearer to the shrinking Diego and shaking a great
fist in his face._Caramba!_ I would that
your illness had carried you off and saved me the task of sending you
down to purgatory!""But--Rosendo--_caro amigo_,
let us reason together!Ah, _compadre_--loosen but a little this rope
which cuts into my tender skin as your bitter words do into my soul!""_Na_, vulture, but you will drown more quickly thus!"retorted
Rosendo, his huge frame trembling with agitation.But the man before him was an ignorant _peon_.It was not the first time that he had set his own wit against
another's brute strength.The ever-present memory of the girl
became more vivid."You see only your thoughts of me--and they are very bad!"Was he
seeing now only his own bad thoughts?But she had said they were
unreal.And this episode--_Hombre!_ he would not be afraid.His
thought was vastly more powerful than that of a simple _peon_!"But, _amigo_," he resumed gently, "if you had wished to drown me, why
did you bring me here?But--ah, well, I have long been prepared to go.I have been sadly misunderstood--disbelieved--persecuted!Ah, friend
Rosendo, if you could know what I do--but--_Bien_, it is of no
consequence now.Come, then, good fellow, despatch me quickly!Diego ceased talking and began to murmur
prayers.The wind was being taken from his
sails.Diego noted the effect, and resumed his speech.His voice was
low and soft, and at times great tears rolled down his cheeks."Rosendo, friend, I wish to go.And yet, I grieve that you must tarnish yours with my
blood.But," his eyes brightening and his tone becoming more
animated, "Rosendo, I will pray the blessed Virgin for you.When I am
with her in paradise I will ask her to beg the gentle Saviour to
forgive you._Bien_, good friend, we shall all be together in heaven
some day."He started his orisons again, and soon was praying like a
locomotive: "_Ora pro nobis!Santa Maria, ora pro nobis!_"

He stopped and sighed gently."Rosendo--I must say this before I die--I came to Simiti to see you.I
was approaching the boat to hold converse with you.But, you struck
me--there, _que importa_!And yet--it was about the gentle Ana, your
beautiful daughter--But, wait, Rosendo--God above!hear me through--"

Rosendo had started again toward him."Good friend, hear me first, then kill me quickly, for I much desire
to go to my home above!"The impression must be
made upon Rosendo at once, or all was lost.The wily priest knew the
_peon_ mind."_Bien_, good friend, you have misunderstood me.I--Rosendo--I--you will keep my secret, will you not?Bien, I have
left the Church.It was for good reasons that
God took me from the priesthood for other work in His field._Bien_,
the bonds of celibacy removed, behold!my first thought is for my
beautiful Ana.I would render
legitimate her unborn child.I would return to her the peace which she
lost when we became so deeply enamored of each other.Rosendo, I have
come to Simiti to lay my life before you--to yield it to the mother of
my child--to offer it in future service as a recompense for the
unhappiness which, the Virgin knows, I did not willingly bring upon
her, or you!"Rosendo's head was now in a whirl.His eyes protruded, and his mouth
was agape."But--the little Carmen--" he muttered.friend," said Diego sadly, shaking his head, while he quickly
grasped the cue, "I have ceased my endeavors to make you believe that
she is my child._Caramba!_ I can only leave it to the blessed Virgin
to restore her to me when we have both passed the portals of death.""_Caro amigo_," returned Diego gently, "in these last moments I see in
her the beautiful image of her blessed mother, who was taken from me
long before I met and loved your Ana.I await now the reunion which death alone can effect.Drown me not, I pray you,
but rather open an artery and let me fall gently asleep here beneath
this noble tree."A light came into Rosendo's troubled eyes.A cunning smile lurked
about his mouth."_Bien pues_, it shall be as you wish, vulture," he replied in a tone
which again struck terror to Diego's heart.He drew his knife and
approached the horrified priest."_Caramba!_" shrieked Diego, shrinking back against the tree."_Hombre!_ you do not intend--"

"Why not, vampire?"returned Rosendo, the sardonic smile spreading
across his grim features.But would
you go down to hell with murder on your soul?""_Cierto_, carrion!But you go down with a load of
murdered souls!""Rosendo--God!--it means hell for eternity to you!""To be sure, dog-meat," calmly replied Rosendo."But hell will be
heaven to me as I sit forever and hourly remind you of the suffering
Ana and the beautiful Carmen, whom you tried to ruin!Wild thoughts flashed through
his mind with lightning speed.A last
expedient came to him.He fixed his beady eyes upon Rosendo and
muttered: "Coward!you bind a sick man and stick him like a
pig!""We give a deer, a tapir, a jaguar, a chance for its life.But you--coward, you are afraid of a sick man!"_Caramba!_" he cried, "what
would you?"He leaped to the sitting man and at a stroke severed his
bonds."_Bien_, spew of the vampire!Diego extended his empty hands, palms up."_Caramba!_ take the knife!_Hombre!_ but I will kill you with my bare
hands!"He threw the long knife to Diego, who stooped and picked it
up.Stepping quickly back, holding the weapon firmly clenched before him,
the priest slowly circled Rosendo, as if looking for an opening.An
evil smile played constantly over his heavy face, and his little eyes
glittered like diamonds.Rosendo stood like a rock, his long arms
hanging at his side.Then, with a shrill, taunting laugh, Diego turned suddenly and
plunged into the newly-cut trail toward the lake.In an instant he was
lost in the fog.For a moment Rosendo stood dumb with amazement.Diego had reached the canoe, leaped
quickly in, and pushed off.He was
left a prisoner, without a boat, and with two miles of shrouded water
stretching between him and the town!He had been tricked, outwitted; and the
evil genius which for years had menaced his happiness was heading
straight toward the town, where his accomplice, Ricardo, awaited.What
would they do, now that he was out of the way?Great beads of water, distilled from his agony, burst through
his pores.The Juncal river lay off to the west, and at a much less
distance than Simiti.He might swim to it and secure a canoe at the
village.But--the lake was alive with crocodiles!Chagrin and apprehension overwhelmed him, and he burst into a flood of
bitter tears.He threw himself upon the ground, and tossed and moaned
in despair.Nature--God himself--seemed to conspire with Diego.He drew the new medal scapulary
around in front of him and kissed it, reverently crossing himself."_Santa Virgen_," he prayed, "help me--it is for the child!"Then,
taking between his teeth the knife which Diego had dropped, he rushed
into the water and struck out for the distant village of Juncal.*       *       *       *       *

Late that afternoon, while the tropical rain was descending in
torrents, Rosendo staggered into the parish house, where Carmen and
Jose were absorbed in their work.he gasped, "_Loado sea
Dios!_" as his eyes fell upon the girl.Then he sank to the floor in
utter exhaustion.cried Jose, bending over him in apprehension,
while Carmen stood lost in wonder.cried Rosendo, raising himself up on his elbow.cried both Jose and the girl in astonishment.Instinctively Jose's arm went about the child.Rosendo dragged himself
to a chair and sank limply into it."Then, Padre, he will come.Slowly the story came out, bit by bit."_Bien_, Padre," said Rosendo, concluding his dramatic and
disconnected recital, "I plowed through the water--_Caramba!_ I knew
not at what moment I should feel the jaws of a cayman seize upon me!_Bien_, I was then glad, for had I appeared in the village, all would
have said that I had murdered Diego!And so I struck out along the
trail that skirts the lake, and followed it around until I came here.And the rain--H_ombre_!it
beat me down--I fell again and again!And then, the fear that I was
too late--_Ah, Dios_!But she is safe--_Caramba_!"But, Rosendo," said Jose anxiously, "where can Diego--"

"He is here, _Caramba_!but I shall set out at
once and search every house!And he shall do well if he escape this
time!"But dusk was falling; and the old man, his strength sapped, listened
not unwillingly to Jose's better counsel.With the coming of night the
rain ceased, and the clouds rolled up and slipped down behind the
mountains, leaving the moon riding in splendor across the infinite
blue.Then Jose, leaving Carmen with Rosendo, walked to and fro
through the streets of the old town, listening and watching.He
wandered down to the lake.He climbed the hill where stood the second
church.He thought he caught the gleam of a light within the old
edifice.Their voices sounded
ghostly to his straining ears."But, friend Ricardo, he set out before dawn, and is not yet returned.I fear he has either abandoned us, or has walked into our good
Rosendo's jaws.""It is
more likely that he and Don Mario lie pickled in rum under the palms
of the Alcalde's _patio_!"He hurried down through the main street
and past the house of Don Mario.The door stood open, and he could see
the portly figure of the official outlined against the back wall.It
was evident that Diego was not there.He returned in perplexity to his
house and sat far into the night, musing on the strange incident.With the coming of the new day Rosendo appeared with fresh suggestions."_Bien_, Padre," he said, "there is nothing to do now but take the girl
and flee to the Boque river and to the _hacienda_ of Don Nicolas.""_Caramba!_" he muttered, "but this is a mystery!"Your canoe, Don Rosendo--as I started out
on the lake to fish I saw it, far in the distance.Did it break away from its
mooring, think you?"The latter replied quickly: "That is the most
reasonable supposition, Juan.But Rosendo is very grateful to you for
securing it again."When the lad had gone, Rosendo sat with bowed head, deeply perplexed."The pole and paddle, Padre, were left on the island.He--the boat--it must
have drifted long.Or--"

He stopped and scratched his head."Padre," he said, looking up
suddenly with an expression of awe upon his face, "do you suppose--do
you think that the Virgin--that she--made him fall from the canoe into
the lake--and that a _cayman_ ate him?_Ca-ram-ba!_"

Jose did not vouchsafe a reply.But his heart leaped with a great
hope.Rosendo, wrapped in profound meditation, wandered back to his
house, his head bent, and his hands clasped tightly behind his back.CHAPTER 29


The rainy season dragged its reeking length through the Simiti valley
with fearful deliberation.Jose thought that he should never again see
the sun.Great clouds of heavy vapor
rolled incessantly upward from the dripping jungle.The rain fell in
cloud-bursts, and the narrow streets of the old town ran like streams
in a freshet.Then, one day, Rosendo abruptly announced, "Padre, the rains are
breaking.And the little Carmen is fourteen
years old to-day."And
Carmen was no longer a child.Youth ripens quickly into maturity in
these tropic lands.The past year had sped like a meteor across an
evening sky, leaving a train of mingled light and darkness.Of Diego's
fate Jose had learned nothing.Ricardo and his companion had
disappeared without causing even a ripple of comment in Simiti.But he often eyed Jose and
Rosendo malignantly through the wooden grill at his window, and once
he ordered Fernando to stop Rosendo and ply him with many and pointed
questions.The old man was noncommittal, but he left a dark suspicion,
which was transmitted to the receptive mind of the Alcalde.Acting-Bishop Wenceslas likewise was growing apprehensive as the weeks
went by, and both Jose and Don Mario were the recipients of letters of
inquiry from him regarding the whereabouts of the priest Diego.In the
course of time came other letters from Cartagena, and at length an
order for a most scrutinizing search to be made for the Bishop's
confidential agent.Rosendo's oft-repeated testimony revealed nothing.The citizens of Simiti had not seen the man.The Alcalde had nothing
but his suspicions to offer.And these might have fallen harmlessly
upon the acting-Bishop's well occupied thought, had it not been for
the complicating influence of certain other events.The first of these
was the exhaustion of the gold which Jose and Carmen had discovered in
the old church.The other was the outbreak of the religio-political
revolution which Diego had predicted some six years before, and which,
in these latter days, Don Jorge, on his infrequent journeys through
Simiti had repeatedly announced as inevitable and imminent.Their
combined effect was such as to wrest Carmen away from Jose, and to set
in a new direction the currents of their lives.For some time past Jose had patched with growing anxiety the
shrinking of his gold supply, and had striven to lessen the monthly
contributions to Cartagena, meanwhile trying to know that the need
now looming daily larger before him would be met.He had not voiced
his apprehension to Carmen.But he and Rosendo had discussed the
situation long and earnestly, and had at length resolved that the
latter should again return to Guamoco to wash the Tigui sands.The old man sighed, but he uttered no protest.Yet each day Jose
thought he grew quieter.And each day, too, he seemed to become more
tender of his sad-faced daughter, Ana, and of the little grandson who
had come into his humble home only a few weeks before.He delayed his
preparations for specious reasons which Jose knew cost him much effort
to invent.He told his rosary often before the
church altar, and with tears in his eyes.And at night he would come
to Jose and beg him to read from the Bible and explain what he thought
the Saviour had really meant to convey to the humble fishermen of
Galilee.But at last the day arrived when he had
nothing to send to Cartagena beyond the mere pittance which the poor
members of his little parish contributed.Then came a letter from Wenceslas,
requesting an explanation.And then it was that Jose realized that in
his excess of zeal he had fallen into his own trap.For, having
established the custom of remitting a certain amount to the Bishop
each month, he must not resent now the implication of dishonesty when
the remittances fell off, or ceased altogether."_Bien_, Padre," said the latter slowly, "the time has come.In the days that followed, Jose could frame no satisfactory reply to
Wenceslas, and so the latter wrote to the Alcalde.Don Mario eagerly
seized the proffered opportunity to ingratiate himself into
ecclesiastical favor.Rosendo was again in the hills, he wrote, and
with supplies not purchased from him.Nor had he been given even a
hint of Rosendo's mission, whether it be to search again for La
Libertad, or not.There could be no doubt, he explained in great
detail, of Jose's connivance with Rosendo, and of his unauthorized
conduct in the matter of educating the girl, Carmen, who, he made no
doubt, was the daughter of Padre Diego--now, alas!probably cold in
death at the violent hands of the girl's foster-father, and with the
priest Jose's full approbation.The letter cost the portly Don Mario
many a day of arduous labor; but it brought its reward in another
inquiry from Cartagena, and this time a request for specific details
regarding Carmen.He dropped his customary well-oiled
manner, and carried his head with the air of a conqueror.His thick
lips became regnant, imperious.He treated his compatriots with
supercilious disdain.And to Jose he would scarce vouchsafe even a
cold nod as they passed in the street.Again he penned a long missive
to Cartagena, in which he dilated at wearisome length upon the
extraordinary beauty of the girl, as well as her unusual mental
qualities.He urged immediate action, and suggested that Carmen be
sent to the convent in Mompox.*       *       *       *       *

Wenceslas mused long over the Alcalde's letters.Then he sent for a young clerical agent of the See, who
was starting on a mission to Bogota, and requested that he stop off a
day at Badillo and go to Simiti to report on conditions in that
parish.Incidentally, also, to gather what data he might as to the
family of one Rosendo Ariza.In due course of time the agent made his report.The parish of Simiti
stood in need of a new _Cura_, he said.And the girl--he found no
words to describe or explain her.The Church had
need of prompt action, however, to secure her.To that end, he advised
her immediate removal to Cartagena.Aside from the girl, to whom he found his
thought reverting oftener than he could wish in that particular hour
of stress, his interest in Simiti did not extend beyond its
possibilities as a further contributor to the funds he was so greatly
needing for the furtherance of his complex political plans.As to the
Alcalde--here was a possibility of another sort.And at the same time warned
against precipitate action, lest he scatter Rosendo's family into
flight, and the graceful bird now dwelling in the rude nest escape the
sharp talons awaiting her."Send a message to Francisco, our Legate,
who is now in Bogota.Bid him on his return journey stop again at
Simiti.We require a full report on the character of the Alcalde of
that town."*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, Jose did not permit his mental torture to interfere
with Carmen's education.For six years now that had progressed
steadily.Wonderful, he thought--and yet not
wholly attributable to his peculiar mode of tutelage.For, after
all, his work had been little more than the holding of her mind
unwarped, that her instinctive sense of logic might reach those
truthful conclusions which it was bound to attain if guided safely
past the tortuous shifts of human speculation and undemonstrable
theory.To his great joy, these six years had confirmed a belief
which he had held ever since the troublous days of his youth,
namely, that, as a recent writer has said, "adolescent understanding
is along straight lines, and leaps where the adult can only
laboriously creep."There had been no awful hold of early teaching
to loosen and throw off; there were no old landmarks in her mind
to remove; no tenacious, clinging effect of early associations to
neutralize.And, perhaps most important of all, the child had seemed
to enter the world utterly devoid of fear, and with a congenital
faith, amounting to absolute knowledge, in the immanence of an
omnipotent God of love.This, added to her eagerness and mental
receptivity, had made his task one of constant rejoicing in the
realization of his most extravagant dreams for her.As a linguist, Carmen had become accomplished.And it was only a matter of practice to give her a similar
grasp of French, Italian, and German.As for other instruction,
such knowledge of the outside world as he had deemed wise to give her
in these six years had been seized upon with avidity and as
quickly assimilated.But he often speculated curiously--sometimes
dubiously--upon the great surprises in store for her should she ever
leave her native village.And yet, as often as such thought recurred
to him he would try to choke it back, to bar his mind against it, lest
the pull at his heartstrings snap them asunder.Often as he watched her expanding so rapidly into womanhood and
exhibiting such graces of manner, such amiability of disposition,
such selfless regard for others, combined with a physical beauty
such as he thought he had never before gazed upon, a great yearning
would clutch his soul, and a lump would rise in his throat.And
when, as was so often the case, her arms flew impulsively about his
neck and she whispered words of tender endearment in his ear, a
fierce determination would seize him, and he would clutch her to
himself with such vehemence as to make her gasp for breath.That she
might marry he knew to be a possibility.But the idea pierced his
soul as with a sword, and he thought that to see her in the arms of
another, even the man of her choice, must excite him to murder.One
day, shortly after her fourteenth birthday, she came to him and,
perching herself as was her wont upon his knees, and twining her arms
about his neck, said, with traces of embarrassment, "Padre dear,
Juan--he asked me to-day to marry him."She--marry a peon of Simiti!To
be sure, Juan had often reminded him of the request he had made for
her hand long ago.But Jose had not considered the likelihood of the
lad's taking his question directly to her.And the girl--

"And what did you reply?""Padre dear--I told him that--" She stopped abruptly."Well, _chiquita_; you told him--what?"He held her back from him and looked
squarely into her wide eyes."You told him, _chiquita_--"

"That--well, Padre dear, I told him that--that I might never marry.""And do you think, little girl, that you will always hold
to that resolution?""Yes, Padre, unless--"

"Well, _chiquita_, unless--"

"Unless you marry, too, Padre," she said, dropping her eyes.But--what has that to do with it,
girl?""Well--oh, Padre dear--can't you see?For then I would marry--" She
buried her face in his shoulder."Yes, _chiquita_," he said, dully wondering.It was the first expression of the kind that had ever come from her
lips.The Goddess of Fortune had
suddenly thrown her most precious jewel into his lap.Joy welled up in
flood tides from unknown depths within.Minutes passed, and the two sat very quiet."Padre," she whispered, "you don't say anything.And you will not always be a priest--not always," shaking her
beautiful curls with suggestive emphasis.The people called her an
_hada_.And then he knew that
she never moved except in response to a beckoning hand that still,
after all these years, remained invisible to him."_Chiquita_," he said in low response, "I fear--I fear that can never
be.And even if--ah, _chiquita_, I am so much older than you, little
girl--almost seventeen years!""You do not want to marry me, even if you could, Padre?"she queried,
looking wistfully into his eyes, while her own grew moist.he cried wildly, "you little
know--you little know!But--child, we must not talk of these things!"But, Padre dear," she pleaded, "just say that you _do_ love me that
way--just say it--your little girl wants to hear it."She, pleading that he would say he loved her!He silently prayed that his tortured soul might burst
and let his wasted life ebb into oblivion while his pent-up misery
poured out."I love you--love
you--love you!"Some day, Padre dear," she
murmured softly, "you will stop thinking that two and two are seven.She sank back in his arms and nestled close to him, as if she longed
to enter his empty heart and fill the great void with her measureless
love."And, Padre dear," she whispered, "your little girl will wait for
you--yes, she will wait."*       *       *       *       *

It was some days later that Rosendo, after returning almost empty
handed from the hills, came to Jose and said, "Padre, I have sold my
_hacienda_ to Don Luis.I need the money to purchase supplies and to
get the papers through for some denouncements which I have made in
Guamoco.I knew that Don Mario would put through no papers for me, and
so I have asked Lazaro to make the transaction and to deliver the
titles to me when the final papers arrive.I have a blank here to be
filled out with the name and description of a mineral property.I--what would be a good name for a mine, Padre?""Why do you ask that, Rosendo?""Because, Padre, I want a foreign name--one not known, here."There is a city, a great city, that I have often
heard about, up in the States," he said finally.He took up the little atlas which he had received long since with
other books from abroad."Look," he said, "it is called Chicago.Call
your property the Chicago mine, Rosendo.It is a name unknown down
here, and there can no confusion arise because of it.""_Caramba!_" Rosendo muttered, trying to twist his tongue around the
word, "it is certain that no one else will use that name in Guamoco!But that makes my title still more secure, no?""But, Rosendo," said Jose, when the full significance of the old man's
announcement had finally penetrated, "you have sold your _finca_!And
to acquire title to property that you can never sell or work!And the
sword that hangs above us may fall any day!""_Bien_, Padre, it is for her sake that I have done it.But, if the titles
should come from Cartagena during my absence--and, Padre, if anything
should happen to me--for the love of the Virgin do not let them out of
your hands!Yet Rosendo departed not on the morrow.He remained to mingle his
tears with those of the sorrowing Ana.For the woman, whose heart had
been lighter since the arrival of her babe, had come to the priest
that day to have the child christened.And so, before the sun might
fill the _plaza_ with its ardent midday heat, Rosendo and his family
repaired to the church.There before the altar Jose baptised the
little one and gave it his own name, thus triumphantly ushering the
pagan babe into the Christian Catholic world.The child cried at the
touch of the baptismal water."Now," commented Rosendo, "the devil has gone out of him, driven out
by the holy water."But, as Jose leaned over the babe and looked into its dark eyes, his
hand stopped, and his heart stood still.He raised his head and bent a
look of inquiry upon the mother.She returned the look with one that
mutely voiced a stifled fear and confirmed his own.He took a candle from the altar and passed it before the child's
eyes._Santa Virgen!_ Do not tell me--_Dios mio_!"The
mother's voice rose to a wail, as she snatched her babe away.Dona Maria stood mute; but Jose as
he looked at her divined her thought and read therein a full knowledge
of the awful fact that she had never voiced to the heart-broken
mother.Ana, what ails the
child?"Carmen crowded close to the weeping Ana."The babe, Rosendo," she said quietly, "was born--blind."CHAPTER 30


The "revolutionist" of Latin America is generally only the disgruntled
politician.His revolution is seldom more than a violent squabble
among greedy spoilsmen for control of the loose-jointed administration.But the great Mosquera Revolution which burst into flame in New
Granada in 1861 was fed with fuel of a different nature.It
demonstrated, if demonstration were necessary, that the Treaty of
Westphalia did not write _finis_ to the history of bloodshed in the
name of Christ; that it had but banked the fires of religious
animosity, until the furnace should be transferred from the Old World to
the New, where the breath of liberty would again fan them into
vigorous activity.The Mosquera War tore asunder Church and State; but left unhappy
Colombia prone and bleeding.It externalized a mighty protest of
enlightenment against Rome's dictates in temporal affairs.And, as has
before happened when that irresistible potentiality, the people, has
been stirred into action, the Church was disestablished, its property
confiscated, and its meddling, parasitical clergy disenfranchised.But then, too, as almost invariably occurs when the masses find that
they have parted with cherished prejudices and effete customs, and
have adopted ideas so radical as to lift them a degree higher in the
scale of progress, they wavered.The holy sacrament of marriage was
debased to a civil ceremony.Education was endangered by taking it out
of the hands of the pious clergy.Texts unauthorized by Holy Church
were being adopted.The alarm
spread, fanned by the watchful agents of Rome.And twenty years of incessant internecine warfare followed.And when
it was seen that Roman Catholicism was therein again declared to be
the national religion of the Republic of Colombia; when it was noted
that the clergy, obedient to a foreign master, were to be readmitted
to participation in government affairs; when it was understood that a
national press-censorship was to be established, dominated by Holy
Church; and when, in view of this, the great religio-political
opponent was seen laying down her weapons and extending her arms in
dubious benediction over the exhausted people, the masses yielded--and
there was great rejoicing on the banks of the Tiber over the
prodigal's return.When Wenceslas Ortiz was placed in temporary control of the See of
Cartagena he shrewdly urged the Church party to make at least a
pretense of disbanding as a political organization.The provinces
of Cundinamarca and Panama were again in a state of ferment.Congress, sitting in Bogota, had before it for consideration a
measure vesting in the President the power to interfere in certain
states or provinces whenever, in his opinion, the conservation of
public order necessitated such action.That this measure would be
passed, Wenceslas could not be sure.But that, once adopted, it would
precipitate the unhappy country again into a sanguinary war, he
thought he knew to a certainty.He had faced this same question six
years before, when a similar measure was before Congress.But then,
with a strong Church party, and believing the passage of the law to be
certain, he had yielded to the counsel of hot-headed leaders in
Cartagena, and approved the inauguration of hostilities.Congress dropped the measure like a
hot plate.The demands of the "revolutionists" were quickly met by the
federal government.The _causae belli_ evaporated.And Wenceslas
retired in chagrin to the solitude of his study, to bite his nails and
wonder dubiously if his party were strong enough to insure his
appointment to the See of Cartagena in the event of the then aged
occupant's demise.It was this hasty judgment of Wenceslas and his political associates
which had delayed further consideration of the objectionable measure
for six years.But the interim had seen his party enormously
strengthened, himself in control of the See, and his preparations
completed for turning the revolt, whenever it should come, to his own
great advantage.He had succeeded in holding the Church party aloof
from actual participation in politics during the present crisis.And
he was now keeping it in constant readiness to throw its tremendous
influence to whichever side should offer the greatest inducements.Congress dallied; and then prepared
to adjourn.Wenceslas received a code message from his agent in Bogota
that the measure would be laid on the table.At the same time came a
sharp <DW8> from New York.The funds had been provided to finance the
impending revolution.Had the Church party exaggerated its influence upon
Congress?"_Santa Virgen!_" he muttered, as he paced
angrily back and forth in his study.A
curse--"

He stopped still.In the midst of his imprecations an idea occurred to
him.He went to his _escritorio_ and drew out the Legate's recent
report."Ah," he mused, "that pig-headed Alcalde.Then he summoned his secretary and dictated telegrams to Bogota and
New York, and a long letter to the Alcalde of Simiti.These finished,
he called a young acolyte in waiting."Take a message to the Governor," he commanded."Say to His Excellency
that I shall, call upon him at three this afternoon, to discuss
matters of gravest import."Dismissing his secretary, he leaned back
in his chair and dropped into a profound revery.Shortly before the hour which he had set for conference with the
Departmental Governor, Wenceslas rose and went to his _escritorio_,
from which he took a paper-bound book._Bien_, I was correct in my surmise that I should some day have use
for this little volume.But--_Bien_, I think
it will do--I think it will do."A smile played over his handsome, imperious face.Then he snapped the
book shut and took up his hat.At the door he hesitated a moment, with
his hand on the knob."If the Alcalde were not such a fool, it would be impossible," he
mused."But--the combination--the isolation of Simiti--the imbecility
of Don Mario--the predicament of our little Jose--_Hombre_!it is a
rare situation, and it will work.It _must_ work--_cielo_!With the
pig-headed Alcalde seizing government arms to suppress the Church
party as represented by the foolish Jose, and with the President
sending federal troops to quell the disturbance, the anticlericals
will rise in a body throughout the country.Then Congress will hastily
pass the measure to support the President, the Church party will swing
into line with the Government--and the revolution will be on.Simiti
provides the setting and the fuel; I, the torch.I will cable again to
Ames when I leave the Governor."He swung the door open and went
briskly out.*       *       *       *       *

"Padre, I am crushed."He and Jose were sitting out in the
gathering dusk before the parish house on the evening of the day that
Ana's babe had been christened.The old man's head was sunk upon his
breast, and he rocked back and forth groaning aloud."We must be brave, Rosendo," returned Jose tenderly."We have gone
through much, you and I, since I came to Simiti.But--we have believed
it to be in a good cause."But, Padre, after it all, to have her babe come into the world blind!Padre, it is the last thing
that I can endure.I cannot return now to
Guamoco."Rosendo," said Jose, drawing his chair closer to the old man, and
laying a hand on his, "we have fought long and hard.But, if I mistake
not, the greatest struggle is yet to come.The greatest demand upon
your strength and mine is still to be made.""This: Juan returned from Bodega Central
this evening.He reports that several large boxes are there, consigned
to Don Mario, and bearing the government stamp.He found one of them
slightly broken, and he peered within.Jose went on:

"I did not intend to tell you this until morning.But it is right that
you should hear it now, that your courage may rise in the face of
danger.The federal government is sending arms to
Simiti to establish a base here at the outlet of the Guamoco region,
and well hidden from the Magdalena river.This town is to become a
military depot, unless I mistake the signs.And danger no longer
threatens, but is at our door."Rosendo rose slowly and drew himself up to his full
height."There is no question about it, Rosendo," replied Jose gravely."And I
have no reason to doubt the truth of Diego's prophecy, that this time
it will be one to be reckoned with.""Take her into the hills, Rosendo.Jose's thought was dwelling on his last talk with the girl.Again he
felt her soft arms about his neck, and her warm breath against his
cheek.He felt her kiss, and heard again her words, the sweetest, he
thought, that had ever echoed in mortal ears.And then he thought of
his mother, of his office, of the thousand obstacles that loomed huge
and insurmountable between him and Carmen.He passed a hand across his
brow and sighed heavily.I welcome, not
only the opportunity for service which this war may bring, but
likewise the hope of--death.If I could but know that she were
safe--"

"_Caramba_!Think you she would leave you here, Padre?Did
Rosendo's words convey aught to the priest that he did not already
know?"But--Rosendo, I shall not go," he returned bitterly."Then neither do we, Padre," replied Rosendo, sitting again."The
child, Carmen--she--Padre, she loves you with a love that is not of
the earth."*       *       *       *       *

Morning found the old man's conviction still unshaken.Jose sought the
quiet of his cottage to reflect.But his meditations were interrupted
by Carmen."Padre," she began, sparkling like a mountain rill in the sunlight as
she seated herself before him."Pepito--Anita's babe--he is not blind,
you know."Her head bobbed vigorously, as was her wont when she sought
to give emphasis to her dramatic statements.Jose smiled, and resigned himself to the inevitable."And, Padre, have you been thankful that he isn't?"You know, Padre Diego thought he couldn't see the reality.He
looked always at his bad thoughts.And so the not seeing, and the
seeing of only bad things, were both--externalized, and the babe came
to us without sight.That is, without what the human mind calls sight.And now," she went on excitedly, "you and I have just _got_ to know
that it isn't so!And I have
thanked Him all morning that this is so, and that you and I see it."Well--I suppose so," replied Jose abstractedly, his thought still
occupied with the danger that hung over the little town.There isn't any'suppose' about it!The eye is made _by_ the
sight.It thinks that sight
depends upon the optic nerve, and upon the fleshly eye.It is the sight that externalizes the'meaty' eye.You see, the
sight is within, not without.God is all-seeing; and so,
sight is eternal.But what he saw was the
beautiful, animated girl before him.And the thought that he must some
day be separated from her was eating his heart like a canker."Well, then," went on the girl, without waiting for his reply, "if a
mortal's mental concept of sight is poor, why, he will manifest poor
eyes.If the thought-concept were right, the manifestation would be
right."By that I
suppose you mean, _chiquita_, that the babe's thought, or concept, of
sight was all wrong, and so he came into the world blind.""Not at all, Padre," she quickly replied."The babe had nothing to do
with it, except to seem to manifest the wrong thoughts of its father,
or mother, or both.Or perhaps it manifests just simply bad thoughts,
without the bad thoughts belonging to anybody.For, you know, we none
of us really _have_ such thoughts.They are just a part of the one big lie about God.""Surely; the real babe is a child of God, and sees.""But the human babe doesn't see," he retorted."But," she replied, "what you call the human babe is only your mental
concept of the babe.And you see that mental concept as a blind one.See only God's child,
with perfect sight.And, Padre, after a while _you will see that babe
seeing things, just as we do_!she exclaimed, as he sat looking fixedly at
her."Don't you see that if you have the right thought about the babe,
and hold to it, and put out every thought that says it is blind, why,
your right thought will be externalized in a mental concept of a babe
that sees?Don't you know that that is exactly what Jesus did?He
didn't affect the real man at all.But he did change the mental
concepts which we call human beings.And we can do the same, if we
only know it, and follow him, and spiritualize our thought, as he did,
by putting out and keeping out every thought that we know does not
come from God, and that is, therefore, only a part of the lie about
Him.Here is a case where we have got to quit thinking that two and
two are seven.It is God's business to make our
concepts right.And we will see these,
right concepts if we will put out the wrong ones!"he queried lamely, wholly at a loss for any other answer."Well, Padre, I am not a bit afraid.I don't see a blind babe at all,
because there just can't be any."In other words, you don't intend to allow yourself to be deceived by
appearances?""Blindness is only an
appearance.But it doesn't appear to God, It appears only to the human
mind--which isn't any mind at all!And the appearance can be made to
disappear, if we know the truth and stick to it.For any appearance of
a human body is a mental concept, that's all.""Yes, a thing of _wrong_ thought.But all wrong thought is subject
to God's right thought.We've proved that, haven't we, lots of
times?Well, this wrong thought about a babe that is blind can be
changed--made to disappear--just as any lie can be made to disappear
when we know the truth.And so you and I are not going to be afraid,
are we?I told Anita this morning not to worry, but to just _know_
all the time that her babe did see, no matter what the appearance
was.And she smiled at me, Padre, she smiled.And I know that she
trusts, and is going to work with you and me."had he done aught of late but work against her
by his constant harboring of fears, of doubts, and his distrust of
spiritual power?"Padre," she resumed, "I want you to promise me that every day you
will thank God that the babe really sees.And that you will turn right
on every thought of blindness and know that it is a part of the lie
about God, and put it right out of your mind."But--child--if my mind tells me that the babe is blind, how can I--"

"I don't care what your mind tells you about the babe!You are to
listen to what God tells you, not your human mind!Does God tell you
that the babe is blind?"Why, no, _chiquita_, He--"

"Listen, Padre," she interrupted again, drawing closer to him."Is God
good, or bad, or both?""He is good, _chiquita_, all good.""And we have long since proved by actual reasoning and demonstration
that He is mind, and so infinite mind, no?""Well, an infinite mind has all power.And an infinite, all-powerful
mind that is all good could not possibly create anything bad, or sick,
or discordant--now could He?"But--the five physical
senses tell us differently."And yet, we know that the five physical senses _do not tell us
truth_!We know that when the human mind thinks it is receiving
reports about things through the five physical senses it is doing
nothing more than looking at its own thoughts."The thoughts of an infinite and good mind must be like that mind, all
good, no?Well, then, thoughts of discord, disease, blindness, and
death--do they come from the infinite, good mind?"Well, _chiquita mia_, that is just the sticking point.But the mighty question is, where _do_ those thoughts come
from?I am quite as ready as you to admit that discord, sin, evil,
death, and all the whole list of human ills and woes come from these
bad thoughts held in the human mind and so externalized.I believe
that the human man really sees, feels, hears, smells, and tastes these
thoughts--that the functioning of the physical senses is wholly
mental--takes place in mind, in thought only.That is, that the human
mind thinks it sees, feels, hears; but that the whole process is
mental, and that it is but regarding its thoughts, instead of actually
regarding and cognizing objects outside of itself."Isn't that just what I am
trying to tell you?""But--and here is the great obstacle--we differentiate between good
and bad thoughts.We agree that a fountain can not send forth sweet
and bitter waters at the same time.And so, good and bad thoughts do
not come from the infinite mind that we call God.Answer that, _chiquita_, and my problems will all be
solved."She looked at him in perplexity for some time.It seemed to her
that she never would understand him.But, with a little sigh of
resignation, she replied:

"Padre, you answered that question yourself, long ago.You worked it
all out three or four years ago.You let
the false testimony of the physical senses mesmerize you again.Instead of sticking to the thoughts that you knew to be good, and
holding to them, in spite of the pelting you got from the others, you
have looked first at the good, and then at the bad, and then believed
them all to be real, and all to be powerful.And so you got miserably
mixed up.And the result is that you don't know where you stand.Or, you think you don't; for that thought, too, is a bad one, and
has no power at all, excepting the power that you seem willing--and
glad--to give it."He knew in his heart that she was
right.He had not clung to the good, despite the roars of Satan.He
had not "resisted unto blood."Far from it; he had fallen, almost
invariably, at the first shower of the adversary's darts.And now, was
he not trying, desperately, to show her that Ana's babe was blind,
hopelessly so?Was he not fighting on evil's side, and vigorously,
though with shame suffusing his face, waving aloft the banner of
error?"The trouble with you, Padre," the girl resumed, after some moments of
reflection, "is that you--you see everything--well, you see everything
as a person, or a thing.""You mean that I always associate thought with personality?"But you have got to learn to deal with thoughts and ideas
by themselves, apart from any person or thing.You have got to learn
to deal with facts and their opposites entirely apart from places, or
things, or people.Now if I say that Life is eternal, I have stated a
mental thing.Its opposite, that is, the opposite of
Life, is death.That being so, Life is the reality, and death is the unreality.Very
well, what makes death seem real?It is just because the false thought
of death comes into the human mind, and is held there as a reality, as
something that has _got_ to happen.And that strong belief becomes
externalized in what mortals call death.Is there a
person in the whole world who doesn't think that some time he has got
to die?But now suppose every person held the belief that
death was an illusion, a part of the big lie about God, just as Jesus
said it was.Well, wouldn't we get rid of death in a hurry?And is there a person in the whole world who wouldn't say
that Anita's babe was blind?They would look at the human
thought of blindness, instead of God's real idea of sight, and so they
would make and keep the babe blind.Don't you understand me, Padre
dear?I know you do, for you really see as God sees!"Her eyes glistened, and her whole body seemed
to radiate the light of knowledge divine.Then she went hurriedly on:

"Padre, everything is mental.You know that, for you told me so, long
since.Well, that being so, we have got to face the truth that every
mental fact seems to have an opposite, or a lot of opposites, also
seemingly mental.Infinite mind is the
infinite fact.The so-called opposite of this infinite fact is the
human mind, the many so-called minds of mankind--_a kind of man._ But
everything is still mental.Now, an illusion, or a lie, does not
_really_ exist.If I tell you that two and two are seven, that lie
does not exist.Is it in what we call my mind, or yours?Even if
you say you believe it, that doesn't make it real.Nor does it show
that it has real existence in your mind.But--if you
hold it, and cling to it--allow it to stay with you and influence
you--why, Padre dear, everything in your whole life will be changed!"Let me take your pencil--and a piece of paper.Look now," drawing a
line down through the paper."On one side, Padre, is the infinite
mind, God, and all His thoughts and ideas, all good, perfect and
eternal.On the other side is the lie about it all.That is still
mental; but it is illusion, falsity.It includes all sin, all
sickness, all murder, all evil, accidents, loss, failure, bad
ambitions, and death.These are all parts of the big lie about
God--His unreal opposite.These are the so-called thoughts that come
to the human mind.The human
mind looks at them, tastes them, feels them, holds them; and then they
become its beliefs.After a while the human mind looks at nothing but
these beliefs.And, finally, it comes to
believe that God made them and sent them to His children.Isn't it
awful, Padre!And aren't you glad that you know about it?And aren't
you going to learn how to keep the good on one side of that line and
the illusion on the other?"It seemed to Jose a thing incredible that these words were coming from
a girl of fifteen.And yet he knew that at the same tender age he was
as deeply serious as she--but with this difference: he was then
tenaciously clinging to the thoughts that she was now utterly
repudiating as unreal and non-existent."Padre dear," the girl resumed, "everything is mental."Well," he replied reflectively, "at least our comprehension of it is
wholly mental.""Why--it is all inside--it is all in our thought!Padre, when Hernando
plays on that old pipe of his, where is the music?"But, _chiquita_, we don't seem to have it in our thought until we
seem to see him playing on the pipe, do we?""No, we don't," she replied.It is just because
the human mind believes that everything, even music, must come from
matter--must have a--"

"Must have a material origin?And men even believe that life itself has a material origin; and
so they have wasted centuries trying to find it in the body.They
don't seem to want to know that God is life.""Then, _chiquita_, you do not believe that matter is real?""There is no matter outside of us, or around us, Padre," she said in
reply."The human mind looks at its thoughts and seems to see them out
around it as things made of matter.But, after all, it only sees its
thoughts.""Then I suppose that the externalization of our thought in our
consciousness constitutes what we call space, does it not?""It must, Padre," she answered.Then:

"_Chiquita_, how do you know me?What do you see that you call'me'?""Why, Padre, I see you as God does--at least, I try always to see you
that way?""And that is the way Jesus always
saw people."But, does He see me as I see myself?""You do not see yourself, Padre," was her reply."You see only the
thoughts that you call yourself.Thoughts of mind and body and all
those things that go to form a human being.""Well--yes, I must agree with you there; for, though God certainly
knows me, He cannot know me as I think I know myself, sinful and
discordant.""He knows the real 'you,' Padre dear.He
knows that the unreal 'you,' the 'you' that you think you know, is
illusion.If He knew the human, mortal 'you' as real, He would have to
know evil."No, for the Bible says He is of eyes too pure to behold evil.""Well, Padre, why don't you try to be like Him?"But the girl needed not that he should answer her question.She knew
why he had failed, for "without faith it is impossible to please him:
for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
rewarder of them that diligently seek him."She knew that Jose's
struggle to overcome evil had been futile, because he had first
made evil real.She knew that the difficulty he had experienced in
keeping his thought straight was because he persisted in looking at
both the good and the evil.Lot's wife, in the Bible allegory, had
turned back to look at things material and had been transformed into
a pillar of salt.Jose had turned again and again to his materialistic
thoughts; and had been turned each time to salt tears.She knew that
he gave up readily, that he yielded easily to evil's strongest
tool, discouragement, and fell back into self-condemnation, whereby he
only rendered still more real to himself the evil which he was
striving to overcome.She knew that the only obstacle that he was
wrestling with in his upward progress was the universal belief in a
power other than God, good, which is so firmly fixed in the human
consciousness.But she likewise knew that this hindrance was but a
false conviction, and that it could and would be overcome."Padre," she reflected, looking up at him in great seriousness, "if a
lie had an origin, it would be true, wouldn't it?"He regarded her attentively, but without replying."But Jesus said that Satan was the father of lies.And Satan, since he
is the father of lies, must himself be a lie.You see, Padre, we can
go right back to the very first chapter in the Bible.First comes the
account of the real creation.Then comes the account as the human
mind looks at it.But that comes after the'mist' had gone up from
the ground, from dirt, from matter.That mist was
error, the opposite of Good.It was
the human mind and all human thought, the opposite of the infinite
Mind, God, and His thought.So every bit
of evil that you can possibly think of comes from the material,
physical senses.Evil is always a mist, hiding the good.The physical universe, the universe of matter, is the way the
human mind sees its thoughts of the spiritual universe that was
created by God.The human mind is just a bundle of these false
thoughts; and you yourself have said that the human consciousness
was a 'thought-activity, concerned with the activity of false
thought.'The human mind is the lie about the infinite mind.It
has no principle, and nothing to stand on.The minute you turn the
truth upon it, why, it vanishes.""Well, then, _chiquita_, why don't people turn the truth upon it
everywhere?""Because they are mesmerized by the error, Padre.They sit looking at
these false thoughts and believing them true.Padre, all disease, all
evil, comes from the false thought in the human mind.It is that
thought externalized in the human consciousness.And when the human
mind turns from them, and puts them out, and lets the true thoughts
in, why--why, _then we will raise the dead_!""But, _chiquita_, the human body--if it has died--"

"Padre," she interrupted, "the human body and human mind are one and
the same.The body that you think you see is
but your thought of a body, and _is in your so-called human mind_!""And so would you if you read your Bible
in the right way.Why--I had never seen a Bible until you gave me
yours.I didn't know what a book it was!And to think that it has been
in the world for thousands of years, and yet people still kill one
another, still get sick, and still die!"But, _chiquita_, people are too busy to devote time to demonstrating
the truths of the Bible," he offered."Why--busy making money--busy socially--busy having a good time--busy
accumulating things that--that they must go away and leave to somebody
else!""They are like the people Jesus spoke of, too
busy with things that are of no account to see the things that
are--that are--"

"That are priceless, _chiquita_--that are the most vital of all things
to sinful, suffering mankind," he supplied.These hours
with Carmen had become doubly precious to him of late.Perhaps he felt
a presentiment that the net about him and his loved ones was drawing
rapidly tighter.Perhaps he saw the hour swiftly approaching, even at
hand, when these moments of spiritual intercourse would be rudely
terminated.And perhaps he saw the clouds lowering ever darker above
them, and knew that in the blackness which was soon to fall the girl
would leave him and be swept out into the great world of human
thoughts and events, to meet, alone with her God, the fiercest
elements, the subtlest wiles, of the carnal mind.As for himself--he
was in the hands of that same God."_Chiquita_," he said, "you do not
find mistakes in the Bible?For, out in the big world where I came
from, there are many, very many, who say that it is a book of
inconsistencies, of gross inaccuracies, and that its statements are
directly opposed to the so-called natural sciences.They say that it
doesn't even relate historical events accurately.But, after all,
the Bible is just the record of the unfoldment in the human
consciousness of the concept of God.Why cavil at it when it
contains, as we must see, a revelation of the full formula for
salvation, which, as you say, is right-thinking."And it even tells us what to think about.Paul said, you
know, that we should think about whatsoever things are true, honest,
just, pure, lovely, and of good report.Well, he told us that there
was no law--not even any human law--against those things.And don't
you know, he wrote about bringing into captivity every thought to
Christ?"Just what you have been telling me, I guess, _chiquita_: that every
thought must be measured by the Christ-principle.And if it doesn't
conform to that standard, it must be rejected."He did die daily to evil,
to all evil thought--"

"And to the testimony of the physical senses, think you?"For, in proving God to be real, he had to prove the
reports of the five physical senses to be only human beliefs.""You are right, _chiquita_.He must have known that the corporeal
senses were the only source from which evil came.He must have known
that unless God testified in regard to things, any other testimony was
but carnal belief.This must be so, for God, being infinite mind, is
also infinite intelligence.He knows all things, and knows them
aright--not as the human mind thinks it knows them, twisted and
deformed, but right."And can't you
_stick_ to it, and prove it?""_Chiquita_," he answered, shaking his head again, his words still
voicing a lingering note of doubt, "it may be--the 'I' that I call
myself may be entirely human, unreal, mortal.I make no doubt it is,
for it seems filled to the brim with discordant thoughts.she cried, with a trace of exasperation."Empty yourself
of the wrong thoughts--shut the door against them--don't let them in
any more!Then when the
mortal part fades away, why, the good will be left.And it will be the
right 'you.'""But how shall I empty myself, and then fill myself again?"cried the girl, springing from her chair and stamping her
foot with each word to give it emphasis."It is love, love, love,
nothing but love!Forget yourself, and love everything and everybody,
the real things and the real bodies!Love God, and good, and good
thoughts!Turn from the bad and the unreal--forget it!Why--"

"Wait, _chiquita_," he interrupted."A great war is threatening our
country at this very minute.Shall I turn from it and let come what
may?"But you can know that war comes only from the
human mind; that it is bad thought externalized; and that God is
peace, and is infinitely greater than such bad thought; and He will
take care of you--if you will let Him!"By sitting back and folding my hands and
saying, Here am I, Lord, protect me--"

"Oh, Padre dear, you make me ashamed of your foolish thought--which
isn't your thought at all, but just thought that seems to be calling
itself 'you.'Jesus said, He that believeth on me, the works that I do
shall he do likewise.But that did not mean sitting back with folded
hands.It meant _understanding_ him; and knowing that there is no
power apart from the Christ-principle; and using that principle, using
it every moment, _hard_; and with it overcoming every thought that
doesn't come from God, every thought of the human mind, whether it is
called war, or sickness, or death!""Then evil can be thought away, _chiquita_?"He knew not why he
pursued her so relentlessly."No, Padre," she replied with a gentle patience that smote him.But it can be destroyed in the human mind.And when you have
overcome the habit of thinking the wrong way, evil will disappear.That is what Jesus tried to make the people
see."Yet he had not put it to the proof.He had gone
through life, worrying himself loose from one human belief, only to
become enslaved to another equally insidious.He knew that the cause
of whatever came to him was within his own mentality.And yet he knew,
likewise, that he would have to demonstrate this--that he would be
called upon to "prove" God.His faith without the works following was
dead.He felt that he did not really believe in power opposed to God;
and yet he did constantly yield to such belief.And such yielding was
the chief of sins.He knew that
when the Master had said, "Behold, I give you power over all the
enemy," he meant that the Christ-principle would overcome every false
claim of the human mentality, whether that claim be one of physical
condition or action, or a claim of environment and event.He knew that
all things were possible to God, and likewise to the one who
understood and faithfully applied the Christ-principle.Carmen
believed that good alone was real and present.She applied this
knowledge to every-day affairs.And in so doing she denied reality to
evil.He must turn upon the claims of evil to life and
intelligence.His false sense of righteousness _must_ give place to
the spiritual sense of God as immanent good.He knew that Carmen's
great love was an impervious armor, which turned aside the darts of
the evil one, the one lie.He knew that his reasoning from the premise
of mixed good and evil was false, and the results chaotic.And knowing
all this, he knew that he had touched the hem of the garment of the
Christ-understanding.There remained, then, the test of fire."Padre," said Carmen, going to him and putting her arms about his
neck, "you say that you think a great war is coming.Don't you remember what it says in the book of
Isaiah?'No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper, and
every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt
condemn.This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their
righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.'No weapon of evil can
touch you, if you understand God.Every tongue of the human mind that
rises to judge you, to sentence you, shall be condemned.You will
condemn it--you _must_!This is your heritage, given you by God.And
your righteousness, your right-thinking, must come from God.Then--"

"Yes, yes, _chiquita_," he said, drawing her to him."And now, Padre, you will promise me that you will know every day that
Anita's babe is not blind--that it sees, because God sees?""Yes, _chiquita_, I promise.""Padre dear," she murmured, nestling close to him, "I love you so
much, so much!"He answered not, except in the tightening of the arm that was about
her.CHAPTER 31


In the weeks that followed there were days when the very air seemed
pregnant with potential destruction, awaiting only the daring hand
that would render it kinetic.Jose dwelt in a state of incessant,
heart-shaking agitation.The sudden precipitation of the revolt six
years before had caught him wholly unprepared, unaware even of the
events which had led to it.In the intervening years, however, he had
had some opportunity, even in his isolation, to study political
conditions in that unhappy country, and to form some estimate of the
mental forces at work in both Church and State which, he knew, must
ultimately bring them again into conflict for supremacy.His knowledge
of the workings of the human mind convinced him that Diego's dire
prophecy had not been empty; that the Church, though ostensibly
assuming only spiritual leadership, would nevertheless rest not until
the question "Who shall be greatest?"even in the petty, sordid
affairs of mortals, should be answered, and answered--though by force
of arms--in her favor.And his estimate of the strength of the
opposing parties had led him to believe that the impending struggle
would drench the land in blood.As to the _role_ which Wenceslas would play, he could form no
satisfactory estimate.He knew him to be astute, wary, and the
shrewdest of politicians.He knew, likewise, that he was acting in
conjunction with powerful financial interests in both North America
and Europe.He knew him to be a man who would stop at no scruple,
hesitate at no dictate of conscience, yield to no moral or ethical
code; one who would play Rome against Wall Street, with his own
unfortunate country as the stake; one who would hurl the fairest sons
of Colombia at one another's throats to bulge his own coffers; and
then wring from the wailing widows their poor substance for Masses to
move their beloved dead through an imagined purgatory.But he could not know that, in casting about impatiently for an
immediate _causus belli_, Wenceslas had hit upon poor, isolated,
little Simiti as the point of ignition, and the pitting of its
struggling priest against Don Mario as the method of exciting the
necessary spark.He could not know that Wenceslas had represented
to the Departmental Governor in Cartagena that an obscure _Cura_ in
far-off Simiti, an exile from the Vatican, and the author of a
violent diatribe against papal authority, was the nucleus about
which anticlerical sentiment was crystallizing in the Department
of Bolivar.He did not know that the Governor had been induced by the
acting-Bishop's specious representations to send arms to Simiti, to
be followed by federal troops only when the crafty Wenceslas saw
that the time was ripe.He did not even suspect that Don Mario was
to be the puppet whom Wenceslas would sacrifice on the altar of
rapacity when he had finished with him, and that the simple-minded
Alcalde in his blind zeal to protect the Church would thereby
proclaim himself an enemy of both Church and State, and afford the
smiling Wenceslas the most fortuitous of opportunities to reveal the
Church's unexampled magnanimity by throwing her influence in with
that of the Government against their common enemy.His own intercourse with Wenceslas during the years of his exile in
Simiti had been wholly formal, and not altogether disagreeable as long
as the contributions of gold to the Bishop's leaking coffers
continued.He had received almost monthly communications from
Cartagena, relating to the Church at large, and, at infrequent
intervals, to the parish of Simiti.But he knew that Cartagena's
interest in Simiti was merely casual--nay, rather, financial--and he
strove to maintain it so, lest the stimulation of a deeper interest
thwart his own plans.His conflict with Diego in regard to Carmen had
seemed for the moment to evoke the Bishop's interference; and the
sudden and unaccountable disappearance of that priest had threatened
to expose both Jose and Carmen to the full scrutiny of Wenceslas.But,
fortunately, the insistence of those matters which were rapidly
culminating in a political outbreak left Wenceslas little time for
interference in affairs which did not pertain exclusively to the
momentous questions with which he was now concerned, and Jose and
Carmen were still left unmolested.It was only when, desperate lest
Congress adjourn without passing the measure which he knew would
precipitate the conflict, and when, well nigh panic-stricken lest his
collusion with Ames and his powerful clique of Wall Street become
known through the exasperation of the latter over the long delay, he
had resolved to pit Don Mario against Jose in distant Simiti, and, in
that unknown, isolated spot, where close investigation would never be
made, apply the torch to the waiting combustibles, that Jose saw the
danger which had always hung over him and the girl suddenly descending
upon them and threatening anew the separation which he had ever
regarded as inevitable, and yet which he had hoped against hope to
avoid.With the deposition of arms in Simiti, and the establishment of
federal authority in Don Mario, that always pompous official rose in
his own esteem and in the eyes of a few parasitical attaches to an
eminence never before dreamed of by the humble denizens of this
moss-encrusted town.From egotistical, Don Mario became insolent.From
sluggishness and torpidity of thought and action, he rose suddenly
into tremendous activity.He was more than once observed by Jose or
Rosendo emerging hastily from his door and button-holing some one of
the more influential citizens of the town and excitedly reading to him
excerpts from letters which he had just received from Cartagena.He
might be seen at any hour of the day in the little _patio_ back of his
store, busily engaged with certain of the men of the place in
examining papers and documents, talking volubly and with much excited
gesticulation and wild rolling of the eyes.A party seemed to be
crystallizing about him.His hitherto uncertain prestige appeared to
be soaring greatly.Men who before made slighting remarks about him,
or opposed his administrative acts, were now often seen in earnest
converse with him.His manner toward Jose and Rosendo became that of
utter contempt.He often refused to notice the priest as they passed
in the streets.It attained its climax when Rosendo
came to him one day to discuss the Alcalde's conduct and the change of
sentiment which seemed to be stealing rapidly over the hearts of the
people of Simiti."Padre," said the old man in perplexity, "I cannot say what it is, but
Don Mario has some scheme in hand, and--and I do not think it is for
our good.I cannot get anything out of those with whom he talks so
continually, but Lazaro tells me that--_Bien_, that he learns that Don
Mario suspects you of--of not belonging to the Church party."Don Mario's suspicions about him had been many and
varied, especially as La Libertad mine had not been discovered.He
said as much to Rosendo in reply; and as he did so, he thought the old
man's face took on a queer and unwonted expression."But, Padre," continued Rosendo at length, "they say that Don Mario
has word from the Bishop that you once wrote a book against the Holy
Father--"

"Good God!"The words burst from the priest's lips like the sudden
issuance of pent steam.Rosendo stared at him in bewilderment.it is what Lazaro tells me," replied the old man,
his own suspicion verging upon conviction.Jose's dark face became almost white, and his breath sobbed out in
gasps.A vague idea of the game Wenceslas was playing now stole
through his throbbing brain.That book, his Nemesis, his pursuing
Fate, had tracked him to this secluded corner of the earth, and in the
hands of the most unscrupulous politician of South America was being
used as a tool.But, precisely to what end, his wild thought did not
as yet disclose.Still, above the welter of it all, he saw clearly
that there must be no further delay on his part.Before he could
speak, however, Rosendo had resumed the conversation."Padre," he said, "had it occurred to you that you were watched, day
and night?"Don Mario's men keep you in sight during the day;
and at night there is always some one hovering near your house.You
could not escape now even if you would."Jose sank back in his chair limp and cold.His frenzied brain held but
one thought: he had delayed until too late--and the end was at hand!"Padre," said Rosendo earnestly, "tell me about that book.You have not brought Carmen up in the Church.But it was I who told
you not to--that her heart was her church, and it must not be
disturbed.But--is it true, as the people say, that you really belong
to the party that would destroy the Church?"While his heart burned within his breast,
he opened its portals and revealed to Rosendo all that lay within.Beginning with his boyhood, he drew his career out before the
wondering eyes of the old man down to the day when the culmination of
carnal ambition, false thought, perverted concepts of filial devotion
and sacredness of oath, of family honor and pride of race, had washed
him up against the dreary shores of Simiti.With no thought of
concealment, he exposed his ambition in regard to Carmen--even the
love for her that he knew must die of inanition--and ended by throwing
himself without reserve upon Rosendo's judgment.When the tense
recital was ended, Rosendo leaned over and clasped the priest's
trembling hand."I understand, Padre," he said gently."I am dull of wit, I know.And
you have often laughed at my superstitions and old family beliefs,
whether religious or otherwise.And I
shall die in the Church, and take my chances on the future, for I have
tried to live a good life.But--with a man like you--I understand.And
now, Padre, we have no time to be sorrowful.And both are
Carmen's, is it not so?Thanks be to the good Virgin," he muttered,
as he walked slowly away, "that Lazaro got those titles from Don Mario
to-day!"*       *       *       *       *

Nightfall brought an unexpected visitor in the person of Don Jorge,
who had returned from the remoter parts of the Guamoco region."_Bien_, and what news?"he called cheerily, as he strode into the
parish house, where Rosendo and Jose were in earnest conversation.Jose embraced him as a brother, while a great sense of relief stole
over him.Then he quickly made known to him the situation.He ceased his task of scraping the caked
mud from his bare limbs, and drew up a chair near Jose.But, _amigo_, lend
me a copy, for I doubt not it is most excellent reading, and will
serve to while away many a weary hour in the jungle."His eyes snapped
merrily, and he slapped Jose roundly upon the back when he finished
speaking."But," he continued more seriously, "things seem to be setting against
you, friend.However, let me but canvass the town to-morrow, and by
evening I can advise.And yet--and yet--I wonder why the Governor
sends arms here.Don Jorge needed not a full day to correctly estimate the situation in
Simiti.His bluff, hearty manner and genial good-nature constituted a
passport to every house, and by midday he had talked with nearly every
man in the _pueblo_.He called Jose and Rosendo for consultation
during the _siesta_."_Bien_," he said, when they were seated in the parish house, "Don
Mario without doubt descends from the very serpent that tempted our
mother Eve!He has become a person of considerable importance since
the Governor and Don Wenceslas strive with each other to rest their
authority and confidence in him.And, unless I mistake much, they have
him slated for important work.However that may be, the man already
has a large following.Moreover, he has them well poisoned against
you, _amigo_ Jose.They know more details about your book and your
life before coming to Simiti than do you._Bien_, you must counteract
the Alcalde's influence by a public statement.It must be to-night--in
the church!You will have to act quickly, for the old fox has you
picked for trouble!Diego's disappearance, you know; the girl, Carmen;
your rather foolish course here--it is all laid up against you,
friend, and you must meet it!"Don Jorge went out and summoned the town to a meeting
in the church that evening.Immediately Don Mario issued a mandate
forbidding a public gathering at a time of such stress.The people
began to assemble on the street corners and in front of their houses
to discuss the situation.Don Jorge was
everywhere, and none could talk so volubly nor gesticulate and
expectorate so vehemently as he.At sundown the people moved toward the _plaza_.Then the concourse
drifted slowly into the church.Don Jorge dragged Jose from the parish
house and up to the altar."You have got to divide them, Padre!""Your only hope now lies in the formation of your
own party to oppose the Alcalde!Talk to them as you never talked
before!Say all that you had stored up to say on Judgment Day!"Again, as Jose faced his little flock and saw them, bare of feet,
scantily clad in their simple cotton and calico, their faces set in
deep seriousness, the ludicrous side of the whole situation flashed
before him, and he almost laughed aloud at the spectacle which the
ancient, decayed town at that moment presented.These primitive
folk--they were but children, with all a child's simplicity of nature,
its petulance, its immaturity of view, and its sudden and unreasoning
acceptance of authority!He turned to the altar and took up a tall
brass crucifix.He held it out before him for a moment.Then he called
upon the Christ to witness to the truth of what he was about to say.Even Don Mario seemed to become calm
after that dramatic spectacle.He talked long and
earnestly.He knew not that such eloquence abode within him.His
declamation became more and more impassioned.He opened wide his heart
and called upon all present to look fearlessly within.Yes, he had
written the book in question.Yes, it had expressed his views at that time.The shadows were gathering
thick, and the smoking kerosene lamps battled vainly with the heavy
blackness.In a far corner of the room he saw Carmen and Ana.Rosendo
sat stolidly beside them.The sightless babe waved its tiny hands in
mute helplessness, while Dona Maria held it closely to her bosom.Carmen's last admonition sang in his ears.He must know--really
_know_--that the babe could see!His appeal to the people was not for himself.He cared not what
became of him.But Carmen--and now Ana and the blind babe--and the
calm, unimpassioned Dona Maria, the embodiment of all that was
greatest in feminine character--and Rosendo, waiting to lay down his
life for those he loved!And then, this people, soon, he felt, to be
shattered by the shock of war--ah, God above!what could he say that
might save them?If they could know, as Carmen did, if they could love
and trust as she did, would the hideous spectre of war ever stalk
among them?Could the world know, and love, and trust as did this fair
child, would it waste itself in useless wars, sink with famine and
pestilence, consume with the anguish of fear, and in the end bury its
blasted hopes in the dank, reeking tomb?The thought gave wings to his
voice, soul to his words.And, while the
holy hush remained upon the people, he descended the altar steps, his
frame still tremulous with the vehemence of his appeal, and went alone
to his house.CHAPTER 32


Dawn had scarcely reddened in the east when a number of men assembled
at Jose's door."You have turned the trick, _amigo_," said Don Jorge, rousing up from
his _petate_ on the floor beside the priest's bed."You have won over
a few of them, at least."Jose went out to meet the early callers."We come to say, Padre," announced Andres Arellano, the dignified
spokesman, "that we have confidence in your words of last night.We
suspect Don Mario, even though he has letters from the Bishop.We are
your men, and we would keep the war away from Simiti."There were five of them, strong of heart and brawny of arm."And there
will be more, Padre," added Andres, reading the priest's question in
his appraising glance.Thus was the town divided; and while many clung to the Alcalde, partly
through fear of offending the higher ecclesiastical authority, and
partly because of imagined benefits to be gained, others, and a goodly
number, assembled at Jose's side, and looked to him to lead them in
the crisis which all felt to be at hand.As the days passed, the
priest's following grew more numerous, until, after the lapse of a
week, the town stood fairly divided.Don Jorge announced his intention
of remaining in Simiti for the present.From the night of the meeting in the church excitement ran continuously
higher.Business was at length suspended; the fishermen forgot their
nets; and the limber tongues of the town gossips steadily increased
their clatter.Don Mario's store and _patio_ assumed the functions of
a departmental office.Daily he might be seen laboriously drafting
letters of incredible length and wearisome prolixity to acting-Bishop
Wenceslas; and nightly he was engaged in long colloquies and whispered
conferences with Don Luis and others of his followers and hangers-on.The government arms had been brought up from Bodega Central and stored
in an empty warehouse belonging to Don Felipe Alcozer to await further
disposition.But with the arrival of the arms, and of certain letters which Don
Mario received from Cartagena, the old town lost its calm of
centuries, not to recover it again for many a dreary day.By the time
its peace was finally restored, it had received a blow from which it
never recovered.And many a familiar face, too, had disappeared
forever from its narrow streets.Meanwhile, Jose and his followers anxiously awaited the turn of
events.It came at length, and in a manner not wholly unexpected.The
Alcalde in his voluminous correspondence with Wenceslas had not
failed to bring against Jose every charge which his unduly stimulated
brain could imagine.But in particular did he dwell upon the
priest's malign influence upon Carmen, whose physical beauty and
powers of mind were the marvel of Simiti.He hammered upon this
with an insistence that could not but at length again attract the
thought of the acting-Bishop, who wrote finally to Don Mario,
expressing the mildly couched opinion that, now that his attention
had been called again to the matter, Carmen should have the benefits
of the education and liberal training which a convent would afford.Don Mario's egotism soared to the sky.The great Bishop was actually
being advised by him!He would yet
remove to a larger town, perhaps Mompox, and, with the support of the
great ecclesiastic, stand for election to Congress!He would show the
Bishop what mettle he had in him.And first he would show
His Grace how a loyal servant could anticipate his master's wishes.He
summoned Fernando, and imperiously bade him bring the girl Carmen at
once.But Fernando returned, saying that Rosendo refused to give up the
child.But Fernando found it
impossible to execute the commission.Jose and Don Jorge stood with
Rosendo, and threatened to deal harshly with the constable should he
attempt to take Carmen by force.Fernando then sought to impress upon
the Alcalde the danger of arousing public opinion again over the
girl.Don Mario's wrath burst forth like an exploding bomb.He seized his
straw hat and his cane, the emblem of his office, and strode to the
house of Rosendo.His face grew more deeply purple as he went.At the
door of the house he encountered Jose and Don Jorge."Don Mario," began Jose, before the Alcalde could get his words
shaped, "it is useless.Be advised, Don Mario, for the consequences of
thoughtless action may be incalculable!"bellowed the irate official, "but, cow-face!do you know
that His Grace supports me?if you do not at once deliver to me your paramour--"

He got no further.Rosendo, who had been standing just within the
door, suddenly pushed Jose and Don Jorge aside and, stalking out, a
tower of flesh, confronted the raging Alcalde.For a moment he gazed
down into the pig-eyes of the man.Then, with a quick thrust of his
thick arm, he projected his huge fist squarely into Don Mario's
bloated face.Neither Jose nor Don Jorge, as they rushed in between Rosendo and his
fallen adversary, had any adequate idea of the consequences of the old
man's precipitate action.As they assisted the prostrate official to
his unsteady feet they knew not that to Rosendo, simple, peace-loving,
and great of heart, had fallen the lot to inaugurate hostilities in
the terrible anticlerical war which now for four dismal years was to
tear Colombia from end to end, and leave her prostrate and exhausted
at last, her sons decimated, her farms and industries ruined, and her
neck beneath the heavy heel of a military despot at Bogota, whose
pliant hand would still be guided by the astute brain of Rome.By the time the startled Alcalde had been set again upon his feet a
considerable concourse had gathered at the scene.Many stood in
wide-eyed horror at what had just occurred.The crowd rapidly grew, and in a few minutes the _plaza_
was full.Supporters of both sides declaimed and gesticulated
vehemently.In the heat of the arguments a blow was struck.The Alcalde, when he found his tongue, shrilly demanded the
arrest of Rosendo and his family, including the priest and Don Jorge.A dozen of his party rushed forward to execute the order.Rosendo had
slipped between Jose and Don Jorge and into his house.In a trice he
emerged with a great _machete_.His
eyes blazed like live coals, and his breath seemed to issue from his
dilating nostrils like clouds of steam.Don Jorge crept behind him and, gaining the house, collected
the terrified women and held them in readiness for flight.Juan,
Lazaro, and a number of others surrounded Jose and faced the angry
multitude.The strain was broken by the frenzied Alcalde, who rushed toward
Rosendo.The old man swung his enormous _machete_ with a swirl that,
had it met the official, would have clean decapitated him.But,
fortunately, one of the priest's supporters threw out his foot, and
the corpulent Alcalde fell heavily over it and bit the dust.The old man staggered with the shock and
gave way.Holding up both
hands high above his head, he sent out his voice clear and loud.The
blessed Virgin--"

"What know you of the blessed Virgin, priest of Satan?"shouted a
rough follower of the Alcalde.Julio Gomez stooped and took up a large piece of shale.He threw it
with all his force, just as the priest again strove to make his voice
heard above the din.The jagged
stone cut deeply, and the red blood spurted.Jose fell into the arms
of Lazaro and was dragged into the house.Then Rosendo, with a mad yell, plunged wildly into the crowd.A dozen
arms sought to hold him, but in vain.Julio saw the terrifying
apparition hurtling down upon him.He turned and fled, but not before
the great knife had caught him on its point as it swung down and
ripped a deep gash the full length of his naked back.Then the last vestige of reason fled from the mob, and chaos took the
reins.Back and forth through the _plaza_, in front of the church
where hung the image of the Prince of Peace, the maddened people
surged, fighting like demons, raining blows with clubs, fists, and
_machetes_, stabbing with their long, wicked knives, hurling sharp
stones, gouging, ripping, yelling, shrieking, calling upon Saints and
Virgin to curse their enemies and bless their blows.Over the heads of
them all towered the mighty frame of Rosendo.Back before his
murderous _machete_ fell the terrified combatants.His course among
them was that of a cannon ball.Dozens hung upon his arms, his
shoulders, or flung themselves about his great legs.His huge body,
slippery and reeking, was galvanized into energy incarnate.Sparks
seemed to flash from his eyes.Behind him, following in the swath which he cut, his supporters
crowded, fought and yelled.They cursed,
broke, and fled.Then Don Jorge, a man whose mortal strength was more
than common, threw himself upon the steaming, frenzied Rosendo and
stopped his mad progress.They are fleeing to the _bodega_
to get the rifles and ammunition!Come--_Dios arriba_!Cut, bruised, and dripping blood from a dozen wounds, Rosendo stood
for a moment blinking in confusion.A score lay on the ground about
him.Whether dead or wounded, he knew not, nor cared.The sight of Don
Mario's supporters in full flight fascinated him.It sounded like the gloating of an imp of Satan.Then the
force of Don Jorge's words smote him.cried Don Jorge, pulling him toward the
house.Those of the priest's other followers who were still whole
scattered wildly to their homes and barred their doors.There they
searched for knives, _machetes_, razors, any tool or instrument that
might be pressed into service as a weapon, and stood guard.One
frenzied fellow, the sole possessor of an antiquated shotgun,
projected the rusty arm from a hole in the wall of his mud hut and
blazed away down the deserted street indiscriminately and without
aim.Within the house Juan and Lazaro were supporting the dazed Jose, while
Dona Maria bathed and bound his wound.Carmen stood gazing upon the
scene in bewilderment.The precipitousness of the affair had taken her
breath away and driven all thought in mad rout from her mind.panted Don Jorge, "the church--it is the only place now
that is even fairly safe!Dona Maria, do you collect all the food in
the house!We know not how long we may be prisoners--"

"But--Don Jorge," interrupted Jose feebly, "they will attack us even
there!Let us flee--"

"Where, _amigo_?they would shoot us
down in cold blood!That
will hold some of them back, at any rate!And none of them, if they
get crazed with _anisado_!cried Rosendo, starting for the door, "but do you, Juan
and Lazaro, follow me with your _machetes_, and we will drive the
cowards from the _bodega_ and get the rifles ourselves!"By this time they have broken open the boxes
and loaded the guns.A shot--and it would be all over with you!But in
the church--you have a chance there!"Don Jorge seized his arm and dragged him out of the house and across
the deserted _plaza_.Juan and Lazaro helped Dona Maria gather what
food and water remained in the house; and together they hurried out
and over to the church.Swinging open the heavy wooden doors, they
entered and made them fast again.Then they sank upon the benches and
strove to realize their situation.Juan and Lazaro hurried to them and swung the wooden shutters.muttered Rosendo, seizing a bench and with one blow of
his _machete_ splitting it clean through, "these will make props to
hold them!"It was the work of but a few minutes to place benches across the thick
shutters and secure them with others placed diagonally against them
and let into the hard dirt floor.Then the little group huddled together and waited.Jose heard a sob
beside him, and a hand clutched his in the gloom.In
the excitement of the hour he had all but forgotten her.Through his
present confusion of thought a great fact loomed: as the girl clung to
him she was weeping!A low rumble drifted to them; a confusion of voices, growing louder;
and then a sharp report."They are coming, Padre," muttered Rosendo."And some one has tried
his rifle!"A moment later the ruck poured into the _plaza_ and made for Rosendo's
house.Don Mario, holding his cane aloft like a sword, was at their
head.Raging with disappointment at not finding the fugitives in the
house, they threw the furniture and kitchen utensils madly about,
punched great holes through the walls, and then rushed pellmell to the
parish house next door.A groan escaped Jose as he watched them
through a chink in the shutters.But as the howling mob streamed toward the parish house a wrinkled
old crone shrilled at them from across the way and pointed toward the
church."In there, _amigos_!"Shoot
them--they have hurt my Pedro!"Back like a huge wave the crowd flowed, and up against the church
doors.Don Mario, at the head of his valiant followers, held up his
hand for silence.Then, planting himself before the main doors of the
church, he loudly voiced his authority."In the name of the Government at Bogota!"he cried pompously, tapping
the doors with his light cane."Fernando," he
called, "run to my house and fetch the drum!"Despite the seriousness of their situation, Jose smiled at the
puppet-show being enacted without.The Alcalde reiterated his demands with truculent vanity."_Caramba!_ if I but had him in here alone!"Then, as no response came from within,
his anger began to soar."_Caramba!_" he cried, "but you defy the
law?"Angry mutterings rose from the crowd.A third intimated
that shooting them full of holes were better.This idea, once voiced,
spread like an infection.The childish people were eager to try the
rifles.The Alcalde threw himself heavily up against the doors."_Caramba!_"
he shrilled.Open!--or it will be the worse for you!"Jose decided that their silence should no longer exasperate the angry
man.He put his mouth to the crevice between the doors."Don Mario," he cried, "this is sacred ground!We may
settle this trouble amicably, if you will but listen to reason."The Alcalde jumped up and down in his towering wrath.he
screamed, "but I am the law--I am the Government!A curse upon you,
priest of Satan!"And if you attack us you attack the Church!"_Amigos!_ _Muchachos!_" he bawled, turning to
the mob, "we will batter down the doors!"Again and
again the mob hurled itself upon the thick doors.They bent, they
sagged, but they held.A torrent of
anathemas streamed from his thick lips.some one shouted, recovering a portion of his scant
wit."Aye--and the door of the _sacristia_!"Round the building streamed the crazed mob, without head, without
reason, lusting only for the lives of the frightened little band
huddled together in the gloom within.Ana bent sobbing over her tiny babe.Don Jorge and Rosendo remained
mute and grim.Jose knew that those two would cast a long reckoning
before they died.Juan and Lazaro went from door to window, steadying
the props and making sure that they were holding.The tough, hard,
tropical wood, though pierced in places by _comjejen_ ants, was
resisting.The sun was already high, and the _plaza_ had become a furnace.The
patience of the mob quickly evaporated in the ardent heat.Don Mario's
wits had gone completely.Revenge, mingled with insensate zeal to
manifest the authority which he believed his intercourse with
Wenceslas had greatly augmented, had driven all rationality from his
motives.Flaming anger had unseated his reason.Descending from the
platform on which stood the church, he blindly drew up his armed
followers and bade them fire upon the church doors.If Wenceslas, acting-Bishop by the grace of political machination,
could have witnessed the stirring drama then in progress in ancient
Simiti, he would have laughed aloud at the complete fulfillment of his
carefully wrought plans.The cunning of the shrewd, experienced
politician had never been more clearly manifested than in the carrying
out of the little program which he had set for the unwise Alcalde of
this almost unknown little town, whereby the hand of Congress should
be forced and the inevitable revolt inaugurated.Don Mario had seized
the government arms, the deposition of which in Simiti in his care had
constituted him more than ever the representative of federal
authority.But, in his wild zeal, he had fallen into the trap which
Wenceslas had carefully arranged for him, and now was engaged in a mad
attack upon the Church itself, upon ecclesiastical authority as vested
in the priest Jose.How could Wenceslas interpret this but as an
anticlerical uprising?And while
the soft-headed dupes and maniacal supporters of Don Mario were
hurling bullets into the thick doors of the old church in Simiti,
Wenceslas sat musing in his comfortable study in the cathedral of
Cartagena, waiting with what patience he could command for further
reports from Don Mario, whose last letter had informed him that the
arrest of the priest Jose and his unfortunate victim, Carmen, was only
a few hours off.When the first shots rang out, and the bullets ploughed into the hard
wood of the heavy doors, Jose's heart sank, and he gave himself up as
lost.Lazaro and Juan cowered upon the floor.Carmen crept close to
Jose, as he sat limply upon a bench, and put her arms about him."Padre dear," she whispered, "it isn't true--it isn't true!They don't
really want to kill us!The recriminating thought
flashed over him that he alone was the cause of this.He had
sacrificed them all--none but he was to blame.if he
could only offer himself to satiate the mob's lust, and save these
innocent ones!Lurid, condemnatory thoughts burned through his brain
like molten iron.Rosendo and
Don Jorge seized him as he was about to lift a prop."I am going out, friends--I shall give myself to them for you all.Let them have me, if they
will spare you!"But the firing had ceased, and Don Mario was approaching the door."Myself for the others, Don Mario!""But promise to spare them--but give me your word--and I
will yield myself to arrest!""It is not
you that the good Bishop wants, but the girl!I have his letters
demanding that I send her to him!If you will come out, you shall not
be hurt.Only, Rosendo must stand trial for the harm he did in the
fight this morning; and the girl must go to Cartagena.As for the rest
of you, you will be free."Juan and Lazaro," he said, "we will open a window quickly in
the rear of the church and let you out.It is not right that you
should die with us.And Don Jorge, too--"

"Stop there, _amigo!_" interrupted the latter in a voice as cold as
steel."My life has not the value of a white heron.Can I do better
than give it for a cause that I know to be right?Nay, man, I remain
with you.Let the lads go, if they will--"

Lazaro forced himself between Don Jorge and the priest."Padre," he
said quietly, "to you I owe what I am.The boy's eyes were fixed on
Carmen.He turned and gazed for a moment at a window, as if hesitating
between two decisions."Padre," he
said, though his voice trembled, "I, too, remain."The Alcalde received his answer with a burst of inarticulate rage.He
rushed back to his followers with his arms waving wildly._Compadres_, get
the poles and burst in the shutters._Caramba!_ it is the Government
they are defying!"A bullet pierced the wall and whizzed past Carmen.Jose seized the girl and drew her down under a bench.The startled
bats among the roof beams fluttered wildly about through the heavy
gloom.Frightened rats scurried around the altar.The rusty bell in
the tower cried out as if in protest against the sacrilege.Juan burst
into tears and crept beneath a bench."Padre," said Rosendo, "it is only a question of time when the doors
will fall._Bien_, let us place
the women back of the altar, while we men stand here at one side of
the doors, so that when they fall we may dash out and cut our way
through the crowd.If we throw ourselves suddenly upon them, we may
snatch away a rifle or two.Then Don Jorge and I, with the lads here,
may drive them back--perhaps beat them!But my first blow shall be for
Don Mario!I vow here that, if I escape this place, he shall not live
another hour!""Better so, Rosendo, than that they should take us alive.Do we leave her to fall into Don Mario's hands?"Rosendo's voice, low and cold, froze the marrow in the priest's bones."Padre, she will not fall into the Alcalde's hands."Rosendo, do you--"

A piercing cry checked him.Padre--!_" Lazaro had
collapsed upon the floor."Padre--I confess--pray for
me.He struggled to lay a hand upon his bleeding
breast."To the altar, _amigos_!"cried Don Jorge, ducking his head as a
bullet sang close to it.Seizing the expiring Lazaro, they hurriedly dragged him down the aisle
and took refuge back of the brick altar.The bullets, now piercing the
walls of the church with ease, whizzed about them.One struck the
pendant figure of the Christ, and it fell crashing to the floor.Rosendo stood in horror, as if he expected a miracle to follow this
act of sacrilege.prayed Jose, "only Thy hand can save us!""He will save us, Padre--He will!"cried Carmen, creeping closer to
him through the darkness."Padre," said Don Jorge hurriedly, "the Host--is it on the altar?""Then, when the doors fall, do you stand in front of the altar,
holding it aloft and calling on the people to stand back, lest the
hand of God strike them!""It is a chance--yes, a bare chance.They will
stop before it--or they will kill me!Carmen's
voice broke clear and piercing through the din.Jose struggled to free
himself from her."_Na_, Padre," interposed Rosendo, "it may be better so!Heavy poles and billets of wood had been
fetched, and blow after blow now fell upon every shutter and door.The
sharp spitting of the rifles tore the air, and bullets crashed through
the walls and windows.In the heavy shadows back of the altar Rosendo
and Don Jorge crouched over the sobbing women.Jose knew as he stretched out a hand through the darkness and touched
the cold face that the faithful spirit had fled.How soon his own
would follow he knew not, nor cared.Keeping close to the floor, he
crept out and around to the front of the altar.Reaching up, he
grasped the Sacred Host, and then stood upright, holding it out before
him.Carmen rose by his side and took his hand.Rosendo's hoarse whisper drifted across the silence like a wraith.He
crept out and along the floor, scarce daring to look up.Through the
darkness his straining eyes caught the outlines of the two figures
standing like statues before the altar."_Loado sea Dios!_" he cried, and his voice broke with a sob."But,
Padre, they have stopped--what has happened?"We are in the hands of God--"

"Padre--listen!"Carmen darted from the altar and ran to the door.All was quiet without, but for
an animated conversation between Don Mario and some strangers who had
evidently just arrived upon the scene.One of the latter was speaking
with the Alcalde in excellent Spanish.Another, evidently unacquainted
with the language, made frequent interruptions in the English tongue."Say, Reed," said the voice in English, "tell the parchment-faced old
buzzard that we appreciate the little comedy he has staged for us.Tell him it is bully-bueno, but he must not overdo it.We are plum
done up, and want a few days of rest.""What says the senor, _amigo_?"asked Don Mario, with his utmost
suavity and unction of manner."He says," returned the other in Spanish, "that he is delighted with
the firmness which you display in the administration of your office,
and that he trusts the bandits within the church may be speedily
executed."They are those who
defy the Government as represented by myself!"He straightened up and
threw out his chest with such an exhibition of importance that the
strangers with difficulty kept their faces straight.Carmen and Jose looked at each other in amazement during this
colloquy."Do all who speak English tell such
lies?"murmured the one addressed as Reed, directing himself to the
Alcalde, "how dared they!But, senor, my friend and I have come to
your beautiful city on business of the utmost importance, in which
you doubtless will share largely.I would suggest," looking with
amusement at the array of armed men about him, "that your prisoners
are in no immediate likelihood of escaping, and you might leave them
under close guard while we discuss our business.A--a--we hear
reports, senor, that there is likely to be trouble in the country, and
we are desirous of getting out as soon as possible."Cierto, senores!_" exclaimed Don Mario, bowing low.Turning to the gaping people, he selected
several to do guard duty, dismissed the others, and then bade the
strangers follow him to his house, which, he declared vehemently, was
theirs as long as they might honor him with their distinguished
presence.The sudden turn of events left the little group within the church in a
maze of bewilderment.They drew together in the center of the room and
talked in low whispers until the sun dropped behind the hills and
night drifted through the quiet streets.Late that evening came a
tapping at the rear door of the church, and a voice called softly to
the priest.Jose roused out of his gloomy revery and hastened to
answer it.I am on guard; but no one must know that I
talk with you.But--Padre, if you open the door and escape, I will not
see you.I am sorry, Padre, but it could not be helped.Don Mario has
us all frightened, for the Bishop--"

"True, _amigo_," returned Jose; "but the strangers who arrived this
afternoon--who are they, and whence?""Two _Americanos_, Padre, and miners.""Fernando--you would aid me?_Bien_, get word
to the stranger who speaks both English and Spanish.Bring him here,
secretly, and stand guard yourself while I talk with him.""Gladly, Padre," returned the penitent fellow, as he hastened quietly
away.An hour later Jose was again roused by Fernando tapping on the door.Fear not; only the _Americano_ will enter.Jose lifted the prop and swung the door open.Rosendo stood with
uplifted _machete_.Jose
quickly closed the door, and then addressed him in English.exclaimed the stranger in a mellow voice."I had no
idea I should find any one in this God-forsaken town who could speak
real United States!"Jose drew him into the _sacristia_.Neither man could see the other in
the dense blackness."Tell me, friend," began Jose, "who you are, and where you come
from.""Reed--Charles Reed--New York--mining engineer--down here to examine
the so-called mines of the Molino Company, now gasping its last while
awaiting our report.Arrived this afternoon from Badillo with my
partner, fellow named Harris.you certainly
were in a stew when we appeared!Even if we passed the guard, where would we
go?There are two women, a girl, and a babe with us.Should we gain the Boque or Guamoco trail, we would
be pursued and shot down.There is a chance here--none in flight!Reed," continued Jose earnestly, "will you get word from
me to the Bishop in Cartagena that our church has been attacked--that
its priest is besieged by the Alcalde, and his life in jeopardy?"Your _bogas_
have not returned to Badillo?""No, they are staying here for the big show.Execution of the
traitors, you know.""Then, friend, send them at dawn to Bodega Central.Let them take a
message to be sent by the telegraph from that place.Tell the
Bishop--"

"Sure!"I'll fix up a message
that will bring him by return boat!I've been talking with the
Honorable Alcalde and I've got his exact number.Say, he certainly is
the biggest damn--beg pardon; I mean, the biggest numbskull I have
ever run across--and that's saying considerable for a mining man!"said Jose, making no other reply to the man's words."Go
quickly--and use what influence you have with the Alcalde to save us.We have women here--and a young girl!"He found the American's hand
and led him out into the night.*       *       *       *       *

Wenceslas Ortiz stood before the Departmental Governor.His face was
deeply serious, and his demeanor expressed the utmost gravity.In his
hand he held a despatch.The Governor sat at his desk, nervously
fumbling a pen."_Bien, Senor_," said Wenceslas quietly, "do you act--or shall I take
it to His Excellency, the President?"The Governor moved uneasily in his chair."_Caramba!_" he blurted out.And yet, I cannot see but that the Alcalde
acted wholly within his rights!""Your Excellency, he seizes government arms--he attacks the church--he
attempts to destroy the life of its priest.Nominally acting for the
Government; at heart, anticlerical.Will the
Government clear itself now of the suspicion which this has aroused?""But the priest--did you not say only last week that he himself had
published a book violently anticlerical in tone?""Senor, we will not discuss the matter further," said Wenceslas,
moving toward the door."Your final decision--you will send troops to
Simiti, or no?"Wenceslas courteously bowed himself out.Once beyond the door, he
breathed a great sigh of relief."_Santa Virgen!_" he muttered, "but I
took a chance!Had he yielded and sent troops, all would have been
spoiled.He entered his carriage and was driven hurriedly to his _sanctum_.There he despatched a long message to the President of the Republic.He mused over it for the space of an hour."Your Excellency," it read, "the
Church supports the Administration."Late that evening a second message from Bogota was put into his hand.He tore it open and read, "The Hercules ordered to Simiti.""Ah," he sighed, sinking into his chair.A message to
the captain of the Hercules to bring me that girl!"*       *       *       *       *

"Well, old man, I've done all I could to stave off the blundering
idiot; but I guess you are in for it!The jig is up, I'm thinking!"Simiti again slept, while the American and Jose
in the _sacristia_ talked long and earnestly.Fernando kept guard at
the door."Your message went down the river two days ago," continued Reed.since then I've racked my dusty brain for topics to keep
the Alcalde occupied and forgetful of you.But I'm dryer than a desert
now; and he vows that to-morrow you and your friends will be dragged
out of this old shack by your necks, and then shot."The two days had been filled with exquisite torture for Jose.Only the
presence of Carmen restrained him from rushing out and ending it all.Every hour, every moment, she
knew only the immanence of her God; whereas he, obedient to the
undulating Rincon character-curve, expressed the mutability of his
faith in hourly alternations of optimism and black despair.After
periods of exalted hope, stimulated by the girl's sublime confidence,
there would come the inevitable backward rush of all the chilling
fear, despondency, and false thought which he had just expelled in
vain, and he would be left again floundering helplessly in the dismal
labyrinth of terrifying doubts.The quiet which enwrapped them during these days of imprisonment; the
gloom-shrouded church; the awed hush that lay upon them in the
presence of the dead Lazaro, stimulated the feeble and sensitive
spirit of the priest to an unwonted degree of introspection, and he
sat for hours gazing blankly into the ghastly emptiness of his past.He saw how at the first, when Carmen entered his life with the
stimulus of her buoyant faith, there had seemed to follow an emptying
of self, a quick clearing of his mentality, and a replacement of much
of the morbid thought, which clung limpet-like to his mentality, by
new and wonderfully illuminating ideas.For a while he had seemed to
be on the road to salvation; he felt that he had touched the robe of
the Christ, and heavenly virtue had entered into his being.But then the shadows began to gather once more.He did not cling to
the new truths and spiritual ideas tenaciously enough to work them out
in demonstration.He had proved shallow soil, whereon the seed had
fallen, only to be choked by the weeds which grew apace therein.The
troubles which clustered thick about him after his first few months in
Simiti had seemed to hamper his freer limbs, and check his upward
progress.Constant conflict with Diego, with Don Mario, and Wenceslas;
the pressure from his mother and his uncle, had kept him looking, now
at evil, now at good, giving life and power to each in turn, and
wrestling incessantly with the false concepts which his own mentality
kept ever alive.Worrying himself free from one set of human beliefs,
he fell again into the meshes of others.Though he thought he knew the
truth--though he saw it lived and demonstrated by Carmen--he had yet
been afraid to throw himself unreservedly upon his convictions.And so
he daily paid the dire penalty which error failed not to exact.But Carmen, the object of by far the greater part of all his anxious
thought, had moved as if in response to a beckoning hand that remained
invisible to him.And each
day, too, she had seemed to draw farther away from him, as she
rose steadily out of the limited encompassment in which they
dwelt.Not by conscious design did she appear to separate from him,
but inevitably, because of his own narrow capacity for true
spiritual intercourse with such a soul as hers.He shared her
ideals; he had sought in his way to attain them; he had striven,
too, to comprehend her spirit, which in his heart he knew to be a
bright reflection of the infinite Spirit which is God.But as the
years passed he had found his efforts to be like her more and more
clumsy and blundering, and his responses to her spiritual demands less
and less vigorous.At times he seemed to catch glimpses of her
soul that awed him.At others he would feel himself half inclined
to share the people's belief that she was possessed of powers
occult.And then he would sink into despair of ever understanding the
girl--for he knew that to do so he must be like her, even as to
understand God we must become like Him.After her fourteenth birthday Jose found himself rapidly ceasing to
regard Carmen as a mere child.Not that she did not still often
seem delightfully immature, when her spirits would flow wildly, and
she would draw him into the frolics which had yielded her such
extravagant joy in former days; but that the growth of knowledge and
the rapid development of her thought had seemed to bring to her a
deepening sense of responsibility, a growing impression of maturity,
and an increasing regard for the meaning of life and her part in
it.She had ceased to insist that she would never leave Simiti.And
Jose often thought of late, as he watched her, that he detected
signs of irksomeness at the limitations which her environment
imposed upon her.But, if so, these were never openly expressed; nor
did her manner ever change toward her foster-parents, or toward the
simple and uncomprehending folk of her native town.From the first, Jose had constituted himself her teacher, guide, and
protector.His soured and
rebellious nature had been no barrier to her great love, which had
twined about his heart like ivy around a crumbling tower.And his love
for the child had swelled like a torrent, fed hourly by countless
uncharted streams.He had watched over her like a father; he had
rejoiced to see her bloom into a beauty as rich and luxuriant as the
tropical foliage; he had gazed for hours into the unsearchable abyss
of her black eyes and read there, in ecstasy, a wondrous response to
his love; and when, but a few short days ago, she had again intimated
a future union, a union upon which, even as a child, she had insisted,
yet one which he knew--had always known--utterly, extravagantly
impossible--he had, nevertheless, seized upon the thought with a joy
that was passionate, desperate--and had then flung it from him with a
cry of agony.It was not the disparity of ages; it was not the girl's
present immaturity.In less than a year she would have attained the
marriageable age of these Latin countries.But he could wait two,
three, aye, ten years for such a divine gift!No; the shadow which lay
upon his life was cast by the huge presence of the master whose chains
he wore, the iron links of which, galling his soul, he knew to be
unbreakable.And, as he sat in the gloom of the decayed old church
where he was now a prisoner, the thought that his situation but
symbolized an imprisonment in bonds eternal roused him to a
half-frenzied resolve to destroy himself."Padre dear," the girl had whispered to him that night, just before
the American came again with his disquieting report, "Love will open
the door--Love will set us free.Remember, Paul
thanked God for freedom even while he sat in chains.And I am just as
thankful as he."Jose knew as he kissed her tenderly and bade her go to her place of
rest on the bench beside Dona Maria that death stood between her and
the stained hand of Wenceslas Ortiz.As morning reddened in the eastern sky Don Mario, surrounded by an
armed guard and preceded by his secretary, who beat lustily upon a
small drum, marched pompously down the main street and across the
_plaza_ to the church.Holding his cane aloft he ascended the steps of
the platform and again loudly demanded the surrender of the prisoners
within."The same," reiterated the Alcalde vigorously."Then we will die, Don Mario," he replied sadly, moving
away from the door and leading his little band of harried followers to
the rear of the altar.The Alcalde quickly descended the steps and shouted numerous orders.Several of his men hurried off in various directions, while those
remaining at once opened fire upon the church.In a few moments the
firing was increased, and the entire attack was concentrated upon the
front doors.Shouts and curses filled the morning
air.But it was evident to Jose that his besiegers were meeting with
no opposition from his own supporters in the fight of two days before.The sight of the deadly rifles in the hands of Don Mario's party had
quickly quenched their loyalty to Jose, and led them basely to abandon
him and his companions to their fate.After a few minutes of vigorous assault the attack abruptly ceased,
and Jose was called again to the door."It's Reed," came the American's voice."I've
persuaded the old carrion to let me have a moment's pow-wow with you.Say, give the old buzzard what he wants.Otherwise it's sure death for
you all.I've argued myself sick with him, but he's as set as
concrete.I'll do what I can for you if you come out; but he's going
to have the girl, whether or no.Seems that the Bishop of Cartagena
wants her; and the old crow here is playing politics with him.""Yes, old man," chimed in another voice, which Jose knew to be that of
Harris."You know these fellows are hell on politics."Then to Jose, "What'll I tell the old
duffer?"ejaculated Harris, "if I had a couple of Mausers I could
put these ancient Springfields on the bum in a hurry!""Tell him, friend, that we are prepared to die," replied Jose
drearily, as he turned back into the gloom and took Carmen's hand.The final assault began, and Jose knew that it was only a question of
minutes when the trembling doors would fall.He crouched with his
companions behind the altar, awaiting the inevitable."Love will save us, Padre," she whispered.They don't know what is using them--and it has no power!Rosendo bent over and whispered to Don Jorge, "When the doors fall and
the men rush in, stand you here with me!When they reach the altar we
will throw ourselves upon them, I first, you following, while Juan
will bring Carmen and try to protect her.With our _machetes_ we will
cut our way out.If we find that it is hopeless--then give me
Carmen!"A moment later, as with a loud wail, the two front doors burst asunder
and fell crashing to the floor.A flood of golden sunlight poured into
the dark room.In its yellow wake rushed the mob, with exultant yells.Rosendo rose quickly and placed himself at the head of his little
band.But, ere the first of the frenzied besiegers had crossed the threshold
of the church, a loud cry arose in the _plaza_.Down the main thoroughfare came a volley of shots.Don Mario, half way
through the church door, froze in his tracks.Those of his followers
who had entered, turned quickly and made pellmell for the exit.Their
startled gaze met a company of federal troops rushing down the street,
firing as they came.But the doors were prone upon the floor,
and could not be replaced.Then he and his men scrambled out and
rushed around to one side of the building.As the soldiers came
running up, the Alcalde's followers fired point blank into their
faces, then dropped their guns and fled precipitately.Within an hour staid old Simiti lay in the
grip of martial law, with its once overweening Alcalde, now a meek and
frightened prisoner, arraigned before Captain Morales, holding court
in the shabby town hall.But the court-martial was wholly perfunctory.Though none there but
himself knew it, the captain had come with the disposal of the
unfortunate Don Mario prearranged.A perfunctory hearing of witnesses,
which but increased his approval of his orders, and he pronounced
sentence upon the former Alcalde, and closed the case."Attack upon the church--Assassination of the man Lazaro--Firing upon
federal soldiers--To be shot at sunset, senor," he concluded
solemnly.I was ordered by him to do
it!""_Bien_, senor," replied the captain, whose heart was not wholly
devoid of pity, "produce your letters.""_Senor Capitan_," interposed Jose, "may I plead for the man?He
is--"

"There, Padre," returned the captain, holding up a hand, "it is
useless.Doubtless this has been brought about by motives which you do
not understand.You have a _carcel_
here?_Bien_," addressing his lieutenant, "remove the prisoner to it,
and at sunset let the sentence be carried out."Don Mario, screaming with fear, was dragged from the room."And now, senores," continued the captain calmly, as if nothing out of
the ordinary had occurred, "I appoint Don Fernando, former secretary,
as temporary Alcalde, until such time as the Governor may fill the
office permanently.And," he continued, looking about the room with a
heavy scowl, while the timid people shrank against the wall, "as for
those misguided ones who took part with Don Mario in this anticlerical
uprising--his fate will serve, I think, as a warning!"A hush of horror lay upon the stunned people as they filed slowly out
of the room."_Bien_," added the captain, addressing Fernando, "quarters for my
men, and rations.And let all
arms and ammunition be collected.And we
shall want _peones_ to carry it to the river."Jose turned away, sick with the horror of it all.A soldier approached
him with a message from Don Mario.The condemned man was asking for
the last rites.Faint and trembling, the priest accompanied the
messenger to the jail.wailed the terrified and bewildered Don Mario.Don Wenceslas--"

"Yes, I understand, Don Mario," interrupted Jose, tenderly taking the
man's hand."Yes, Padre," sobbed the unfortunate victim."He said that I would be
rich--that I would be elected to Congress--ah, the traitor!And,
Padre--I burned his letters because it was his wish!Ah, _Santa
Virgen_!"He put his head on the priest's shoulder and wept
violently.Jose's heart was wrung; but he was powerless to aid the man.And yet,
as he dwelt momentarily on his own sorrows, he almost envied the fate
which had overtaken the misguided Don Mario."_Senor Padre_," he said, "the sun is low.In
a quarter of an hour--"

Don Mario sank to the ground and clasped the priest's knees.Jose held
up his hand, and the lieutenant, bowing courteously, withdrew.The
priest knelt beside the cowering prisoner."Don Mario," he said gently, holding the man's hand, "confess all to
me.It may be the means of saving other lives--and then you will have
expiated your own crimes.""Padre," moaned the stricken man, rocking back and forth, his head
buried in his hands and tears streaming through his fingers, "Padre,
you will forgive--?"But remove now the last burden from your soul--the guilty
knowledge of the part Don Wenceslas has had in the disaster which has
come upon Simiti.Tell it all, friend, for you may save many precious
lives thereby."The fallen Alcalde roused himself by a mighty effort.Forgetting for
the moment his own dire predicament, he opened his heart.Jose sat
before him in wide-mouthed astonishment.Don Mario's confession
brought a revelation that left him cold.Then, to Don Mario: "And Carmen?"Don Mario leaned close to the priest and whispered low."No, she is
not Diego's child!And, Padre, take her away, at once!There is not an inch of ground in all Colombia now where she
would be safe from Don Wenceslas!"Then he again took Don Mario's
hand."Friend," he said gravely, "rest assured, what you have told me saves
at least one life, and removes the sin with which your own was
stained.And now," rising and turning to the waiting lieutenant, "we
are ready."Santa Virgen, San Salvador, ora pro
nobis!_

A few minutes later a sharp report echoed through the Simiti valley
and startled the herons that were seeking their night's rest on the
wooded isle.Then Jose de Rincon, alone, and with a heart of lead,
moved slowly down through the dreary village and crossed the deserted
_plaza_ to his lowly abode.CHAPTER 34


The low-hung moon, shrouded in heavy vapor, threw an eldritch shimmer
upon the little group that silently bore the body of the martyred
Lazaro from the old church late that night to the dreary cemetery on
the hill.Jose took but a reluctant part in the proceedings.He would
even have avoided this last service to his faithful friend if he
could.It seemed to him as he stumbled along the stony road behind the
body which Rosendo and Don Jorge carried that his human endurance had
been strained so far beyond the elastic limit that there could now be
no rebound.Every thought that touched his sore mind made it bleed
anew, for every thought that he accepted was acrid, rasping,
oppressive.The sheer weight of foreboding, of wild apprehension, of
paralyzing fear, crushed him, until his shoulders bent low as he
walked.How, lest he perform a miracle, could he hope to extricate
himself and his loved ones from the meshes of the net, far-cast, but
with unerring aim, which had fallen upon them?As he passed the town hall he saw through the open door the captain's
cot, and a guard standing motionless beside it.The captain had
elected to remain there for the night, while his men found a prickly
hospitality among the cowering townsfolk.Jose knew now that the hand
which Don Mario had dealt himself in the game inaugurated by Wenceslas
had been from a stacked deck.He knew that the President of the
Republic had ordered Morales to this inoffensive little town to quell
an alleged anticlerical uprising, and that the execution of the
misguided Alcalde had been determined long before the Hercules had got
under way.He could see that it was necessary for the Government to
sacrifice its agent in the person of the Alcalde, in order to prove
its own loyalty to the Church.And in return therefor he knew it would
expect, not without reason, the cooeperation of the Church in case the
President's interference in the province of Bolivar should precipitate
a general revolt.But what had been determined upon as his own fate?He had not the
semblance of an idea.From the confession of the ruined Alcalde he now
knew that Don Mario had been poisoned against him from the beginning;
that even the letters of introduction which Wenceslas had given him to
the Alcalde contained the charge of his having accomplished the ruin
of the girl Maria in Cartagena, and of his previous incarceration in
the monastery of Palazzola.And Don Mario had confessed in his last
moments that Wenceslas had sought to work through him and Jose in the
hope that the location of the famous mine, La Libertad, might be
revealed.Don Mario had been instructed to get what he could out of
this scion of Rincon; and only his own greed and cupidity had caused
him to play fast and loose with both sides until, falling before the
allurements which Wenceslas held out, he had rushed madly into his own
destruction.Jose realized that so far he himself had proved extremely
useful to Wenceslas--but had his usefulness ended?At these thoughts
his soul momentarily suffused with the pride of the old and hectoring
Rincon stock and rose, instinct with revolt--but only to sink again in
helpless resignation, while the shadow of despair rolled in and
quenched his feeble determination.Rosendo and Don Jorge placed the body in one of the vacant vaults and
filled the entrance with some loose bricks.He had a part to perform,
out there on the bleak hilltop in the ghostly light.But Jose remained
motionless and silent, his head sunk upon his breast.Then Rosendo, waxing troubled, spoke in gentle admonition."He would
expect it, you know, Padre."Bitter tears coursed down his
cheeks, and his voice broke.He laid his head on Rosendo's stalwart
shoulder and wept aloud.The sickly, greenish cast of the moonlight silhouetted the figures of
the three men in grotesque shapes against the cemetery wall and the
crumbling tombs.The morose call of a toucan floated weirdly upon the
heavy air.The faint wail of the frogs in the shallow waters below
rose like the despairing sighs of lost souls.Rosendo wound his long arm about the sorrowing priest.Don Jorge's
muscles knotted, and a muttered imprecation rose from his tight lips.Strangely had the shift and coil of the human mind thrown together
these three men, so different in character, yet standing now in united
protest against the misery which men heap upon their fellow-men in the
name of Christ.Jose, the apostate agent of Holy Church, his hands
bound, and his heart bursting with yearning toward his fellow-men;
Rosendo, simple-minded and faithful, chained to the Church by heredity
and association, yet ashamed of its abuses and lusts; Don Jorge,
fierce in his denunciation of the political and religious sham and
hypocrisy which he saw masking behind the cloak of imperial religion."I have nothing to say, friends," moaned Jose, raising his head;
"nothing that would not still further reveal my own miserable weakness
and the despicable falsity of the Church.If the Church had followed
the Christ, it would have taught me to do likewise; and I should now
call to Lazaro and bid him come forth, instead of shamefully
confessing my impotency and utter lack of spirituality, even while I
pose as an _Alter Christus_.""You--you will leave a blessing with him before we go, Padre?"queried
the anxious Rosendo, clinging still to the frayed edge of his fathers'
faith."My blessing, Rosendo," replied Jose sadly, "would do no good.He lies
there because we have utterly forgotten what the Master came to teach.He lies there because of our false, undemonstrable, mortal beliefs.Oh, that the Church, instead of wasting time murmuring futile prayers
over dead bodies, had striven to learn to do the deeds which the
Christ said we should all do if we but kept his commandments!""But, Padre, you will say Masses for him?"I would not take his or your money to
give to the Church to get his soul out of an imagined purgatory which
the Church long ago invented for the purpose of enriching herself
materially--for, alas!after spiritual riches she has had little
hankering.""To pay God to get His own children out of the flames, eh?""It is what I have always said, the religion of the Church
is a _religion de dinero_.If there ever was a God, either He is still
laughing Himself sick at our follies--or else He has wept Himself to
death over them!"Friend," said Jose solemnly, turning to Don Jorge, "I long since
learned what the whole world must learn some time, that the Church
stands to-day, not as the bride of the Christ, but as the incarnation
of the human mind, as error opposed to Truth.It is the embodiment of
'Who shall be greatest?'It is one of the various phenomena of the
human mentality; and its adherents are the victims of authoritative
falsehood.Its Mass and countless other ceremonies differ in no
essential respect from ancient pagan worship.And so it can do none of the works of the Master.Its corrupting
faith is foully materialistic.And as the human mind expands, the incoming light must drive out the
black beliefs and deeds of Holy Church, else the oncoming centuries
will have no place for it.""But why do you still remain a
priest?I knew when I saw you on the river boat that you
were none.But," his voice dropping to a whisper, "there is a soldier
in the road below.He might think we were
here to plot."When the soldier had passed, they quietly left the gloomy cemetery and
made their way quickly back through the straggling moonlight to
Rosendo's house.Dona Maria, with characteristic quietude, was
preparing for the duties of the approaching day.Jose went to her bedside and bent over her, wondering.What were the
events of the past few days in her sight?What did Lazaro's death and the
execution of Don Mario mean to her?Did she, as he had done, look upon
them as real events in a real world, created and governed by a good
God?Or did she still hold such things to be the unreal phenomena of
the human mentality?--unreal, because opposed to God, and without the
infinite principle.As for himself, how had the current of his life
been diverted by this rare child!What had she not sought to teach him
by her simple faith, her unshaken trust in the immanence of good!True, as a pure reflection of good she had seemed to be the means of
stirring up tremendous evil.But had he not seen the evil eventually
consume itself, leaving her unscathed?He himself had always conceded to the forces of evil as great power as
to those of good--nay, even greater.And even now as he stood looking
at her, wrapped in peaceful slumber, his strained sight caught no
gleam of hope, no light flashing through the heavy clouds of
misfortune that lowered above her.He turned away with an anxious
sigh."Padre," said the gentle Dona Maria, "the two _Americanos_--"

"Ah, yes," interrupted Jose, suddenly remembering that he had sent
word to them to use his house while they remained in the town."They brought their baggage to your house an hour ago and set up their
beds in your living room."Good," he replied, a wistful sense of gratitude stealing over him at
the reassuring thought of their presence."_Bien_, we will not disturb
them."Summoning Rosendo and Don Jorge, the three men sought the lake's edge.There, seated on the loose shales, they wrestled with their problem
until dawn spread her filmy veil over the shimmering stars.*       *       *       *       *

Long before sun-up the soldiers and the _peones_, whom Captain Morales
had impressed, were busy gathering the commandeered rifles and
carrying them down to the gunboat Hercules, waiting at the mouth of
the Boque river, some six or eight miles distant, and over a wild
trail.The townsfolk, thoroughly frightened, hugged the shelter of
their homes, and left the streets to the troops.Though they detested
the soldiers, yet none would lightly risk a blow from the heavy hand
of Morales, whose authority on a punitive expedition of this sort was
unlimited.The summary execution of the Alcalde had stricken them with
horror, and left an impression which never would be erased from their
memories.Immediately after the early _desayuno_ the captain appeared at
Rosendo's door.He had come to say farewell to the priest.All of the
soldiers had disappeared down the trail, with the exception of the two
who formed the captain's small personal escort."_Conque, adios, Senor Padre_" he called cheerily, as he approached.Jose was sitting at table with Rosendo's family and Don Jorge.Instinctively he rose hastily, and seizing Carmen, thrust her into the
adjoining bedroom and closed the door.Then he went out to face the
captain."Much excitement for your little _pueblo_, no?"exclaimed the captain
with a bluff laugh as he grasped Jose's hand."But a lesson like this
will last a century.I rejoice that I found it unnecessary to burn the
town.""_Senor Capitan_, I, too, rejoice.But--the state of the country--what may we expect?""_Caramba, Padre mio_!There
is much talk, many angry looks, much gesturing and waving of hands.The President sees fit to send me here, without
order from the Departmental Governor.He shrugged his shoulders with that expressive Latin
gesture which indicates complete irresponsibility for and indifference
to results."_Bueno pues, Senor Capitan_,"
he said hurriedly."I wish you every felicitation on your return trip.Ah--ah--your orders contained no reference to--to me?""None whatever, _Senor Padre_," replied the captain genially.He
turned to go, and Jose stifled a great sigh of relief.But suddenly
the captain stopped; then turned again.He fumbled in an inner pocket and drew forth a telegraphic document."_And you will seize the person of one Rosendo Ariza's daughter and
immediately send her with proper conveyance to the Sister Superior of
the convent of Our Lady in Cartagena_," he read aloud.From within Rosendo's house came a soft,
scurrying sound.Morales returned
the folded message to his pocket and started to enter the house.He was rendered suddenly inert, although
vividly conscious of a drama about to be enacted in which he and his
loved ones would play leading _roles_.As in a dream he heard the
captain address Rosendo and gruffly demand that he produce his
daughter.He heard a deep curse from Rosendo; and his blood congealed
more thickly as he dwelt momentarily on the old man's possible conduct
in the face of the federal demand.He heard Morales hunting
impatiently through the shabby rooms.Then he saw him emerge in a
towering rage--but empty-handed.cried the angry captain, "but what is this?Have
they not had one good lesson, that I must inflict another?I demand to
know, has this Rosendo Ariza a daughter?"He stood waiting for the answer that Jose knew he must make.The
priest's hollow voice sounded like an echo from another world."_Bien_, then I have discovered one honest man in yourself, Padre.You
will now assist me in finding her.""I--I know not--where--where she is, _Senor Capitan_," murmured Jose
with feebly fluttering lips.They were alone, this little party of actors, although many an eye
peered out timidly at them from behind closed shutters and barred
doors around the _plaza_.Don Jorge and Rosendo came out of the house
and stood behind Jose.The captain confronted them, bristling with
wrath at the insolence that dared oppose his supreme authority.The
heat had already begun to pour down in torrents.The morning air was
light, but not a sound traversed it.The principals in this tense
drama might have been painted against that vivid tropical background.Then Harris, moved by his piquant Yankee curiosity, appeared at the
door of the parish house, his great eyes protruding and his head
craned forth like a monster heron."Perhaps the _Americano_ hides the daughter of Ariza!"But ere he reached it Reed suddenly
appeared from behind Harris.In his hand he grasped a large American
flag.Holding this high above his head, he blocked the entrance."We are
American citizens, and this house is under the protection of the
American Government!"Morales fell back and stood with mouth agape in astonishment.The
audacity of this foreign adventurer fairly robbed him of his breath.He glanced dubiously from him to the priest.Then, to save the
situation, he broke into an embarrassed laugh."_Bien_, my good friend," he finally said, addressing Reed in his
courtliest manner, "all respect to your excellent Government.And, if
you will accept it, I shall be pleased to secure you a commission in
the Colombian army.But, my orders--you understand, do you not?The
sun is already high, and I can not lose more time.Therefore, you will
kindly stand aside and permit me to search that house."He motioned to
his men and moved forward.Still holding aloft the flag, Reed drew a long revolver.Harris
quickly produced one of equal size and wicked appearance.Morales
stopped abruptly and looked at them in hesitation.His chief delight
when not in the field was the perusal of a battered history of the
American Civil War; and his exclamations of admiration for the
hardihood of those who participated in it were always loud and
frequent.But he, too, had a reputation to sustain.The Americans
stood grimly silent before him.Harris's finger twitched nervously
along the trigger, and a smile played over his thin lips.Then, his face flaming with shame and chagrin, Morales turned to his
escort and commanded them to advance.A moment more, and--

A cry came from Rosendo's house.Ana, her face swollen with weeping,
clasping her sightless babe to her bosom, had emerged and faced the
captain."Senor," she said in a voice strained to a whisper, "I am the daughter
of Rosendo Ariza."A half-suppressed exclamation burst from the lips of Rosendo.A
desperate, suffocating joy surged over the riven soul of the priest.Don Jorge's mouth opened, but no sound came forth.This precipitate
_denouement_ held them rigid with astonishment.In the eyes of Jose Ana's
tense figure, standing grim and rigid before the captain, took on a
dignity that was majestic, a worth that transcended all human
computation.A Magdalen, yes, standing with her sin-conceived child
clasped in her trembling arms.this
sacrificial act broke the alabaster box and spread the precious nard
over the feet of the pitying Christ."It is," murmured the dazed priest, scarce hearing his own words."But--I have no orders respecting a child--"

"They cannot be separated," half whispered Jose, not daring to meet
the vacant gaze of the babe.Then, with an upward glance at
the sun, he gave a sharp command to his men.Placing the woman between
them, the two soldiers faced about and moved quickly away.With a low
bow and a final "_Adios, Senores_," the captain hurriedly joined them.Ere the little group before Rosendo's house had collected their wits,
the soldiers and their frail charge had mounted the hill beyond the
old church and disappeared into the matted trail that led from it to
the distant river.Rosendo was the first to break the mesmeric silence.His knees gave way beneath him and he buried his face in his
hands.Then he rose hastily, and made as if to pursue the soldiers.cried Don Jorge, "but it is the hand of Providence!Listen, friend Rosendo, it but gives us time to act!When the mistake is discovered they will return,
and they will bring her back unharmed--though they may not learn until
she reaches Cartagena!_Bien_, we can not waste time in mourning now!Rosendo strove to unravel his tangled wits.Jose went to him and
clasped his big hand."Rosendo--friend--would you have it different?I--I alone am to blame
that they took Anita!But--it was to save--to save--Ah, God!if I did
wrong, take the American's revolver and shoot me!"He tore open his
cassock and stood rigid before the dazed man.Anguish and soul-torture
had warped his features."We
shall find plenty of others more deserving of shooting, I think!Reed turned back into the parish house, and emerged a moment later
with Carmen and Dona Maria, who knew not as yet of Ana's departure."I
hid them in your bedroom, Padre," Reed explained."Dona Maria," he cried, "do you
take Carmen into your house and await our decision!And you, men, go
into my study!It is as Don Jorge says, we must act quickly!It may serve to protect us further
against the angry people of Simiti!"The five men quickly gathered in Jose's living room in a strained,
excited group.Rapidly he related
in detail Don Mario's last confession.When he had closed, Reed made
reply."Old man," he said, familiarly addressing Jose, "having seen the girl,
I do not at all wonder that blood has been shed over her.But to keep
her another hour in Simiti is to sacrifice her.If not, the people will drive you out.With the soldiers gone, the people will rise up against
you all.""But, friend, where shall we go?""There is
no place in Colombia now where she would be safe!""It can not be done," interposed Don Jorge."It would be impossible
for him to escape down the river with the girl, even if he had funds
to carry her away from Colombia, which he has not.To take the trail would only postpone for a short
time their certain capture.And then--well, we will not predict!To
flee into the jungle--or to hide among the _peones_ along the
trails--that might be done--yes.""What's the gibberish about now, pal?"put in Harris, whose knowledge
of the Spanish tongue was _nil_."Well, that's easy," returned Harris."Tell 'em you'll take the girl
out yourself.She's white enough to pass as your daughter, you know."Rosendo, stunned by the sudden departure of Ana, had sat in a state of
stupefaction during this conversation.But now he roused up and turned
to Reed.The latter translated his friend's suggestion, laughing as he
commented on its gross absurdity.Rosendo dropped his head again upon his chest and lapsed into silence.Then he rose unsteadily and passed a hand slowly across his brow.A
strange light had come into his eyes.For a moment he stood looking
fixedly at Reed."Senores," he said, rolling his syllables sonorously, "the time has
come at last!For years I have waited, waited, knowing that some day
the great gift which the good God put into my hands for the little
Carmen would be needed.The cruel
Spaniards drove them to and from their heavy labors with the lash; and
when the great war ended, they sank exhausted into their graves.My
parents--I have not told you this, Padre--were the slaves of Don
Ignacio de Rincon!"An exclamation burst from the astonished priest's lips.What, then,
had this man been concealing all these years?Little wonder that he
had hesitated when he learned that a Rincon had come to the parish of
Simiti!As he continued, his recital became
dramatic.As they listened, his auditors sat spellbound."Don Ignacio de Rincon himself was kind of heart.But his overseers--ah,
_Dios arriba_!Many a time the great lash wound
itself about my poor father's shrinking body, and hurled him shrieking to
the ground--and why?Because his blistered hands could not hold the
_batea_ with which he washed gold for your grandfather, Padre, your
grandfather!"A groan escaped him, and tears
trickled slowly down his sunken cheeks."I bear you no malice, Padre," continued Rosendo."It was hard those
first days to accept you here.But when, during your fever, I
learned from your own lips what you had suffered, I knew that you
needed a friend, and I took you to my bosom.And now I am glad--ah,
very glad, that I did so.But, though my confidence in you increased
day by day, I could never bring myself to tell you my great
secret--the secret that now I reveal for the sake of the little
Carmen.Padre--senores--I--_I am the owner of the great mine, La
Libertad_!"Had the heavens collapsed the astonishment of Don Jorge and the priest
could not have been greater.The coming of the soldiers, the terrific
strain of the past few days, culminating in the loss of Ana--all was
for the moment obliterated.Rosendo paused a moment for the effect which he knew his revelation
would produce, and then went on rapidly:

"Padre, the mine belonged to your grandfather.The gold taken from it was brought down the Guamoco trail to
Simiti, and from here shipped to Cartagena, where he lived in great
elegance.I make no doubt the gold which you and the little Carmen
discovered in the old church that day came from this same wonderful
mine.But the ore was quartz, and _arrastras_ were required to grind
it, and much skill was needed, too.He had men from old Spain, deeply
versed in such knowledge.Ah, the tales my poor father told of that
mine!"_Bien_, the war broke out.The Guamoco region became depopulated, and
sank back into the jungle.The location of the mine had been recorded
in Cartagena; but, as you know, when Don Ignacio fled from this
country he destroyed the record.He did the same with the records in
Simiti, on that last flying trip here, when he hid the gold in the
altar of the old church.And then the jungle grew up around the mine
during those thirteen long years of warfare--the people who knew of it
died off--and the mine was lost, utterly lost!"The little group sat enthralled before him.All
but Harris, who was vainly beseeching Reed to translate to him the
dramatic story."Padre," continued Rosendo at length, "from what my father had told me
I had a vague idea of the location of that mine.And many a weary day
I spent hunting for it!It was while I was on the Tigui, washing gold.I was
working near what we used to call _Pozo Cayman_, opposite La Colorado,
where the Frenchmen died.I camped on the lonely bank there, with only
the birds and the wondering animals to keep me company.One dark
night, as I lay on the ground, I had a dream.I dreamt that the Virgin, all in white, came to me where I
lay--that she whispered to me and told me to rise quickly and drive
away the devil.It was still dark, but a pair of fiery eyes were
gleaming at me from the bush.I seized my _machete_ and started after
them.It was a jaguar, Padre, and he fled up the hill from me.Why I
followed, I know not, unless I thought, still half asleep as I was,
that I was obeying the Virgin."At the top of the hill I lost the animal--and myself, as well.I am a
good woodsman, senores, and not easily lost.But this time my poor
head went badly astray.At last I
came to the edge of a steep ravine.I clambered down the sides into
the gully below.I thought it looked like an old trail, and I followed
it.So narrow was it at times that the walls almost touched.Then it widened, and I knew that at last I was in a trail,
long since abandoned--and how old, only the good God himself knew!"But my story grows as long as the trail!On and on I went, crossing
stream after stream, scaring snakes from my path, frightening the
birds above, who doubtless have never seen men in that region, all the
time thinking I was going toward the Tigui, until at last the old
sunken trail led me up a tremendous hill.At the top, buried in a
dense matting of brush, I fell over a circle of stones.They were the
remains of an ancient _arrastra_.Further on I found another; and
still another.Then, near them, the stone foundations of houses, long
since gone to decay.From these the trail took me into a gully, where
but little water flowed.I struck
off a piece from one of the largest.I went on up the stream, striking
off piece after piece from the great rocks.Every one showed specks of
free gold.Tunnel after tunnel yawned at me from the hillside.Some of
these were still open, where they had been driven through the hard
rock.I had my wallet, in which I always carry
matches and a bit of candle.far within I crossed a quartz vein--I scraped it with my
_machete_.it could not have been less than six feet in
width--and all speckled with gold!Above it, far into the blackness,
where bats were scurrying madly, the ore had been taken out long, long
ago.In the darkness below I stumbled over old, rusted tools.Every
one bore the inscription, 'I de R.'Your grandfather, Padre, put his
stamp on everything belonging to him.Then, as I sat trying to place
myself, my father's oft-told story of the location of the mine flashed
into my brain.I was at the headwaters of the Borrachera._And I had discovered La
Libertad_!"Reed's eager ears had drunk in every word of the old man's dramatic
story.When Rosendo
paused again, he quickly asked:

"The title, senor?"Rosendo drew forth a paper from his bosom."You will recall, Padre," he said, addressing the dully wondering
Jose, "that I once asked you to give me a name for a mine--a rare
name?And you told me to call it the--the--what is it?""Yes," exclaimed the old man excitedly, "that is it!_Bien_, I told no
one of my discovery of years before.I had never had money enough to
get the title to it.But when it seemed that I
might soon have use for it I sold my _finca_ for funds and had Lazaro
apply through Don Mario for title to a mine called--called--"

"The Chicago mine," said Jose, again coming to the rescue._Bien_, Lazaro got the title, which I never could have done,
for at that time Don Mario would not have put through any papers for
me.I then had the unsuspecting Lazaro transfer the title to me,
and--_Bien_, I am the sole owner of La Libertad!"Reed examined the paper at some length, and then handed it back to
Rosendo."Can we not talk business, senor?""I am so situated that I can float an American company
to operate this mine, and allow you a large percentage of the returns.he exclaimed, unable longer to contain himself, "it is
your fortune!""Senor," replied Rosendo, slowly shaking his head, "I want no share in
any of your American companies.But--your friend--he has suggested
just what has been running through my mind ever since you came to
Simiti."The wild, terrifying idea tore through
his fraught brain.He turned quickly to Reed and addressed him in
English."Such a thing is
quite out of the question!"Priest, Reed's wife is
in Cartagena, waiting for him.Came down from New York that far for
the trip.What's to prevent her from taking
the girl to the States and placing her in a boarding school there
until such time as you can either follow, or this stew down here has
settled sufficiently to permit of her returning to you?"Reed threw up a deprecatory hand."But," interposed Harris exasperatedly, "would you leave the ravishing
little beauty here to fall into the hands of the cannibals who are
trailing her?if it weren't for the looks of the thing I'd
take her myself.But you've got a wife, so it'd be easy."He leaned
over to Reed and concluded in a whisper, "The old man's going to make
a proposition--listen!""But," remonstrated the latter, "the expense of keeping her in New
York indefinitely!For, unless I mistake much, none of these people
will ever see the States after she leaves.And then I have an adopted
daughter on my hands!now that my ambitious wife is
determined to break into New York society with her adorable sister, I
have no money to waste on adopted children!"Rosendo, who had been studying the Americans attentively during their
conversation, now laid a hand on Reed's."Senor," he said in a quiet
tone, "if you will take the little Carmen with you, and keep her safe
from harm until Padre Jose can come to you, or she can be returned to
us here, I will transfer to you a half interest in this mine."he cried wildly, "do not do that!_Dios arriba_, no!Ah, senor," turning to Reed, "I beg you will
forgive--but Rosendo is mad to suggest such a thing!We cannot permit
it--we--I--oh, God above!"He sank again into his chair and covered
his face with his hands.Don Jorge gave vent to a long, low whistle.Rosendo, his voice husky
and his lips trembling, went on:

"I know, Padre--I know.I will give the mine to
the American--and to Carmen.He has a powerful government back of him,
and he is able to defend the title and save her interest as well as
his own.As for me, I--_Bien_, I shall want nothing when Carmen
goes--nothing.""If you
don't tell me what all this is about now I shall shoot--and not
straight up, either!""Senores," said Reed in a controlled voice, "let me talk this matter
over with my friend here.Rosendo and Don Jorge bowed and silently withdrew from the parish
house.The former went at once to apprise the wondering Dona Maria of
the events which had crowded the morning's early hours and to answer
her apprehensive questionings regarding Ana.Carmen was to know only
that Ana--but what could he tell her?That the woman had sacrificed
herself for the girl?No; but that they had seized this opportunity to
send her, under the protection of Captain Morales, to the Sisters of
the Convent of Our Lady.The old man knew that the girl would see only
God's hand in the event.It seemed to him that once his arms
closed about her no power under the skies could tear them asunder.He
found her sitting in the doorway at the rear of Rosendo's house,
looking dreamily out over the placid lake.Cucumbra, now old and
feeble, slept at her feet.As the man approached he heard her murmur
repeatedly, "It is not true--it is not true--it is not true!""Gladly, Padre--but where?""God only knows--to the end of the world!""Well, Padre dear," she softly replied, as she smiled up into his
drawn face, "we will start out.But I think we had better rest when we
reach the shales, don't you?"CHAPTER 35


"No, Padre dear," with an energetic shake of her head, "no.Not even
after all that has seemed to happen to us do I believe it true.No, I
do not believe it real.It does not exist,
excepting in the human mind.And that, as you yourself know, can not
be real, for it is all that God is not."They were seated beneath the slowly withering _algarroba_ tree out on
the burning shales.Jose still held the girl's hand tightly in his.Again he was struggling with self, struggling to pass the borderline
from, self-consciousness to God-consciousness; striving, under the
spiritual influence of this girl, to break the mesmeric hold of his
own mortal beliefs, and swing freely out into his true orbit about the
central Sun, infinite Mind.The young girl, burgeoning into a marvelous womanhood, sat before him
like an embodied spirit.Her beauty of soul shone out in gorgeous
luxuriance, and seemed to him to envelop her in a sheen of radiance.The brilliant sunshine glanced sparkling from her glossy hair into a
nimbus of light about her head.Her rich complexion was but faintly
suggestive to him of a Latin origin.Her oval face and regular
features might have indicated any of the ruddier branches of the
so-called Aryan stock.But his thought was not dwelling on these
things now.It was brooding over the events of the past few weeks, and
their probable consequences."Padre dear," she had said, when his tremulous voice ceased, "how
much longer will you believe that two and two are seven?And how much
longer will you try to make me believe it?Oh, Padre, at first you did
seem to see so clearly, and you talked so beautifully to me!And then,
when things seemed to go wrong, you went right back to your old
thoughts and opened the door and let them all in again.And so things
couldn't help getting worse for you.You told me yourself, long ago,
that you would have to empty your mind of its old beliefs.But I guess
you didn't get them all out.If you had cleaned house and got your
mind ready for the good thoughts, they would have come in.You know,
you have to get ready for the good, before it can come.But you go right on getting ready for evil.If you loved
God--really _loved_ Him--why, you would not be worried and anxious
to-day, and you would not be believing still that two and two are
seven.You told me, oh, so long ago!that this human life was just a
_sense_ of life, a series of states of consciousness, and that
consciousness was only mental activity, the activity of thought.Well,
I remembered that, and put it into practice--but you didn't.A true
consciousness is the activity of true thought, you said.A false
consciousness is the activity of false thought.True thought comes
from God, who is mind.False thought is the opposite of true thought,
and doesn't come from any mind at all, but is just supposition.A
supposition is never really created, because it is never real--never
truth.True thought becomes externalized to us in good, in harmony, in
happiness.False thought becomes externalized to us in unhappiness,
sickness, loss, in wrong-doing, and in death.It is unreal, and yet
awfully real to those who believe it to be real.Why don't you act
your knowledge, as you at first said you were going to do?I have all
along tried to do this.Whenever thoughts come to me I always look
carefully at them to see whether they are based on any real principle,
on God.Sometimes it
has been hard to tell just which were true and which false.And
sometimes I got caught, and had to pay the penalty.But every day I do
better; and the time will come at last when I shall be able to tell at
once which thoughts are true and which untrue.When that time comes,
nothing but good thoughts will enter, and nothing but good will be
externalized to me in consciousness.I shall be in heaven--all the
heaven there is.It is the heaven which Jesus talked so much about,
and which he said was within us all.It is so simple, Padre dear, so
simple!"The man sat humbly before her like a rebuked child.Indeed, these were the very things that he had taught her
himself.Why, then, had he failed to demonstrate them?Only because
he had attempted to mix error with truth--had clung to the reality and
immanence of evil, even while striving to believe good omnipotent and
infinite.He had worked out these theories, and they had appeared
beautiful to him.But, while Carmen had eagerly grasped and
assimilated them, even to the consistent shaping of her daily life to
accord with them, he had gone on putting the stamp of genuineness and
reality upon every sort of thought and upon every human event as it
had been enacted in his conscious experience.His difficulty was that,
having proclaimed the allness of spirit, God, he had proceeded to bow
the knee to evil.Carmen had seemed to know that the mortal, material
concepts of humanity would dissolve in the light of truth.He, on the
other hand, had clung to them, even though they seared the mind that
held them, and became externalized in utter wretchedness."When you let God's thoughts in, Padre, and drive out their
opposites, then sickness and unhappiness will disappear, just as
the mist disappears over the lake when the sun rises and the light
goes through it.If you really expected to some day see the now
'unseen things' of God, you would get ready for them, and you would
'rejoice always,' even though you did seem to see the wickedness of
Padre Diego, the coming of the soldiers, the death of Lazaro and Don
Mario, and lots of unhappiness about yourself and me.Those men are
not dead--except to your thought.You ought to know that all these
things are the unreal thoughts externalized in your consciousness.And, knowing them for what they really are, the opposites of God's
thoughts, you ought to know that they can have no more power over
you than anything else that you know to be supposition.We can
suppose that two and two are seven, but we can't make it true.The
supposition does not have any effect upon us.But as regards just thought--and you yourself said that everything
reduces to thought--why, people seem to think it is different.Don't you understand what the good man Jesus meant when he
told the Pharisees to first cleanse the cup and platter within,
that the outside might also be clean?Why, that was a clear case of
externalization, if there ever was one!Cleanse your thought, and
everything outside of you will then become clean, for your clean
thought will become externalized.You once said that you believed
in the theory that 'like attracts like.'I believe that
good thoughts attract good ones, and evil thoughts attract thoughts
like themselves.And you ought to know that your
life shows it, too.You hold fear-thoughts and worry-thoughts, and
then, just as soon as these become externalized to you as misfortune
and unhappiness, you say that evil is real and powerful, and that
God permits it to exist.Yes, God does permit all the existence
there is to a supposition--which is none.You pity yourself and all
the world for being unhappy, when all you need is to do as Jesus told
you, and know God to be infinite Mind, and evil to be only the
suppositional opposite, without reality, without life, without
power--unless you give it these things in your own consciousness.You
don't have to take thought for your life.You don't have to be
covetous, or envious, or fearful, or anxious.You couldn't do
anything if you were.Jesus said that
of himself he could do nothing.But--as soon as he recognized God as
the infinite principle of all, and acted that knowledge--why, then
he raised the dead!And at last, when his understanding was greater,
he dissolved the mental concept which people called his human body.Don't you see it, Padre--don't you?And yet:

"But, Carmen, padre Rosendo would send you out of the country with
these Americans!"And you have said that you have always feared
you would lose me.I have not
feared that I would lose you.But, Padre dear--"

The ghastly look on the man's face threw wide the flood-gates of her
sympathy."Padre--all things work together for good, you know.Listen--" She clung more closely to
him."Padre, it may be best, after all.You do not want me to stay always
in Simiti.And if I go, you will go with me, or soon follow.Oh, Padre
dear, you have told me that up in that great country above us the
people do not know God as you and I are learning to know Him.Padre--I
want to go and tell them about Him!I've wanted to for a long, long
time."The girl's eyes shone with a holy light.Her wistful face glowed with
a love divine."Padre dear, you have so often said that I had a message for the
world.Do not the people up north need that message?The people of Simiti are too dull to hear the message
now.But up there--Oh, Padre, it may be right that I should go!And, if it is right, nothing can prevent it, for the right _will_ be
externalized!Such a spirit as hers could not
long be confined within the narrow verges of Simiti.He must not
oppose his egoism to her interests.And, besides, he might follow
soon.it might be the opening of the
way to the consummation of that heart-longing for--

Ah, the desperate joy that surged through his yearning soul at the
thought!A year, two, three, and he would still
be a young man!She loved him--never had man had such proofs as he of
an affection so divine!"Carmen," he said tenderly, drawing her closer to him, "you may be
right.Yes--we will both go with the Americans.Once out of this
environment and free from ecclesiastical chains, I shall do better."The girl looked up at him with brimming eyes."Padre dear," she
whispered, "I want to go--away from Simiti.Juan--he asks me almost
every day to marry him.Even in
the church, when Don Mario was trying to get us, Juan said he would
save me if I would promise to marry him.He said he would go to
Cartagena and kill the Bishop.He--Padre,
he is a good boy.But--I do not--want to marry him."Jose knew how insistent Juan had
become."Padre, you--you are not always going to be a priest--are you?And--I--I--oh, Padre dear, I love you so!"She turned impulsively and
threw both arms about his neck."I want to see you work out your
problem.You can go with me--and I can always live
with you--and some day--some day--" She buried her face in his
shoulder.The artless girl had never seemed to think it unmaidenly to
declare her love for him, to show him unmistakably that she hoped to
become his wife.The beautiful child in his arms
was human!Young in years, and yet a woman by the conventions of these
tropic lands.Why, she had long
insisted that she would wait for him!And why should he now oppose the
externalization of that sweet thought?"Ah, _chiquita_," he murmured, "I will indeed go with you now!I will
send my resignation to the Bishop at once.No, I will wait and send it
from the States.I will renounce my oath, abjure my promise--"

The girl sat suddenly upright and looked earnestly into his eyes.But--I promised my mother, dearest one,
that I would always remain a priest--unless, indeed, the Church
herself should eject me from the priesthood.But, it was foolish--"

"And your mother--she expects you to keep your word?"The girl sat in pensive silence for a moment."But, Padre," she
resumed, "honesty--it is the very first thing that God requires of us.We have to be--we _must_ be honest, for He is Truth.He cannot see or
recognize error, you know.And so He cannot see you and help you if
you are dishonest."And I tried to be honest, even when circumstances and
my own poor resistive force combined to direct me into the priesthood.But--since that day I have lived a life of hypocrisy, not knowing how
to shape my course."But, Padre, the Church has not put you out?"But, if you went to the States--with me--would you be put out of the
Church?""Possibly, _chiquita_.""And what would that mean, Padre?""The disgrace that always attaches to an apostate priest, child.""And, Padre--your mother--what would she say?""It would kill her," he replied slowly.Carmen reflected long, while Jose, with ebbing hope, waited."Padre
dear," she finally said, "then you have not yet worked out your
problem--have you?"And he was now attempting to solve it by flight."I mean, Padre, you have not worked it out in God's way.For if you
had, no one would be hurt, and there could not be any disgrace, or
unhappiness--could there?""But, _chiquita_," he cried in despair, "nothing but excommunication
can release me!And I long ago ceased to look for that.You do not
understand--you are young!"Why, Padre dear, you can work it out, all out, in God's way.""But--must I remain here--can I let you go alone with the Americans--?""Yes, you can, if it is right," she answered gently.he cried, straining her in his arms."If you go with the
Americans, I shall, I must, go too!""Not unless it is right, Padre," she insisted."If it is right,
nothing can keep you from going.But, unless it is God's way--well,
you can not solve your problem by running away from it.""But--child--to remain here means--God above!you don't realize what
it may mean to us both!"Jose began to feel that they were
drifting hopelessly, abysmally apart."I have been cheated and thwarted all my
wretched life!I can not, would not, hold
you here, if the way opens for you to go!But--I can not remain here
without you--and live!""That is not true, Padre," replied the girl, slowly shaking her head."No human being is necessary to any one's happiness.You are trying to 'acquire that mind which was in
Christ.'If you are really progressing, why, you will surely be happy.But you must work it all out God's way.""And that--"

"You must be honest, Padre, honest with Him and with everybody.If you
can no longer be a priest--if you are not one, and never have been
one--you must be honest with the Church and with yourself.Why do you not write to the Bishop and
tell him all about it?You must--Padre, you _must_--be honest!Write to your
mother--write to the Bishop.But--oh,
Padre dear, you must trust Him, and you must--you _must_--know that He
is good, that He is infinite, and that there is no evil!Otherwise,
the good can not be externalized.If you did that, your problem would
be quickly solved.""Padre dear," she continued, "God is
life--there is no death.God is all
good--there is no poverty, no lack, no loss.God is infinite, and He
is mind--there is no inability to see the right and to do it.God is
my mind, my spirit, my soul, my all.I look at God constantly, and strive always to see only Him.But He is just as much to you as He is to me.You can not outline how
things will work out; but you can know that they can only work out in
the right way.Only by so doing can
you solve your problem.And I have
always worked for you that way.I have always thought the time would
come when you and I would live and work together--always.I have not said that it _had_ to be.If it works
out that way, I know I would be very happy.But, even if it does not,
I shall know that I can not be deprived of any good, for the good God
is everywhere, and He is love, and He has given me all happiness.And
now we must leave everything to Him, while we work, work, work to see
Him only everywhere."Suffering himself to be led by her, they
crossed the shales to the dust-laden road and made their way silently
through the burning heat into the village.At the door of the parish house stood Rosendo.His face was grave, but
his manner calm."Padre," he announced, "it is arranged."Jose's knees shook under him as he followed the old man into the
house.Reed, Harris, and Don Jorge sat about the table, on which were
strewn papers covered with figures and sketches.The priest sat down
dumbly and drew Carmen to him.Harris fell to devouring the girl with
his bulging eyes.Reed at once plunged into the topic under
consideration."I have been saying," he began, addressing the priest, "that I can
accept the proposal made by Don Rosendo, but with some amendments.Harris and I are under contract with the Molino Company to report upon
their properties along the Boque river.I am informed by Don Rosendo
that he is acquainted with these alleged mines, and knows them to be
worthless.Be that as it may, I am obliged to examine them.But I will
agree to take this girl to New York, under the protection of my wife,
upon the consideration that when I reach my home city I be allowed to
form a company to take over this mine, returning to the girl a
fifty-one per cent interest in the stock, one half of which she agrees
in writing to deliver to me immediately upon its issuance.Being under
contract, I can not accept it now.The balance of the stock must be
sold for development purposes.I further agree to place the girl in a
boarding school of the first quality in the States, and to bear all
expenses of her maintenance until such time as she is either
self-supporting, or one or several of you may come to her, or effect
her return to Colombia.Now, according to Ariza's sketches, we may
proceed up the Boque river to its headwaters--how far did you say,
friend?""Some hundred and fifty miles from Simiti, senor," replied Rosendo."And then," resumed Reed, "we can cut across country from the sources
of the Boque, following what is known as Rosario creek, down to the
river Tigui, striking the latter somewhere near the ancient point
known as La Colorado.""But, senor," interposed Rosendo, "remember that the headwaters of the
Boque are practically unknown to-day.Many years ago, when I was a
small lad, some liberated slaves worked along Rosario creek, which was
then one day's journey on foot with packs from La Colorado.But that
old trail has long since disappeared.Probably no one has been over it
since.""Very well," returned the practical Reed, "then we shall have to make
our own trail across the divide to the Tigui.But once at La Colorado,
you tell me there is an ancient trail that leads down to Llano, on the
Nechi river?""Yes, to the mouth of the Amaceri.Llano was something of a town long
ago.But river steamers that go up the Nechi as far as Zaragoza once a
month, or less frequently, still touch there, I am told.And so you
can get down the Cauca to Maganguey, where you can change to a
Magdalena river boat for Calamar.The trail
to Llano can not be more than fifty miles in length, and fairly
open."Harris, who had been studying the sketches, whistled softly.he muttered, "nearly two hundred miles, and all by foot, over
unspeakable jungle trails!""Very well, then," he continued, "we
had best set out as soon as possible.To you, friend Rosendo, I leave
all arrangements regarding supplies and _cargadores_.I will furnish
funds for the entire expedition, expecting to be reimbursed by La
Libertad."Carmen listened, with dilated eyes.Starting hurriedly after Rosendo, who rose immediately to inaugurate
preparations, he drew him into the latter's house.he
cried, his whole frame tremulous with agitation, "do you know what you
are doing?Do you--"

"_Na_, Padre," replied Rosendo gently, as he held up a restraining
hand, "it is best.I want the _Americanos_ to take Carmen.At any moment an order might come for your arrest or
mine.The struggle has been long, and I weary of it."He sat down in
exhaustion and mopped his damp brow.If I can but know that she is safe--_Bien_, that is all.From what we
have learned, this country will soon be plunged again into war.I do
not wish to live through another revolution.I seem
to have fought all my life.I doubt
if I could even hold it, were it known here that I had the title to
such a famous mine.But the _Americano_ can hold it.He will save Carmen's interest, and deal fairly with her._Bien_, let him place her in a school in the States.If you weather
the oncoming revolution, then you may be able to send for her."Rosendo," he said, "I will go with her.""Do you mean, Padre, that you
will leave the Church?""Can I remain longer in Simiti, where the people have become
divided--where they look upon me askance, as the cause of the trouble
that has befallen them?What, think you, will it mean to Simiti?And Wenceslas,
what has he further in store for you and me?What he has for Carmen,
we well know.But the disappearance
of Diego has not been explained.The trick which Anita played upon
Morales to save Carmen must bring down increased wrath upon our heads,
especially yours and mine.No, Rosendo, you and I must go, and go at
once!""We will pick her up in Cartagena.I have certain information to give him that will enlist his
services--information which, I think, will serve to introduce him
to His Grace, and somewhat abruptly.But, come, Rosendo, do you and
Dona Maria prepare for flight!"I will go with
the _Americanos_ up the Boque and to La Libertad.Then I will return
to Simiti--or to the _hacienda_ of Don Nicolas, if Maria wishes to
remain there while I am in the hills.But--do you go, Padre--go and
look after the girl.Yes,
Padre, go--go!""But--ah, Rosendo, you will reconsider?The Americans will take us all
for that mine!"No, Padre," said the old man firmly, but in a voice heavy with
sadness.My work is done when I have
seen the girl safely out of this unhappy country.Carmen came bounding in and flew into Rosendo's arms.she cried, aglow with animation, "we are all going to the States up
north!Oh, padre, isn't it beautiful!""Ah, _chiquita_," said Rosendo cheerily, straining her to him, "I
guess we have decided to send you on ahead--a little ahead of us.Your
old padre has some business he must attend to here before he leaves."Jose knew what his effort at cheerfulness was
costing him."But, padre Rosendo, you will come--later?She
looked into his eyes, pleading wistfully."Yes, little one, yes--of course.For where you are, there your old
padre will always be--always--always!"panted the girl under Rosendo's tight grasp as she
turned her head toward the priest."He goes with us," assured Rosendo--"I think--at least as far as the
coast.He will see Anita--and--" His voice broke, and he turned
abruptly away."And she will go to the States with us!cried the girl,
bounding up and down with joy.Jose turned and went quickly into his own house.With grim determination
he drew the battered haircloth trunk from beneath his bed and began
to throw his few effects into it.But he had scarce begun when Juan, now bearing the proud title of
official courier between Simiti and Bodega Central, entered with a
letter.Jose recognized the writing, and tore it open at once."My beloved son, at last, after these many years of most rigid
economy, even of privation, I have saved enough from my meager income,
together with what little you have been able to send me from time to
time, and a recent generous contribution from your dear uncle, to
enable me to visit you.I shall sail for Colombia just as soon as you
send me detailed instructions regarding the journey.And, oh, my son,
to see you offering the Mass in your own church, and to realize that
your long delayed preferment is even at hand, for so your good uncle
informs me daily, will again warm the blood in a heart long chilled by
poignant suffering.Till we meet, the Blessed Virgin shield you, my
beloved son."The letter slipped from the priest's fingers and drifted to the floor.With a moan he sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.CHAPTER 36


What had kept Jose de Rincon chained all these years to an institution
to which in thought, feeling, and sympathy he was so utterly alien, we
have repeatedly pointed out--a warped sense of filial devotion, a
devotion that would not willingly bring sorrow upon his proud,
sensitive mother, and yet the kind that so often accomplishes just
that which it strives to avoid.But yet he had somehow failed to note
the nice distinction which he was always making between the promises
he had given to her and the oath which he had taken at his ordination.He had permitted himself to be held to the Church by his mother's fond
desires, despite the fact that his nominal observance of these had
wrecked his own life and all but brought her in sorrow to the grave.The abundance of his misery might be traced to forgetfulness of the
sapient words of Jesus: "For whosoever shall do the will of my Father
which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."And he had sacrificed his new-found life to the
child.He had exhausted every expedient to keep himself in Simiti,
that he might transfer his own great learning to this girl, and at the
same time yield himself to her beneficent influence.Yet, despite his
vague hopes, he had always dimly seen the day when she would leave
him; but he had likewise tried to feel that when it arrived his own
status would be such that the ecclesiastical ties which bound him
would be loosened, and he would be free to follow her.the lapse
of years had brought little change in that respect.But now he saw the girl entering upon that very hour of departure
which all his life in Simiti had hung like a menacing cloud above
him.And the shock had been such that he had thrown every other
consideration to the winds, and, regardless of consequences, was madly
preparing to accompany her.Then, like a voice from the tomb, had come
his mother's letter.Indeed, for the past two nights sleep had
avoided his haggard eyes.In the feeble glow of his candle he sat in
his little bedroom by his rough, bare table, far into the hours of
morning, struggling, resolving, hoping, despairing--and, at last,
yielding.If he had been born anew that fateful day, seven years
before, when Rosendo first told him the girl's story, he had this
night again died.When the gray hours of dawn stole silently across
the distant hills he rose.He staggered as he passed out through the living room where
lay the sleeping Americans.Rosendo met him in front of the house.exclaimed the old man as he noted the priest's appearance."Do not speak of it, Rosendo."It has been hard on you, Padre.And in the States with her--"

"For God's sake, friend, never speak of that again!"How long will it take to complete your preparations?""_Bien_," returned the amazed Rosendo when he recovered his breath,
"we can get away to-morrow."But you--"

"Hear me, friend.Everything must be conducted in the greatest
secrecy.It must be given out that the Americans go to explore the
Boque; that you accompany them as guide; that Carmen goes as--as cook,
why not?""_Cierto_, she cooks as well as Maria."Juan must be kept in complete ignorance of the real nature
of your trip.He is the courier--I will see
that Fernando sends him again to Bodega Central to-morrow, and keeps
him there for several days.You say it is some two hundred miles to
Llano.How long will it take to go that distance?""Why--_Quien sabe_, Padre?""With a
fair trail, and allowing the _Americanos_ some time to prospect on the
Boque--where they will find nothing--and several days to look over La
Libertad, we ought to reach Llano in six weeks.""A week later, if you do not have to wait a month on the river bank
for the boat.""Then, all going well, within two months Carmen should be out of the
country."You and she--"

"Enough, friend."Go now and bid Carmen come to me immediately after the _desayuno_.Tell Dona Maria that I will eat nothing this morning.I am going up to
the old church on the hill."But Jose turned abruptly and
started away, leaving the old man in a maze of bewilderment.In the gloom of the old church Jose threw himself upon a bench near
the door, and waited torpidly.A few moments later came a voice, and
then the soft patter of bare feet in the thick dust without.Carmen
was talking as she approached.Jose rose in curiosity; but the girl
was alone.In her hand she held a scrubby flower that had drawn a
desperate nourishment from the barren soil at the roadside.She
glanced up at Jose and smiled."It is easy to understand their language, isn't it, Padre?They don't
speak as we do, but they reflect.They stand for His ideas in the human mind.And I. Aren't they wonderful, these flowers!But you know,
they are only the way we interpret certain of God's wonderful ideas.Only, because we mortals believe in death, we see these beautiful
things at last reflecting our thought of death--don't we?We see only
our thoughts, after all.Everything we see about us is reflected
thought.First we see our thoughts of life and beauty and good.And
then our thoughts of decay and death."But God--He never sees anything but the good," she went on."He sees
the real, not the supposition.And when we learn to see only as He
does, why, then we will never again see death.We will see ourselves
as we really are, immortal.Jesus learned
to see that way, didn't he?His thought was finally so pure that he
saw nothing but good.And that gave him such power that he did those
things that the poor, ignorant, wrong-thinking people called miracles.But they were only the things that you and I and everybody else ought
to be doing to-day--and would be doing, if we thought as he did,
instead of thinking of evil."But," she panted, as she sat down beside him, "I've talked a lot,
haven't I?And you sent for me because you wanted to talk.But,
remember," holding up an admonitory finger, "I shall not listen if you
talk anything but good.Oh, Padre dear," looking up wistfully into his
drawn face, "you are still thinking that two and two are seven!How can you ever expect to see good if
you look only at evil?If I looked only at wilted flowers I would
never know there were any others.""Carmen," he said in a hollow voice, "I love you.""Why, of course you do," returned the artless girl.You have just _got_ to love me and everything and everybody.But it had been floating like foam on
his tossing mind."You are going away from me," he continued, almost in a whisper."Why, no, Padre," she replied quickly; "you are going too!Padre
Rosendo said we could start to-morrow at sunrise.""I do not go," he said in a quavering voice.What meant this change which had
come over him so suddenly?His mother's face hovered before him in the dim light.Behind her
a mitered head, symbolizing the Church, nodded and beckoned
significantly.Back of them, as they stood between him and the
girl, he saw the glorified vision of Carmen.He
turned wearily from it to the gentle presence at his side."I stay--to work out--my problem," was his scarcely audible reply.But her breath came more quickly, and her hand
closed more tightly about his."Dearest one," he murmured, bending over the brown curls, "it is God's
way, I guess.Perhaps in the years which I have spent here with you I
have had the time and the opportunity to work out my salvation.But, though I strove in my way, I could not quickly
acquire your spirituality.I could not at once shake loose those
poisonous thoughts of a lifetime, which have at last become
externalized in separation from all that I hold dearest in this life,
you, my beloved girl, you."He buried his face in her luxuriant hair
and strove to hold back the rush of scalding tears."It but shows how poisonous thoughts separate us from all that is
good--even from God," he continued in a choked voice."Oh, my sweet
girl, I love you as it seems to me no human being could love another!It has been so from that first day when, a mere babe, your wonderful
eyes held me until I could read in them a depth of love for mankind
that was divine."It did not seem to him that a mature man was
speaking to a mere girl.She seemed, as always, ages beyond him in
wisdom and experience.Carmen reached up and wound her arms about his neck.He bent low and
kissed her brow.Then he drew himself up quickly and resumed his
broken talk."I believed at first that my salvation lay in you.And so it did, for
from your clear thought I gleaned my first satisfying knowledge of the
great principle, God.I could not seem to realize that
between recognizing righteousness as 'right-thinking' and daily
practicing it so as to 'prove' God there was a great difference.And
so I rested easy in my first gleams of truth, expecting that they
would so warm my soul that it would expand of itself out of all
error."She made as if to reply, but he checked her."I learned enough, I repeat, those first few months here to have
enabled me to work out my salvation, even though with fear and
trembling.But I procrastinated; I vacillated; I still clung to
effete beliefs and forms of thought which I knew were bound to
manifest in unhappiness later.I was afraid to boldly throw myself
upon my thought.Yes, the great Paul was at times
under the same mesmeric spell of human belief, even after he had seen
the vision of the Christ.And now
I see that I must do likewise, for salvation is an individual
experience.No vicarious effort, even of the Christ himself, can save
a man.We must apply it to our
problems ourselves.My unfinished task--scarcely even begun!--lies
still before me.My environment is what I have made it by my own
thought.I believe you, that I can enter another only as I externalize
it through righteousness, right-thinking, and 'proving' God."He paused and bent over the silent little figure nestling so quietly
at his side."You, Carmen, though but a child in years, have risen beyond me, and
beyond this lowly encompassment.Why, when you were a mere babe, you
should have grasped your padre Rosendo's casual statement that 'God is
everywhere,' and shaped your life to accord with it, I do not know.That must remain one of the hidden mysteries of God.But
the fact stands that you did grasp it, and that with it as a light
unto your feet you groped your way out of this environment, avoiding
all pitfalls and evil snares, until to-day you stand at the threshold
of another and higher one.So progress must ever be, I now realize.Up
we must rise from one plane of human mentality to another, sifting and
sorting the thoughts that come to us, clinging to these, discarding
those, until, even as you have said, we learn at last instantly to
accept those that mirror forth God, infinite, divine mind, and to
reject those that bear the stamp of supposition.""Padre," the girl said, lifting her beautiful face to his, "I have
told you so often--when a thought comes to me that I think is not from
God, or does not reflect Him, I turn right on it and kill it.You
could do the same, if you would.""Assuredly, child--if I would!"And then the millennium would be with us, and the
kingdom of heaven revealed.The mesmeric belief in evil as an entity
and a power opposed to good alone prevents that.Destroy this belief,
and the curtain will instantly rise on eternity."His eyes struggled with hers, as he gazed long and wistfully into
them.Lost in his impassioned speech, he had for the moment seemed to
be translated.Then a surge of fear-thoughts swept him, and left him
dwelling on the hazardous journey that awaited her.He wildly clutched
her again to his side."Carmen--child--how can I let you go!And that
awful journey--two hundred miles of unknown jungle, to the far-off
Nechi!And then the burning river, to Cartagena, where--where _he_ is!And the States--God, what awaits you there!""Padre," she answered softly, "I shall not go unless it is right.If
it is right, then God will take care of me--and of you."Again she saw only the "right-best" thought, while he sat trembling
before its opposite.And the opposite was as yet a supposition!"Padre dear, there is no separation, you know.God is everywhere, and
so there is no separation from good--is there?""Not in your thought, dearest child," he murmured huskily."Well, Padre dear, I am still with you, am I not?Can't you live one
day at a time?You are borrowing from
to-morrow, and you have no right to do it.God says,
'Thou shalt not steal,' even from to-morrow."The thought seemed to
lighten his load momentarily."You have been thinking so many bad thoughts of late--I don't suppose
you have had any good thoughts at all about Anita's little babe?"You promised me that every day you
would just _know_ that."Aye, his crowning sin was revealed again in
all its ugly nakedness.His thought was always of his own
troubles, his own longings, his own fears.Self-centeredness had left
no room for thoughts of Ana's blind babe.And why was he now straining
this beautiful girl to himself?Was it fear for her, or for himself?Yet she gave but little heed to her own needs.Always her concern was
for others, others who stumbled and drooped because of the human
mind's false, unreal, undemonstrable beliefs and ignorance of the
allness of God."Ah, child," he exclaimed penitently, "such love!How could I dare to
hope ever to claim it!"Why, Padre, I love the real 'you,' the 'you' that is going to be
brought out, and that will become more and more clear, until at last
it stands as the perfect reflection of God.Haven't I told you that,
time and time again?"But--to live with me--to be my--"

"Well, Padre, if we were not still human we would not be thinking that
we were on earth.We have got to work out of this human way of
thinking and living.And it has seemed to me that you and I could work
out of it so much better together, you helping me, manifesting God's
protection and care, and I helping you, as you say I can and do.And
how can we live together and work together unless we marry?He would not try to explain her reasoning, her contempt for
convention.As for him, women had never
constituted a temptation.He knew that he loved this simple, ingenuous
girl with a tenderness of passion that was wholly free from the dross
of mesmerism."Padre, if you think you must stay here for a little while, to work
out your problem, why, I shall just _know_ that evil can not separate
us.I don't like to even seem to go away without you.But--it will be
only seeming, after all, won't it?God's children can not really be
separated--never!"She was still paying faithful tribute to her vision of the spiritual
universe.How like a benison they
flowed over his drooping spirits!"And now, Padre dear," she said, rising from the bench,--"we have done
all we could--left everything with God--haven't we?I must go now, for
madre Maria told me to come back soon.Sing
again the sweet melody that I heard when I awoke from the fever that
day long ago!"Nestling close against him, her
head resting on his shoulder and her hand in his, she sang again the
song that had seemed to lift him that distant day far, far above the
pitiful longings and strivings of poor humanity, even unto the gates
of the city of eternal harmony.She finished, and the last clear, sweet note echoed through the musty
room and died among the black rafters overhead.A holy silence fell
upon them as they sat, hand in hand, facing the future.Hot tears were
streaming down the man's cheeks.They fell sparkling like drops of
dew upon her brown curls.The girl, obedient
to the vision, was reaping her reward.He, timid, wavering, doubting,
was left, still pecking at the shell of his dreary environment.It was
but the working of the infinite law of cause and effect.But did he
imagine that out in the world she would not still find tribulation,
even as the Saviour had said?But she
leaned on her sustaining God.She had already passed through such fiery trials that
he knew no contrary belief in evil now could weaken or counterbalance
her supreme confidence in immanent good."If I have to go and leave you, will you promise me that you will act
your knowledge of the Christ-principle and work out your problem, so
that you may come to me soon?"The tug at his heartstrings brought a moan to his lips."And--you will keep your promise about Anita's babe?"She rose and, still holding his hand, led him down the hill and to
Rosendo's house.Throughout the remainder of that feverishly busy day the priest clung
to the girl like a shadow.They talked together but little, for she
was in constant demand to help her foster-mother in the preparations
for the long journey.Again and again
he would seize her hand and press it to his burning lips.Again and
again he would stroke her soft hair, or stretch out his hand to touch
her dress as she passed him.Always when she glanced up at him the
same sweet, compassionate smile glowed on her face.When she left the
house, he followed.When she bent over the ash-strewn fireplace, or
washed the few plain dishes, he sought to share her employment; and,
when gently, lovingly repulsed, sat dully, with his yearning eyes
riveted upon her.Rosendo saw him, and forgot his own sorrow in pity
for the suffering priest.The preparations carried the toilers far into the night.But at length
the last bundle was strapped to its _siete_, the last plan discussed
and agreed upon, and the two Americans had thrown themselves upon
their cots for a brief rest before dawn.Rosendo took Jose aside,
while Dona Maria and Carmen sought their beds."Fernando sends Juan to Bodega Central at daybreak," the old man said.Maria remains
here with you until I return.Then we may go to the _hacienda_ of Don
Nicolas, on the Boque.I shall tell him to have it in readiness on my
return.I shall probably not get back to Simiti for two months.If, as
you say, you still think best not to go with the Americans and the
girl, what will you do here?Some say
they intend to ask the Bishop to remove you._Bien_, will you not
decide to go?"He shook his head, and waved
Rosendo away.Then, taking a chair, he went into the sleeping room and
sat down at the bedside of the slumbering girl.Reaching over, he took
her hand.What was it that she had said to him that day, long gone, when Diego
claimed her as his child?Ah, yes:

"Don't feel badly, Padre dear.His thoughts have only the minus
sign--and that means nothing, you know."And later, many weeks later:

"Padre, you can not think wrong and right thoughts together, you know.You can not be happy and unhappy at the same time.You can not be sick
and well together."In other words, the wise little maid was trying to
show him that Paul spoke directly to such as he when he wrote: Know ye
not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants
ye are--?"You can not have both good and evil, Padre," she had so often
insisted."You must want good--want it more than anything else.And
then you must prepare for it by thinking right thoughts and unthinking
wrong ones.And as you prepare for good, you must _know_ that it is
coming.But you must not say how it shall come, nor what it shall look
like.You must not say that it shall be just as you may think you
would like to have it."You see, Padre dear"--oh, how the memory of her words smote him
now!--"you see, the good Jesus told the people to clean their
window-panes and let in the light--good thoughts--for then these would
be externalized in health, happiness, and all good, instead of the
old, bad thoughts being externalized longer in sickness and evil.He saw that the Christ-idea found expression and
reflection in the pure mentality of this girl.He saw that that
mentality was unsullied, uneducated in the lore of human belief, and
untrained to fear.He saw that the resurrection of the Christ, for
which a yearning world waits, was but the rising of the Christ-idea
in the human mentality.And he saw, too, that ere the radiant
resurrection morn can arrive there must be the crucifixion, a
world-wide crucifixion of human, carnal thought.But will ye not learn that following him means _thinking_
as he did?But Jose had tried to think aright during those years in Simiti.True,
but the efforts had been spasmodic.From childhood he had passed
through doubt, fear, scepticism, and final agnosticism.Then he had
started anew and aright.And then had come the "day of judgment," the
recurrent hours of sore trial--and he had not stood.Called upon to
prove God, to prove the validity of his splendid deductions, he had
vacillated between the opposing claims of good and evil, and had
floundered helplessly.And now he stood confronting his still unsolved
problem, realizing as never before that in the solving of it he must
unlearn the intellectual habits of a lifetime.There were other problems which lay still unsolved before him as he
sat there that night.The sable veil of mystery which hung about
Carmen's birth had never been penetrated, even slightly.What woman's
face was that which looked out so sadly from the little locket?"Dolores"--sorrowful, indeed!What tragedy had those great, mournful
eyes witnessed?He used to
think so, but not of late.Did she, he wondered, resemble the man?And
had the mother's kisses and hot tears blurred the portrait beneath
which he had so often read the single inscription, "Guillermo"?If so,
could not the portrait be cleaned?But Jose himself had not dared
attempt it.Perhaps some day that could be done by one skilled in such
art.And did Carmen inherit any of her unique traits from either of her
parents?Her voice, her religious instinct, her keen mentality--whence
came they?"From God," the girl would always answer whenever he voiced
the query in her presence.And Jose found himself sitting beside the
sleeping girl and dumbly yielding to the separation which now had
come.And, if he must live and
solve his problem, could he stand after she had left?He bent closer
to her, and listened to the gentle breathing.He seemed again to see
her, as he was wont in the years past, flitting about her diminutive
rose garden and calling to him to come and share her boundless joy."Come, Padre dear, and see my beautiful
thoughts!"And then, so often, "Oh, Padre!"bounding into his arms,
"here is a beautiful thought that came to me to-day, and I caught it
and wouldn't let it go!"Lonely, isolated child, having nothing in
common with the children of her native heath, yet dwelling ever in a
world peopled with immaculate concepts!He thought of the day when he had
approached Rosendo with his great question."Rosendo," he had said in
deep earnestness, "where, oh, where did Carmen get these ideas?"No, Padre," Rosendo had replied gravely."When she was a little
thing, just learning to talk, she often asked about God.And one day I
told her that God was everywhere--what else could I say?_Bien_, a
strange light came into her eyes.And after that, Padre, she talked
continually about Him, and to Him.And she seemed to know Him well--so
well that she saw Him in every thing and every place.Padre, it is
very strange--very strange!"No, it was not strange, Jose had thought, but beautifully natural.And
later, when he came to teach her, his constant endeavor had been to
impart his secular knowledge to the girl without endangering her
marvelous faith in her immanent God.In that he had succeeded, for in
that there had been no obstructing thoughts of self to overcome.And now--

"For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will
I gather thee--"

The night shadows fled.Jose still sat at the girl's
bedside, dumb and motionless.Carmen awoke, and threw her arms about
him.But Rosendo appeared and hurried her out to the light morning
repast, for they must lose no time in starting.By ten o'clock the savannas would be too hot to cross, and
they lay some distance from Simiti.Reed and Harris were bustling
about, assembling the packers and cracking jokes as they strapped the
chairs to the men's backs.Dona Maria's eyes were red with weeping,
but she kept silence.Don Jorge
grimly packed his own kit and prepared to set out for the Magdalena,
for he had suddenly announced his determination not to accompany
Rosendo and his party, but to go back and consult with Don Carlos
Norosi in regard to the future.At last Rosendo's voice rang out in a great shout:

"_Ya esta!"_

"Bully-bueno!"The _cargadores_ moved forward in the direction of the Boque trail.The Americans, with a final _adios_ to Dona Maria and the priest,
swung into line behind them.Rosendo again tenderly embraced his
weeping spouse, and then, turned to Jose."The Virgin watch over you and Maria, Padre!If the war comes, flee with her to the Boque."He threw an arm about the priest and kissed him on both cheeks.Then,
calling to Carmen, he turned and started after the others."Padre," she murmured, clinging to him and showering him with kisses,
"I love you, love you, love you!You
will come--or I will come back to you.And I will work for you every
day.I will know that you are God's child, and that you will solve
your problem!"Rosendo, half way down the road, turned and called sharply to her.But again she stopped, turned around, and flew
back to Jose, as he knelt in the dust and, with tongue cleaving to his
mouth, held out his trembling arms."Padre, dearest, dearest Padre," she sobbed, "I love you, I love you!And--I had forgotten--this--it is for you to read every day--every
day!"Again she tore herself
away and ran after the impatient Rosendo.In a moment they were out of
sight.A groan of anguish escaped the stricken priest.He rose from his knees
and followed stumbling after the girl.As he reached the shales he saw
her far in the distance at the mouth of the trail.She turned, and
waved her hand to him.Then the dark trail swallowed her, and he saw
her no more.For a moment he stood like a statue, striving with futile gaze to
penetrate that black opening in the dense bush that had engulfed his
very soul.His hand
closed convulsively over the paper which the girl had left with him.Mechanically he opened it and read:

  "Dearest, dearest Padre, these four little Bible verses I leave
  with you; and you will promise your little girl that you will
  always live by them.Thou shall have no other gods before me.Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
  heaven is perfect.Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."And, Padre, my dearest, dearest Padre, _God is everywhere_."His brain reeled, and he swayed like a drunken man.He
turned about, muttering incoherently.Tenderly taking his arm, she led him back to the forlorn little house.Its ghastly emptiness smote him until his reason tottered.He sank
into a chair and gazed with dull, stony eyes out over the placid
lake, where the white beams of the rising sun were breaking into
myriad colors against the brume.CHAPTER 37


The two hundred miles which lay before Rosendo and his little band
stretched their rugged, forbidding length through ragged canons,
rushing waters, and dank, virginal forest.Only the old man, as he
trudged along the worn trail between Simiti and the Inanea river,
where canoes waited to transport the travelers to the little village
of Boque, had any adequate conception of what the journey meant.Even
the _cargadores_ were unfamiliar with the region which they were to
penetrate.Some of them had been over the Guamoco trail as far as
Culata; a few had ascended the Boque river to its farthest navigable
point.But none had penetrated the inmost reaches of the great canon
through which the headwaters tumbled and roared, and none had ever
dreamed of making the passage over the great divide, the _Barra
Principal_, to the Tigui beyond.To the Americans, fresh from the luxury and convention of city life,
and imbued with the indomitable Yankee spirit of adventure, the
prospect was absorbing in its allurements.Especially to the
excitable, high-strung Harris, whose great eyes almost popped from his
head at the continuous display of tropical marvels, and whose
exclamations of astonishment and surprise, enriched from his
inexhaustible store of American slang and miner's parlance, burst from
his gaping mouth at every turn of the sinuous trail.From the outset,
he had constituted himself Carmen's special protector, although
much to Rosendo's consternation, for the lank, awkward fellow, whose
lean shoulders bent under the weight of some six-feet-two of
height, went stumbling and tripping along the way, swaying against
every tree and bush that edged the path, and constantly giving noisy
vent to his opinions regarding trails in general, and those of the
tropics in particular.His only accouterment was a Winchester
rifle of tremendous bore, which he insisted on carrying in constant
readiness to meet either beasts of prey or savage Indians, but
which, in his absent-mindedness and dreamy preoccupation, he
either dragged, muzzle up, or carried at such dangerous angles that
the natives were finally obliged, in self-protection, to insist
that he hand the weapon over to Rosendo.To Carmen, as the days
passed and she gradually recognized his sterling qualities, he
became a source of delight.Hour after hour she trotted along after
him, chatting merrily in her beloved English tongue, poking fun at
his awkwardness, and laughing boisterously over his quaint slang and
naive Yankee expressions.She had never heard such things from Jose;
nor had the priest, despite his profound knowledge, ever told her
such exciting tales as did Harris, when he drew from his store of
frontier memories and  his narratives with the rich tints
furnished by his easy imagination.The first day out had been one of mental struggle for the girl.She
had turned into the trail, after waving a last farewell to Jose, with
a feeling that she had never experienced before.For hours she trudged
along, oblivious of her environment, murmuring, "It isn't true--it
isn't true!"until Harris, his curiosity aroused by the constant
repetition which floated now and then to his ears, demanded to know
what it was that was so radically false."It isn't true that we can be separated," she answered, looking at him
with moist eyes."Yes, God's children--people--people--who--love each other," she
replied.Then she dropped her eyes in evident embarrassment, and
refused to discuss the topic further.ejaculated Harris, pondering the cryptical remark, "you
surely are a queer little dud!"But the girl turned from him to Rosendo.Nor would
she permit the old man to leave her until, late that night, exhausted
by the excitement of the day, she dropped asleep in the house of Don
Nicolas, on the muddy margin of the river Boque, still clinging to
Rosendo's hand.Despite the protestations of Don Nicolas and the pleading of the
_cargadores_, Rosendo stolidly refused to spend a day at Boque.They were still within reach of
the federal authorities.He dared not rest until the jungle had
swallowed them."Ah, _compadre_," said Don Nicolas, in disappointment, "I would like
much for you to enjoy my house while it is still clean.they swarmed down upon us but a day ago.They came out of the bush in millions, straight for the house.had we remained, we should have been eaten alive.But
they swept the house--_Hombre_!no human hands could have done so
well.Every spider, every rat, beetle, flea, every plague, was
instantly eaten, and within a half hour they had disappeared again,
and we moved back into a thoroughly cleaned house!"Harris stood with mouth agape in mute astonishment when Carmen, whom
he had constituted his interpreter, translated to him the story.That evening, after they had eaten out in the open before the house,
and the Americans had tickled the palates of the villagers with some
tinned beef of uncertain quality, Don Nicolas approached Reed."Senor," he said, "my mother, now very aged, is sick, and we think she
can not recover.But you Americanos are wonderfully skilled, and your
medicines powerful.Have you not some remedy in your pack that will
alleviate the good woman's sufferings?Reed knew how great was the faith of these simple people in the wisdom
of the American, and he had reason to wish to preserve it.But he had
come into that country illy prepared to cope with disease, and his
medical equipment contained nothing but quinine.He reflected a
moment, then turned to Harris."Did you smuggle any of your beloved root-beer extract into the
equipment?"Harris looked sheepish, but returned a sullen affirmative."Well," continued Reed, "dig out a bottle and we'll fix up a dose of
pain-killer for our worthy host's mother.""Cierto, senor," he said with an air of
confidence."I have a remedy which I know to be unfailing for any
disease."He disappeared into the house, from which he emerged again in a few
moments with an empty cola bottle.Washing this clean in the river, he
partly filled it with water.Then he poured in the small bottle of
root-beer extract which Harris handed him, and added a few grains of
quinine.Shaking the mixture thoroughly, he carried it to Don
Nicolas."Be very careful, senor," he admonished, giving him the bottle."It is
a medicine extremely powerful and immediate in its action.Give the
senora a small teaspoonful every hour.By morning you will notice a
marked change."Don Nicolas's eyes lighted with joy, and his gratitude poured forth in
extravagant expressions.With the first indications of approaching day Rosendo was abroad,
rounding up his cargadores, who were already bickering as to their
respective duties, and arranging the luggage in the canoes for the
river trip.Additional boats and men had been secured; and Don Nicolas
himself expressed his intention of accompanying them as far as his
hacienda, Maria Rosa, a day's journey up-stream."It was there that I hid during the last revolution," he said, "when
the soldiers burned the village and cut off the ears and fingers of
our women for their rings.Ah, senores, you can not know how we
suffered!All my goods stolen or burned--my family scattered--my
_finca_ destroyed!We lived two years at Maria Rosa, not daring to
come down the river again.His eyes burned fiercely as he spoke, and his hands opened
and closed convulsively.He was a representative of that large class
of _rurales_ upon whom the heaviest burdens, the greatest suffering,
and the most poignant sorrow attending a political revolution always
fall.he exclaimed, suddenly turning to Reed, "I had all but
forgotten!She would see the kind
American whose remedies are so wonderful.For, senor, she rose from
her bed this morning restored!And you must leave us another bottle of
the remedy--at whatever price, senor!"Reed gazed at the man uncomprehendingly, until at length the truth
dawned upon him.His root-beer remedy had done its work!Then a broad
grin mantled his face; but he quickly suppressed it and went with Don
Nicolas to receive in person his patient's effusive thanks.When he
returned and took his place in the waiting boat, he shook his head."It's past all understanding," he muttered to Harris, "what faith will
do!I can believe now that it will remove mountains."Throughout the long, interminably long, hot day the perspiring men
poled and paddled, urged and teased, waded and pushed against the
increasing current, until, as the shadows began to close around them,
they sighted the scarcely visible opening in the bush which marked the
trail to the _hacienda_ of Maria Rosa.It was a desperately lonely
clearing on the verge of the jungle; but there were two thatch-covered
sheds, and to the exhausted travelers it gave assurance of rest and
protection.Before they made the landing Rosendo's sharp eyes had
spied a large ant-eater and her cub, moving sluggishly through the
bush; and Reed's quick shots had brought them both down.The men's
eyes dilated when the animals were dragged into the canoes.It meant
fresh meat instead of salt _bagre_ for at least two days.Early next morning the travelers bade farewell to Don Nicolas and set
their course again up-stream.They would now see no human being other
than the members of their own little party until they reached Llano,
on the distant Nechi."Remember," called Don Nicolas, as the canoes drifted out into the
stream, "the _quebrada_ of Caracoli is the third on the right.An old
trail used to lead from there across to the Tiguicito--but I doubt if
you find even a trace of it now.There is no water between that point
and the Tiguicito._Conque, adios, senores, adios_!"The hallooing of farewells echoed along the river and died away in the
dark forest on either hand.Harris and Reed settled back in their
canoe and yielded to the fascination of the slowly shifting scene.Carmen chose to occupy the same canoe with them, and perforce Rosendo
acted as _patron_.Between his knees
Reed held the rifle upright, in readiness for any animal whose
curiosity might bring it to the water's edge to view the rare pageant
passing through that unbroken solitude.The river was now narrowing, and there were often rapids whose ascent
necessitated disembarking from the canoes, while the _bogas_ strained
and teased the lumbering dugouts up over them.In places the stream
was choked by fallen trees and tangled driftwood, until only a narrow,
tortuous opening was left, through which the waters raced like a
mill-course, making a heavy draft on the intuitive skill of the
_bogas_.Often slender islets rose from the river; and then heated,
chattering, often acrimonious discussions ensued among the men as to
the proper channel to take.Always on either side rose the matted,
tangled, impenetrable forest wall of dense bush and giant trees, from
which innumerable trailers and _bejuco_ vines dropped into the waters
beneath.From the surface of the river to the tops of the great trees,
often two hundred feet above, hung a drapery of creeping plants, of
parasitical growths, and diversified foliage, of the most vivid shades
of green, inextricably laced and interwoven, and dotted here and there
with orchideous flowers and strange blossoms, while in the tempered
sunlight which sifted through it sported gorgeous insects and
butterflies of enormous size and exquisite shades, striped and spotted
in orange, blue, and vivid red.Scarcely a hand's breadth of the
jungle wall but contained some strange, eerie animal or vegetable form
that brought expressions of wonder and astonishment from the
enraptured Americans.At times, too, there were grim tragedies being
enacted before them.In one spot a huge, hairy spider, whose delicate,
lace-like web hung to the water's edge, was viciously wrapping its
silken thread about a tiny bird that had become entangled.Again, a
shriek from beyond the river's margin told of some careless monkey or
small animal that had fallen prey to a hungry jaguar.Above the
travelers all the day swung the ubiquitous buzzards, with their
watchful, speculative eyes ever on the slowly moving cavalcade.If her thought reverted at all to the priest,
she gave no hint of it.But once, leaning back and gazing off into
the opalescent sky overhead, she murmured: "And to think, it is only
the way the human mind translates God's ideas!And some day I shall see those ideas, instead of the mortal mind's
interpretations of them!"Harris heard her, and asked her to repeat her comments in English."You would not understand," she said simply.And no
badinage on his part could further influence her.Rosendo, inscrutable and silent, showed plainly the weight of
responsibility which he felt.Only twice that day did he emerge from
the deep reserve into which he had retired; once when, in the far
distance, his keen eye espied a small deer, drinking at the water's
edge, but which, scenting the travelers, fled into cover ere Reed
could bring the rifle to his shoulders; and again, when they were upon
a jaguar almost before either they or the astonished animal realized
it.In the tempered rays of the late afternoon sun the flower-bespangled
walls of the forest became alive with gaily painted birds and insects.Troops of chattering monkeys awoke from their midday _siesta_ and
scampered noisily through the treetops over the aerial highways
formed by the liana vines, whose great bush-ropes, often a foot and
more in thickness, stretched their winding length long distances
through the forest, and bound the vegetation together in an
intricate, impenetrable network.Yellow and purple blossoms, in a
riot of ineffable splendor, bedecked the lofty trees and tangled
parasitical creepers that wrapped around them, constituting
veritable hanging gardens.Great palms, fattened by the almost
incessant rains in this hot-house of Nature, rose in the spaces
unoccupied by the buttressed roots of the forest giants.Splendidly
tailored kingfishers swooped over the water, scarce a foot above its
surface.Quarreling parrots and nagging macaws screamed their
inarticulate message to the travelers.Tiny forest gems, the
infinitely variegated _colibri_, whirred across the stream and
followed its margins until attracted by the gorgeous pendent flowers.On the _playas_ in the hazy distance ahead the travelers could often
distinguish tall, solemn cranes, dancing their grotesque measures, or
standing on one leg and dreaming away their little hour of life in
this terrestrial fairy-land.Darkness fell, almost with the swiftness of a snuffed candle.For an
hour Rosendo had been straining his eyes toward the right bank of the
river, and as he gazed his apprehension increased.But, as night
closed in, a soft murmur floated down to the cramped, toil-worn
travelers, and the old man, with a glad light in his eyes, announced
that they were approaching the _quebrada_ of Caracoli.A half hour
later, by the weird, flickering light of the candles which Reed and
Harris held out on either side, Rosendo turned the canoe into a
brawling stream, and ran its nose into the deep alluvial soil.Plunging fearlessly through the fringe of delicate ferns which lined
the margin of the creek, he cut a wide swath with his great _machete_
and uncovered a dim trail, which led to a ramshackle, thatch-covered
hut a few yards beyond.It was the tumbled vestige of a shelter which
Don Nicolas had erected years before while hunting wild pigs through
this trackless region.An hour later the little group lay asleep on
the damp ground, wrapped in the solitude of the great forest.The silvery haze of dawn was dimming the stars and deepening into
ruddier hues that tinged the fronds of the mighty trees as with
streaks of blood when Rosendo, like an implacable Nemesis, prodded his
little party into activity.Their first day's march through the
wilderness was to begin, and the old man moved with the nervous,
restless energy of a hunted jaguar.The light breakfast of coffee and
cold _arepa_ over, he dismissed the _bogas_, who were to return to
Boque with the canoes, and set about arranging the cargo in suitable
packs for the _cargadores_ who were to accompany him over the long
reaches of jungle that stretched between them and Llano.Two
_macheteros_ were sent on ahead of the main party to locate and open a
trail.Before the shimmering,
opalescent rays which overspread the eastern sky had begun to turn
downward, the little cavalcade, led by Rosendo, had taken the narrow,
newly-cut trail and plunged into the shadows of the forest--

  "the great, dim, mysterious forest, where uncertainty wavers to an
  interrogation point."CHAPTER 38


The emotion of the jungle is a direct function of human temperament.Where one sees in it naught but a "grim, green sepulcher," teeming with
malignant, destructive forces, inimical to health, to tranquillity, to
life, another--perhaps a member of the same party--will find in the
wanton extravagance of Nature, her prodigious luxury, her infinite
variety of form, of color, and sound, such stimuli to the imagination,
and such invitation to further discovery and development, as to
constitute a lure as insidious and unescapable as the habit which too
often follows the first draft of the opium's fumes.There are those
who profess to have journeyed through vast stretches of South
American _selva_ without encountering a wild animal.Others, with sight
and hearing keener, and with a sense of observation not dulled by
futile lamentations over the absence of the luxuries of civilized
travel, will uncover a wealth of experiences which feed the memory
throughout their remaining years, and mold an irresistible desire to
penetrate again those vast, teeming, baffling solitudes.It is true, the sterner aspect of the South American jungle
affords little invitation to repose or restful contemplation.And
the charm which its riotous prodigality exerts is in no sense
idyllic.For the jungle falls upon one with the force of a blow.It
grips by its massiveness, its awful grandeur.It does not entice
admiration, but exacts obeisance by brute force.Its rest is continuous motion, incessant activity.The
garniture of its trackless wastes is that of great daubs of vivid
color, laid thick upon the canvas with the knife--never modulated,
never worked into delicate shading with the brush, but attracting
by its riot, its audacity, its immensity, its disdain of convention,
its utter disregard of the canons cherished by the puny mind that
contemplates it.The forest's appeal is a reflex of its own infinite
complexity.The sensations which it arouses within the one who steps
from civilization into its very heart are myriad, and often
terrible.The instinct of self-preservation is by it suddenly,
rudely aroused and kept keenly alive.The roar of its howling monkeys strikes terror to the timid heart.The plaintive calls of its persecuted feathered denizens echo through
the mysterious vastnesses like despairing voices from a spirit
world.The crashing noises, the strange, weird, unaccountable
sounds that hurtle through its dimly lighted corridors blanch the
face and cause the hand to steal furtively toward the loosely
sheathed weapon.The piercing, frenzied screams which arise with
blood-curdling effect through the awful stillness of noonday or the
dead of night, turn the startled thought with sickening yearning
toward the soft charms of civilization, in which the sense of
protection is greater, even if actual security is frequently less.Because of Nature's utter disregard of the individual, life is
everywhere.And that life is sharply armed and on the defensive.Their droning murmur crowds the air.The trunks of trees, the
great, pendent leaves of plants, the trailing vines, slimy with dank
vegetation, afford footing and housing to countless myriads of
them, keenly alert, ferociously resistive.The decaying logs fester
with scorpions.The ground is cavernous with the burrows of
lizards and crawling forms, with centipedes and fierce formicidae.Where
one falls, countless others spring up to fill the gap.The rivers
and _pantanos_ yield their quota of variegated forms.The flat
_perania_, the dreaded electric eel, infests the warm streams, and
inflicts its torture without discrimination upon all who dare invade
its domain.Snakes lurk in the fetid swamps and lagoons, the
brilliant coral and the deadly _mapina_.Beneath the forest leaves
coils the brown adder, whose sting proves fatal within three days.To those who see only these aspects of the jungle, a journey such as
that undertaken by Rosendo and his intrepid little band would prove a
terrifying experience, a constant repetition of nerve-shocks, under
which the "centers" must ultimately give way.But to the two
Americans, fresh from the mining camps of the West, and attuned to any
pitch that Nature might strike in her marvelous symphony, the
experience was one to be taken in the same spirit as all else that
pertained to their romantic calling.Rosendo and his men accepted the
day's stint of toil and danger with dull stolidity.Carmen threw
herself upon her thought, and saw in her shifting environment only the
human mind's interpretation of its mixed concept of good and evil.The
insects swarmed around her as around the others.The tantalizing
_jejenes_ urged their insidious attacks upon her, as upon the rest.Her hands were dotted with tiny blood-blisters where the ravenous
gnats had fed.But she uttered no complaint; nor would she discuss the
matter when Harris proffered his sympathy, and showed his own red
hands."It isn't true," she would say."But you have no religion, and you
don't understand--as yet."Well, you have mighty
strange beliefs, young lady!""But not as strange and illogical as those you hold," she replied."Oh, I don't believe anything," he answered, with a shrug of his
shoulders."I'm an agnostic, you know.""There is just where you mistake, Mr."For, instead of not believing anything, you firmly believe in the
presence and power of evil.It is just those very people who boast
that they do not believe in anything who believe most thoroughly in
evil and its omnipotence and omnipresence."Yes, even the animals which she saw about her were but the human
mind's concepts of God's ideas--not real.In the
Bible allegory, or dream, the human, mortal mind names all its own
material concepts.From the rippling Tiguicito,
which they reached choking with thirst and utterly exhausted, they
dropped down again to the Boque, where they established camps and
began to prospect the Molino company's "near-mines," as Harris called
them after the first few unsuccessful attempts to get "colors" out of
the barren soil.At certain points, where there seemed a more likely
prospect, they remained for days, until the men, under Rosendo's
guidance, could sink pits to the underlying bedrock.Such work was
done with the crudest of tools--an iron bar, wooden scrapers in lieu
of shovels, and wooden _bateas_ in which the men handed the loosened
dirt up from one stage to another and out to the surface.It was slow,
torturing work.The food ran low, and they
complained.Then Harris one evening stumbled upon a tapir, just as the great
animal had forded the river and was shambling into the bush
opposite.It fell
with a broken hip, and the men finished it with their _machetes_.Its hide was nearly a half inch in thickness, and covered with
_garrapatas_--fierce, burrowing vermin, with hooked claws, which
came upon the travelers and caused them intense annoyance throughout
the remainder of the journey.Then Reed shot a deer, a delicate, big-eyed creature that had never
seen a human being and was too surprised to flee.Later, Fidel Avila
felled another with a large stone.And, finally, monkeys became so
plentiful that the men all but refused to eat them any longer.Two weeks were spent around the mouth of the Tiguicito and the Boque
canon.The little party
shouldered their packs and began the ascent of the ragged gorge.For
days they clambered up and down the jagged walls of the cut, or
skirted its densely covered margin.Twice Harris fell into the
brawling stream below, and was fished out by Rosendo, his eyes
popping, and his mouth choked with uncomplimentary opinion regarding
mountain travel in the tropics.Once, seizing a slender vine to aid
him in climbing, he gave a sudden lurch and swung out unexpectedly
over the gorge, hundreds of feet deep.Again Rosendo, who by this time
had learned to keep one eye on the ground and the other on the
irresponsible Harris, rescued him from his perilous position."Why don't you watch where you are going?""I might," sputtered Harris, "if I could keep my eyes off of you."Whereat Carmen pursed her lips and told him to reserve his compliments
for those who knew how to appraise them rightly.They camped where night overtook them, out in the open, often falling
asleep without waiting to build a fire, but eating soggy corn _arepa_
and tinned food, and drinking cold coffee left from the early morning
repast.But sometimes, when the fatigue of day was less, they would
gather about their little fire, chilled and dripping, and beg Carmen
to sing to them while they prepared supper.Then her clear voice would
ring out over the great canon and into the vast solitudes on either
hand in strange, vivid contrast to the cries and weird sounds of the
jungle; and the two Americans would sit and look at her as if they
half believed her a creature from another world.Sometimes Harris
would draw her into conversation on topics pertaining to philosophy
and religion, for he had early seen her bent and, agnostic that he
was, delighted to hear her express her views, which to him were so
childishly impossible.But as often he would voluntarily retire from
the conflict, sometimes shaking his head dubiously, sometimes
muttering his impatience with a mere child whose logic he, despite his
collegiate training, could not refute.He was as full of philosophical
theories as a nut with meat; but when she asked for proofs, for less
human belief and more demonstration, he hoisted the white flag and
retired from the field.But his admiration for the child became
sincere.And by the time
they had reached the great divide through which the Rosario fell, he
was dimly aware of a feeling toward the beautiful creature who walked
at his side day after day, sharing without complaint hardship and
fatigue that sorely taxed his own endurance, that was something more
than mere regard, and he had begun to speculate vaguely on a possible
future in which she became the central figure.At Rosario creek they left the great canon and turned into the rugged
defile which wound its tortuous course upward into the heights of the
_Barra Principal_.They were now in a region where, in Rosendo's
belief, there was not one human being in an area of a hundred square
miles.He himself was in sore doubt as to the identity of the
_quebrada_ which they were following.But it tallied with the brief
description given him by Don Nicolas.And, moreover, which was even
more important, as they began its ascent there came to him that sense
of conviction which every true son of the jungle feels when he is
following the right course.He might not say how he knew he was right;
but he followed the leading without further question.Up over the steep talus at the base of the canon wall they clambered,
up into the narrowing _arroyo_, cutting every foot of the way, for the
_macheteros_ were now no longer keeping ahead of them--the common
danger held the band united.Often they believed they discovered
traces of ancient trails.But the jealous forest had all but
obliterated them, and they could not be certain.In the higher and
drier parts of the forest, where they left the creek and followed
the beds of dead streams, slender ditches through which the water
raced in torrents during the wet season, they were set upon by
countless swarms of bees, a strange, stingless variety that covered
them in a buzzing, crawling mass, struggling and fighting for the
salt in the perspiration which exuded from the human bodies.Harris
swore he would cease to eat, for he could not take even a mouthful
of food without at the same time taking in a multitude of bees.Often, too, their _machetes_ cut into great hornet nests.Then, with
the shrill cry, "_Avispas_!"Rosendo would tear recklessly through
the matted jungle, followed by his slapping, stumbling companions,
until the maddened insects gave up the chase.Frequently they
walked into huge ant nests before they realized it, sometimes the
great _tucanderas_, so ferociously poisonous."Ah, senores,"
commented Rosendo, as he once stopped to point out the marvelous
roadway cut by these insects for miles straight through the jungle,
"in the days of the Spaniards the cruel taskmasters would often tie
the weak and sick slaves to trees in the depths of the forest and
let these great ants devour them alive!Senores, you can never know
the terrible crimes committed by the Spaniards!"murmured Harris, eying Carmen furtively.But she knew, though she voiced it not, that the Spaniard had never
known the Christ.Night was spent on the summit of the divide.Then, without further
respite, Rosendo urged the descent.Down through ravines and gullies;
over monster bowlders; waist deep through streams; down the sheer
sides of gorges on natural ladders formed by the hanging _mora_
vines; skirting cliffs by the aid of tangled and interlaced roots
of rank, wet vegetation; and then down again into river bottoms,
where the tenacious mud challenged their every step, and the streams
became an interminable morass, through which passage was possible
only by jumping from root to root, where the gnarled feeders of the
great trees projected above the bottomless ooze.The persecution
of the _jejenes_ became diabolical.At dawn and sunset the raucous
bellow of the red-roarer monkeys made the air hideous.The
flickering lights of the forest became dismally depressing.The men
grew morose and sullen.Reed and Harris quarreled with each other on
the slightest provocation.Then, to increase their misery, came the rain.It fell upon them in
the river bottoms in fierce, driving gusts; then in sheets that
blotted out the forest and wet their very souls.The mountains roared and trembled with the hideous
cannonade of thunder.The jungle-matted hills ran with the flood.An
unvaried pall of vapor hung over the steaming ground, through which
uncanny, phantasmagoric shapes peered at the struggling little band.Again the sun burst forth, and a fiery vapor seethed above the moist
earth.The reek of their damp clothing and the acrid odor of the wet
soil increased the enervation of their hard travel.Again and again
the peevish Harris accused Rosendo of having lost the way.The old man
patiently bore the abuse.Reed chided Harris, and at length quarreled
violently with him, although his own apprehension waxed continually
greater.Hour after hour she toiled along,
floundering through the bogs, fording the deeper streams on Rosendo's
broad back, whispering softly to him at times, often seizing and
pressing his great horny hand, but holding her peace.In vain at
evening, when gathered about the damp, smudging firewood, Harris would
bring up to her the causes of her flight.In vain he would accuse the
unfortunate Alcalde, the Bishop, the soldiers.Carmen refused to lend
ear to it, or to see in it anything more than a varied expression of
the human mind.She
saw, not persons, not things, but expressions of thought in the
phenomena which had combined to urge her out of her former environment
and cast her into the trackless jungle.At length, one day, when it seemed to the exhausted travelers that
human endurance could stand no more, Rosendo, who had long been
straining his ears in the direction straight ahead, announced that the
singing noise which floated to them as they descended a low hill and
plunged into a thicket of tall lush grass, undoubtedly came from the
river Tigui.Another hour of straining and plunging through the dense
growth followed; and then, with a final effort, which manifested in a
sort of frenzied rush, the little band emerged suddenly upon the east
bank of the crystal stream, glittering and shimmering in the bright
morning sun as it sang and rippled on its solitary way through the
great jungle.The men threw off their packs and sprawled full length upon the
ground."La Colorado," he said, indicating what the Americans at length made
out to be a frame house, looming above the high grass."And there,"
pointing to the north, "is _Pozo Cayman_, where the trail begins that
leads to La Libertad."That night, as they lay on the rough board floor of the house at La
Colorado, Rosendo told them the story of the misguided Frenchmen who,
years before, had penetrated this wild region, located a barren quartz
vein, then floated a company and begun developments.The soil was fertile; the undeveloped country
ceaselessly rich in every resource, the water pure and sparkling, and
abounding in fish.The climate, too, was moderate and agreeable.It
seemed to the foreigners a terrestrial paradise.It crept out of the jungle like a thief in the night.One by one the Frenchmen fell sick and died.He remained to protect the
company's property.But he, too, fell a victim to the plague.One day,
as he lay burning upon his bed, he called feebly to his one remaining
servant, the native cook, to bring him the little package of quinine.She hastened to comply; but, alas!she brought the packet of
strychnine instead, and soon he, too, had joined his companions in
that unknown country which awaits us all.The old woman fled in
terror; and the evil spirits descended upon the place.They haunt it
yet, and no man approaches it but with trembling.Reed and Harris listened to the weird story with strange sensations.The clouds above had broken, and the late moon streamed through the
night vapor, and poured through the bamboo walls of the house.The
giant frogs in the nearby creek awoke, and through the long night
croaked their mournful plaint in a weird minor cadence that seemed to
the awed Americans to voice to the shimmering moon the countless
wrongs of the primitive Indians, who, centuries before, had roamed
this marvelous land in happy freedom, until the Spaniard descended
like a dark cloud and, with rack and stake, fastened his blighting
religion upon them.A day's rest at La Colorado sufficed to revive the spirits of the
party and prepare them for the additional eight or ten hour journey
over boggy morass and steep hill to La Libertad.For this trip Rosendo
would take only the Americans and Carmen.The _cargadores_ were not to
know the nature of this expedition, which, Rosendo announced, was
undertaken that the Americans might explore for two days the region
around the upper Tigui.The men received this explanation with grunts
of satisfaction.Trembling with suppressed excitement, oblivious now of fatigue,
hunger, or hardship, Reed and Harris followed the old man that day
over the ancient, obliterated trail to the forgotten mine of Don
Ignacio de Rincon.They experienced all the sensations of those who
find themselves at last on the course that leads to buried treasure.To Harris, the romance attaching to the expedition obliterated all
other considerations.But Reed was busy with the practical end of it,
with costs, with the problems of supplies, of transportation, and
trail.Carmen saw but one vision, the man in far-off Simiti, whose
ancestor once owned the great mine which lay just ahead of them.When night fell, the four stood, silent and wondering, at the mouth of
the crumbling tunnel, where lay a rusted shovel bearing the scarce
distinguishable inscription, "I de R."*       *       *       *       *

Two weeks later a group of natives, sitting at a feast of baked
alligator tail, at the mouth of the Amaceri, near the dirty,
straggling riverine town of Llano, rose in astonishment as they saw
issuing from the clayey, wallowing Guamoco trail a staggering band of
travelers, among them two foreigners, whose clothes were in shreds and
whose beards and unkempt hair were caked with yellow mud.With them
came a young girl, lightly clad and wearing torn rope _alpargates_ on
her bare feet.From the
neighboring town floated a brawling bedlam of human voices.It was
Sunday, and the villagers were celebrating a religious _fiesta_."_Compadres_," said Rosendo, approaching the half-intoxicated group.One of the group, his mouth too full to speak, pointed in expressive
pantomime up-stream.Rosendo murmured a fervent "_Loado sea Dios_,"
and sank upon the ground."It will be down to-morrow--to-day, perhaps," gurgled another of the
rapidly recovering feasters, his eyes roving from one member to
another of the weird-looking little band.exclaimed Harris, as he squatted upon the damp ground
and mopped his muddy brow."I'm a salamander for heat, that's
certain!""Senor," said Rosendo, addressing Reed, "it would be well to pay the
men at once, for the boat may appear at any time, and it will not wait
long."While the curious group from the village crowded about and eagerly
watched the proceedings, Reed unstrapped his pack and drew out a bundle
of Colombian bills, with which he began to pay the _cargadores_,
according to the reckoning which Rosendo had kept.As the last man,
with a grunt of satisfaction, received his money, Harris exclaimed:
"And to think, one good American dollar is worth a bushel of that paper
stuff!"The words were scarcely out of his mouth when a shrill whistle came
echoing down the river.A cloud of smoke above the distant treetops
heralded the approach of the steamer.The little party had escaped a
wait of a month in the drenching heat of Llano by the narrow margin of
an hour.Rosendo hastened to Reed and drew him aside.He tried to speak, but
words failed him."I understand, my friend," he
said gently.My wife
and I will care for the girl until we hear from you.And we will keep
in touch with you, although it will take two months for a letter to
reach us and our reply to get back again to Simiti.The development
company will be formed at once.Within six months you may expect to
see the work started.It is your fortune--and the girl's.""Padre, I am coming back to you--yes?""_Cierto, chiquita_!"The old man would not permit himself to say
more.The girl had known for some time that he was not to accompany
her to the States, and that she should not see Ana in Cartagena.To
this she had at length accustomed herself.In a few minutes the lumbering boat had swung around and thrown out
its gang plank.A hurried embrace; a struggle with rushing tears;
another shriek from the boat whistle; and the Americans, with Carmen
standing mute and motionless between them, looked back at the fading
group on shore, where Rosendo's tall figure stood silhouetted
against the green background of the forest.For a moment he held his
arm extended toward them.Carmen knew, as she looked at the
great-hearted man for the last time, that his benediction was
following her--following her into that new world into which he might
not enter.*       *       *       *       *

Reed lifted the silent, wondering, big-eyed girl from the dinkey
train which pulled into Cartagena from Calamar ten days later, and
took her to the Hotel Mariana, where his anxious, fretting wife
awaited.Their boat had hung on a hidden bar in the Cauca river
for four interminable, torturing days.CHAPTER 39


On the day that Carmen arrived in Cartagena, Rosendo staggered down
the Guamoco trail into Simiti.On that same momentous day the flames
of war again flared up throughout the country.The Simiti episode, in
which the President had interfered, brought Congress to the necessity
of action.A few days of fiery debate followed; then the noxious
measure was taken from the table and hastily enacted into a law.But news travels slowly in Latin America, and some time was required
for this act of Congress to become generally known.The delay saw
Carmen through the jungle and down to the coast.There Reed lost no
time in transacting what business still remained for him in Cartagena,
and securing transportation for his party to New York.Jose, the shadow of his former self, clung pitiably to Rosendo's hand,
imploring the constant repetition of the old man's narrative.Then
came Juan, flying to the door.He had seen and talked with the
returned _cargadores_.Neither Jose nor Rosendo could
calm him.At length it seemed wise to them both to tell him that she
had gone to the States with the Americans, and would return to Simiti
no more.He gathered groups of companions about him and talked to them
excitedly.Then, evidently acting on
the advice of some cooler head, he rushed to his canoe and put off
across the lake toward the _cano_.But when he did, the town knew that he had been to Bodega Central, and
that the country was aflame with war.*       *       *       *       *

Reed's wife had not received Carmen in an amiable frame of mind."For
heaven's sake, Charles," she had cried, turning from his embrace to
look at the wondering girl who stood behind him, "what have you
here?""Oh, that," he laughingly replied, "is only a little Indian I lassoed
back in the jungle."And, leaving the girl to the not very tender
graces of his wife, he hurried out to arrange for the return voyage.At noon, when Harris appeared at Reed's room, Carmen rushed to him and
begged to be taken for a stroll through the town.Yielding to her
husband's insistence, Mrs.Reed had outfitted the girl, so that she
presented a more civilized appearance.At first Carmen had been
delighted with her new clothes.They were such, cheap as they were, as
she had never seen in Simiti.But the shoes--"Ah, senora," she
pleaded, "do not make me wear them, they are so tight!She was beginning her education in the conventions
and trammels of civilization.As Carmen and Harris stood that afternoon in the public square, while
the girl gazed enraptured at an equestrian statue of Simon Bolivar, a
ragged little urchin approached and begged them to buy an afternoon
paper.Harris humored him and bade Carmen ask him his name."Rincon," the lad answered, drawing himself up proudly."In the Calle Lozano," he replied, wondering why these people seemed
interested in him."Ask him who his father
is," suggested the latter."I do not know," replied the little fellow, shaking his head.He lives far away, up the great river, so Tia Catalina says."Come with me to your home,"
she said, taking his hand.The boy led them willingly through the winding streets to the little
upper room where, years before, he had first seen the light."Tia Catalina," he cried to the shabby woman who rose in amazement as
the visitors entered, "see, some strangers!"Carmen lost no time, but went at once to the heart of her question."The little fellow's father--he is a Rincon?And--he lives up the
great river?"The woman eyed her suspiciously for some moments without replying."Yes, senorita," he said eagerly, "in
Simiti.And his name--I am named for him--it is Jose.And I am going
to visit him some day.Tia Catalina said I should, no, Tia?"Harris fumbled in his pocket and drew out some money, which he handed
to the woman.Her eyes lighted, and a cavernous smile spread over her
wrinkled face."_Ah, gracias, senor_," she murmured, bending over his hand; "we need
it.The boy's father has sent us but little of late."Carmen's heart was fluttering wildly."Tell me," she said in a cold
voice, "the boy's father is Padre Jose de Rincon, of Simiti?We have just come from Simiti, and have seen him.We are leaving to-morrow for the States.""Yes, senorita," replied the woman in a thin, cracking voice, now
completely disarmed of her suspicion."The little fellow was born here
some seven years ago.But the good Padre has sent
us money ever since to care for him, until of late.Senorita, why is
it, think you, that he sends us so little now?""I--do--not--know," murmured Carmen abstractedly, scarce hearing the
woman.She bent over him and looked long
and wistfully into his eyes.He was a bright, handsome little fellow;
and though her heart was crushed, she took him into it.Swallowing the
lump which had come into her throat, she drew him to the window and
sat down, holding him before her."Your father--I know him--well.But--I did not
know--I never knew that he had a son.""Tia Catalina says he is a fine man," proudly answered the boy."And she wants me to be a priest, too.But I am going to be a
bull-fighter.""It is true, senorita," interposed the woman."We cannot keep him
from the _arena_ now.He hangs about it all day, and about the
slaughter-house.We can hardly drag him back to his meals.What
can we do, senorita?But," with a touch of pride as she looked at him,
"if he becomes a bull-fighter, he will be the best of them all!"Her question carried an appeal which
came from the depths of her soul."Senora, is there no doubt--no doubt
that Padre Rincon is the father of the boy?"The lad's mother died in the good Padre's
arms.She would not say positively who was the boy's father.We
thought at first--it was some one else.Marcelena insisted on it to
her dying day.But now--now we know that it was Padre Jose.And he was
sent to Simiti for it.But--ah, senorita, the little mother was so
beautiful, and so good!She--but, senorita, you are not leaving so
soon?""Yes, my good senora," she said wearily."We must
now return to the hotel.But--here is more money for the boy.And,
senora, when I reach the States I will send you money every month for
him.""Come," she said simply, "I have seen enough
of the city."*       *       *       *       *

At noon the next day a message from Bodega Central was put into the
hand of the acting-Bishop of Cartagena, as he sat in his study,
wrapped in the contemplation of certain papers before him.Hostilities
had begun along the Magdalena river the day before.The gates of
Cartagena were to be barricaded that day, for a boatload of rebels was
about to leave Barranquilla to storm the city and seize, if possible,
the customs.When he had read the message he uttered an exclamation.Had not the Sister Superior of the Convent of Our Lady reported the
arrival of the daughter of Rosendo Ariza some days before?He seized
his hat and left the room.Hastening to the Department of Police, he had a short interview with
the chief.Then that official despatched policemen to the office of
the steamship company, and to the dock.Their orders were to arrest
two Americans who were abducting a young girl.They returned a half
hour later with sheepish faces."Your Excellency," they announced to
their chief, "the vessel sailed from the port an hour ago, with the
Americans and the girl aboard."The announcement aroused in Wenceslas the fury of a tiger.Exacerbation
succeeded surprise; and that in turn gave way to a maddening thirst for
sanguinary vengeance.He hastened out and despatched a telegraphic
message to Bogota.Then he returned to his study to await its effect.Two days later a river steamer, impressed by the federal authorities,
stopped at the mouth of the Boque, and a squad of soldiers marched
over the unfrequented trail to Simiti, where they arrived as night
fell.Their orders were to take into custody the priest, Jose de
Rincon, who was accused of complicity in the recent plot to overthrow
the existing government.At the same time, on a vessel plowing its way into the North, a young
girl, awkwardly wearing her ill-fitting garments, hung over the rail
and gazed wistfully back at the Southern Cross.The tourists who saw
her heterogeneous attire laughed.But when they looked into her
beautiful, sad face their mirth died, and a tender pity stirred their
hearts.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The blanket of wet fog which had hung over the harbor with such
exasperating tenacity lifted suddenly, late in the raw fall afternoon,
and revealed to the wondering eyes of the girl who stood alone at the
rail of the _Joachim_ a confusion of mountainous shadows, studded with
myriad points of light which glittered and shimmered beneath the gray
pall.Across the heaving waters came the dull, ominous breathing of
the metropolis.Clouds of heavy, black smoke wreathed about the bay.Through it shrieking water craft darted and wriggled in endless
confusion.For two days the port of New York had been a bedlam of raw
sound, as the great sirens of the motionless vessels roared their
raucous warnings through the impenetrable veil which enveloped them.Their noise had become acute torture to the impatient tourists, and
added bewilderment to the girl.The transition from the primitive simplicity of her tropical home had
not been one of easy gradation, but a precipitate plunge.The
convulsion which ensued from the culmination of events long gathering
about little Simiti had hurled her through the forest, down the
scalding river, and out upon the tossing ocean with such swiftness
that, as she now stood at the portal of a new world, she seemed to be
wandering through the mazes of an intricate dream.During the ocean
voyage she had kept aloof from the other passengers, partly because of
embarrassment, partly because of the dull pain at her heart as she
gazed, day after day, at the two visions which floated always before
her: one, the haggard face of the priest, when she tore herself from
his arms in far-off Simiti; the other, that of the dark-faced,
white-haired old man who stood on the clayey river bank at wretched
Llano and watched her, with eager, straining eyes, until the winding
stream hid her from his earthly sight--forever.She wondered dully now
why she had left them, why she had so easily yielded to the influences
which had caused the separation.They might have fled to the jungle
and lived there in safety and seclusion.The malign influences which
beset them all in Simiti never could have reached them in the
trackless forest.And yet, she knew that had not Rosendo and Jose held
out to her, almost to the last moment, assurances of a speedy reunion,
she would not have yielded to the pressure which they had exerted, and
to the allurements of life in the wonderful country to which they had
sent her.Her embarrassment on the boat was due largely to a sense of
awkwardness in the presence of women who, to her provincial sight,
seemed visions of beauty.To be sure, the priest had often shown her
pictures of the women of the outside world, and she had some idea of
their dress.But that such a vast difference existed between the
illustrations and the actualities, she had never for a moment
imagined.Their gowns, their jewels, their coiffures held her in
open-mouthed marvel, until Mrs.Reed, herself annoyed and embarrassed,
remanded her to her cabin and bade her learn the impropriety of such
manners.Nor had the conduct of this lady throughout the voyage conduced to
Carmen's happiness.Reed showed plainly that the girl was an
awkward embarrassment to her; that she was tolerated because of
reasons which pertained solely to her husband's business; and she took
pains to impress upon her fellow-travelers that, in view of the
perplexing servant problem, this unmannered creature was being taken
to the States to be trained as a maid, though, heaven knew!the
training would be arduous, and the result uncertain.Reed, though measurably kind, gave Carmen scant attention.Harris
alone saved the girl from almost complete neglect.He walked the deck
with her, regardless of the smiles of the other passengers.He taught
her to play shuffle-board, checkers, and simple card games.He
conducted her over the boat and explained the intricate machinery and
the numberless wonders of the great craft.He sat with her out on the
deck at night and told her marvelous stories of his experiences in
frontier camps.And at the table he insisted that she occupy the seat
next to him, despite the protestations of the chief steward, who would
have placed her apart with the servants.Carmen said little, but she clung to the man with an appeal which,
though mute, he nevertheless understood.At Kingston he took her on a
drive through the town, and bought post cards for her to send back to
Jose and Rosendo.It consoled her immeasurably when he glowingly
recounted the pleasure her loved ones would experience on receiving
these cards; and thereafter the girl daily devoted hours to the
preparation of additional ones to be posted in New York.The lifting of the fog was the signal for a race among the stalled
craft to gain the harbor entrance.The enforced retention of the
vessels in the bay had resulted in much confusion in docking, and the
_Joachim_ was assigned to a pier not her own.The captain grumbled,
but had no choice.At the pier opposite there docked a huge liner from
Havre; and the two boats poured their swarming human freight into the
same shed.When the gang plank dropped, Harris took charge of Carmen,
while Reed and his wife preceded them ashore, the latter giving a
little scream of delight as she spied her sister and some friends with
a profusion of flowers awaiting her on the pier.She rushed joyfully
into their arms, while Reed hastened to his equipage with a customs
officer.But as Harris and the bewildered Carmen pushed into the great crowd in
the shed, the absent-minded man suddenly remembered that he had left a
bundle of Panama hats underneath his bunk.Dropping the girl's hand,
the impetuous fellow tore back up the gang plank and dived into the
boat.For a moment Carmen, stood in confusion, bracing herself against
the swarming multitude, and clinging tenaciously to the small,
paper-wrapped bundle which she carried.But the eager, belated crowd almost swept her off her
feet, and she turned again, drifting slowly with it toward the
distant exit.As she moved uncertainly, struggling the while to
prevent being crushed against the wall, she felt some one grasp her
hand.sounded a gentle voice close to her ear.Come, they are waiting for
us up ahead."It was a woman, comely of feature,
and strikingly well dressed.The
anxious fears of a moment before vanished.Reed and the others are waiting for us.The automobiles came for you all; but I presume the
others have gone by this time.However, you and I will follow in mine.the girl asked eagerly, as the woman forced a way for them
through the mass of humanity."Did he write to you--from Simiti?"He said
your name was--"

"Carmen," interrupted the girl, with a great surge of gladness, for
here was one woman who did not avoid her.cried Carmen, suddenly stopping as she remembered.He knows where to find the
automobiles.I will leave word with the pier-master to tell him."By this time they had wormed their way clear of the crowd and gained
the street.The woman, still retaining Carmen's hand, went directly to
a waiting automobile and pushed the unresisting girl through the open
door.Carmen had never seen a conveyance like this, and her thought
was instantly absorbed.And
then, sinking into the luxurious cushions, she fell to speculating as
to how the thing was moved.As the chauffeur reached back to close the door a policeman, who had
been eying the party since they came out of the shed, stepped up and
laid a hand on the car."Er--little girl," he said, looking in and addressing Carmen,
"_you--you know this lady, do you_?""Yes," replied Carmen, looking up confidently into the woman's smiling
face.She thought his blue uniform
and shining buttons and star gorgeously beautiful.Suspicion lurked in his eyes as
he looked at the woman and then back again at the girl."She is a little girl who came up from the South with my nephew, Mr.I
will give you my card, if you wish."The chauffeur, too, as he got out and
leisurely examined his engine, served further to disarm suspicion.The
officer raised up and removed his hand from the machine.The chauffeur
slowly mounted the box and threw on his lever.As the car moved gently
into the night the officer glanced at its number.What's a fellow going to do in a case like this, I'd like to know--go
with 'em?"Some minutes later, Harris, wild and disheveled, followed by Reed and
his party, emerged hurriedly into the street.asked the officer, planting himself in front
of Harris, and becoming vaguely apprehensive.sputtered Harris, his eyes protruding and his long arms pawing
the air."Girl--so high--funny dress--big straw hat!Aunt took her just now in an auto!"For a moment they all stood silent, big-eyed and gaping.The
girl came up from South America with me.Describe the woman--"

"Reed!"cried the policeman excitedly, his eyes lighting.cried the distracted Harris,
menacing the confused officer.Night had fallen, and a curious crowd was gathering around the
excited, noisy group.Reed quickly signaled a taxicab and hustled the
bewildered officer into it."You, Harris, get the women folks home,
and wait for me!I'll go to central with this officer and report the
case!""I'm going to visit every dance hall
and dive in this bloomin' town before I go home!And you, you blithering idiot," shaking a fist at the
officer, "you're going to lose your star for this!"Meantime, the car, in which Carmen lay deep in the soft cushions, sped
through the dusk like a fell spirit.A confused jumble of shadows flew
past, and strange, unfamiliar noises rose from the animated streets.The lights shimmered on the moist glass.The girl
ceased trying to read any meaning in it.It all fused into a blur; and
she closed her eyes and gave herself up to the novel sensations
stimulated by her first ride in a carriage propelled--she knew not
how.At length came a creaking, a soft, skidding motion, and the big car
rolled up against a curb and stopped."We are home now," said the woman softly, as she descended and again
took Carmen's hand.They hurriedly mounted the white stone steps of a
tall, gloomy building and entered a door that seemed to open
noiselessly at their approach.A glare of light burst upon the
blinking eyes of the girl.A <DW64> woman softly closed the door after
them.With a wondering glance, Carmen looked about her.In the room at
her right she caught a glimpse of women--beautiful, they seemed to
her--clad in loose, low-cut, gaily  gowns.There were men
there, too; and some one sat at a piano playing sprightly music.She
had seen pianos like that in Cartagena, and on the boat, and they had
seemed to her things bewitched.In the room at the end of the hall men
and women were dancing on a floor that seemed of polished glass.Loud
talk, laughter, and singing floated through the rooms, and the air
was warm and stuffy, heavy with perfume.The odor reminded her of the
roses in her own little garden in Simiti.It was all beautiful,
wonderful, fairy-like.But she had only a moment for this appraisal.Seizing her hand again,
the woman whisked her up the flight of stairs before them and into a
warm, light room.Then, without speaking, she went out and closed the
door, leaving the girl alone.Carmen sank into a great, upholstered rocking chair and tried to grasp
it all as she swayed dreamily back and forth.She
wondered if Harris dwelt in a place of such heavenly beauty; for he
had said that he did not live with Reed.What would the stupid people
of Simiti think could they see her now!She had never dreamed that
such marvels existed in the big world beyond her dreary, dusty, little
home town!Jose had told her much, ah, wonderful things!But how pitifully inadequate now seemed all their stories!She
still wondered what had made that carriage go in which she had come up
from the boat.Would her interest in
La Libertad suffice to buy one?She passed her hand over
the clean, white counterpane of the bed."Oh," she murmured, "how
beautiful!"She went dreamily to the bureau and took up, one by one,
the toilet articles that lay there in neat array.she
murmured, again and again.The
little figure reflected there contrasted so oddly with the gorgeously
beautiful ones she had glimpsed below that she laughed aloud.Then she
went to the window and felt of the soft curtains."It is heaven," she
murmured, facing about and sweeping the room, "just heaven!Oh, how
beautiful even the human mind can be!I never thought it, I never
thought it!"Again she sat down in the big rocker and gave herself up to the charm
of her surroundings.Her glance fell upon a vase of flowers that stood
on a table near another window.She rose and went to them, bending
over to inhale their fragrance.she exclaimed, as she
felt them crackle in her fingers.But she would learn, ere long, that they fittingly symbolized the life
of the great city in which she was now adrift.She began to wonder why the woman did not return.Were
not the Reeds anxious to know of her safe arrival?It was a ball--but so
different from the simple, artless _baile_ of her native town.Stray
snatches of music drifted into the room from the piano below.She went to the door, thinking to open
it a little and listen.She went hastily, instinctively, to a window and raised the
curtain.She remembered suddenly
that prison windows were like that.Terror's clammy hand gripped at her heart.Then she
caught herself--and laughed.she exclaimed, sinking again
into the rocker.At that moment the door opened noiselessly and a woman entered.She
was younger than the one who had met the boat.When she saw the girl
she uttered an exclamation.Carmen glanced down at her odd attire and then smiled up at the woman.The woman laughed, a sharp, unmusical laugh.The dry cosmetic
plastered thick upon her cheeks cracked.She was not beautiful like
the others, thought Carmen.Her cheeks were sunken, and her low-cut
gown revealed great, protruding collarbones."Come," she said
abruptly, "get out of those rags and into something modern."She
opened a closet door and selected a gown from a number hanging there.It was white, and there was a gay ribbon at the waist."It'll have to be pinned up," she commented to herself, holding it out
before her and regarding Carmen critically.she exclaimed, "am I to wear that?The woman returned no answer, but opened a bureau drawer and took from
it several other garments, which she threw upon a chair, together with
the dress."Into the whole lot of 'em," she said sharply, indicating the
garments."And move lively, for supper's waitin' and there'll be
callers soon--gentlemen callers," she added, smiling grimly.The woman stopped
abruptly and stood with arms akimbo, regarding the girl.Carmen gazed
up at her with a smile of happy, trustful assurance.She mentioned Simiti, Padre Jose, and Rosendo.Her
voice quavered a little; but she brightened up and concluded: "And Mr.Reed's Auntie, she met us--that is, me.Oh, isn't she a beautiful
lady!"The woman seemed to be fascinated by the child's gaze.Then, suddenly,
as if something had given way under great strain, she cried: "For
God's sake, don't look at me that way!She dropped into
a chair and continued to stare at the girl."Well, I've told you," replied Carmen."But," she continued, going
quickly to the woman and taking her hand, "you haven't told me your
name yet.And we are going to be such good friends, aren't we?And you are going to tell me all about this beautiful house, and
that wonderful carriage I came here in.Reed will take me out in it every
day!"Then, in a low voice:

"Your mother--is she living?""But my mother, my own real mother,
she died, long, long ago, on the banks of the great river.My father
left her, and she was trying to follow him.Then I was born--"

"The same old story!""I've been there,
girl, and know all about it.I followed the man--but it was my kid
that died!God, if I could have laid my hands on him!And now you have
come here--"

She stopped abruptly and swallowed hard.Carmen gently stole an arm
about her neck."It isn't true," she murmured, laying her soft cheek
against the woman's painted one."No one can desert us or harm us, for
_God is everywhere_.Padre Jose said I had a message for the people up here; and now you
are the first one I've told it to.And if we know that, why, nothing bad can ever happen to us.But you
didn't know it when your husband left you, did you?"Then she looked up into the girl's
deep, wondering eyes and checked herself."Come," she said abruptly,
rising and still holding her hand."We'll go down to supper now as you
are."Carmen's companion led her down the stairs and through the hall to a
brightly lighted room at the rear, where about a long table sat a half
dozen women.There were places for as many more, but they were
unoccupied.The cloth was white, the glass shone, the silver
sparkled.And the women, who glanced up at the girl, were clad in
gowns of such gorgeous hues as to make the child gasp in amazement.Over all hung the warm, perfumed air that she had thought so delicious
when she had first entered the house.The woman led her to a chair next to
the one she herself took.Carmen looked around for the lady who had
met her at the boat.The silence and the steady
scrutiny of the others began to embarrass her."Where--where is
Auntie?"she asked timidly, looking up at her faded attendant.One of the women, who swayed slightly
in her chair, looked up stupidly.A burst of laughter followed this remark, and Carmen sat down
in confusion.asked one of the younger women of Carmen's
attendant.Headache," was the laconic reply."She landed a queen this time, didn't she?"looking admiringly at
Carmen."Gets me, how the old girl does it!"Carmen," replied the girl timidly, looking questioningly about the
room."Carmen Ariza," the child amended, as her big, wondering eyes swept
the group."Where do you hail from,
angel-face?"The girl looked uncomprehendingly at her interlocutor."Tell them where you lived, child," said the woman called Jude in a
low voice."Simiti," replied Carmen, tears choking her words.A
burst of mirth punctuated the question."Long way from Paris, judging by the fashions."Carmen answered in a scarcely audible voice, "South America."Low exclamations of astonishment encircled the table, while the women
sat regarding the girl curiously."But," continued Carmen in a trembling voice, "where is Mrs.Her beautiful face wore
such an expression of mingled fear, uncertainty, and helplessness as
to throw a hush upon the room.she
muttered, "it's a shame!"She looked for a moment uncertainly into the
big, deep eyes of the girl, and then turned and hastily left the
room.The silence which followed was broken by a pallid, painted creature at
the end of the table."What an old devil the Madam is!One look into those eyes
would have been enough for me!""This is only a recruiting
station for the regular army.She'll go over to French Lucy's; and the
Madam will get a round price for the job.""Old Lucy'll get rich off of her!Ames owns
her house, too, doesn't he?"replied Jude, brightening under the stimulus of her
wine."He owns every house in this block, they say.The Madam rolls on the
floor and cusses for a week straight every time she pays hers.But
just the same, if you've ever noticed, the houses that Ames owns are
never raided by the coppers.Ames whacks up with the mayor and the
city hall gang and the chief of police.That means protection, and we
pay for it in high rents.But it's a lot better'n being swooped down
on by the cops every few weeks, ain't it?We know what we're expected
to pay, that way.And we never do when we keep handin' it out to the
cops."And he's got a new
collector, fellow from the Ketchim Realty Company.They're the old
man's agents now for his dive-houses.He can't get anybody else to
handle 'em, so the collector tells me.""Belle Carey's place was pulled last night, I hear," said one of the
women, pushing back her plate and lighting a cigarette."Yes," returned Jude, "and why?Cause the house is owned by
Gannette--swell guy livin' up on Riverside Drive--and he don't divvy
with the city hall.Belle don't pay no such rent as the Madam does--at
least so old Lucy tells me."The half-intoxicated woman down the table, who had stirred their
laughter a few minutes before, now roused up heavily.Caught a pippin for her once--right off
the train--jus' like this li'l hussy.Went to th' depot in a hack.Saw
th' li'l kid comin' an' pretended to faint.Li'l kid run to me an'
asked could she help.Got her to see me safe home--tee!She's
workin' f'r ol' Lucy yet, sound's a dollar."She fixed her bleared eyes upon Carmen and lapsed back into her former
state of sodden stupidity.The policeman's words at the
pier were floating confusedly through her thought.The strange talk of
these women increased the confusion.Another of the women got up hurriedly and left the table."I haven't
the nerve for another sob-scene," she commented as she went out.pleaded Carmen, turning from one to
another.Jude reached out and seized her hand tightly.Then, to Carmen:

"You are in a--a hotel," she said abruptly."Oh--then--then it was a mistake?"The girl turned her great, yearning
eyes upon the woman."Sit down, and finish
your supper," she said harshly, pulling the girl toward the chair.The maudlin woman down the table chuckled thickly.The <DW64> waitress
went quickly out and closed the door.Jude rose, still holding the
girl's hand."Come up stairs with me," she said, leading her away.commented one of the women, when the two had left the
room.But she's housekeeper, and that's part of her job.Jude took the girl into her own room and locked the door.Then she
sank wearily into a chair.she cried, "I'm sick of this--sick
of the whole thing!"It was all a
mistake, and we can go.""Why, you said this was a hotel--"

"Hotel!Carmen gazed at the excited woman with a puzzled expression on her
face."Now listen," said Jude, bracing herself, "I've got something to tell
you.For God's sake, child,
don't look at me that way!"Your face looks as if you had come down from the sky.But if you did,
and if you believe in a God, you had better pray to Him now!"I was afraid--a
little--at first.When we stop and just know that we love
everybody, and that everybody really loves us, why, we can't be afraid
any more, can we?"The woman looked up at the child in blank amazement.That
warped, twisted word conveyed no meaning to her.And God--it was only
a convenient execrative.But--what was it that looked out from that
strange girl's eyes?What
was emerging from those unfathomable depths, twining itself about her
withered heart and expanding her black, shrunken soul?Whence came
that beautiful, white life that she was going to blast?"Look here," she cried sharply, "tell me again all about yourself, and
about your friends and family down south, and what it was that the
Madam said to you!Carmen sat down at her feet, and taking her hand, went again over the
story.As the child talked, the woman's hard eyes widened, and now and
then a big tear rolled down the painted cheek.Her thought began to
stray back, far back, along the wreck-strewn path over which she
herself had come.At last in the dim haze she saw again the little New
England farm, and her father, stern, but honest and respected,
trudging behind the plow.In the cottage she saw her white-haired
mother, every lineament bespeaking her Puritan origin, hovering over
her little household like a benediction.Then night fell, swiftly as
the eagle swoops down upon its prey, and she awoke from a terrible
dream, stained, abandoned, lost--and seared with a foul oath to drag
down to her own level every innocent girl upon whom her hands might
thereafter fall!"And I have just had to know," Carmen concluded, "every minute since I
left Simiti, that God was everywhere, and that He would not let any
harm come to me.But when we really know that, why, the way _always_
opens.For that's prayer, right prayer; the kind that Jesus taught."The woman sat staring at the girl, an expression of utter blankness
upon her pallid face.Oh, yes, she had been taught to pray.Well she remembered, though the memory now cut like a knife, how she
knelt at her beautiful mother's knee and asked the good Father to
bless and protect them all, even to the beloved doll that she hugged
to her little bosom.But God had never heard her petitions, innocent
though she was.And He had let her fall, even with a prayer on her
lips, into the black pit!A loud sound of male voices and a stamping of feet rose from below.The woman sprang to the door and stood listening."It's the boys from
the college!"She turned and stood hesitant for a moment, as if striving to
formulate a plan.A look of fierce determination came into her face.She went to the bureau and took from the drawers several articles,
which she hastily thrust into the pocket of her dress."Now," she said, turning to Carmen and speaking in a low, strained
voice, "you do just as I say.And for God's sake
don't speak!"Leaving the light burning, she stepped quickly out with Carmen and
locked the door after her.Then, bidding the girl wait, she slipped
softly down the hall and locked the door of the room to which the girl
had first been taken.Laughter and music floated up from below, mingled with the clink of
glasses.The air was heavy with perfume and tobacco smoke.A door near
them opened, and a sound of voices issued.The woman pulled Carmen
into a closet until the hall was again quiet.Then she hurried on to
another door which she entered, dragging the girl with her.Groping through the darkness, she reached a
window, across which stood a hinged iron grating, secured with a
padlock.The woman fumbled among her keys and unfastened this.Swinging it wide, and opening the window beyond, she bade the girl
precede her cautiously."It's a fire-escape," she explained briefly.She reached through the
window grating and fastened the padlock; then closed the window; and
quickly descended with the girl to the ground below.Pausing a moment to get her breath, she seized Carmen's hand and crept
swiftly around the big house and into a dark alley.There she stopped
to throw over her shoulders a light shawl which she had taken from the
bureau.Their course lay through the muddy alley for several blocks.When they
emerged they were in a dimly lighted cross street.The air was chill,
and the thinly clad woman shivered.Carmen, fresh from the tropics,
felt the contrast keenly.A few moments' rapid walking down the street
brought them to a large building of yellow brick, surrounded by a high
board fence.The woman unfastened the gate and hurried up to the door,
over which, by the feeble light of the street lamp, Carmen read, "The
Little Sisters of the Poor."A black-robed woman admitted them and went to summon the Sister
Superior.Carmen marveled at her strange attire.A moment later they
were silently ushered into an adjoining room, where a tall woman,
similarly dressed, awaited them."Sister," said Jude excitedly, "here's a little kid--you got to care
for her until she finds her friends!"The Sister Superior instantly divined the status of the woman."Let
the child wait here a moment," she said, "and you come with me and
tell your story.It would be better that she should not hear."Carmen was drowsing in her
chair."She's chock full of religion," the woman was saying."But you," the Sister replied, "what will you do?"Then you will stay here until--"

"No, no!I have friends--others like myself--I will go to them.I--I
couldn't stay here--with her," nodding toward the girl."But--you will
take care of her?""Surely," returned the Sister in a calm voice.Then she turned abruptly and went swiftly out into the chill night."Come," said the Sister to Carmen, extending a hand.CHAPTER 2


Carmen was astir next morning long before the rising-bell sounded its
shrill summons through the long corridors.When she opened her eyes
she gazed at the ceiling above in perplexity.She still seemed to feel
the tossing motion of the boat, and half believed the bell to be the
call to the table, where she should again hear the cheery voice of
Harris and meet the tolerant smile of Mrs.Then a rush of
memories swept her, and her heart went down in the flood.She was
alone in a great foreign city!She turned her face to the pillow, and
for a moment a sob shook her.Then she reached under the pillow and
drew out the little Bible, which she had taken from her bundle and
placed there when the Sister left her the night before.The book fell
open to Isaiah, and she read aloud:

  "I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine
  hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the
  people, for a light of the Gentiles.""That means me," she said
firmly."Padre Jose said I had a message for the world; and now I
am to tell it to these people up here.That means, He has called me to do _right thinking_.And I am to tell these people how to think right.Suddenly her thought reverted to Cartagena, and to the sturdy little
lad who had so proudly claimed the name of Rincon.Then she burst into tears and threw herself back upon the
bed."I must think only God's thoughts,"
she said, struggling to her feet and checking her grief."If it is
right for the little boy to be his son, then I must want it to be so.I _must_ want only the right--I have _got_ to want it!And if it is
not right now, then God will make it so.It is all in His hands, and I
must not think of it any more, unless I think right thoughts."She dressed herself quickly, but did not put on the shoes."I simply
can not wear these things," she mourned, looking at them dubiously;
"and I do not believe the woman will make me.I wonder why the other
woman called her Sister.Why did she wear that ugly black bonnet?And
why was I hurried away from that hotel?It was so much pleasanter
there, so bright and warm; and here it is so cold."She shivered as
she buttoned her thin dress."But," she continued, "I have got to go
out now and find Mr.Harris--I have just _got_ to find
them--and to-day!But, oh, this city is so much larger than Simiti!"She shook her head in perplexity as she put the Bible back again in
the bundle, where lay the title papers to La Libertad and her mother's
little locket, which Rosendo had given her that last morning in
Simiti.The latter she drew out and regarded wistfully for some
moments."I haven't any father or mother but God," she murmured."But
He is both father and mother to me now."With a little sigh she tied
up the bundle again.Holding it in one hand and carrying the much
despised shoes in the other, she left the cheerless room and started
down the long, cold hall.When she reached the stairway leading to the floor below she stopped
abruptly."I have been
thinking only of myself.What is it that the Bible says?--'And I will bring them by a way
that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not
known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things
straight.'And Padre Jose said he would
remember it, too."Again she choked back the tears which surged up at the remembrance of
the priest, and, bracing herself, hastily descended the stairs,
murmuring at every step, "God is everywhere--right here!"At the far end of the lower hall she saw, through an open door, a
number of elderly people sitting at long tables.When she reached the door, she stopped and peered
curiously within.A murmur of astonishment rose from the inmates
when they caught sight of the quaint object in the doorway, standing
uncertainly, with her shoes in one hand, the awkwardly tied bundle in
the other, and garbed in the chaotic attire so hastily procured for
her in Cartagena.A Sister came quickly forward and, taking the girl's hand, led her
into a smaller adjoining room, where sat the Sister Superior at
breakfast.The latter greeted the child gently and bade her be seated
at the table.Carmen dropped into a chair and sat staring in naive
wonder."Well," began the Sister at length, "eat your breakfast quickly.This
is Sunday, you know, and Mass will be said in the chapel in half an
hour.But you are with friends
here, little girl.Carmen quickly recovered her spirits, and her nimble tongue its wonted
flexibility.Without further invitation or preface she entered at once
upon a lively description of her wonderful journey through the jungle,
the subsequent ocean voyage, and the mishap at the pier, and concluded
with the cryptical remark: "And, you know, Senora, it is all just as
Padre Jose said, only a series of states of consciousness, after
all!"The Sister stared blankly at the beaming child.What manner of being
was this that had been so strangely wafted into these sacred precincts
on the night breeze!The abandoned woman who had brought her there,
the Sister remembered, had dropped an equally cryptical remark--"She's
chock full of religion."But gratitude quickly mastered her wonder, and the woman, pondering
the child's dramatic recital, murmured a sincere, "The Virgin be
praised!""Oh," said Carmen, looking up quickly as she caught the words, "you
people up here talk just like those in Simiti.But Padre Jose said you
didn't know, either.You ought to, though, for you have had so many
more ad--advantages than we have.Senora, there are many big, clumsy
words in the English language, aren't there?We used to speak it all the time during the
last years we were together.He said it seemed easier to talk about
God in that language than in any other."And who is this
Jose that you talk so much about?""He--taught me--in Simiti."Well," replied the Sister warmly, "he seems to have taught you queer
things!"returned Carmen quickly, "he just taught me the truth.He
didn't tell me about the queer things in the world, for he said they
were not real."Again the Sister stared at the girl in dumb amazement.But the child's
thought had strayed to other topics.she
exclaimed, shivering and drawing her dress about her."I guess I'll
have to put on these shoes to keep my feet warm.""Didn't you
wear shoes in your country?""No," replied Carmen, tugging and straining at the shoes; "I didn't
wear much of anything, it was so warm.Oh, it is beautiful down there,
Senora, so beautiful and warm in Simiti!"She sighed, and her eyes
filled with tears.But she brushed them away and smiled bravely up at
the Sister."I've come here because it is right," she said with a firm
nod of her head."Padre Jose said I had a message for you.He said you
didn't know much about God up here.Why, I don't know much of anything
else!"She laughed a happy little laugh as she said this.Then she
went on briskly:

"You know, Senora, Padre Jose isn't really a priest.But he said he
had to stay in the Church in order to teach me.I am sure he just thought wrong about it.But, anyway,
he will not have to be a priest any more, now that I have gone, will
he?You know, Don Jorge said priests were a bad lot; but that isn't
so, for there are many good priests, aren't there?Why, Senora," she exclaimed,
suddenly remembering the Sister's previous injunction, "is this a
church?You said there would be Mass in the chapel--"

"No," replied the Sister, still studying the girl attentively, while
her manner became more severe; "this is a home for old people, a
charitable institution.""Oh," replied Carmen, with a very vague idea of what that meant."Well," her face alight and her eyes dancing, "I don't belong here
then, do I?I am never going to be old," she meditated.The Bible says we
are made in His image and likeness.Well, if that is so, how can we
ever grow old?Just think of God hobbling around in heaven with a cane
and saying: 'Well, I'm getting old now!We wouldn't grow old and die if it wasn't for our wrong
way of thinking, would we?When we think His thoughts, why, we will be
like Him.Padre Jose says this, and he knows it is
true--only, he seems to have a hard time proving it.But, Senora, we
have all got to prove it, some time, every one of us.And then there
will not be any places like this for old people--people who still
believe that two and two are seven, you know.The woman looked at her blankly; but the girl rambled on."Padre Jose
sometimes talked of the charitable institutions out in the world, and
he always said that charity was a crime against the people.And he was
right, for that is just the way Jesus looked at it, isn't it?Jesus
did not give money to beggars, but he did better, he healed them of
the bad state of mind that was making them poor and sick.Jesus, when he taught,
first said a thing, and then he turned right around and proved it.And, why, Senora,
I've had thousands of proofs!"The Sister did not reply; and Carmen, stealing a covert glance at her,
continued:

"You know, Senora, it is just as wicked to be sick and poor as it is
to tell a lie, because being sick and poor is just the ex--the
ex-ter-nal-i-zation of our thought; and such thought is not from God;
and so to hold such thoughts and to believe them real is to believe in
power apart from God.It is having other gods than the one God; and
that is breaking the very first Commandment, isn't it?Yes, it is; and
you can prove it, just as you can prove the principles in mathematics.Senora, do you know anything about mathematics?"The astonished woman made an involuntary sign of negation."Oh, Senora," cried the enthusiastic girl, "the things that Jesus
taught can be proved just as easily as we prove the rules in
mathematics!for they are truth, and all truth can be
demonstrated, you know.You know, Senora, God is everywhere--not only
in heaven, but right here where we are.Heaven, Padre Jose used to say
so often, is only a perfect state of mind; and so it is, isn't it?And when we reflect Him perfectly, why, we
will be in heaven.But," she went on after catching
her breath, "we can't reflect Him as long as we believe evil to be
real and powerful.It is just zero, nothing--"

"I've heard that before," interrupted the woman, recovering somewhat
from her surprise."But I think that before you get out of New York
you will reverse that idea.There's a pretty fair amount of evil here,
and it is quite real, we find.""If it is real, then God made it.It
seems real to you--but that is only because you give it reality in
your consciousness.You believe it real, and so it becomes to you.""Well," said the woman dryly, "on that basis I think the same may be
said of good, too.""No," answered Carmen eagerly, "good is--"

"There," interrupted the Sister coldly, holding up an admonitory hand,
"we are not going to discuss the foolish theological notions which
that fallen priest put into your poor little head.The child looked at the woman in mute protest.It was a new thought, and
one that she would not accept."Senora," she began again, after a brief interval, "Padre Jose is a
good man, even the human Padre Jose.And he is trying to solve his
problem and know God.And he is trying to know himself, not as other
people think they know him, but as God knows him, and as I have always
tried to know him.You have no right to judge him--and, anyway, you
are not judging him, but only your wrong idea of him.And that," she
said softly, "is nothing."She was beginning to feel the spell of
those great brown eyes, that soft, rich voice, and the sparkling
expression of innocence, purity, and calm assurance that bubbled from
those red lips.And she was losing herself in contemplation of the
girl's luxuriant beauty, whose rich profusion her strange, foreign
attire could not disguise."Senora," said Carmen suddenly, "the people on the boat laughed at my
clothes.But I don't think them half as funny as that great black
bonnet you are wearing.I never saw one until I
was brought here."It was said innocently, and with no thought of offense.But the woman
instantly roused from her meditation and assumed an attitude of
severe dignity."And
remember after this that children's manners here are not those of your
country."The girl fell quiet under the rebuke, and the meal ended in silence.As they were rising from the table a cheery voice came from the outer
room, and presently a priest looked in."Good morning, Sister," he cried heartily.He was a young man, apparently still in the
twenties, of athletic build, inclined rather to stoutness, and with a
round, shining face that radiated health and good nature."It is a little
waif," she said in answer to his query, "who strayed in here last
night.""Aha," said the priest, "another derelict!And will you send her to
the orphanage?""I'm afraid if I do the little heretic will corrupt all the other
children," replied the Sister."Father," she continued seriously, "I
want you to examine this child, and then tell me what you think should
be done with her.""No," replied the Sister; "but another priest has gone wrong, and
this," pointing to Carmen, "is the result of his pernicious
teachings.""Very well, Sister," he said in a low voice."I will talk with her
after the service."He seemed suddenly to have lost his cheerfulness,
as he continued to converse with the woman on matters pertaining to
the institution.Carmen, wondering and receptive, took the place assigned to her in the
chapel and sat quietly through the service.She had often seen Jose
celebrate Mass in the rude little church in Simiti, but with no such
elaboration as she witnessed here.Once or twice she joined in the
responses, not with any thought of worship, but rather to give vent,
even if slight, to the impelling desire to hear her own musical voice.She thought as she did so that the priest looked in her direction.She
thought others looked at her attentively at the same time.But they
had all stared at her, for that matter, and she had felt confused and
embarrassed under their searching scrutiny.Yet the old people
attracted her peculiarly.Never had she seen so many at one time.And
never, she thought, had she seen such physical decrepitude and
helplessness.And then she fell to wondering what they were all there
for, and what they got out of the service.Did they believe that thereby their sins were atoned?Did
they believe that that priest was really changing the wafer and wine
into flesh and blood?She recalled much that Jose had told her about
the people up in the States.They were not so different, mentally,
from her own, after all.The people, still gossiping cheerfully,
had prostrated themselves before it.The sermon had been short, for
the old people waxed impatient at long discourses.Then the priest
descended from the pulpit and came to Carmen."Now, little girl," he
said, seating himself beside her, "tell me all about yourself, who you
are, where you come from, and what you have been taught.Carmen smiled up at him; then plunged into
her narrative.It was two hours later when the Sister Superior looked in and saw the
priest and girl still sitting in earnest conversation."But," she heard the priest say, "you tell me that this
Father Jose taught you these things?""He taught me English, and French, and German.And he taught me all I know of history, and of the
world," the girl replied."Yes, yes," the priest went on hurriedly; "but these other things,
these religious and philosophical notions, who taught you these?"The Sister drew closer and strained her ears to hear.The girl looked down as she answered softly, "God."He reached out and laid a hand
on hers."I believe you," he said, in a voice scarcely audible."I
believe you--for we do not teach such things.""Then," she said quizzically,
"you are not really a priest."The Sister's voice rang sternly through the quiet
chapel."The dinner-bell
will ring in a few minutes," continued the Sister, regarding the man
severely."Ah, true," he murmured, hastily glancing at the clock."The time
passed so rapidly--a--a--this girl--"

"Leave the girl to me," replied the Sister coldly."Unless," she
added, "you consider her deranged.Coming from that hot country
suddenly into this cold climate might--"

"No, no," interrupted the priest hastily; "she seems uncommonly strong
mentally.She has some notions that are a--somewhat different from
ours--that is--but I will come and have a further talk with her."He raised his hand in silent benediction, while the Sister bowed her
head stiffly.Then, as if loath to take his eyes from the girl, he
turned and went slowly out.Carmen followed her out into the hall
and down a flight of steps to the kitchen below."Katherine," said the Sister Superior, addressing an elderly,
white-haired Sister who seemed to be in charge of the culinary
department, "put this girl to work.Let her eat with you and sleep in
your room.And see if you can't work some of the foolish notions out
of her head."CHAPTER 3


"Get some o' th' foolish notions out of your head, is it?Och, puir
bairn, wid yer swate face an' that hivenly hair, it's welcome ye air
to yer notions!Ye have talked too brash to the Sister
Superior.But, mind your tongue,
honey.Tell your funny notions to old Katie, an' they'll be safe as
the soul of Saint Patrick; but keep mum before the others, honey.""But, Senora, don't they want to know the truth up here?"There was a
note of appeal in the quavering voice."Now listen, honey; don't call me sich heathen names.I'm no Senora, whativer that may be.And as for wantin' to know the
truth, God bless ye, honey!"They don't, Sen--Sister!""Well, thin, they don't--an' mebby I'm not so far from agreein' wid
ye.But, och, it's dead beat I am, after the Sunday's work!But ye air
a right smart little helper, honey--only, ye don't belong in th'
kitchen.""Sen--I mean, Sister--"

"That's better, honey; ye'll get it in time.""Sister, I've just _got_ to find Mr."No, honey, it's few I know outside these walls.But ye can put up a
bit of a prayer when ye turn in to-night.An' we'd best be makin' for
th' bed, too, darlin', for we've a hard day's work to-morrow."It was Carmen's second night in New York, and as the girl silently
followed the puffing old woman up the several long, dark flights of
stairs to the little, cheerless room under the eaves, it seemed to her
that her brain must fly apart with the pressure of its mental
accumulation.The great building in which she was now sheltered, the
kitchen, with its marvels of equipment, gas stoves, electric lights,
annunciators, and a thousand other equally wonderful appliances which
the human mind has developed for its service and comfort, held her
fascinated, despite her situation, while she swelled with questions
she dared not ask.Notwithstanding the anxiety which she had not
wholly suppressed, her curiosity, naive, eager, and insatiable, rose
mountain high.Sister Katherine had been kind to her, had received her
with open arms, and given her light tasks to perform.And many times
during the long afternoon the old woman had relaxed entirely from her
assumed brusqueness and stooped to lay a large, red hand gently upon
the brown curls, or to imprint a resounding kiss upon the flushed
cheek.Now, as night was settling down over the great, roaring city,
the woman took the homeless waif into her big heart and wrapped her in
a love that, roughly expressed, was yet none the less tender and
sincere."Ye can ask the Virgin, honey, to send ye to yer frinds," said the
woman, as they sat in the gloaming before the window and looked out
over the kindling lights of the city."Not much, I guess, honey," answered the woman frankly."Troth, an'
I've asked her fer iverything in my time, from diamonds to a husband,
an' she landed me in a convint!"You didn't ask in the right way, Sister--"

"Faith, I asked in ivery way I knew how!An' whin I had th' carbuncle
on me neck I yelled at her!Sure she may have answered me prayer, fer
th' whoop I gave busted the carbuncle, an' I got well.Ye nivir kin
tell, honey."But, Sis--I can't call you Sister!"pleaded the girl, going to the
woman and twining her arms about her neck."Och, honey darlin'"--tears started from the old woman's eyes and
rolled down her wrinkled cheeks--"honey darlin', call me Katie, just
old Katie.Och, Holy Virgin, if I could have had a home, an' a
beautiful daughter like you--!"She clasped the girl in her great arms
and held her tightly."Katie, when you pray you must pray knowing that God has already given
you what you need, and that there is nothing that can keep you from
seeing it.""An' so, darlin', if I want
diamonds I must know that I have 'em, is it that, honey?"murmured Carmen, drawing closer, and laying her soft
cheek against the leathery visage of the old woman."Say that again, honey--och, say it again!It's words, darlin', that's
nivir been said to old Katie!""Why, hasn't any one ever been kind to you?"Och, ivirybody's kind to me, honey!But nobody has ivir loved
me--that way.The good Lord made me a fright, honey--ain't ye noticed?An' they told me from th' cradle up I'd nivir
land a man.An' I didn't, honey; they all ran from me--an' so I become
a bride o' th' Church."But, Katie, the face is nothing.Why, your heart is as big--as big as
the whole world!I hadn't been with you an hour before I knew that."Och, darlin'," murmured the woman, "sure th' Virgin be praised fer
sendin' ye to me, a lonely old woman!""It was not the Virgin, Katie, but God who brought me here," said the
girl gently, as she caressed the old Sister's cheek."It's all one, honey; the Virgin's th' Mother o' God.""Troth, child, she has th' same power as God!Don't we pray to her,
an' she prays to th' good God to save us?There is no person or thing that persuades God to be
good to His children.He is
infinite--infinite mind, Katie, and infinite good.Oh, Katie, what
awful things are taught in this world as truth!How little we know of
the great God!And yet how much people pretend they know about Him!But if they only knew--really _knew_, as Jesus did--why, Katie, there
wouldn't be an old person, or a sick or unhappy one in the whole
world!Katie," after a little pause, "I know."Air these more o' yer funny
notions, darlin'?""I suppose they are what the world thinks funny, Katie," answered the
girl.But then,
th' world moves, girlie--even old Katie sees that.Only, the Church
don't move with it.An' old Katie can see that, too.An' so, I'm
thinkin', does Father Waite.""Faith, an' how do ye know it, child?""He talked with me--a long time, this morning.He said God had taught
me what I know."Thin me own suspicions air right; he's out o' tune!Did ye say, girlie dear, that he didn't scold ye fer yer funny
notions?""No, Katie, he said they were right."Thin, lassie dear, things is goin' to happen.An' he's a
good man--troth, they make no better in this world!"Carmen looked out wonderingly over
the city.She yearned to know what it held for her."Katie," she said at length, bending again over the woman, "will you
help me find Mr."Och, lassie--what's your name again?""Carmen," replied the girl, "Carmen Ariza.""Cair-men Aree--now ain't that a name fer ye!An' I'm Scotch-Irish, honey; an' we're both a long
way from th' ol' sod!Lassie dear, tell me about last night.But, no;
begin 'way back.Old Katie's weak in th' head,
girlie, but she may see a way out fer ye.Th' Virgin help ye, puir
bairn!"Midnight boomed from the bell in a neighboring tower when Carmen
finished her story.exclaimed the old Sister, staring at the girl
in amazement."Now do ye let me feel of ye to see that ye air human;
fer only a Saint could go through all that an' live to tell it!An'
the place ye were in last night!Now be Saint Patrick, if I was rich
I'd have Masses said every day fer that Jude who brung ye here!Don't
tell me th' good Lord won't forgive her!"She's a good woman, Katie; and, somehow, I felt sorry for her, but I
don't know why.She has a beautiful home in that hotel--"

"Hotel, is it!But--och, sure, it was a hotel, honey.Only, ye air better off here wi' old Katie."But--unless it's wi' Father
Waite, I don't know what I can do.Ye air in bad with th' Sister
Superior fer yer talk at th' breakfast table.Ye're a fresh little
heathen, honey.An' she's suspicious of Father Waite, too.An' he th' best man on airth!But his doctrine ain't just sound,
sweatheart.There,
honey, lave it to me.But it's got to be done quick, or th' Sister
Superior'll have ye in an orphan asylum, where ye'll stay till ye air
soused in th' doctrine!I can manage to get word to Father Waite
to-morrow, airly.A bit of a word wi'
him'll fix it, lassie dear.An' now, honey swate, off with them funny
clothes and plump into bed.it's all but marnin' now!"A few minutes later the woman turned to the girl who lay so quiet at
her side."Honey," she whispered, "was ye tellin' me awhile back that ye knew
the right way to pray?""Yes, Katie dear," the child murmured."Thin do you pray, lass, an' I'll not trouble the Virgin this night."*       *       *       *       *

"Well, Father, what do you think now?"The Sister Superior looked up
aggressively, as Father Waite slowly entered the room.His head was
bowed, and there was a look of deep earnestness upon his face."I have talked with her again--an hour, or more," he said reflectively."She is a--a remarkable girl, in many ways.""She attracts and repels me, both," she
said.And she appears to be
suffering from religious dementia.It was a compromising question, and the priest weighed his words
carefully before replying."She does--seem to--to have rather--a--rather
unusual--religious views," said he slowly."Would it not be well to have Dr."That we may know what to do with her.If she is mentally unsound she
must not be sent to the orphanage.""She should be taken--a--I mean, we should try to locate her friends.I have already searched the city directory; but, though there are many
Reeds, there are none listed with the initials she gave me as his.I
had thought," he continued hesitatingly, "I had thought of putting her
in charge of the Young Women's Christian Association--"

"Father Waite!"The Sister Superior rose and drew herself up to her
full height."Do you mean to say that you have contemplated delivering
her into the hands of heretics?"she demanded coldly, her tall figure
instinct with the mortal pride of religious superiority."Why, Sister," returned the priest with embarrassment, "would it not
be wise to place her among those whose views harmonize more closely
with hers than ours do?"urged the man, with a gesture of
impatience.The combined weight of all the
centuries of church authority could not make her one--never!I must
take her to those with whom she rightfully belongs."The Sister Superior's eyes narrowed and glittered, and her face grew
dark.I am in charge here, and I
shall report this case to the Bishop!"The futility of his case
seemed to impress him.Taking up his hat, he bowed without speaking
and went out.Outside
the door the man listened until he caught the number she called.His
face grew dark and angry, and his hands clenched a she strode down the
hall.On the stairs that led up from the kitchen stood Sister Katherine."Wait on th' corner--behind the church!The lassie will meet you
there!"Before he could reply the woman had plunged again into the dark
stairway.Stopping at a small closet below, she took out a bundle.Then she hurried to the kitchen and summoned Carmen, who was sitting
at a table peeling potatoes."Troth, lazy lass," she commanded sharply, "do you take the bucket and
mop and begin on the front steps.And mind that ye don't bring me
heavy hand down on ye!Och, lassie darlin'," she added, when she had
drawn the startled girl out of hearing of the others, "give yer old
Katie a kiss, and then be off!Troth, it breaks me heart to see ye
go--but 'twould break yours to stay!Go, lassie darlin', an' don't
fergit old Katie!Here," thrusting the girl's bundle and a dollar bill
into her hands, "an' God bless ye, lass!Ye've won me, heart an' soul!Ye'll find a frind at th' nixt corner!"She
strained the girl again to her breast, then opened the door and
hastily thrust her out into the street.For a moment Carmen stood dazed by the suddenness of it all.She
looked up confusedly at the great, yellow building from which she had
been ejected.Then, grasping her
bundle and the dollar bill, she hurried out through the gate and
started up the street.The man's face was furrowed, and
his body trembled.The girl went up to him with a glad smile.The
priest looked up, and muttered something incoherent under his breath a
she took her hand.He drew some loose change from his pocket, and hailed an approaching
street car."To police headquarters," he replied, "to ask them to help us find
your friends."CHAPTER 4


From the mysterious wastes which lie far out on the ocean, the fog was
again creeping stealthily across the bay and into the throbbing
arteries of the great city.Through half-opened doors and windows it
rolled like smoke, and piled like drifted snow against the mountains
of brick and stone.Caught for a moment on a transient breeze, it
swirled around a towering pile on lower Broadway, and eddied up to the
windows of the Ketchim Realty Company, where it sifted through the
chinks in the loose frames and settled like a pall over the dingy
rooms within.To Philip O. Ketchim, junior member of the firm, it seemed a fitting
external expression of the heavy gloom within his soul.Crumpled into
the chair at the broad table in his private office, with his long,
thin legs stretched out before him, his hands crammed into the pockets
of his trousers, and his bullet-shaped head sunk on his flat chest,
until it seemed as if the hooked nose which graced his hawk-like
visage must be penetrating his breast-bone, the man was the embodiment
of utter dejection.On the littered table, where he had just tossed
it, lay the report of Reed and Harris on the pseudo-mineral properties
of the Molino Company--the "near-mines" in the rocky canon of the
far-off Boque.Near it lay the current number of a Presbyterian
review, wherein the merits of this now moribund project were
advertised in terms whose glitter had attracted swarms of eager,
trusting investors.The firm name of Ketchim Realty Company was something of a misnomer.The company itself was an experiment, whose end had not justified its
inception.It had been launched a few years previously by Douglass
Ketchim to provide business careers for his two sons, James and
Philip.The old gentleman, still hale and vigorous, was one of those
sturdy Englishmen who had caught the infection of '49 and abruptly
severed the ties which bound them to their Kentish homes for the
allurements of the newly discovered El Dorado of western America.Across the death-haunted Isthmus of Panama and up the inhospitable
Pacific coast the indomitable spirit of the young adventurer drove
him, until he reached the golden sands of California.There he toiled
for many years, until Fortune at length smiled upon his quenchless
efforts.Then he tossed aside his rough tools and set out for the less
constricted fields of the East.He invested his money wisely, and in the course of years turned it
several times.He aspired to the hand of a
sister of a railway president, and won it.He educated his sons in the
best colleges of the East, and then sent them to Europe on their
honeymoons.And finally, when the burden of years began to press
noticeably, and the game became less attractive, he retired from
the field of business, cleared off his indebtedness, organized the
Ketchim Realty Company, put its affairs on the best possible basis,
and then committed the unpardonable folly of turning it over to the
unrestricted management of his two sons.At the expiration of a year the old gentleman
hurried back into the harness to save the remnant of his fortune, only
to find it inextricably tied up in lands of dubious value and
questionable promotional schemes.The untangling of the real estate he
immediately took into his own hands.A word in passing regarding these sons, for they typify a form of
parasitical growth, of the fungus variety, which in these days has
battened and waxed noxious on the great stalk of legitimate commercial
enterprise.They were as dissimilar, and each as unlike his father, as
is possible among members of the same family.Both sought, with
diligent consecration, the same goal, money; but employed wholly
different means to gain that end.James, the elder, was a man of ready
wit, a nimble tongue, and a manner which, on occasions when he could
think of any one but himself, was affable and gracious.He was a
scoffer of religion, an open foe of business scruple, and the avowed
champion of every sort of artifice and device employed in ancient,
mediaeval, or modern finance to further his own selfish desires, in
the minimum of time, and at whatever cost to his fellow-man.In his
cups he was a witty, though arrogant, braggart.In his home he was
petulant and childish.Of real business acumen and constructive
wisdom, he had none.He would hew his way to wealth, if need be,
openly defiant of God, man, or the devil.Or he would work in subtler
ways, through deceit, jugglery, or veiled bribe.But he generally wore
his heart on his sleeve; and those who perforce had business relations
with him soon discovered that, though utterly unscrupulous, his
character was continuously revealed through his small conceit, which
caused him so to work as to be seen of men and gain their cheap
plaudits for his sharp, mendacious practices.Philip retained a degree of his father's confidence--which James
wholly lacked--and he spared himself no pains to cultivate it.Though
far less ready of wit than his stubby, bombastic brother, he was a
tenacious plodder, and was for this reason much more likely ultimately
to achieve his sordid purposes.His energy was tireless, and he never
admitted defeat.He never worked openly; he never appeared to have a
decided line of conduct; and no one could ever say what particular
course he intended to pursue.Apparently, he was a man of exemplary
habits; and his mild boast that he knew not the taste of tobacco or
liquor could not be refuted.He was an elder in the Presbyterian
church in the little suburb where he lived, and superintendent of its
Sunday school.His prayers were beautiful expressions of reverent
piety; and his conversation, at all times chaste and modest, announced
him a man of more than ordinary purity of thought and motive.While it
is true that no one could recall any pious deed, any charitable act,
or any conduct based on motives of self-abnegation and brotherly love
performed by him, yet no one could ever point to a single coarse or
mean action emanating from the man.If there was discord in company
affairs, the wanton James always bore the onus.And because of this,
relations between the brothers gradually assumed a condition of
strain, until at length James openly and angrily denounced Philip as a
hypocrite, and refused longer to work with him.Thereupon the milder
Philip offered the other cheek and installed a mediator, in the person
of one Rawlins, a sickly, emaciated, bearded, but loyal Hermes, who
thenceforth performed the multifold functions of pacificator,
go-between, human telephone, and bearer of messages, documents, and
what-not from one to the other for a nominal wage and the crumbs that
dropped from the promoter's table.The fog and the gloom thickened, and Ketchim sat deeply immersed in
both.He was still shaking from the fright which he had received that
morning.On opening the door as he was about to leave his house to
take the train to the city, he had confronted two bulky policemen.With a muffled shriek he had slammed the door in their astonished
faces and darted back into the house, his heart in his throat and
hammering madly.How could he know that they were only selling tickets
to a Policemen's Ball?Then he had crept to the window and, concealed
in the folds of the curtain, had watched them go down the street,
laughing and turning often to glance back at the house that held such
a queer-mannered inmate.Rousing himself from the gloomy revery into which he had lapsed,
Ketchim switched on the light and took up again the report of Reed
and Harris.Sullenly he turned its pages, while the sallow skin on his
low forehead wrinkled, and his bird-like face drew into ugly
contortions."Didn't they see that clause in their contract,
providing an additional fifty thousand in stock for them in case they
made a favorable report?"A light tap at the door, and a low cough, preceded the noiseless
entrance of the meek-souled Rawlins."A--a--this is the list which Reverend Jurges sent us--names and
addresses of his congregation.I've mailed them all descriptive
matter; and I wrote Mr.Jurges that the price of his stock would be
five dollars, but that we couldn't sell to his congregation for less
than seven.I told him Molino stock would go
up to par next month."How much stock did Jurges say he'd take?"demanded Ketchim, without
looking up."Why, he said he could only get together two thousand dollars at
present, but that later he would have some endowment insurance falling
due--"

"How soon?""About a year, I think he said.""Well, he ought to be able to borrow on that."Do so--but only hint at it.And tell him to send his check at once
for the stock he has agreed to take.""Why, he sent that some days ago.I thought you--"

"He did?"cried Ketchim, his interest now fully aroused."Er--your brother James received the letter, and I believe he put the
check in his pocket."Ketchim gave vent to a snort of rage."You tell James," he cried,
pounding the desk with his fist, "that as president and treasurer of
the Molino Company I demand that check!""Yes, sir--and--"

"Well?"Cass 'phoned before you got down this morning.He said the bank
refused to extend the time on your note."Ketchim sank back limply into his chair, and his face became ashen."And here is the mail," pursued the gentle Hermes, handing him a
bundle of letters.Ketchim roused himself with an effort."Do
you know whether James has been selling any of his own Molino stock?""I--I believe he has, sir--a little.""He sold some two hundred shares yesterday--I believe; to a Miss
Leveridge.""Why, the Leveridge children--grown men and women now--have just sold
their farm down state; and Mr.James saw the sale announced in the
papers.So he got in touch with Miss Alvina Leveridge.I believe he
sent Houghton down there; and he closed a deal.James got eight
dollars a share, I believe."Ketchim gulped down his wrath, and continued:

"How much did the Leveridges get for their farm?And why didn't you
inform me of the sale?"he demanded, fixing the humble Rawlins with a
cold eye."A--a--twenty-five thousand dollars, sir, I believe.And I didn't see
the notice until--"

"As usual, James saw it first!"James is still dickering with Miss Leveridge, I
suppose?""Nezlett got back last night, didn't he?Very well, call him up and
tell him to get ready to go at once to--wherever the Leveridges live.And--I want to see him right away!"He abruptly dismissed the factotum and turned to his mail.As his
glance fell upon the pile he gasped.Then he quickly drew out a letter
and tore it open.His thin lips moved rapidly as his eyes roved over
the paper.He laid the letter down and looked wildly about.Then he
took it up again and read aloud the closing words:

  "--and, having bought somewhat heavily of Molino stock, and
  believing that your representations were made with intent to
  deceive, I shall, unless immediate reparation or satisfactory
  explanation is made, take such steps as my counsel may advise."Yours, etc.,
                                                 "J. WILTON AMES."Congealing with fear, Ketchim took his stock memorandum from a drawer
and consulted it."He put in ten thousand, cash," he murmured, closing
the book and replacing it."And I always wondered why, for he doesn't
go into things that he can't control.He
shouldn't have been sold a dollar's worth!He knows we can't return
the money; and now he's tightening the screws!He has something up his
sleeve; and we've fallen for it!"He settled back in his chair and groaned aloud.Did
he think he'd reach Uncle Ted through us?For a
year or more he's wanted to oust Uncle from the C.& R., and now he
thinks by threatening the family with disgrace, and us fellows with
the pen, he can do it!Oh, if I ever get out of
this I'll steer clear of these deals in the future!"It was his stock
resolution, which had never borne fruit.The door opened slightly, and the noiseless Rawlins timidly announced
the arrival of Reed and Harris.cried Ketchim, jumping up and hastily passing
his hands over his hair and face.Then, advancing with a wan smile, he
courteously greeted the callers."Well, fellows," he began, waving them to seats, "it looks a
little bad for Molino, doesn't it?I've just been reading your
report--although of course you told me over the 'phone yesterday
that there was no hope.But," he continued gravely, and his face
grew serious, "I'm glad, very glad, of one thing, and that is that
there are men in the world to-day who are above temptation.""Why," continued Ketchim, smiling pallidly, "the little joker that
James inserted in the contract, about your getting fifty thousand in
the event of a favorable report.I told him it didn't look well--but
he said it would test you.He would be funny, though, no matter how
serious the business.Harris snickered; but Reed turned the conversation at once."We have
been studying how we could help you pull the thing out of the fire.Suppose you give us," he suggested, "a little of Molino's history."There isn't much to tell," replied Ketchim gloomily."The mines were
located by a man named Lakes, at one time acting-Consul at Cartagena.He came up to New York and interested
Bryan, Westler, and some others, and they asked us to act as fiscal
agents.""But you never had title to the property," said Reed."Because, on our way down the Magdalena river we made the acquaintance
of a certain Captain Pinal, of the Colombian army.When he learned
that we were mining men he told us he had a string of rich properties
that he would like to sell.I inquired their location, and he said
they lay along the Boque river.And I learned that he had clear title
to the property, too--Molino's mines.Now you have sold some three or
four hundred thousand dollars' worth of stock on alleged mines to
which you never had even the shadow of a claim!""But--" murmured Ketchim weakly, "we thought we had.We acted in good
faith--we took Mr.Lakes's word--and we showed our confidence and
sincerity by purchasing machinery to operate--"

"Oh, the machinery went down there, all right!""I judge it was designed to manufacture barrel staves, rather
than to extract gold!Lakes had it shipped to Cartagena; rented part
of an old woman's house; dumped the machinery in there; and now she's
wild.Can't get her pay from you for storing the machinery; and can't
sell the stuff, nor move it.So there she sits, under some six or
eight tons of iron junk, waiting for the Lord to perform a miracle!""But Molino has no
funds--"

"You are still selling stock, aren't you?""We would not sell any more stock
until we received your report--and not then, unless the report were
favorable.But the image of truth sat enthroned upon
Ketchim's sharp features."It is unfortunate, boys," the promoter continued dejectedly."But I
care nothing for my own losses; it's the poor stockholders I am
thinking about.I've prayed to be
led to do right."I suggest," blurted out Harris, "that, having already relieved them
considerably, you'll soon be wearing a striped suit!"The last trace of color faded from Ketchim's face, but the sickly
smile remained."I'd wear it, willingly, if by so doing I could help
these poor people," he mournfully replied."Well," pursued Harris, "it'll help some when they learn that you're
in one.""Boys," said Ketchim suddenly, quite disregarding the insinuation,
"to-morrow is Sunday, and I want you both out to dinner with me, and
we will talk this all over.Then in the afternoon I want you to come
over and see my little Sunday school.Fellows," he continued gravely,
"I've prayed for you and for your success every day since you left.And my faith in my Saviour is too great to be shattered now by your
adverse report.He certainly will show us a way out; and I can trust
him and wait."Reed and Harris looked at him and then at each other with puzzled
expressions on their faces.The man continued earnestly:

"Colombia is a rich and undeveloped country, you have said.There must
be other mineral properties available there.Did you see none on your
travels?Or could we not organize an exploration party to search for
mines?""Will your sheep stand for further shearing?""Fellows," said Ketchim, brightening and drawing his chair closer,
"you've got something--I know it!You've got something to suggest that
will save the Molino stockholders!""I shall sacrifice myself," answered Ketchim deprecatingly.His manner
had now become animated, and he leaned expectantly toward them.Reed and Harris again looked questioningly at each other."I guess we
might as well," said Reed in a low voice."It is bound to come out,
anyway.""Sure," returned Harris; "drive ahead."Ketchim," began Reed, turning to the eager, fidgeting man, "when
I came to New York a year ago, looking for a business opening, my
friend and former classmate in the University, Mr.Cass, put me in
touch with you.At that time you were booming the Molino company hard,
and, I have no doubt, thought you really had something down in
Colombia.But when you offered to lease me a portion of your
properties there, I laughed at you.And, in the course of time, I
succeeded in convincing you that you knew nothing whatsoever about the
properties on which you were selling so much stock.Then, after months
of parley, from an offer to permit me to go down to Colombia at my own
expense to examine Molino's mines, to ascertain whether or not I
wished to operate a part of them on a royalty basis, you adopted my
own view, namely, that the time had come for you to know whether the
company possessed anything of value or not.And so you sent my
associate, Mr.Harris, and myself down there to examine and report on
Molino's so-called mines.And you gave us each a block of stock as
part compensation.And now you have got to
face a body of stockholders from whom you have lured thousands of
dollars by your misrepresentations.From talks with your salesmen, I
am convinced that this body of stockholders is made up chiefly of
widows and indigent clergymen.""Which of my salesmen told you that?""Let us waive that," replied Reed calmly."The fact is, you are in a
hard way just at present, is it not so?""Fellows," said Ketchim, with an air of penitent humility, "the
officers and stockholders of the Molino Company have been grossly
deceived and unfortunately--"

"All right," interrupted Reed, "we'll pass that.But Harris and I have
played square with you.And we are going to continue to do so, and to
offer you a possible opportunity to do something for your poor
stockholders, and incidentally for yourself and us.The fact is, we do
know of another property down there, but we haven't the title--"

"That makes no difference!""I mean, it can be
acquired--" striving to restrain his eagerness."That's just the question," replied Reed."The title is at present
vested in a young Colombian girl, who, unfortunately, is lost.This
girl came up to the States with us--"

"Ha!"exclaimed Ketchim, unable longer to hold himself."Then you
broke your contract, for that stipulated that whatever you might
acquire there should belong to me!"I believe," put in Harris dryly, "we were employed by the Molino
company.""But my mother advanced the funds to send you down there!"queried Harris, with an insinuating
grin."I'm speaking for the stockholders, of course," said Ketchim,
subsiding."There is no likelihood that this poor girl will ever be heard of
again," continued Reed."Nor is it likely that the title papers, which
she has with her, will be of any use to those into whose hands she has
fallen.Her old foster-father held the title to this mine, but
transferred it to the girl, stipulating that she and I should divide a
large interest in the stock of a company formed to develop and operate
it.For my share, I agreed to bring the young girl to the States and
place her in a school, at my own expense."He went on to relate the
manner in which Carmen had been lost, and then continued: "Of course,
the title to this mine is registered in Cartagena, and in the girl's
name, as the old man gave me power to have that change made.But, now
that she is gone, the property naturally reverts to him.""No, that wouldn't be right to the old man," returned Reed."But, it
might be that the property could now be secured from him.He is old
and penniless, and without any further interest in life.It is a bare
chance, but we might prevail upon him to join us in the formation of a
company to take over his mine, La Libertad."asked Ketchim, reaching for a writing pad.Reed complied, and then continued: "Now, Mr.Ketchim, we are living
strictly up to the letter of our contract by giving you this
information.It would require not less than one hundred thousand
dollars, cash in hand, to acquire that mine, develop it, make trails,
and erect a stamp-mill.Harris and I are in no condition
financially to advance or secure such an amount.""It is barely possible," mused Harris, "that my father and Uncle John
could do something.""We don't have to call upon them!"Reed, in this mine already belongs to Molino, as you were acting under
contract with us--"

"I have covered that point, Mr."But
the time has come for us all to put our shoulders to the wheel, act
fairly with one another, help the Molino stockholders, and at the same
time make good ourselves.Harris and I have barely entered upon
our business careers, and we have come to New York to establish
ourselves.We know where this mine
is--we know the old man, and may be able to influence him.To
forestall possible complications, we should begin negotiations with
him at once.But--remember--everything must be done in the name of the
company, not in your own name.Harris and I must personally
negotiate with the old man, and receive a very liberal compensation
for our work."why didn't
you tell me this yesterday over the 'phone, and save me a night of
torment?Rawlins," he said, addressing
that individual, who had entered in response to the buzzer, "'phone
Cass to come right over.And tell Miss Honeywell to give you ten
dollars for our lunch, and charge it to Molino.Since the old man gave
you a share in the mine, Molino has property, after all!""Has it to get," amended Harris dubiously.cried Ketchim, rubbing his hands gleefully."But
now while waiting for Cass, tell me more about your trip.In the midst of the ensuing recital, Cass was announced; and Ketchim,
after detailing to him the previous conversation, launched into the
project which had been developing in his own mind while Reed had been
describing his experiences in the South."What we want is another organization, fellows," he said in
conclusion, "to take over the tottering Molino; purchase its assets
with stock; give Molino stockholders an opportunity to get in on the
ground floor, and so on.We'll let Molino die in the arms of a new
company, eh?""But one with a somewhat wider scope," suggested Cass, with an air of
importance."A sort of general development company, to secure La
Libertad, if possible; prospect for other mineral properties; and
develop the resources of the country.""Just so," assented Ketchim, with increasing enthusiasm."A company to
go in for coffee, cotton--you say you saw wild cotton, didn't you,
fellows?And cocoanuts, timber, cattle--in fact, we'll get
concessions from the Colombian Government, and we'll--"

"Just rip things wide open, eh?""Uncle Ted has influence at
Washington, with the Pan American Union, and so on--why, we can get
anything we want!Ames and the bank will both cool down--by Jove, this
is great!""But where's the cold and vulgar cash coming from to oil the wheels?""Oh, I can sell the stock," replied Ketchim."Then, too, there's the
Molino stockholders; why, I'll bet there's hardly one that wouldn't be
able to scrape up a few dollars more for the new company!By the way,
what'll we call it?"I'd call it the Salvation Company," drawled Harris, "as it is likely
to delay your trip to Sing Sing."A general laugh, in which Ketchim joined heartily, followed the
remark."I suggest we call it the Simiti Development Company," said Cass,
after a moment's dignified reflection."If these gentlemen can acquire that mine, I
think I would capitalize for, say, about three millions."He went to
the desk and made some calculations."I assume," he continued somewhat
pompously after a few moments' figuring, "that you wish to retain me,
and that I am to take my compensation in stock?"He knew that Cass had correctly concluded
that in no other way was he likely to be reimbursed.And, at best, it
was only a hazard, a wild gamble.In fact, it was a last desperate
chance.Moreover, stock was always available; while cash was a rare
commodity."Suppose, then," continued the sapient young lawyer, "that we
capitalize for three millions; set aside one million, five hundred and
one thousand as treasury stock, to be sold to raise money for
development purposes; transfer to the Ketchim Realty Company one
million, as compensation for acting as fiscal agents of the new
company; transfer to these two gentlemen, as part compensation for
past and future services, the sum of four hundred thousand in stock;
give to the stockholders of the Molino Company the sum of fifty-nine
thousand in stock for all the assets, machinery, good will, _et
cetera_, of that company; and to me, for services to be rendered,
forty thousand dollars' worth of the stock.All of us shall agree not
to sell any of our personal holdings of stock until the company shall
be placed upon a dividend-paying basis.Harris,
or both, will return to Colombia immediately to relocate the mine, and
prepare for its development, while the Ketchim Realty Company at once
endeavor to sell the treasury stock."Having delivered himself of this comprehensive plan, Cass settled back
in his chair and awaited remarks."Well," observed Ketchim at length, "that's all right--only, I think
we should be allowed to sell our personal stock if we wish.Of
course," with a deprecating wave of his hand, "there isn't the
slightest likelihood of our ever wanting to do that--with a mine such
as you have described, fellows."Not one dollar's worth of your stock shall you be permitted to sell!"cried Harris, bringing his fist down upon the desk."I suggest that we leave that for the Directors to decide later,"
offered Cass, anxious to avoid discord.He was young, scarcely out of
the twenties, just married, just admitted to the bar, and eager to get
a toe-hold in the world of business."And now," he concluded, "if
agreeable to you, I will put this through at once, organize the
company, and get the charter.You gentlemen will return to Colombia as
soon as Mr.Harris and I have formed an engineering partnership," said Reed."As such, we will handle the affairs of the new company in Colombia.Harris will proceed to that country, while I go to California to
open a copper mine which we have taken over there."I'll send Houghton and Nezlett out on the road to-morrow.Rawlins
has just told me of one prospect, a bully one!We don't need to
wait for the papers from Albany before going ahead.But we find it
costs about forty-eight cents to sell a dollar's worth of stock, and
so some time will be needed to raise enough to send Mr.Harris back
to Colombia--unless," he added, eying Harris furtively, "he will
advance us the amount of his own expenses--"

"Which he will not!""There's a revolution on down there now," said Reed, "and we'd better
go easy for a while.Besides, Harris needs time to study the language.But, are we all agreed on the terms?Salary for Harris while in
Colombia to be settled later, of course.""It's all satisfactory, I think," said Ketchim, smiling happily."The
details can be worked out anon--Molino stockholders' meeting, and so
on.""Then," said Reed, rising, "we will consider the new company launched,
to take over the defunct Molino and to operate on a comprehensive
scale in Colombia, beginning with the development of La Libertad, if
we can secure it."At that moment Rawlins opened the door and peered in.Reed," he announced softly; "a priest, I believe."The door swung open, and Father Waite
entered with Carmen.With a glad cry the girl dropped her bundle and bounded into the arms
of the astonished Harris.Reed grasped the priest's hand, and begged
him to speak.Ketchim and the young lawyer looked on in perplexity."I was unable to find your name in the city directory, Mr.Reed,"
explained the priest, his face beaming with happiness."But at police
headquarters I found that you had made inquiries, and that detectives
were searching for the girl.I learned that you were living with your
wife's sister, and that you had no business address, having just come
up from South America.So I telephoned to your sister-in-law, and your
wife informed me that you had an appointment this morning at this
office.I therefore came directly here with the girl, who, as you see,
is safe and sound, but with an additional interesting experience or
two to add to the large fund she already possessed."He looked down at
Carmen and smiled."And now," he concluded, laughing, as he prepared
to depart, "I will not ask for a receipt for the child, as I see I
have several witnesses to the fact that I have delivered her to the
proper custodian."cried Reed, seizing him by the hand.We
want to know you--"

"I will give you my card," replied the priest."And I would be very
happy, indeed, if some time again I might be permitted to see and talk
with the little girl."He handed his card to Reed; then nodded and
smiled at Carmen and went out.sputtered Harris, pushing the girl aside and making after
him.The priest had already caught a descending
elevator, and disappeared."I
guess that knocks the Simiti Company sky-high," he exclaimed, "for
here is the sole owner of La Libertad!"Ketchim collapsed into a chair, while Reed, saying that he would keep
his dinner engagement with Ketchim on the following day, picked up
Carmen's precious bundle and, taking her hand, left the room."I am
going home," he called back to Harris; "and you be sure to come up to
the house to-night.We'll have to readjust our plans now."CHAPTER 5


"Reed," said Harris the following day, as they sat in the dusty,
creaking car that was conveying them to their dinner appointment with
Ketchim, "who is this Ames that Ketchim referred to yesterday?"The men were not alone, for Carmen accompanied them.Reed was
reluctantly bringing her at the urgent request received from Ketchim
over the telephone the previous evening.But the girl, subdued by the
rush of events since her precipitation into the seething American
world of materialism, sat apart from them, gazing with rapt attention
through the begrimed window at the flying scenery, and trying to
interpret it in the light of her own tenacious views of life and the
universe.If the marvels of this new world into which she had been
thrown had failed to realize her expectations--if she saw in them, and
in the sense of life which they express, something less real, less
substantial, than do those who laud its grandeur and power to
charm--she gave no hint.She was still absorbing, sifting and
digesting the welter of impressions.She had been overpowered,
smothered by the innovation; and she now found her thoughts a tangled
jumble, which she strove incessantly to unravel and classify according
to their content of reality, as judged by her own standards."Why, Ames," replied Reed, turning a watchful eye upon Carmen, "is a
multimillionaire financier of New York--surely you have heard of him!He and his clique practically own the United States, and a large
slice of Europe.For some reason Ames bought a block of Molino stock.And now, I judge, Ketchim would give his chances on eternal life if he
hadn't sold it to him.And that's what's worrying me, too.For, since
Ames is heavily interested in Molino, what will he do to the new
company that absorbs it?""There isn't going to be any new company," asserted Harris doggedly."Ketchim holds us strictly to our
contract.Our negotiations with old Rosendo were made while in the
employ of Molino.It wouldn't be so bad if we had only Ketchim to deal
with.We've got the goods on him and could beat him.But here enters
Ames, a man of unlimited wealth and influence.If he wants La
Libertad, he's going to get it, you mark me!Where we fell down was in
ever mentioning it to Ketchim.For if we don't come over now he will
lay the whole affair before Ames.He told me over the 'phone last
night that he was badly in debt--that Ames was pressing him--that many
of the Molino stockholders were making pertinent inquiries.And yesterday I saw on his desk a letter from
Ames.Ketchim would sacrifice us and
everything else to keep himself out of Ames's grip.We're in for it, I
tell you!And all because we were a bit too previous in believing that
the girl had disappeared for good."exclaimed Harris, "but doesn't it sound like a fairy-tale,
the way Carmen got back to us?""And here I am," continued Reed, with a gesture of vexation, "left
with the girl on my hands, and with a very healthy prospect of losing
out all around.My wife said emphatically last night that she wouldn't
be bothered with Carmen.""But do you realize
that that involves expense?I'm a comparatively poor man, just getting
a start in my profession, and with a young and socially ambitious
wife!""But--your wife--er, she's going to--to have money some day, isn't
she?"But the grim reaper has a little work to do first.And on
occasions like this he's always deucedly deliberate, you know.Meantime, we're skating close to the edge--for New Yorkers.""Well, we may be able to beat Ketchim.Now, my father and Uncle
John--"

"Oh, shoot your father and Uncle John!"The conductor opened the door and bawled a cryptical announcement."This is the place," said Reed, starting up and making for the door."And now you rake your thought for some way to deal with Ketchim.And
leave your father and Uncle John entirely out of the conversation!"Ketchim was just bowing out a caller as the young engineers mounted
the steps.he exclaimed, after giving them a hearty
welcome."I just sold him a hundred shares of Simiti stock, at five
dollars a share--just half of par."But--" protested Harris, as they entered the spacious parlor, "the
company isn't even in existence yet--and hasn't an asset!""Oh, that's all right," replied Ketchim easily."It's coming into
existence, and will have the grandest mine in South America!Boys," he
went on earnestly, "I've been talking over the 'phone with Mr.Ames,
our most influential stockholder, and a very warm friend of mine.I
told him about our conversation of yesterday.He says, go right ahead
with the new company--that it's a great idea.He's satisfied with his
present holding, and will not increase it.Says he wants Molino
stockholders to have the opportunity to purchase all the treasury
stock, if they want to.""Decidedly magnanimous," returned Reed."But--what about the basis of
organization of the new company?""Leave it as we planned it, he says.He thinks the arrangement and
division of stock fine!"Reed and Harris looked at each other questioningly."But," went on Ketchim, "have you seen the morning papers?They are
full of the revolution in Colombia.The country is torn wide open,
and reports say nothing can be done down there until peace is
restored--and that may take a year or two.But, meantime, we will go
ahead and organize the new company and take over Molino and prepare
to begin work just as soon as you fellows can get into that country.And so this," going to
Carmen and taking her hand, "is the wonderful little girl!Ketchim and her troop of children at this
juncture interrupted the conversation."All enthusiastic Simiti
stockholders," said Ketchim, waving his hand toward them, after the
introductions."And all going to get rich out of it, too--as well as
yourselves, boys.It simply shows how Providence works--one with God
is a majority, always."Carmen glanced up at him wonderingly.Dinner over, the men were left alone.Carmen had been taken upstairs
by the children to the nursery."I've got myself slated for the presidency of the new company," said
Ketchim, plunging again into the subject nearest his heart; "and I
think we'd better put brother James in as vice-president.Perfectly
safe," looking at Harris and winking."He's got to be recognized, you
know, since the Ketchim Realty Company act as fiscal agents.Now for
directors I've put down Judge Harris, your father--that's to assure
you boys that there'll be some one to look after your interests.Then
we'll say Reverend Jurges for another.He's got a big congregation and
will be able to place a lot of stock.You just ought to see the letter
he wrote me about selling stock to his people!You'd never believe he
was a good, spiritually-minded clergyman, with an eye single to
heavenly riches!Then one of you fellows, say Reed, had better go on
the directorate, since Harris will be in Colombia in charge of
operations.He's young and immature, but
absolutely square.He'll do all the legal work for his stock interest."But what do I do while we are waiting?"asked Harris in some
perplexity."Reed goes to California right away, you know.""That's all right, old man," Ketchim genially assured him."The new
company will be organized at once--this week, if possible.You go on
salary from the moment of its incorporation, and you open your office
right here in this building.I'll see that the rent is paid until you
go back to Colombia.Everything's arranged, and you turn right in and
help Cass with the new company.You've got
to prepare circulars; write boosting letters to stockholders and
prospects; follow up leads; and--oh, you'll be busy!But here comes
Reverend Coles," looking out of the window as a man came up the steps."He's interested in some projects I've been exploiting.He hastened out to greet the visitor and conducted him into a back
room.Reed and Harris were left to the contemplation of their own
mixed thoughts.Presently Harris, whose eyes had been dilating
for some moments, broke out in a hoarse whisper: "Listen!God
a'mighty!--he's praying!"He got up softly and approached the door of the room into which
Ketchim had taken his caller.In a few minutes he returned to his
chair."I could see Ketchim through the
keyhole, on his knees by the bed, praying with that fellow!Through the silence that fell upon
them snatches of the prayer being offered in the adjoining room
floated to their ears--"O, blessed Saviour, vouchsafe prosperity to
our venture, we beseech thee!The earth is the Lord's, and the
fullness thereof--we ask thy blessing on these efforts of ours to
wrest from the ground the wealth which the Father of lights has
deposited there for the benefit of His children--"

Harris snickered aloud."It may not be a game," he replied."But if it is, it's an old one, hiding behind the mask of religion.But I'm inclined to believe the man sincere."I
know James to be an out-and-out rascal--he openly flies the black
flag.But this pious fellow--well, he's got me guessing!"The caller soon departed, and Ketchim again joined the young men."He's our assistant pastor," he said musingly, as he watched the man
go down the walk."Nice young fellow, waiting for a church.He and
some of his friends are interested in a zinc mine we've been floating,
down in the Joplin district."queried the cynical Harris, with a twinkle in his eyes."Oh, yes," Ketchim smiled affably.Lots of development work to be done, you know.And there's a lot of water in this mine.""And in the stock, too, eh?""We haven't struck the deposit yet, although we expect to soon.But,"
glancing up at the clock on the mantel, "we'll have to be going over
to Sunday school now.And I want that little girl to go with Marjorie.Fellows," the man's face became deeply serious, "I have no doubt you
are both church members?"Reed fidgeted uneasily under Ketchim's searching glance; but Harris
frankly met the question."Nope," he asserted, "we're both rank
heathen.And I'm a dyed-in-the-wool atheist."cried Ketchim, "how can you say that, when you see the
goodness of the Lord on every hand?""Reed, I believe," continued the imperturbable Harris, waving a hand
toward his friend, "has philosophical leanings--New Thought,
Subliminal Consciousness, Power in Silence, and all that."But surely you believe in the divinity of the Christ?""Well, as a matter of fact, I never gave it much thought," said
Harris."Ah, that's what so many say," replied Ketchim sadly; "and then comes
the awful voice of the Lord, 'This night thy soul shall be required of
thee!'Fellows, I want to pray for you; and I want you both to promise
me that you will take up seriously the consideration of your souls'
welfare.It's too grave a subject for jest," addressing himself
solemnly to the grinning Harris."All right, old man," laughed Harris."But don't dig up any
Presbyterian tracts for me.I've got a living witness to--well, to
something out of the ordinary, in that girl, Carmen, and I'm inclined
to believe she's dug nearer to bottom facts than any of you.So when
I'm ready to discuss my soul's welfare I'll just consult her, see?""That reminds me," said Ketchim, turning abruptly to Reed, "what do
you intend to do with the girl?""_Quien sabe?_" Reed answered abstractedly."Send her to a boarding
school, I guess.At least, that's what I told the old man I'd do.""So you said before," Ketchim returned.My daughter Marjorie leaves Tuesday
for Conway-on-the-Hudson, where she has been attending Madam Elwin's
Select School for Girls.Suppose you go with her--I'm too busy,
myself--and take Carmen.It's only a few hours' ride by boat down the
river.This is Marjorie's third year
there, and she's simply in love with it."Reed began to show signs of interest; and Ketchim, noting the effect
of his words, went on briskly:

"Now look here, Molino owes its salvation, and the new company its
existence, to that girl.Why shouldn't they do something to show their
gratitude?I say, it is no more than right that the new company should
support her while she is in school."not a half-bad idea," commented Harris."Certainly not," continued Ketchim earnestly."Now fix up everything
with her as regards the transfer of the mine to the new company, and
then let her go with Marjorie to the Elwin school.We can, if you
like, make some agreement with her to the effect that when the company
is on its feet and she is receiving dividends, she shall return what
it may advance for her schooling, eh?""You'd better accept the suggestion, Reed," put in Harris."I'll be
here, you know, to keep an eye on the girl; and I'll take her and
Marjorie down to Conway myself, and attend to getting her located
right."He was hardly in a position to refuse such
an offer.Besides, he was really leaving her in charge of Harris."Well," he said at length, "in that case I could leave for California
to-morrow night.That matter is pressing hard--all right, I accept the
company's offer.It's no more than is due the girl, anyway.""I'll make the necessary arrangements at
once.Thus it was that two days later Carmen, still wondering if she was
dreaming, was enrolled in the Elwin Select School for Girls, with
Marjorie Ketchim for roommate; while Reed, on the Overland Limited,
hurrying to the far West, was musing dubiously at frequent intervals
on Ketchim's rather conflicting statements, which, until left to this
enforced leisure, he had not had time to try to reconcile.At the same
time, while Harris was loudly declaiming to the gracious Madam Elwin
on the astonishing mental prowess of the girl, Ketchim and Cass sat
deeply immersed in the tentative plans for the newly-projected Simiti
Development Company."Now listen," said Ketchim, who for some minutes had been quietly
scanning his youthful lawyer, "Ames knows nothing about the formation
of this company, but Harris and Reed are not to know that; and we're
going to keep Ames in ignorance of all our plans.With the first sales
of stock--and they've already begun--we'll return him his Molino
investment.Nezlett wired me this morning that he's sure to sell a big
block to the Leveridges, that they're mightily interested, and want to
meet Carmen.We'll use the girl for just such purposes.That's one
reason why I wanted her handy, so's we could reach her at any time.She makes a star impression; and with her as an advertisement we'll
sell a million dollars' worth of stock, and no trouble at all!She's
got that honest look that's convincing.And she can tell a story that
beats the Arabian Nights!Ames has given me a week to explain, or make
good his investment.By that time we'll have the Leveridges sold for
twice his investment, and we'll just pay him off and remove him.Meantime, you go over to the bank in the morning and put up the best
line of talk you're capable of.I've got sixteen hundred dollars to
give 'em on that note; and that'll secure more time, until the sales
of stock are enough to pay it all up.Perhaps Uncle Ted will advance
me enough to take up the note when he hears about La Libertad.And,
say, you see brother James, and shake the club over him until he
disgorges that check he got from Miss Leveridge.You can hand him a
scare that he won't get over.things have taken a
great turn, eh?Why, I can just see Simiti stock sales humping these
next few months.Oh, Miss Honeywell," calling to his cashier, "bring
me five dollars, please, and charge it to Molino--I mean, to Simiti.Then, again addressing Cass: "Come
with me to the football game this afternoon.We can discuss plans
there as well as here.Gee whiz, but I feel great!"CHAPTER 6


Carmen's rapid transition from the eternal solitudes of Guamoco to the
whirring activities of New York was like a plunge into the maelstrom,
and left her groping blindly in the effort to adapt herself to the
changed order.There was little in her former mode of existence that
could be transferred to her new environment, and she felt that she was
starting life like a new-born babe.For days, even weeks, she moved
about dreamily, absorbed, ceaselessly striving to orient herself and
to accept easily and naturally the marvels, the sudden accession of
material aids, and the wonders of this modern, complex civilization,
so common to her associates, but scarcely even dreamed of by her in
her former home, despite the preparation which Jose had tried to give
her.The Elwin school was small, its student-body seldom numbering
more than fifty, and in it Carmen found herself hedged about by
restrictions which in a way were beneficial, in that they narrowed her
environment and afforded her time for her slow adjustment to it.But if these restrictions aided her, they also rendered the length of
her stay in the school almost calculable.Little by little the girl
saw the forces developing which she knew must effect her dismissal;
little by little, as Madam Elwin's manner toward her became less
gracious, and her schoolmates made fewer efforts to conceal from her
the fact that she was not one of them, Carmen prepared for the
inevitable.Six months after the girl's enrollment, Madam Elwin
terminated her series of disparaging reports to Ketchim by a request
that he come at once and remove his charge from the school.Ketchim, the girl is a paradox.And
after these months of disappointing effort to instruct her, I am
forced to throw up my hands in despair and send for you."Madam Elwin
tapped nervously with a dainty finger upon the desk before her."But, if I may be permitted the question, what specific reasons have
you, Madam, for--ah, for requesting her removal?"William Jurges, who, having come up to the city to
attend a meeting of the directors of the Simiti company, had accepted
Ketchim's invitation to first accompany him on his flying trip to
Conway-on-the-Hudson, in response to Madam Elwin's peremptory
summons."Because," replied that worthy personage with a show of exasperation, "I
consider her influence upon the young ladies here quite detrimental.Our school, while non-sectarian, is at least Christian.Where she got her views, I can not imagine.At first she made
frequent mention of a Catholic priest, who taught her in her home town,
in South America.But of late she has grown very reserved--I might say,
sullen, and talks but little.Her views, however, are certainly not
Catholic.She refuses to
accept a large part of our instruction.Her answers to examination
questions are wholly in accord with her peculiar views, and hence quite
apart from the texts.For that reason she fails to make any grades,
excepting in mathematics and the languages.She utterly refuses to
accept any religious instruction whatsoever.She would not be called
atheistic, for she talks--or used to at first--continually about God.But her God is not the God of the Scriptures, Dr.She is a
free-thinker, in the strictest sense.And as such, we can not
consent to her remaining longer with us.""Ah--quite so, Madam, quite so," returned the clergyman, in his
unconsciously pompous manner."Doubtless the child's thought
became--ah--contaminated ere she was placed in your care.But--ah--I
have heard so much from our good friend, Mr.Ketchim, regarding this
young girl, that--ah--I should like exceedingly to see and talk with
her--if it might be--ah--"

"Madam Elwin will arrange that, I am sure," interposed Ketchim."Suppose," he suggested, addressing the lady, "we let him talk with
her, while I discuss with you our recently acquired mine in South
America, and the advisability of an investment with us.""Certainly," acquiesced Madam Elwin, rising and pressing one of the
several buttons in the desk."Bring Miss Carmen," she directed, to the
maid who answered the summons.Jurges; "but may I go to her?Ah--it
would doubtless be less embarrassing for the child.""Miss Carmen was in the chapel a few moments ago," volunteered the
maid."Then take the doctor there," returned Madam Elwin, with a gesture of
dismissal.At the head of the stairway the mingled sounds of a human voice and
the soft, trembling notes of an organ drifted through the long hall
and fell upon the ears of the clergyman."Miss Carmen," said the maid, answering his unspoken thought."She
often comes up to the chapel and sings for hours at a time--alone.The
chapel is down there," pointing to the end of the hall."Then--ah--leave me," said the doctor.The maid turned willingly and went below, while the man tiptoed to
the chapel door.The girl was
singing in Spanish, and he could not understand the words.But they
would have meant nothing to him then.It was the voice upon which
they were borne that held him.The song was a weird lament that had
come down to the children of Simiti from the hard days of the
_Conquistadores_.It voiced the untold wrongs of the Indian slaves;
its sad, unvarying minor echoed their smothered moans under the
cruel goad; on the plaintive melody of the repeated chorus their
piteous cries were carried to heaven's deaf ears; their dull despair
floated up on the wailing tones of the little organ, and then died
away, as died the hope of the innocent victims of Spanish lust.The reverend doctor had never heard a song of that kind before.Nor
could he readily associate the voice, which again and again he could
not distinguish from the flute-like tones of the organ, with the
sordidness and grime of material, fleshly existence.He entered softly
and took a seat in the shadow of a pillar.The clear, sweet voice of
the young girl flowed over him like celestial balm.Some were dreamy bits and snatches in Spanish and English;
others were sacred in character.He wondered deeply, as the girl mused
over these; yet he knew not that they were her own compositions.Curiosity and uncertainty mastered him at length, and he got softly to
his feet and moved away from the pillar, that he might see from what
manner of being issued such unbroken harmony.But in his eagerness his
foot struck a chair, and the sound echoed loudly through the room.The music abruptly ceased, and the girl rose and looked over the organ
at the intruder."I--I beg your pardon," said the clergyman, advancing in some
embarrassment."I was listening to your singing--uninvited, but none
the less appreciative.I--"

"Wait, please!"cried the girl, hastily stooping over and fumbling
with her shoes.The doctor laughed genially, as he grasped the
situation."I took them off," she explained hurriedly."I am not yet accustomed
to them.I never wore shoes until I left Simiti."Her face was
scarlet, and she tried to cover her confusion with a little laugh.The doctor stood staring at her, lost in admiration of the shapely
figure, the heavy, curling hair, and the wonderfully expressive face.The girl quickly recovered her poise and returned him a frank smile.she said, after waiting in vain for him to
begin."Ah--a--yes, certainly--that is, I beg your pardon," stammered the
doctor."I did request permission of Madam Elwin to make your
acquaintance.I am Doctor Jurges, an
Episcopal clergyman."His sentences issued like blasts from an engine
exhaust."I am Carmen Ariza," said the girl, extending her hand."Ah--quite so, quite so," blustered the doctor, clearing his throat
noisily.Ah--ah--you have a remarkable voice.And my poor organ-playing is what I have
picked up myself these six months."The girl looked up into his face searchingly."Why," she asked,
"should every one up here think it remarkable when a human mind is
clear enough to be a transparency for God?"Had the roof fallen, the excellent doctor could have been no more
startled.He cleared his throat violently again; then fumbled
nervously in his pocket and drew out his glasses.These he poised upon
the ample arch of his ecclesiastical nose, and through them turned a
penetrating glance upon the girl.yes," said he at length; "quite so, quite so!And--ah--Miss
Carmen, that brings us to the matter in question--your religious
instruction--ah--may I ask from whom you received it?""From God," was the immediate and frank reply.The clergyman started, but quickly recovered his equipoise.But--your religious views--I believe they are not
considered--ah--quite evangelical, are they?By your present
associates, that is.""No," she replied, with a trace of sadness in her tone."But," looking
up with a queer little smile, "I am not persecuting them for that.""Oh, no," with a jerky little laugh.I judge the
persecution has come from the other side, has it not?""We will not speak of that," she said quickly."They do not
understand--that is all."no, quite so--that is--ah--may I ask why you think they do not
understand?"If that which I believe is not true," the girl replied evenly, "it
will fail under the test of demonstration.Their beliefs have long
since failed under such test--and yet they still cling jealously to
them, and try to force them upon all who disagree with them.I am a
heretic, Doctor.""H'm--ah--yes, I see.But--it is a quite unfortunate characteristic
of mankind to attribute one's views indiscriminately to the
Almighty--and--ah--I regret to note that you are not wholly free from
this error.""You do not understand, I think," she quickly returned."I put every
view, every thought, every idea to the test.If good is the result, I
know that the thought or idea comes from the source of all good, God.The views I hold are those which I have time and again tested--and
some of them have withstood trials which I think you would regard as
unusually severe."Her thought had rested momentarily upon her vivid
experience in Banco, the dangers which had menaced her in distant
Simiti, and the fire through which she had passed in her first hours
in Christian America, the land of churches, sects, and creeds.the worthy doctor mused, regarding the girl first through his
spectacles, and then over the tops of them, while his bushy eyebrows
moved up and down with such comicality that Carmen could scarcely
refrain from laughing.Ah--suppose you relate to me
some of the tests to which your views have been subjected.""No," she returned firmly; "those experiences were only states of
consciousness, which are now past and gone forever.Why go back now and give them the
appearance of reality?"H'm--then you do not regard untoward experience as given us
by God for the testing of our faith, I take it."Carmen turned her head away with a little sigh of weariness."I
think," she said slowly, "I think we had better not talk about these
things, Doctor."Why--ah," blustered the clergyman, assuming a more paternal air,
"we--ah--would not for a moment cause you embarrassment, Miss Carmen!But--in fact, Madam Elwin has--ah--expressed her disapproval of your
views--your religious ideals, if I may put it so baldly, and she--that
is--the good lady regrets--"

"She wishes to be rid of me, you mean, Doctor?"said the girl,
turning and stretching a mental hand to the sinking divine.well, hardly so--ah--so--"

"Doctor," said the girl calmly, "I know it, and I wish to go.I have
been waiting only to see the way open.I do not wish to remain longer
in an atmosphere where ignorance and false belief stifle all real
progress."The doctor turned another look of astonishment upon her.He had
forgotten that he had not been talking with one of his own age.But if her clear mental gaze
penetrated the ecclesiastical mask and surmounted the theological
assumptions of her interlocutor, enabling her to get close to the
heart of the man, she did not indicate it further."I am nearly
sixteen," was her only reply."Ah," he reflected, "just a child!My dear girl," he continued, laying
a hand indulgently upon hers, "I will advise with Madam Elwin, and
will endeavor to convince her that--ah--that your spiritual welfare,
if I may so put it, requires that you be not turned adrift at this
critical, transitorial period of your life.We must all be patient,
while we strive to counteract the--ah--the pernicious teaching to
which you were exposed before--ah--before becoming enrolled in this
excellent school."Carmen looked at him steadily for a moment before replying.There was
something of pity in the expression of her beautiful face, of tender
sympathy for those who seek the light, and who must some day find it,
but whose progress is as yet hampered by the human mind's unreasoning
adherence to the stepping-stones over which it has been passing
through the dark waters of ignorance."Then, Doctor," she said calmly,
"you know what I have been taught?""Why--ah--yes--that is, vaguely.He was beginning to be sensible of having passed judgment upon the
girl without first according her a hearing."Well," she smiled up at him, "I have been taught the very hardest
thing in the whole world."He again clutched at his mental poise.But--ah--is it not the function of all our schools to teach
us to think?""No," answered the girl decidedly; "not to teach us to think, but to
cause us blindly to accept what is ignorantly called 'authority'!I
find we are not to reason, and particularly about religious matters,
but to accept, to let those 'in authority' think for us.Are you not even now seeking to make me accept your religious views?Oh, no; but because you believe them
true--whether they are or not.Do your religious views rest upon anything
but the human mind's undemonstrated interpretation of the Bible?And
yet you can not prove that interpretation true, even though you would
force it upon such as I, who may differ from you.""I--ah--" began the doctor nervously.But Carmen continued without
heeding the interruption:

"Only yesterday Professor Bales, of the University, lectured here on
'The Prime Function of Education.'He said it was the development of
the individual, and that the chief end of educational work was the
promotion of originality.And yet, when I think along original
lines--when I depart from stereotyped formulae, and state boldly that I
will not accept any religion, be it Presbyterian, Methodist, or Roman
Catholic, that makes a God of spirit the creator of a man of flesh, or
that makes evil as real as good, and therefore necessarily created and
recognized by a God who by very necessity can not know evil--then I am
accused of being a heretic, a free-thinker; and the authorities take
steps to remove me, lest my influence contaminate the rest of the
pupils!""H'm--ah--yes, quite so--that is--I think--"

"Do you, a preacher, think?""Or do you
only _think_ that you think?Do you still believe with the world that
the passing of a stream of human thought, or a series of mental
pictures, through your mentality constitutes _real_ thinking?Do you
believe that jumping from one human mental concept to another
twenty-four hours a day constitutes thinking?Have you yet learned to
distinguish between God's thoughts and their opposites, human
thoughts?Have you a real, working,
demonstrable knowledge of Christianity?Do you heal the sick, raise
the dead, and preach the truth that sets men free from the mesmerism
of evil?If so, then you are unevangelical, too, and you and I are
both heretics, and we'd better--we'd better leave this building at
once, for I find that the Inquisition is still alive, even in
America!"Her face was flushed, and her
whole body quivered with emotion.Why, my dear young lady, this is a Christian
nation!""Then," said the girl, "you have still much to learn from the pagan
nations that have gone before."exclaimed the doctor, again adjusting his glasses
that he might see her more clearly."My dear child, you have been
thinking too much, and too seriously.""No, Doctor," she replied; "but you preachers have not been thinking
enough, nor even half seriously.Oh," she went on, while her eyes grew
moist, and ever and again her throat filled, "I had expected so much
in this great country!And I have found so little--so little that is
not wholly material, mechanical, and unreal!I had imagined that, with
all your learning and progress, which Padre Jose told me about, you
would know God much better than we in the darkened South.But your god
is matter, machinery, business, gold, and the unreal things that can
be bought with money.Some one wrote, in a recent newspaper, that
America's god was'mud and mammon!'What do I find the girls here in
this school talking about but dress, and society, and the unreal,
passing pleasures of the physical senses!There are religious services here every
Sunday, and sermons by preachers who come down from the city.Sometimes a Baptist; sometimes a Presbyterian; and sometimes an
Episcopalian, or a Methodist.Each has a different concept of God; yet they all believe
Him the creator of a man of flesh and bones, a man who was originally
made perfect, but who fell, and was then cursed by the good and
perfect God who made him.Oh, what childish views for men to hold and
preach!How could a good God create anything that could fall?And if
He could, and did, then He knew in advance that the man would fall,
and so God becomes responsible, not man.Oh, Doctor, is it possible
that you believe such stuff?Is it any
wonder that, holding such awful views, you preachers have no longer
the power to heal the sick?Do you not know that, in order to heal the
sick, one must become spiritually-minded?But no one who holds to the
puerile material beliefs embraced in your orthodox theology can
possibly be spiritual enough to do the works Jesus said we should all
do if we followed him--really understood him.""My dear child--you really are quite inconsistent--you--"

"Inconsistent!What a charge for an orthodox preacher to bring!Let us
see: You say that the Scriptures teach that God made man in His image
and likeness--the image and likeness of spirit.Spirit,
God, is eternal, immortal.Then while He exists can His image fade
away, or die?Can or would God cause it to do so?Can or would He
destroy His own reflection?And could that image, always being like
Him, ever change, or manifest sin, or disease, or evil, unless God
first manifested these things?And if God did manifest them, then,
perforce, the image would _have_ to do likewise.But, in that case,
could God justly punish His image for faithfully reflecting its
original?Oh, it is you preachers, lacking sufficient
spirituality to correctly interpret the Scriptures, who are wildly,
childishly, ignorantly inconsistent!"Carmen rose and faced the clergyman."I did not mean to condemn
you, Doctor," she said earnestly."I wage no warfare with persons
or things.My opposition is directed only against the entrenched human
thought that makes men spiritually blind and holds them in the
mesmeric chains of evil.I am young, as you reckon years, but I
have had much experience in the realm of thought--and it is there
that all experience is wrought out before it becomes externalized.I have told you, my teacher was God.He used as a channel a priest,
who came years ago to my little home town of Simiti, in far-off
Colombia.His life had been wrecked by holding to the belief of
evil as a power, real and intelligent.He began to see the light; but
he did not overcome fear sufficiently to make his demonstration and
break the imaginary bonds which held him.He saw, but he did not
prove.And, Doctor, you and everybody else will
have to do the same.For, unless Jesus uttered the most malicious
falsehoods ever voiced, every human being will have to take every
step that he took, make every demonstration that he made, and prove
all that he proved, before mortals will cease to consume with
disease, perish miserably in accidents, and sink with broken lives
into graves that do _not_ afford a gateway to immortal life!My God is
infinite, eternal, unchanging mind.The god of the preachers,
judging from their sermons preached here, is a human, mental
concept, embodying spirit and matter, knowing good and evil, and
changing with every caprice of their own unstable mentalities.My
religion is the Christianity of the Master, love.Oh, how this poor
world needs it, yearns for it!The love that demonstrates the
nothingness of evil, and drives it out of human experience!The love
that heals the sick, raises the dead, binds up broken hearts!The
love that will not quench the religious instincts of children, and
falsely educate them to know all manner of evil; but that teaches
them to recognize it for what it is, the lie about God, and then
shows them how to overcome it, even as Jesus did.Then all is spirit and
spirit's manifestation--is it not true?What, then, becomes of the
evil that men hug to their bosoms, even while it gnaws into their
hearts?It is the opposite of good, of mind, of truth, God.And
the opposite of truth is supposition.And you can put it out
whenever you are willing to drop your ceremonials and your theories,
and will open your mentality to truth, which will make you free,
even as the Master said.Those are
the religious views which you have been sent by Madam Elwin to
investigate.She waited a few moments for the doctor to reply.Then, as he remained
silent, she went up to him and held out her hand."You do not care to talk with me longer, I think," she said.But, as regards Madam Elwin's wishes, you may tell
her that I shall leave the school.""Have you--have you been fitting yourself for any--ah--particular
work--ah--for your support, that is?"inquired the doctor gravely, as
he took the proffered hand.He had been swept off his feet by the
girl's conversation, and he had not the temerity to combat her views."I have been working daily to gain a better
understanding of the teachings of Jesus, and through them, of God.My
single aim has been to acquire 'that mind which was in Christ Jesus.'And I have no other business than to reflect it to my fellow-men in a
life of service.That is my Father's business, and I am working with
Him.My mission in this world is to manifest God.I am going out now
to do that, and _to show what love will do_.God will use me, and He
will supply my every need.She turned abruptly from him and went to the organ.Soon the same song
which he had heard as he entered the room rose again through the
stillness.He started toward
the girl; checked himself; and stood hesitating.Then his lips set,
and he turned and walked slowly from the room.In the hall two women were approaching, and as they drew near he
recognized one of them."Why," he exclaimed with enthusiasm, holding out both hands, "my dear
Mrs.It is not so long since we met at the Weston's.But what, may I ask, brings you here?"We have come to,
make a duty call on Mr.Reed's protegee, the little South American
savage, you know.Madam Elwin said she was up here with you?""Ah, yes, quite so--er, in the chapel, I believe," said the clergyman,
his face becoming suddenly grave."I would return with you, but my
time is--ah--so limited."He bowed low, with his hand in the breast of
his long frock coat, and passed on down the hall.As the women approached the door of the chapel through which came
Carmen's low singing they turned and looked at each other inquiringly.Then they quietly entered the doorway and stood listening.Carmen,
concealed behind the organ, did not see them.Hawley-Crowles went quickly to the organ.Bending over it, she gazed down into the face of the startled girl."Get up and let me see what sort of a
looking creature you are."Reed came forward and gave her a tempered
greeting.Hawley-Crowles fell back and stared at the girl
from head to foot."You know," she said to her sister, "this is the
first glimpse I've had of your husband's discovery.I was out of the
city when he brought her to my house, you remember.But," turning
again to Carmen, "sing that song over, dear, please--the one you were
singing just now."Carmen seated herself again at the organ, and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles drew
her sister to the rear of the room."It will sound better back here,"
she explained.After the lapse of a few minutes she turned to Mrs."Belle," she
said, nodding her head sententiously, "you had a pearl, and you threw
it away.Her voice, and her
face--why, with our ward--this beautiful, gifted, South American owner
of a famous mine--as a lever, we can force the Beaubien to bring the
Ames to our terms!Meantime, the dainty Madam Elwin and the amiable Doctor Jurges in the
office below had reached a conclusion."A young lady of--ah--invincible
will," the doctor had observed; "and already--ah--decidedly mature,
despite her tender years.Should she--ah--assume leadership over the
pupils of your school, my dear Madam Elwin, the result might be
disquieting.There can be no question as to her religious views, as I
have said.But, what astonishes me is--ah--that this strange cult
should have its devotees even in the wilds of tropical America!The girl is utterly--ah--unevangelical,
Madam; and the advisability of removing her from the school can not be
questioned."By all means," asserted the latter gentleman with great seriousness,
while his eyes dwelt tenderly upon Madam Elwin's written order for a
hundred shares of Simiti stock which he held in his hand."Very well, then," said the lady with a determined nod of her head; "I
shall request Mrs.Then, with a proper sense
of what it meant to have the moral support of such an eminent divine
as Doctor Jurges, she rang for her maid and bade her summon Mrs.Thus it was that Carmen was again shifted a space on the checkerboard
of life, and slept that night once more under the spacious roof of the
wealthy relict of the late James Hawley-Crowles, on Riverside Drive.CHAPTER 7


As has been said, Carmen's six months in the Elwin school had been a
period of slow adjustment to the changed order.She had brought into
this new world a charm of unsophistication, an ingenuous _naivete_,
such as only an untrammeled spirit nourished in an elemental
civilization like that of primitive Simiti could develop.Added to
this was the zest and eagerness stimulated by the thought that she had
come as a message-bearer to a people with a great need.Her first
emotion had been that of astonishment that the dwellers in the great
States were not so different, after all, from those of her own
unprogressive country.Her next was one of sad disillusionment, as the
fact slowly dawned upon her trusting thought that the busy denizens of
her new environment took no interest whatsoever in her message.And
then her joy and brilliant hopefulness had chilled, and she awoke to
find her strange views a barrier between herself and her associates.She had brought to the America of the North a spirit so deeply
religious as to know naught else than her God and His ceaseless
manifestation.She had come utterly free of dogma or creed, and
happily ignorant of decaying formularies and religious caste.Her
Christianity was her demonstrable interpretation of the Master's
words; and her fresh, ebulliant spirit soared unhampered in the warm
atmosphere of love for mankind.Her concept of the Christ stirred no
thought within her of intolerance toward those who might hold
differing views; nor did it raise interposing barriers within her own
mind, nor evoke those baser sentiments which have so sadly warped the
souls of men into instruments of deadly hatred and crushing tyranny.Her spiritual vision, undimmed and world-embracing, saw the advent of
that day when all mankind would obey the commands of Jesus, and do the
works which he did, even to the complete spiritualization and
dematerializing of all human thought.And her burning desire was to
hasten the coming of that glad hour.The conviction that, despite its tremendous needs, humanity was
steadily rejecting, even in this great land of opportunity and
progress, the remedy for its consuming ills, came to her slowly.And
with it a damping of her ardor, and a dulling of the fine edge of her
enthusiasm.She grew quiet as the days passed, and drew away from her
companions into her thought.With her increasing sense of isolation
came at length a great longing to leave these inhospitable shores, and
return to her native environment and the sympathy and tender
solicitude of her beloved Rosendo and Padre Jose.Indeed, she could not be certain now of their
whereabouts.A great war was raging in Colombia, and she knew not what
fate had befallen her loved ones.To her many letters directed to
Simiti there had come back no reply.Even Harris, who had written
again and again to both Rosendo and Jose, had received no word from
them in return.Corroding fear began to assail the girl; soul-longing
and heart-sickness seized upon her; her happy smile faded; and her
bright, bubbling conversation ceased.Then one day, standing alone in her room, she turned squarely upon the
foul brood of evil suggestions crowding upon her and, as if they were
fell spirits from the nether world, bade them begone."I know you for what you are--_nothing_!You seemed to
use Padre Jose, but you can't use me!He is my life; and you, evil thoughts, can't make me think He isn't!I
am His image and likeness; I am His witness; and I will _not_ witness
to His opposite, evil!My life is filled with harmony; and you, evil
thoughts, can't reverse that fact!God has brought me here, else I
would not have come, for He is the cause of all that is.It is for me
to stand and see His glory.as she paced about the room and
seemed to ward off the assaults of an invisible enemy, "there is no
power apart from Him!Then, in the lull of battle, "Father divine, I thank Thee that Thou
hast heard me.And now I lay my all upon the altar of love, and throw
myself upon Thy thought."From that day, despite continued attacks from error--despite, too, the
veiled slights and covert insinuations of her schoolmates, to whom the
girl's odd views and utter refusal to share their accustomed
conversation, their interest in mundane affairs, their social
aspirations and worldly ambitions, at length made her quite
unwelcome--Carmen steadily, and without heed of diverting gesture,
brought into captivity every thought to the obedience of her
Christ-principle, and threw off for all time the dark cloud of
pessimism which human belief and the mesmerism of events had drawn
over her joyous spirit.Reed had not been near her since her enrollment in the school;
but Ketchim had visited her often--not, however, alone, but always
with one or more prospective purchasers of Simiti stock in tow whom
he sought to influence favorably through Carmen's interesting
conversation about her native land.Harris came every Sunday, and
the girl welcomed the great, blundering fellow as the coming of the
day.At times he would obtain Madam Elwin's permission to take the
girl up to the city on a little sight-seeing expedition, and then he
would abandon himself completely to the enjoyment of her naive wonder
and the numberless and often piquant questions stimulated by it.He
was the only one now with whom she felt any degree of freedom, and
in his presence her restraint vanished and her airy gaiety again
welled forth with all its wonted fervor.Once, shortly after Carmen
had been enrolled, Harris took her to a concert by the New York
Symphony Orchestra.But in the midst of the program, after sitting
in silent rapture, the girl suddenly burst into tears and begged to be
taken out.she sobbed as, outside the door,
she hid her tear-stained face in his coat; "I just couldn't!Oh, it was God that we heard--it was God!"And the
astonished fellow respected this sudden outburst of pent-up emotion
as he led her, silent and absorbed, back to the school.With the throwing of the girl upon her own thought came a rapid
expansion of both mind and body into maturity, and the young lady who
left the Elwin school that bright spring afternoon under the
protection of the self-sufficient Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was very far
from being the inquisitive, unabashed little girl who had so
greatly shocked the good Sister Superior by her heretical views
some six months before.The sophistication engendered by her
intercourse with the pupils and instructors in the school had
transformed the eager, trusting little maid, who could see only good
into a mature woman, who, though her trust remained unshaken,
nevertheless had a better understanding of the seeming power "that
lusteth against the spirit," and whose idea of her mission had been
deepened into a grave sense of responsibility.She saw now, as never
before, the awful unreality of the human sense of life; but she
likewise understood, as never previously, its seeming reality in
the human consciousness, and its terrible mesmeric power over
those materialistic minds into which the light of spirituality had as
yet scarcely penetrated.Her thought had begun to shape a definite
purpose; she was still to be a message-bearer, but the message must be
set forth in her life conduct.The futility of promiscuous verbal
delivery of the message to whomsoever might cross her path had
been made patent.She must do
likewise, and let her deeds attest the truth of her words.And from
the day that she bade the suggestions of fear and evil leave her,
she had consecrated herself anew to a searching study of the
Master's life and words, if happily she might acquire "that mind"
which he so wondrously expressed.But the assumption of an attitude of quiet demonstration was by no
means sudden.There were times when she could not restrain the impulse
to challenge the beliefs so authoritatively set forth by the preachers
and lecturers whom Madam Elwin invited to address her pupils, and who,
unlike Jesus, first taught, and then relegated their proofs to a life
beyond the grave.Once, shortly after entering the school, forgetful
of all but the error being preached, she had risen in the midst of an
eloquent sermon by the eminent Darius Borwell, a Presbyterian divine
of considerable repute, and asked him why it was that, as he seemed to
set forth, God had changed His mind after creating spiritual man, and
had created a man of dust.She had later repented her scandalous
conduct in sackcloth and ashes; but it did not prevent her from
abruptly leaving the chapel on a subsequent Sunday when another
divine, this time a complaisant Methodist, quite satisfied with his
theories of endless future rewards and fiery punishments, dwelt at
length upon the traditional idea that the sorrows of the world are
God-sent for mankind's chastisement and discipline.Then she gradually learned to be less defiant of the conventions and
beliefs of the day, and determined quietly to rise superior to them.But her experience with the preachers wrought within her a strong
determination henceforth to listen to no religious propaganda
whatsoever, to give no further heed to current theological beliefs,
and to enter no church edifice, regardless of the tenets of the sect
worshiping within its precincts.The wisdom of this decision she left
for the future to determine."Oh," she cried, "my only mission is to manifest the divine, not to
waste time listening to the theories of ignorant preachers, who fail
utterly to prove the truth of their teachings!Oh, how the world needs
love--just love!And I am going to love it with the selfless love that
comes from God, and destroys error and the false beliefs that become
externalized in the human consciousness as sickness, failure, old
age, and death!Love, love, love--it is mankind's greatest need!Why,
if the preachers only knew, the very heart and soul of Christianity is
love!It is love that casts out fear; and fear is at the bottom of all
sickness, for fear leads to belief in other gods than the one Father
of Christ Jesus!Oh, God--take me
out into the world, and let me show it what love can do!"And the divine ear heard the call of this beautiful disciple of the
Christ--aye, had heard it long before the solicitous, fluttering
little Madam Elwin decided that the strange girl's unevangelical views
were inimical to the best interests of her very select school.Hawley-Crowles threw wide the
portals of the world to Carmen, and she entered, wide-eyed and
wondering.Nor did she return until the deepest recesses of the human
mind had revealed to her their abysmal hideousness, their ghastly
emptiness of reality, and their woeful mesmeric deception.James Hawley-Crowles, more keenly perceptive than her sister, had
seized upon Carmen with avidity bred of hope long deferred.The
scourge of years of fruitless social striving had rendered her
desperate, and she would have staged a ballet on her dining table,
with her own ample self as _premiere danseuse_, did the attraction but
promise recognition from the blase members of fashionable New York's
ultra-conservative set.From childhood she had looked eagerly forward
through the years with an eye single to such recognition as life's
desideratum.To this end she had bartered both youth and beauty with
calculated precision for the Hawley-Crowles money bags; only to weep
floods of angry tears when the bargain left her social status
unchanged, and herself tied to a decrepit old rounder, whose tarnished
name wholly neutralized the purchasing power of his ill-gotten gold.Fortunately for the reputations of them both, her husband had the good
sense to depart this life ere the divorce proceedings which she had
long had in contemplation were instituted; whereupon the stricken
widow had him carefully incinerated and his ashes tenderly deposited
in a chaste urn in a mausoleum which her architect had taken oath cost
more than the showy Ames vault by many thousands.The period of
decorous mourning past, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles blithely doffed her weeds
and threw herself again into the terrific competition for social
standing, determined this time that it should be a warfare to the
death.And so it bade fair to prove to her, when the eminent nerve
specialist, Dr.Bascom Ross, giving a scant half hour to the
consideration of her case, at the modest charge of one hundred
dollars, warned her to declare a truce and flee to the Alps for
unalloyed rest.She complied, and had returned with restored health
and determination just as her sister came up from South America,
bringing the odd little "savage" whom Reed had discovered in the wilds
of Guamoco.A prolonged week-end at Newport, the last of the summer
season, accounted for her absence from the city when Reed brought
Carmen to her house, where he and his wife were making their temporary
abode.Six months later, in her swift appraisal of the girl in the
Elwin school, to whom she had never before given a thought, she seemed
to see a light."It does look like a desperate chance, I admit," she said, when
recounting her plans to her sister a day or so later."But I've played
every other card in my hand; and now this girl is going to be either a
trump or a joker.All we need is a word from the Beaubien, and the
following week will see an invitation at our door from Mrs.The trick is to reach the Beaubien.And I'm going to introduce the girl as an Inca
princess.Reed was not less ambitious than her sister, but hitherto she had
lacked the one essential to social success, money.In addition, she
had committed the egregious blunder of marrying for love.And now that
the honeymoon had become a memory, and she faced again her growing
ambition, with a struggling husband who had neither name nor wealth to
aid her, she had found her own modest income of ten thousand a year,
which she had inherited from her mother, only an aggravation.True, in
time her wandering father would pass away; and there was no doubt that
his vast property would fall to his daughters, his only living kin.But at present, in view of his aggressively good health and disregard
for his relatives, her only recourse was to attach herself to her
wealthy, sharp-witted sister, and hope to be towed safely into the
social swim, should that scheming lady ultimately achieve her high
ambition.Hawley-Crowles should have seen in Carmen a means of
reaching a woman of the stamp of the Beaubien, and through her the
leader of the most exclusive social set in the metropolis, is
difficult to say.But thus does the human mind often seek to further
its own dubious aims through guileless innocence and trust.Hawley-Crowles had likewise a slight trace of that clairvoyance
of wisdom which so characterized the girl.But with this difference,
that she knew not why she was led to adopt certain means; while
Carmen, penetrating externals, consciously sought to turn those who
would employ her into channels for the expression of her own dominant
thought.Be that as it may, the Beaubien was now the stone before the
door of their hope, and Carmen the lever by which these calculating
women intended it should be moved."The Beaubien, my dear," explained Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to her
inquisitive sister, whose life had been lived almost entirely away
from New York, "is J. Wilton Ames's very particular friend, of long
standing.As I told you, I have recently been going through my late
unpleasant husband's effects, and have unearthed letters and memoranda
which throw floods of light upon Jim's early indiscretions and his
association with both the Beaubien and Ames.Jim once told me, in a
burst of alcoholic confidence, that she had saved him from J. Wilton's
clutches in the dim past, and for that he owed her endless gratitude,
as well as for never permitting him to darken her door again.Now I
have never met the Beaubien.But I dare say she knows
all about us.However, the point that concerns us now is this: she has
a hold on Ames, and, unless rumor is wide of the truth, when she hints
to him that his wife's dinner list or yachting party seems incomplete
without such or such a name, why, the list is immediately revised."The position which the Beaubien held was, if Madam On-dit was not to
be wholly discredited, to say the least, unique.It was not as social
dictator that she posed, for in a great cosmopolitan city where polite
society is infinitely complex in its make-up such a position can
scarcely be said to exist.It was rather as an influence that she was
felt, an influence never seen, but powerful, subtle, and wholly
inexplicable, working now through this channel, now through that, and
effecting changes in the social complexion of conservative New York
that were utterly in defiance of the most rigid convention.Particularly was her power felt in the narrow circle over which Mrs.J. Wilton Ames presided, by reason of her own and her husband's
aristocratic descent, and the latter's bursting coffers and supremacy
in the realm of finance.Only for her sagacity, the great influence of the woman would have
been short-lived.But, whatever else might be said of her, the
Beaubien was wise, with a discretion that was positively uncanny.Tall, voluptuous, yet graceful as a fawn; black, wavy, abundant hair;
eyes whose dark, liquid depths held unfathomable mysteries; gracious,
affable, yet keen as a razor blade; tender, even sentimental on
occasions, with an infinite capacity for either love or hate, this
many-sided woman, whose brilliant flashes of wit kept the savant or
roue at her table in an uproar, could, if occasion required, found an
orphanage or drop a bichloride tablet in the glass of her rival with
the same measure of calculating precision and disdain of the future.It was said of her that she might have laid down her life for the man
she loved.It is probable that she never met with one worth the
sacrifice.While yet in short dresses she had fled from her boarding school, near
a fashionable resort in the New Hampshire hills, with a French
Colonel, Gaspard de Beaubien, a man twice her age.With him she had
spent eight increasingly miserable years in Paris.Then, her withered
romance carefully entombed in the secret places of her heart, she
secured a divorce from the roistering colonel, together with a small
settlement, and set sail for New York to hunt for larger and more
valuable game.With abundant charms and sang-froid for her capital, she rented an
expensive apartment in a fashionable quarter of the city, and then
settled down to business.Whether she would have fallen upon bad days
or not will never be known, for the first haul of her widespread net
landed a fish of supreme quality, J. Wilton Ames.On the plea of
financial necessity, she had gone boldly to his office with the deed
to a parcel of worthless land out on the moist sands of the New Jersey
shore, which the unscrupulous Gaspard de Beaubien had settled upon her
when she severed the tie which bound them, and which, after weeks of
careful research, she discovered adjoined a tract owned by Ames.Pushing aside office boy, clerk, and guard, she reached the inner
_sanctum_ of the astonished financier himself and offered to sell at a
ruinous figure.A few well-timed tears, an expression of angelic
innocence on her beautiful face, a despairing gesture or two with her
lovely arms, coupled with the audacity which she had shown in forcing
an entrance into his office, effected the man's capitulation.She was
then in her twenty-fourth year.The result was that she cast her net no more, but devoted herself
thenceforth with tender consecration to her important catch.In time
Ames brought a friend, the rollicking James Hawley-Crowles, to call
upon the charming Beaubien.In time, too, as was perfectly natural, a
rivalry sprang up between the men, which the beautiful creature
watered so tenderly that the investments which she was enabled to make
under the direction of these powerful rivals flourished like Jack's
beanstalk, and she was soon able to leave her small apartment and take
a suite but a few blocks from the Ames mansion.At length the strain between Ames and Hawley-Crowles reached the
breaking point; and then the former decided that the woman's
bewitching smiles should thenceforth be his alone.He forthwith drew
the seldom sober Hawley-Crowles into certain business deals, with the
gentle connivance of the suave Beaubien herself, and at length sold
the man out short and presented a claim on every dollar he possessed.Hawley-Crowles awoke from his blissful dream sober and trimmed.But
then the Beaubien experienced one of her rare and inexplicable
revulsions of the ethical sense, and a compromise had to be effected,
whereby the Hawley-Crowles fortune was saved, though the man should
see the Beaubien no more.By this time her beauty was blooming in its utmost profusion, and her
prowess had been fairly tried.She took a large house, furnished it
like unto a palace, and proceeded to throw her gauntlet in the face of
the impregnable social caste.There she drew about her a circle of
bon-vivants, artists, litterateurs, politicians, and men of
finance--with never a woman in the group.Yet in her new home she
established a social code as rigid as the Median law, and woe to him
within her gates who thereafter, with or without intent, passed the
bounds of respectful decorum.His name was heard no more on her rosy
lips.Her dinners were Lucullan in their magnificence; and over the rare
wines and imperial cigars which she furnished, her guests passed many
a tip and prognostication anent the market, which she in turn quietly
transmitted to her brokers.She came to understand the game
thoroughly, and, while it was her heyday of glorious splendor, she
played hard.She had bartered every priceless gift of nature for
gold--and she made sure that the measure she received in return was
full.Her gaze was ever upon the approaching day when those charms
would be but bitter memories; and it was her grim intention that when
it came silken ease should compensate for their loss.Ten years passed, and the Beaubien's reign continued with undimmed
splendor.In the meantime, the wife of J. Wilton Ames had reached the
zenith of her ambitions and was the acknowledged leader in New York's
most fashionable social circle.But, though
the Beaubien had never sought the entree to formal society, preferring
to hold her own court, at which no women attended, she exercised a
certain control over it through her influence upon the man Ames.Ames knew of the long-continued relations between her husband and
this woman was never divulged.And doubtless she was wholly satisfied
that his wealth and power afforded her the position which her heart
had craved; and, that secure, she was willing to leave him to his own
methods of obtaining diversion.But rumor was persistent, maliciously
so; and rumor declared that the list of this envied society dame was
not drawn up without the approval of her husband and the woman with
whom his leisure hours were invariably spent.Hawley-Crowles, whose doting mate had once fawned in the perfumed wake
of the luxurious Beaubien.Carmen, whose wishes had not been consulted, had voiced no objection
whatever to returning to the Hawley-Crowles home.Indeed, she secretly
rejoiced that an opportunity had been so easily afforded for escape
from the stifling atmosphere of the Elwin school, and for entrance
into the great world of people and affairs, where she believed the
soil prepared for the seed she would plant.That dire surprises
awaited her, of which she could not even dream, did not enter her
calculations.Secure in her quenchless faith, she gladly accepted the
proffered shelter of the Hawley-Crowles mansion, and the protection of
its worldly, scheming inmates.In silent, wide-eyed wonder, in the days that followed, the girl
strove to accustom herself to the luxury of her surroundings, and to
the undreamed of marvels which made for physical comfort and
well-being.Hawley-Crowles settled upon her seemed a fortune--enough, she thought,
to buy the whole town of Simiti!Her gowns seemed woven on fairy
looms, and often she would sit for hours, holding them in her lap and
reveling in their richness.Then, when at length she could bring
herself to don the robes and peep timidly into the great pier glasses,
she would burst into startled exclamations and hide her face in her
hands, lest the gorgeous splendor of the beautiful reflection
overpower her."Oh," she would exclaim, "it can't be that the girl reflected there
ever lived and dressed as I did in Simiti!I wonder, oh, I wonder if
Padre Jose knew that these things were in the world!"And then, as she leaned back in her chair and gave herself into the
hands of the admiring French maid, she would close her eyes and dream
that the fairy-stories which the patient Jose had told her again and
again in her distant home town had come true, and that she had been
transformed into a beautiful princess, who would some day go in search
of the sleeping priest and wake him from his mesmeric dream.Then would come the inevitable thought of the little newsboy of
Cartagena, to whom she had long since begun to send monetary
contributions--and of her unanswered letters--of the war devastating
her native land--of rudely severed ties, and unimaginable changes--and
she would start from her musing and brush away the gathering tears,
and try to realize that her present situation and environment were but
means to an end, opportunities which her God had given her to do His
work, with no thought of herself.A few days after Carmen had been installed in her new home, during
which she had left the house only for her diurnal ride in the big
limousine, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles announced her readiness to fire the
first gun in the attack upon the Beaubien."My dear," she said to her
sister, as they sat alone in the luxurious sun-parlor, "my washerwoman
dropped a remark the other day which gave me something to build on.Her two babies are in the General Orphan Asylum, up on Twenty-third
street.Well, it happens that this institution is the Beaubien's sole
charity--in fact, it is her particular hobby.I presume that she feels
she is now a middle-aged woman, and that the time is not far distant
when she will have to close up her earthly accounts and hand them over
to the heavenly auditor.Anyway, this last year or two she has
suddenly become philanthropic, and when the General Orphan Asylum was
building she gave some fifty thousand dollars for a cottage in her
name.What's more, the trustees of the Asylum accepted it without the
wink of an eyelash."But here's the point: some rich old fellow has willed the institution
a fund whose income every year is used to buy clothing for the
kiddies; and they have a sort of celebration on the day the duds are
given out, and the public is invited to inspect the place and the
inmates, and eat a bit, and look around generally.Well, my
washerwoman tells me that the Beaubien always attends these annual
celebrations.The next one, I learn, comes in about a month.I propose
that we attend; take Carmen; ask permission for her to sing to the
children, and thereby attract the attention of the gorgeous Beaubien,
who will be sure to speak to the girl, who is herself an orphan, and,
ten to one, want to see more of her.I'll have a
word to say regarding our immense debt of gratitude to her for saving
Jim's fortune years ago when he was entangled in her net--and, well,
if that scheme doesn't work, I have other strings to my bow."But it did work, and with an ease that exceeded the most sanguine
hopes of its projector.On the day that the General Orphan Asylum
threw wide its doors to the public, the Hawley-Crowles limousine
rubbed noses with the big French car of the Beaubien in the street
without; while within the building the Beaubien held the hand of the
beautiful girl whose voluntary singing had spread a veil of silence
over the awed spectators in the great assembly room, and, looking
earnestly down into the big, trusting, brown eyes, said: "My dear
child, I want to know you."Then, turning to the eager, itching Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I shall send my car for her to-morrow afternoon, with
your permission."Hawley-Crowles wildly hugged her
sister and the girl all the way home--then went to bed that night with
tears of apprehension in her washed-out eyes, lest she had shown
herself too eager in granting the Beaubien's request.But her fears
were turned to exultation when the Beaubien car drew up at her door
the following day at three, and the courteous French chauffeur
announced his errand.A few moments later, while the car glided
purring over the smooth asphalt, Carmen, robed like a princess, lay
back in the cushions and dreamed of the poor priest in the dead little
town so far away.CHAPTER 9


"Sing it again, dear.I know you are tired, but I want to hear that
song just once more.Somehow it seems to bring up thoughts of--of
things that might have been."The Beaubien's voice sank to a whisper
as she finished.Carmen laughed happily and prepared to repeat the weird lament which
had so fascinated the Reverend Doctor Jurges a few days before."I--I don't know why that song affects me so," mused the Beaubien,
when the girl had finished and returned to the seat beside her.Then,
abruptly: "I wish you could play the pipe-organ out in the hall.I put
twelve thousand dollars into it, and I can't even play five-finger
exercises on it."exclaimed Carmen, drawing a long breath,
while her eyes dilated."Well, you poor, unsophisticated girl, suppose we just go down there
and buy the whole town.It would at least give me an interest in life.Do you think I could stand the heat there?How did you live, and what did you do?And are
you really descended from the old Incas?"They were alone in the darkened music room, and the soft-stepping,
liveried butler had just set the tea table before them, At one end of
the long room a cheery fire snapped and crackled in the huge
fireplace, tempering the sharpness of the early spring day and casting
a ruddy glow upon the tapestried walls and polished floor in front,
where dozed the Beaubien's two "babies," Japanese and Pekingese
spaniels of registered pedigree and fabulous value.Among the heavy
beams of the lofty ceiling grotesque shadows danced and flickered,
while over the costly rugs and rare skins on the floor below subdued
lights played in animated pantomime.Behind the magnificent grand
piano a beautifully wrought harp reflected a golden radiance into the
room.Everything in the woman's environment was softened into the same
degree of voluptuousness which characterized her and the life of
sybaritic ease which she affected.From the moment Carmen entered the house she had been charmed,
fascinated, overpowered by the display of exhaustless wealth and
the rich taste exhibited in its harmonious manifestation.The
Hawley-Crowles home had seemed to her the epitome of material
elegance and comfort, far exceeding the most fantastic concepts of her
childish imagination, when she had listened enraptured to Padre
Jose's compelling stories of the great world beyond Simiti.But the
gorgeous web of this social spider made even the Hawley-Crowles
mansion suffer in comparison."And yet," said the amused Beaubien, when Carmen could no longer
restrain her wonder and admiration, "this is but a shed beside the new
Ames house, going up on Fifth Avenue.I presume he will put not less
than ten millions into it before it is finished."Carmen dared not attempt to grasp the
complex significance of such an expenditure."Why, is that such a huge amount, child?"asked the Beaubien, as
accustomed to think in eight figures as in two."But, I forget that
you are from the jungle.she mused, gazing
with undisguised admiration at the beautiful, animated girl before
her.Carmen was struggling with the
deluge of new impressions; and the woman fastened her eyes upon her as
if she would have them bore deep into the soul of whose rarity she was
becoming slowly aware.What thoughts coursed through the mind of the
Beaubien as she sat studying the girl through the tempered light, we
may not know.What she saw in Carmen that attracted her, she herself
might not have told.Had she, too, this ultra-mondaine, this creature
of gold and tinsel, felt the spell of the girl's great innocence and
purity of thought, her righteousness?Or did she see in her something
that she herself might once have been--something that all her gold,
and all the wealth of Ormus or of Ind could never buy?"What have you got," she suddenly, almost rudely, exclaimed, "that I
haven't?"And then the banality of the question struck her, and she
laughed harshly."Why," said Carmen, looking up quickly and beaming upon the woman,
"you have everything!"You," returned the woman quickly, though she knew not why she said
it.And yet, memory was busy uncovering those bitter days when, in the
first agony of marital disappointment, she had, with hot, streaming
tears, implored heaven to give her a child.But the gift had been
denied; and her heart had shrunk and grown heavily calloused.Then she spoke more gently, and there was that in her voice which
stirred the girl's quick sympathy."Yes, you have youth, and beauty.But I could part with them, gladly, if only
there were anything left."Carmen instantly rose and went swiftly to her.Forgetful of caste,
decorum, convention, everything but the boundless love which she felt
for all mankind, she put her arms about the worldly woman's neck and
kissed her.For a moment the Beaubien sat in speechless surprise.It was the only
manifestation of selfless love that had ever come into her sordid
experience.that it was an
act of real sympathy, and not a clever ruse to win her from behind the
mask of affection?Her own kisses, she knew, were bestowed only for
favors.they drew not many now, although time was when a single
one might win a brooch or a string of pearls.The girl herself quickly met the woman's groping thought."I'm in the
world to show what love will do," she murmured; "and I love you."Had
she not thus solved every problem from earliest childhood?Not even a heart of stone could withstand the
solvent power of such love.Her head dropped upon her breast, and she
wept."Don't cry," said Carmen, tenderly caressing the bepowdered cheek."Why, we are all God's children; we all have one another; you have me,
and I have you; and God means us all to be happy."The Beaubien looked up, wondering.Her variegated life included no
such tender experience as this.She had long since ceased to shed
aught but tears of anger.But now--

She clutched the girl to her and kissed her eagerly; then gently
motioned her back to her chair."Don't mind it," she smiled, with
swimming eyes, and a shade of embarrassment."I don't know of anything
that would help me as much as a good cry.If I could have had a
daughter like you, I should--but never mind now."She tried to laugh,
as she wiped her eyes.Then an idea seemed to flash through her jaded brain, and she became
suddenly animated."Why--listen," she said; "don't you want to learn
the pipe-organ?I will pay for
them; I will engage the best teacher in New York; and you shall take
two or three a week, and use the big organ out in the hall.Carmen's heart gave a great leap."I'll do it myself," returned the woman with growing enthusiasm."William," she directed, when the butler responded to her summons,
"get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles on the wire at once.But who is coming, I
wonder?"glancing through the window at an automobile that had drawn
up at her door.a look of vexation mantling her face, "the
Right Reverend Monsignor Lafelle.Well," turning to Carmen, "I suppose
I'll have to send you home now, dear.Hawley-Crowles
that I shall call for you to-morrow afternoon, and that I shall speak
to her at that time about your music lessons.William, take Monsignor
into the morning room, and then tell Henri to bring the car to the
porte-cochere for Miss Carmen.Good-bye, dear," kissing the bright,
upturned face of the waiting girl."I wish I could--but, well, don't
forget that I'm coming for you to-morrow."Hawley-Crowles directed her French tailor to cable
to Paris for advance styles.Twenty-four hours later she hastened with
outstretched arms to greet the Beaubien, waiting in the reception
room.Oh, yes, they had heard often of each other; and now were so
pleased to meet!New York was such a whirlpool, and it was so
difficult to form desirable friendships.Yes, the Beaubien had known
the late-lamented Hawley-Crowles; but, dear!that was years and
years ago, before he had married, and when they were both young and
foolish.Hawley-Crowles, chance enabled him and me to be mutually
helpful at a time when I was in sore need of a friend; and the debt of
gratitude is not yours to me, but mine to your kind husband."Hawley-Crowles could have hugged her on the spot.What cared she
that her husband's always unsavory name had been linked with this
woman's?She had married the roistering blade for his bank account
only.Any other male whose wealth ran into seven figures would have
done as well, or better.Hawley-Crowles gratefully
accepted the use of the organ and the Beaubien mansion for the girl;
but she herself insisted upon bearing the expense of the lessons.Together, she and the Beaubien,
they would foster and develop it.Moreover, though of course this must
follow later, she intended to give the girl every social advantage
befitting her beauty, her talents, and her station.And then, when the Beaubien, who knew to a second just how long to
stay, had departed, taking Carmen with her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles turned
to her sister with her face flushed with anger.she exclaimed, while hot tears suffused her eyes."The hussy went away
actually laughing at me!What do you suppose she's got up her sleeve?But, let me tell you, she'll not fool me!I'll slap that arrogant Ames
woman yet; and then, when I've done that, I'll give the Beaubien
something to think about besides the way she did up poor old Jim!"*       *       *       *       *

There was now but one cloud that cast its dark shadow across the full
splendor of Carmen's happiness, the silence that shrouded Simiti.But
Harris was preparing to return to Colombia, and his trip promised a
solution of the mystery of her unanswered letters.For weeks Carmen
had struggled to teach him Spanish, with but small measure of success."You'll have to go back with me and
act as interpreter," he said one day, when they were alone in the
Hawley-Crowles parlor.Then a curious light came into his eyes, and he
blurted, "Will you?"But the girl turned the question aside with a laugh, though she knew
not from what depths it had sprung.Harris shrugged his broad
shoulders and sighed.He had not a hundred dollars to his name.Yet he had prospects, not the least of which was the interest he
shared with Reed in La Libertad.For, despite the disturbed state of
affairs in Colombia, Simiti stock had sold rapidly, under the sedulous
care of Ketchim and his loyal aids, and a sufficient fund had been
accumulated to warrant the inauguration of development work on the
mine.A few years hence Harris should be rich from that source alone.Reed was still in California, although the alluring literature which
Ketchim was scattering broadcast bore his name as consulting engineer
to the Simiti Development Company.His wife had continued her
temporary abode in the Hawley-Crowles mansion, while awaiting with
what fortitude she could command the passing of her still vigorous
father, and the results of her defiant sister's assaults upon the Ames
set.The wonderful organ in the Beaubien
mansion had cast a spell of enchantment over her soul, and daily she
sat before it, uncovering new marvels and losing herself deeper and
deeper in its infinite mysteries.Her progress was commensurate with
her consecration, and brought exclamations of astonishment to the lips
of her now devoted Beaubien.Hour after hour the latter would sit in
the twilight of the great hall, with her eyes fastened upon the
absorbed girl, and her leaden soul slowly, painfully struggling to
lift itself above the murk and dross in which it had lain buried for
long, meaningless years.They now talked but little, this strange
woman and the equally strange girl.Their communion was no longer of
the lips.It was the silent yearning of a dry, desolate heart,
striving to open itself to the love which the girl was sending far and
wide in the quenchless hope that it might meet just such a need.For
Carmen dwelt in the spirit, and she instinctively accepted her
splendid material environment as the gift, not of man, but of the
great divine Mind, which had led her into this new world that she
might be a channel for the expression of its love to the erring
children of mortals.She came and went quietly, and yet with as much confidence as if the
house belonged to her.At first the Beaubien smiled indulgently.And
then her smile became a laugh of eager joy as she daily greeted her
radiant visitor, whose entrance into the great, dark house was always
followed by a flood of sunshine, and whose departure marked the
setting in of night to the heart-hungry woman.In the first days of
their association the Beaubien could turn easily from the beautiful
girl to the group of cold, scheming men of the world who filled her
evenings and sat about her board.But as days melted into weeks, she
became dimly conscious of an effort attaching to the transition; and
the hour at length arrived when she fully realized that she was facing
the most momentous decision that had ever been evolved by her worldly
mode of living.But that was a matter of slow development through many
months.Hawley-Crowles trod the clouds.A week after Carmen
began the study of the organ she boldly ventured to accompany her one
day to the Beaubien citadel.She was graciously received, and departed
with the Beaubien's promise to return the call.Thereupon she set
about revising her own social list, and dropped several names which
she now felt could serve her no longer.Her week-end at Newport, just
prior to her visit to the Elwin school, had marked the close of the
gay season in the city, and New York had entered fully upon its summer
_siesta_.Even the theaters and concert halls were closed, and the
metropolis was nodding its weary head dully and sinking into
somnolence.The
summer interim would give her time to further her plans and prepare
the girl for her social _debut_ in the early winter."And Milady Ames
will be mentioned in the papers next day as assisting at the
function--the cat!"she muttered savagely, as she laid aside her
revised list of social desirables.But in preparing Carmen that summer for her subsequent entry into
polite society Mrs.Hawley-Crowles soon realized that she had
assumed a task of generous proportions.In the first place,
despite all efforts, the girl could not be brought to a proper
sense of money values.Her eyes were ever gaping in astonishment at
what Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister regarded as the most moderate
of expenditures, and it was only when the Beaubien herself mildly
hinted to them that ingenuousness was one of the girl's greatest
social assets, that they learned to smile indulgently at her wonder,
even while inwardly pitying her dense ignorance and lack of
sophistication.A second source of trial to her guardians was her delicate sense of
honor; and it was this that one day nearly sufficed to wreck their
standing with the fashionable Mrs.Gannette of Riverside Drive, a
pompous, bepowdered, curled and scented dame, anaemic of mind, but
tremendously aristocratic, and of scarcely inferior social dignity to
that of the envied Mrs.Gannette moved into the
neighborhood where dwelt the ambitious Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the latter
was taken by a mutual acquaintance to call upon her, and was
immediately received into the worldly old lady's good graces.And it
so happened that, after the gay season had closed that summer, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister to an informal
afternoon of bridge, and especially requested that they bring their
young ward, whose beauty and wonderful story were, through the
discreet maneuvers of her guardians, beginning to be talked about.Hawley-Crowles had been inducting Carmen
into the mysteries of the game; but with indifferent success, for the
girl's thoughts invariably were elsewhere engaged.On this particular
afternoon Carmen was lost in contemplation of the gorgeous dress, the
lavish display of jewelry, and the general inanity of conversation;
and her score was pitiably low.The following morning, to her great
astonishment, she received a bill from the practical Mrs.Gannette for
ten dollars to cover her losses at the game.For a long time the
bewildered girl mused over it.Then she called the chauffeur and
despatched him to the Gannette mansion with the money necessary to
meet the gambling debt, and three dollars additional to pay for the
refreshments she had eaten, accompanying it with a polite little note
of explanation.The result was an explosion that nearly lifted the asphalt from the
Drive; and Carmen, covered with tears and confusion, was given to
understand by the irate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles that her conduct was as
reprehensible as if she had attacked the eminent Mrs.Whereupon the sorrowing Carmen packed her effects and prepared to
depart from the presence of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, to the terrified
consternation of the latter, who alternately prostrated herself before
the girl and the offended Mrs.Gannette, and at length, after many
days of perspiring effort and voluminous explanation, succeeded in
restoring peace.When the Beaubien, who had become the girl's confidante, learned the
story, she laughed till her sides ached.And then her lips set, and
her face grew terribly hard, and she muttered, "Fools!"But she smiled
again as she gathered the penitent girl in her arms, and kissed her."You will learn many things, dearie, before you are through with New
York.And," she added, her brow again clouding, "you _will_ be through
with it--some day!"That evening she repeated the story at her table, and Gannette, who
happened to be present, swore between roars of laughter that he would
use it as a club over his wife, should she ever again trap him in any
of his numerous indiscretions.Again, the girl's odd views of life and its meaning which, despite her
efforts, she could not refrain from voicing now and then, caused the
worldly Mrs.Hawley-Crowles much consternation.Carmen tried
desperately to be discreet.Even Harris advised her to listen much,
but say little; and she strove hard to obey.But she would forget and
hurl the newspapers from her with exclamations of horror over their
red-inked depictions of mortal frailty--she would flatly refuse to
discuss crime or disease--and she would comment disparagingly at too
frequent intervals on the littleness of human aims and the emptiness
of the peacock-life which she saw manifested about her."I don't
understand--I can't," she would say, when she was alone with the
Beaubien."Why, with the wonderful opportunities which you rich people
have, how can you--oh, how can you toss them aside for the frivolities
and littleness that you all seem to be striving for!It seems to me
you must be mad--_loco_!And I know you are, for you are simply
mesmerized!"Then the Beaubien would smile knowingly and take her in her arms."We
shall see," she would often say, "we shall see."Thus the summer months sped swiftly past, with Carmen ever looking and
listening, receiving, sifting, in, but not of, the new world into
which she had been cast.In a sense her existence was as narrowly
routined as ever it had been in Simiti, for her days were spent at the
great organ, with frequent rides in the automobile through the parks
and boulevards for variation; and her evenings were jealously guarded
by Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose policy was to keep the girl in seclusion
until the advent of her formal introduction to the world of
fashionable society, when her associates would be selected only from
the narrow circle of moneyed or titled people with whom alone she
might mingle.To permit her to form promiscuous acquaintances now
might prove fatal to the scheming woman's cherished plans, and was a
risk that could not be entertained.And Carmen, suppressing her
wonder, and striving incessantly to curb her ready tongue, accepted
her environment as the unreal expression of the human mind, and
submitted--and waited.CHAPTER 10

The chill blasts had begun to swoop down from the frozen North, and
summer had gathered her dainty robes about her and fled shivering
before them.Hawley-Crowles stood at a window and gazed with
unseeing eyes at the withered leaves tossing in the wind.Carmen's sixteenth birthday was past by some months; the gay season
was at hand; and the day was speeding toward her which she had set for
the girl's formal _debut_.Already, through informal calls and
gatherings, she had made her charming and submissive ward known to
most of her own city acquaintances and the members of her particular
set.The fresh, beautiful girl's winning personality; her frank,
ingenuous manner; her evident sincerity and her naive remarks, which
now only gave hints of her radical views, had opened every heart wide
to her, and before the advent of the social season her wonderful story
was on everybody's tongue.There remained now only the part which the
woman had planned for the Beaubien, but which, thus far, she had found
neither the courage nor the opportunity to suggest to that influential
woman.Gazing out into the deserted street, she stamped her ample foot
in sheer vexation.The Beaubien had absorbed Carmen; had been
politely affable to her and her sister; had called twice during the
summer; and had said nothing.The
hint must come from the other side; and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles could have
wept with chagrin as she reflected gloomily on her own timorous
spirit.But as she stood in dejection before the window a vague idea flitted
into her brain, and she clutched at it desperately.Carmen had spoken
of the frequent calls of a certain Monsignor Lafelle at the Beaubien
mansion, although the girl had never met him."Old Gaspard de Beaubien was a
French Catholic."Nothing--except--why, to be sure,
the girl came from a Catholic country, and therefore was a Catholic!That was worth developing a little
further."Let us see," she reflected, "Kathleen Ames is coming out
this winter, too.Candidate for her mother's
social position, of course.The Reverend Darius Borwell, D.D., L.L.D., and any other D. that will
keep him glued to his ten-thousand-dollar salary, hooked them early in
the game.Now suppose--suppose Lafelle should tell the Beaubien
that--that there's--no, that won't do!But suppose I tell him that
here's a chance for him to back a Catholic against a Protestant for
the highest social honors in New York--Carmen versus Kathleen--what
would he say?I'm just as good a Catholic as Protestant.And Catholic, Methodist, or Hard-shell
Baptist, as suited his needs.Suppose I should tip
it off to Lafelle that I'm smitten with the pious intention of
donating an altar to Holy Saints Cathedral in memory of my late,
unlamented consort--what then?Yes,
it's not a bad idea at all."And thus it was that a few days later Mrs.Hawley-Crowles timed it so
carefully that she chanced to call on the Beaubien with Carmen shortly
after Monsignor Lafelle's car had pulled up at the same door.It was
the merest accident, too, that Carmen led her puffing guardian
directly into the morning room, where sat the Beaubien and Monsignor
in earnest conversation.Hawley-Crowles would have retired at
once, stammering apologies, and reprimanding Carmen for her assumption
of liberties in another's house; but the Beaubien was grace and
cordiality itself, and she insisted on retaining her three callers and
making them mutually acquainted.Hawley-Crowles found it easy to take
the contemplated plunge.Therefore she smiled triumphantly when, a
week later, Monsignor Lafelle alighted at her own door, in response to
a summons on matters pertaining to the Church."But, Madam," replied the holy man, after carefully listening to her
announcement, "I can only refer the matter to the Bishop.I am not
connected with this diocese.But I
shall be most pleased to lay it before him, with my endorsement.""As you say, Monsignor," sweetly responded the gracious Mrs."I sought your advice because I had met you through my
dear friend, Madam Beaubien.""It has been a great pleasure to know you and to be of service to you,
Madam," said Monsignor, rising to depart."But," he added with a
tender smile, "a pleasure that would be enhanced were you to become
one of us."Hawley-Crowles knew that at last the time had come."A moment,
please, Monsignor," she said, her heart beating quickly.It concerns my ward, the young girl
whom you met at Madam Beaubien's.""And just
budding into still more beautiful womanhood."Then she threw herself precipitately into her
topic, as if she feared further delay would result in the evaporation
of her boldness."Monsignor, it is, as you say, unfortunate that I
profess no religious convictions; and yet, as I have told you, I find
that as the years pass I lean ever more strongly toward your Church.Now you will pardon me when I say that I am sure it is the avowed
intention to make America dominantly Catholic that brings you to this
country to work toward that end--is it not so?"The man's handsome face lighted up pleasantly, but he did not reply."Now, Monsignor, I am going to be terribly frank; and if you
disapprove of what I suggest, we will both forget that the matter was
ever under discussion.To begin with, I heartily endorse your
missionary efforts in this godless country of ours.Nothing but the
strong arm of the Catholic Church, it seems to me, can check our
headlong plunge into ruin.But, Monsignor, you do not always work
where your labors are most needed.You may control political--"

"My dear lady," interrupted the man, holding up a hand and shaking his
head in gentle demurral, "the Catholic Church is not in politics.""But it is in society--or should be!""And
if the Catholic Church is to be supreme in America it must work from
the top down, as well as from the lower levels upward.At present our
wealthiest, most influential social set is absolutely domineered by a
Protestant--and under the influence of a Presbyterian minister at
that!Monsignor Lafelle's eyes twinkled, as he listened politely.But he
only stroked the white hair that crowned his shapely head, and
waited."Monsignor," continued the now thoroughly heated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles,
"why do not the women of your Church constitute our society leaders?Why do you not recognize the desirability of forcing your people into
every avenue of human activity?And would you resent a suggestion from
me as to how in one instance this might be accomplished?""Certainly not, Madam," replied Monsignor, with an expression of
wonder on his face."You are laughing at me, I do believe!"she exclaimed, catching the
glint in his gray eyes."Pardon me, dear lady, I really am deeply interested."Well, at any rate I have your promise to forget this conversation if
you do not approve of it," she said quizzically.He nodded his head to inspire her confidence; and she continued:

"Very well, now to the point.My ward, the little Inca princess, is
coming out shortly.I want her to have the _entree_ into the very best
society, into the most fashionable and exclusive set, as befitting her
rank."She stopped and awaited the effect of her words.Monsignor studied her for a moment, and then broke into a genial
laugh."There is nothing reprehensible in your wish, Madam," he said."Our social system, however imperfect, nevertheless exists,
and--dominant Catholic influence might improve it."Why, I really see nothing that I can do," he replied slowly.Hawley-Crowles was becoming exasperated with his apparent
dullness."You can do much," she retorted in a tone tinctured with
impatience."Since I have made you my Father Confessor to-day, I am
going to tell you that I intend to start a social war that will rip
this city wide open.It is going to be war in which Catholic is pitted
against Protestant.For a moment her blunt question startled him, and he stared at her
uncomprehendingly; but he quickly recovered his poise and replied
calmly, "Neither, Madam; it remains quite neutral.""Pardon me if I say it; not at all."she murmured, her eagerness subsiding."Then I've made an awful
mistake!""No," he amended gently, "you have made a good friend.And, as such, I
again urge you first to respect the leaning which you mentioned a
moment ago and become actively affiliated with our Church here in New
York."Certainly I will consider it," she responded, brightening with hope."And I will go so far as to say that I have long had it in mind.""Then, Madam, when that is accomplished, we may discuss the less
important matter of your ward's entrance into society--is it not so?"Hawley-Crowles rose, completely discomfited."But the girl,
Monsignor, is already a Catholic--comes from a Catholic country.It is
she whom I am pitting against the Protestant.""You are cruel," she retorted, affecting an air of injured innocence
as she stood before him with downcast eyes."But--if you--"

"Madam," said Monsignor, "plainly, what is it that you wish me to
do?"The sudden propounding of the question drew an equally sudden but less
thoughtful response."Tell the Beau--Madam Beaubien that you wish my ward to be received
into the best society, and for the reasons I have given you."And is my influence with Madam Beaubien, and hers with the members of
fashionable society, sufficient to effect that?"he asked, an odd look
coming into his eyes."She has but to say the word to J. Wilton Ames, and his wife will
receive us both," said the woman, carried away by her eagerness."And
that means strong Catholic influence in New York's most aristocratic
set!""Monsignor," continued the woman eagerly, "will your Church receive an
altar from me in memory of my late husband?"Then, slowly, and in a low, earnest tone, "It
would receive such a gift from one of the faith.When may we expect
you to become a communicant?"The woman paled, and her heart suddenly chilled.She had wondered how
far she might go with this clever churchman, and now she knew that she
had gone too far.But to retract--to have him relate this conversation
and her retraction to the Beaubien--were fatal!She had set her
trap--and walked into it.Then,
raising her eyes and meeting his searching glance, she murmured
feebly, "Whenever you say, Monsignor."When the man had departed, which he did immediately, the plotting
woman threw herself upon the davenport and wept with rage."Belle,"
she wailed, as her wondering sister entered the room, "I'm going to
join the Catholic Church!But I'd go through Sheol to beat that Ames
outfit!"CHAPTER 11


MONSIGNOR LAFELLE made another afternoon call on the Beaubien a few
days later.That lady, fresh from her bath, scented, powdered, and
charming in a loose, flowing Mandarin robe, received him graciously."But I can give you only a moment, Monsignor," she said, waving him to
a chair, while she stooped and tenderly took up the two spaniels."I
have a dinner to-night, and so shall not listen unless you have
something fresh and really worth while to offer.""My dear Madam," said he, bowing low before he sank into the great
leather armchair, "you are charming, and the Church is justly proud of
you.""Tut, tut, my friend," she returned, knitting her brows."That may be
fresh, I admit, but not worth listening to.And if you persist in that
vein I shall be obliged to have William set you into the street.""I can not apologize for voicing the truth, dear Madam," he replied,
as his eyes roved admiringly over her comely figure."The Church has
never ceased to claim you, however far you may have wandered from her.I am leaving for Canada shortly on a mission of
some importance.May I not take with me the consoling assurance that
you have at last heard and yielded to the call of the tender Mother,
who has never ceased to yearn for her beautiful, wayward daughter?""There," she said gently, "I thought
that was it.No, Monsignor, no," shaking her head."When only a wild,
thoughtless girl I became a Catholic in order that I might marry
Gaspard de Beaubien.The priest urged; and I--<DW30>!But
the past eighteen years have confirmed me in some views; and one is
that I shall gain nothing, either here or hereafter, by renewing my
allegiance to the Church of Rome."Monsignor sighed, and stroked his abundant white hair."I learned this morning," he said musingly, "that my
recent labors with the Dowager Duchess of Altern in England have not
been vain.She has become a communicant of Holy Church.""The Duchess of Altern--sister of Mrs.Why, she was a high Anglican--"

"Only a degree below the true Church, Madam.Her action is but
anticipatory of a sweeping return of the entire Anglican Church to the
true fold.And I learn further," he went on, "that the Duchess will
spend the winter in New York with her sister.Which means, of course,
an unusually gay season here, does it not?"The Beaubien quickly recovered from her astonishment."Well,
Monsignor," she laughed, "for once you really are interesting.Ames herself will be the next
convert?But one of your most intimate friends will
become a communicant of Holy Saints next Sunday."The Beaubien set the spaniels down
on the floor."Now, my dear Monsignor, you are positively refreshing."Am I not right when I insist that you have
wandered far, dear Madam?It is not 'he,' but'she,' your dear friend,
Mrs.The Beaubien's mouth opened wide and she sat suddenly upright and
gazed blankly at her raconteur.The man went on, apparently oblivious
of the effect his information had produced."Her beautiful ward, who
is to make her bow to society this winter, is one of us by birth.""Then you have been at work on Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward, have
you?"said the Beaubien severely, and there was a threatening note in
her voice."Why," returned Monsignor easily, "the lady sent for me to express her
desire to become affiliated with the Church.And I
have had no conversation with the girl, I assure you."Then:

"Will you tell me why, Monsignor, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles takes this
unusual step?"Is it unusual, Madam, for a woman who has seen much of the
world to turn from it to the solace and promise of the Church?"Hawley-Crowles it
is, decidedly."Monsignor, I do not.And by this time you
do, too.She is the last woman in the world to turn from it.""But the question you have just propounded reflects seriously upon
both the Church and me--"

"Bah!"interjected the Beaubien, her eyes flashing."Wait," she
commanded imperiously, as he rose."I have a few things to say to you,
since this is to be your last call.""Madam, not the last, I hope.For I shall not cease to plead the cause
of the Church to you--"

"Surely, Monsignor, that is your business.You are welcome in my
house at any time, and particularly when you have such delightful
scraps of gossip as these which you have brought to-day.But, a word
before you go, lest you become indiscreet on your return.Hawley-Crowles to any extent you wish, but let her ward
alone--_absolutely_!The cold, even tone in which the woman said this left no doubt in the
man's mind of her meaning.She was not trifling with him now, he knew.In her low-voiced words he found no trace of banter, of sophistry, nor
of aught that he might in any wise misinterpret."Now, Monsignor, I have some influence in New York, as you may
possibly know.Will you admit that I can do much for or against you?Drop your mask, therefore, and tell me frankly just what has induced
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to unite with your Church."The man knew he was pitting his own against a master mind.He
hesitated and weighed well his words before replying."Madam," said he
at length, with a note of reproach, "you misjudge the lady, the
Church, and me, its humble servant.Hawley-Crowles, I speak truly when I say that doubtless she
has been greatly influenced by love for her late husband."The Beaubien half rose from her chair."Jim Crowles--that raw,
Irish boob, who was holding down a job on the police force until Ames
found he could make a convenient tool of him!The man who was
Gannette's cat's-paw in the Fall River franchise steal!Now,
Monsignor, would you have me believe you devoid of all sense?""But," ejaculated the man, now becoming exasperated, and for the
moment so losing his self-control as to make wretched use of his
facts, "she is erecting an altar in Holy Saints as a memorial to
him!"Monsignor Lafelle again made as if to rise.He felt that he was guilty
of a miserable _faux pas_."Madam, I regret that I must be leaving.But the hour--"

"Stay, Monsignor!"The Beaubien roused up and laid a detaining hand
upon his arm."Our versatile friend, what other projects has she in
hand?"Why, really, I can not say--beyond the fact that the girl is to be
introduced to society this winter."Going to make a try for the Ames set?""That, I believe, Madam, would be useless without your aid."Hawley-Crowles say so, Monsignor?"demanded the woman,
leaning forward eagerly."Why, I believe I am not abusing her confidence when I say that she
intimated as much," he said, watching her closely and sparring now
with better judgment.Ames as New York's
fashionable society leader--"

"There is no such position as leader in New York society, Monsignor,"
interrupted the Beaubien coldly."There are sets and cliques, and
Mrs.Ames happens to be prominent in the one which at present
foolishly imagines it constitutes the upper stratum.Hawley-Crowles, with nothing but a tarnished name and a large bank
account to recommend her, now wishes to break into that clique and
attain social leadership, does she?Then the woman's eyes narrowed and grew hard.Leaning closer to
the churchman, she rested the tip of her finger on his knee."So, Monsignor," she said, with cold precision, "this is Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's method of renouncing the world, is it?And she would use both you and me, eh?And you are her ambassador
at the court of the Beaubien?Very well, then, she shall use us.But you and I will first make this compact, my dear Monsignor:
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles shall be taken into the so-called 'Ames set,'
and you shall cease importuning me to return to your Church, and
what is more, shall promise to have no conversation on church
matters with her ward, the young girl.If you do not agree to
this, Monsignor, I shall set in motion forces that will make your
return to New York quite undesirable."When she concluded, she
looked long and steadily into his eyes.Monsignor got slowly to his feet.he exclaimed in a hoarse
whisper, "my astonishment--"

"There," she said calmly, as she rose and took his hand, "please omit
the dramatics, Monsignor.And now you must go, for to-night I
entertain, and I have already given you more time than I intended.But, Monsignor, do you in future work with or against me?"Why, Madam," he replied quickly, "we could never be the latter!""And you always respect the wishes of a friend, especially if she is a
lady, do you not?""Always, Madam," he returned after a moment's hesitation, as he bowed
low over her hand.And, Monsignor," she added, when he reached the door,
"I shall be pleased to attend the dedication of the Hawley-Crowles
altar."When Monsignor's car glided away from her door the Beaubien's face
grew dark, and her eyes drew to narrow slits."So," she reflected, as
she entered the elevator to mount to her dressing room, "that is her
game, is it?The poor, fat simpleton has no interest in either the
girl or myself, other than to use us as stepping-stones.She forgets
that a stone sometimes turns under the foot.She entered her room and rang for her maid.Turning to the pier glass,
she threw on the electric light and scrutinized her features narrowly."It's going," she murmured, "fast!Oh, what a farce life is--what a howling, mocking farce!No--that little girl--if it is possible
for me to love, I love her.""I wonder what it is she does to me.I'm
hypnotized, I guess.Anyhow, I'm different when I'm with her.And to
think that Hawley-Crowles would sacrifice the child--humph!But, if
the girl is made of the right stuff--and I know she is--she will stand
up under it and be stronger for the experience.She has got something
that will make her stand!I once asked her what she had that I didn't,
and now I know--it is her religion, the religion that Borwell and
Lafelle and the whole kit of preachers and priests would corrupt if
they had half a chance!Very well, we'll see what it does under the
test.If it saves her, then I want it myself.But, as for that little
pin-headed Hawley-Crowles, she's already signed her own death-warrant.She shall get into the Ames set, yes.And I will use her, oh,
beautifully!to pay off certain old scores against Madam Ames--and
then I'll crush her like a dried leaf, the fat fool!"The Beaubien's position was, to say the least, peculiar, and one which
required infinite tact on her part to protect.It was for that reason
that the decorum which prevailed at her dinners was so rigidly
observed, and that, whatever the moral status of the man who sat at
her board, his conduct was required to be above reproach, on penalty
of immediate ejection from the circle of financial pirates, captains
of commercial jugglery, and political intriguers who made these feasts
opportunities for outlining their predatory campaigns against that
most anomalous of creatures, the common citizen.It was about this table, at whose head always sat the richly gowned
Beaubien, that the inner circle of financial kings had gathered almost
nightly for years to rig the market, determine the price of wheat or
cotton, and develop mendacious schemes of stock-jobbery whose golden
harvests they could calculate almost to a dollar before launching.As
the wealth of this clique of financial manipulators swelled beyond all
bounds, so increased their power, until at last it could be justly
said that, when Ames began to dominate the Stock Exchange, the
Beaubien practically controlled Wall Street--and, therefore, in a
sense, Washington itself.But always with a tenure of control
dubiously dependent upon the caprices of the men who continued to pay
homage to her personal charm and keen, powerful intellect.At the time of which we speak her power was at its zenith, and she
could with equal impunity decapitate the wealthiest, most aristocratic
society dame, or force the door of the most exclusive set for any
protegee who might have been kept long years knocking in vain, or
whose family name, perchance, headed a list of indictments for gross
peculations.At these unicameral meetings, held in the great, dark,
mahogany-wainscoted dining room of the Beaubien mansion, where a
single lamp of priceless workmanship threw a flood of light upon the
sumptuous table beneath and left the rest of the closely guarded room
shrouded in Stygian darkness, plans were laid and decrees adopted
which seated judges, silenced clergymen, elected senators, and
influenced presidents.There a muck-raking, hostile press was muffled.There business opposition was crushed and competition throttled.There
tax rates were determined and tariff schedules formulated.There
public opinion was disrupted, character assassinated, and the
death-warrant of every threatening reformer drawn and signed.In a
word, there Mammon, in the _role_ of business, organized and
unorganized, legitimate and piratical, sat enthroned, with wires
leading into every mart of the world, and into every avenue of human
endeavor, be it social, political, commercial, or religious.These
wires were gathered together into the hands of one man, the directing
genius of the group, J. Wilton Ames.Over him lay the shadow of the
Beaubien.An hour after the departure of Monsignor Lafelle the Beaubien, like a
radiant sun, descended to the library to greet her assembled guests.Some moments later the heavy doors of the great dining room swung
noiselessly open, and the lady proceeded unescorted to her position at
the head of the table.At her signal the half dozen men sat down, and
the butler immediately entered, followed by two serving men with the
cocktails and the first course.The chair at the far end of the table,
opposite the Beaubien, remained unoccupied."Ames is late to-night," observed the girthy Gannette, glancing toward
the vacant seat, and clumsily attempting to tuck his napkin into his
collar.The Beaubien looked sharply at him."Were you at the club this
afternoon, Mr.Gannette straightened up and became rigid.Pulling the napkin down
hastily, he replied in a thick voice, "Just a little game of
bridge--some old friends--back from Europe--"

The Beaubien turned to the butler.Gannette is not
drinking wine this evening."The butler bowed and removed the glasses
from that gentleman's place."Now, Lucile--" he began peevishly.The Beaubien held up a hand.Gannette glowered and sank down in his
chair like a swollen toad."May be Ames is trying to break into the C. and R. directors'
meeting," suggested Weston, himself a director in a dozen companies,
and a bank president besides."They tell me," said Fitch, "that for once Ames has been outwitted,
and that by a little bucket-shop broker named Ketchim."queried Kane, Board of Trade plunger, and the most
mettlesome speculator of the group."Why," explained Weston, "some months ago Ames tried to reach Ed.Stolz through Ketchim, the old man's nephew, and get control of C. and
R. But friend nephew dropped the portcullis just as Ames was dashing
across the drawbridge, and J. Wilton found himself outside, looking
through the bars.First time I've ever known that to happen.Now the
boys have got hold of it on 'Change, and Ames has been getting it from
every quarter.""Long time leaking out, seems to me," remarked Kane."But what's Ames
going to do about it?""He seems to have dropped the
matter.""I think you will find yourself mistaken," put in the Beaubien
evenly.queried Fitch, as all eyes turned upon the woman.Ames always gets what he goes
after, and he will secure control of C. and R.vigorously asserted Murdock, who had been an
interested listener."I have one thousand dollars that says he will," said the Beaubien,
calmly regarding the speaker.Murdock seemed taken back for the moment; but lost no time recovering
his poise.Drawing out his own book he wrote a check in the Beaubien's
name for the amount and sent it down the table to her.Fitch will hold the stakes," said the woman, handing him the two
slips of paper."And we will set a time limit of eighteen months.""By the way," remarked Peele, the only one of the group who had taken
no part in the preceding conversation, "I see by the evening paper
that there's been another accident in the Avon mills.Fellow named
Marcus caught in a machine and crushed all out of shape.That's the
third one down there this month.They'll force Ames to equip his mills
with safety devices if this keeps up.""Not while the yellow metal has any influence upon the Legislature,"
returned the Beaubien with a knowing smile."But," she added more
seriously, "that is not where the danger lies.The real source of
apprehension is in the possibility of a strike.And if war breaks out
among those Hungarians down there it will cost him more than to equip
all his mills now with safety devices."Gannette, who had been sulking in his chair, roused up."Speaking
of war," he growled, "has Ames, or any of you fellows, got a
finger in the muddle in South America?I've got interests down
there--concessions and the like--and by--!"He wandered off into
incoherent mutterings.The Beaubien gave a sharp command to the butler.cried Gannette, his apoplectic face becoming
more deeply purple, and his blear eyes leering angrily upon the calm
woman."I ain't a-goin' to stand this!I'm as sober
as any one here, an'--" William took the heavy man gently by the arm
and persuaded him to his feet.The other guests suppressed their
smiles and remained discreetly quiet."Have Henri take him to his club, William," said the Beaubien, rising.We will expect you Wednesday evening, and
we trust that we will not have to accept your excuses again."Gannette was led soddenly out.The Beaubien quietly resumed her seat.It was the second time the man had been dismissed from her table, and
the guests marveled that it did not mean the final loss of her favor.But she remained inscrutable; and the conversation quickly drifted
into new channels.A few moments later William returned and made a
quiet announcement:

"Mr.A huge presence emerged from the darkness into the light.The Beaubien
immediately rose and advanced to greet the newcomer.she
whispered, taking his hand.The man smiled down into her upturned, anxious face.His only reply
was a reassuring pressure of her hand.But she comprehended, and her
face brightened."Gentlemen," remarked Ames, taking the vacant chair, "the President's
message is out.I have been going over it with Hood--which accounts
for my tardiness," he added, nodding pleasantly to the Beaubien."Quoting from our chief executive's long list of innocent platitudes,
I may say that 'private monopoly is criminally unjust, wholly
indefensible, and not to be tolerated in a Republic founded upon the
premise of equal rights to all mankind.'"concurred Weston, holding up his glass and gazing
admiringly at the rich color of the wine."Quite my sentiments, too," murmured Fitch,
rolling his eyes upward and attempting with poor success to assume a
beatific expression."Furthermore," continued Ames, with mock gravity, "the interlocking of
corporation directorates must be prohibited by law; power must be
conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission to superintend the
financial management of railroads; holding-companies must cease to
exist; and corrective policies must be shaped, whereby so-called
'trusts' will be regulated and rendered innocuous."We are," said they all, in one voice."Carried," concluded Ames in a solemn tone.Then a burst of laughter
rose from the table; and even the inscrutable William smiled behind
his hand."But, seriously," said Weston, when the laughter had ceased, "I
believe we've got a President now who's going to do something, don't
you?""As long as the human mind
remains as it is there is nothing to fear, though Congress legislate
itself blue in the face.Reform is not to be made like a garment and
forced upon the people from the outside.Restrictive measures have not as yet, in all the history of
civilization, reformed a single criminal.""That we are puncture-proof," replied Ames with a light laugh."But what about your indictment in that cotton deal?Is Hood going to
find you law-proof there?""The case is settled," said Ames easily."I went into court this
morning and plead guilty to the indictment for conspiring to corner
the cotton market two years ago.I admitted that I violated the
Sherman law.The judge promptly fined me three thousand dollars, for
which I immediately wrote a check, leaving me still the winner by some
two million seven hundred thousand dollars on the deal, to say nothing
of compound interest on the three thousand for the past two years.You
see the beneficent effect of legislation, do you not?""By George, Ames, you certainly were stingy not to let us in on that!""Cotton belongs to me, gentlemen," replied Ames simply."Well," remarked Fitch, glancing about the table, "suppose we get down
to the business of the evening--if agreeable to our hostess," bowing
in the direction of the Beaubien."Has any one
anything new to offer?""There is a little
matter," he began, "that I have been revolving for some days.It occurred to
me some time ago that a franchise for a trolley line on that road
could be secured and ultimately sold for a round figure to the wealthy
residents whose estates lie along it, and who would give a million
dollars rather than have a line built there.After some preliminary
examination I got Hood to draft a bill providing for the building of
the road, and submitted it to Jacobson, Commissioner of Highways.He
reported that it would be the means of destroying the post road.I
convinced him, on the other hand, that it would be the means of lining
his purse with fifty thousand dollars.So he very naturally gave it
his endorsement.I then got in consultation with Senator Gossitch, and
had him arrange a meeting with the Governor, in Albany.I think," he
concluded, "that about five hundred thousand dollars will grease the
wheels all 'round.I've got the Governor on the hip in that Southern
Mexican deal, and he is at present eating out of my hand.I'll lay
this project on the table now, and you can take it up if you so
desire.""The scheme seems all right," commented Weston, after a short
meditation."Well, a net profit of half a million to split up among us would at
least provide for a yachting party next summer," remarked Ames
sententiously."And no work connected with it--in fact, the work has
been done.I shall want an additional five per cent for handling it."An animated discussion followed; and then Fitch offered a motion that
the group definitely take up the project.The Beaubien put the vote,
and it was carried without dissent."What about that potato scheme you were figuring on, Ames?"asked
Fitch at this juncture."I didn't get much encouragement from my
friends," he replied."I don't believe it," put in Weston emphatically."I have one million dollars that says it could," returned Ames calmly.Weston threw up his hands in token of surrender.he
exclaimed, scurrying for cover."Well," he said, "suppose we look into the scheme and
see if we don't want to handle it.It simply calls for a little
thought and work.He stopped and glanced at the Beaubien for approval.She nodded, and
he went on:

"I have lately been investigating the subject of various food supplies
other than wheat and corn as possible bases for speculation, and my
attention has been drawn strongly to a very humble one, potatoes."But Ames continued
unperturbed:

"I find that in some sections of the West potatoes are so plentiful at
times that they bring but twenty cents a bushel.My investigations
have covered a period of several months, and now I have in my
possession a large map of the United States with the potato sections,
prices, freight rates and all other necessary data indicated.My idea is to send agents into all these
sections next summer before the potatoes are turned up, and contract
for the entire crop at twenty-five cents a bushel.The agents will pay
the farmers cash, and agree to assume all expenses of digging,
packing, shipping, and so forth, allowing the farmer to take what he
needs for his own consumption.Needless to say, the potatoes will not
be removed from the fields, but will be allowed to rot in the ground.Those that do reach the market will sell for a dollar and a half in
New York and Chicago.""In other words," added Fitch, "you are simply figuring to corner the
market for the humble tuber, eh?""But--you say you have all the necessary data now?""All, even to the selection of a few of my agents.I can control
freight rates for what we may wish to ship.The rest of the crop will
be left to rot.And the
consumers will pay our price for what they must have.""And how much do you figure we shall
need to round the corner?""A million, cash in hand," replied Ames."Is this anything that the women can mix into?""You know they forced us to dump tons of our cold-storage stuff onto
the market two years ago.""That was when I controlled wheat," said Ames, "and was all tied up.It will be done so quietly
and thoroughly that it will all be over and the profits pocketed
before the women wake up to what we're doing.In this case there will
be nothing to store.And potatoes exposed in the field rot quickly,
you know."The rest of the group seemed to study the idea for some moments.Then
the practical Murdock inquired of Ames if he would agree to handle the
project, provided they took it up."Yes," assented Ames, "on a five per cent basis.And I am ready to put
agents in the field to-morrow.""Then, Madam Beaubien," said Fitch, "I move that we adopt the plan as
set forth by Mr.Ames, and commission him to handle it, calling upon
us equally for whatever funds he may need."A further brief discussion ensued; and then the resolution was
unanimously adopted."Say, Ames," queried Weston, with a glint of mischief in his eyes,
"will any of these potatoes be shipped over the C. and R.?"A laugh
went up around the table, in which Ames himself joined."Yes," he
said, "potatoes and cotton will both go over that road next summer,
and I shall fix the rebates."suggested Fitch, with a wink at
Murdock.Ames's mouth set grimly, and the smile left his face."Ketchim is
going to Sing Sing for that little deal," he returned in a low, cold
tone, so cold that even the Beaubien could not repress a little
shudder."I had him on Molino, but he trumped up a new company which
absorbed Molino and satisfied everybody, so I am blocked for the
present.But, mark me, I shall strip him of every dollar, and then put
him behind the bars before I've finished!"And no one sought to refute the man, for they knew he spoke truth.At midnight, while the cathedral chimes in the great hall clock were
sending their trembling message through the dark house, the Beaubien
rose, and the dinner was concluded.A few moments later the guests
were spinning in their cars to their various homes or clubs--all but
Ames.As he was preparing to leave, the Beaubien laid a hand on his
arm."Wait a moment, Wilton," she said."I have something important to
discuss with you."She led him into the morning room, where a fire was
blazing cheerily in the grate, and drew up a chair before it for him,
then nestled on the floor at his feet."I sent Gannette home this evening," she began, by way of introduction.I would drop him entirely, only you said--"

"We need him," interrupted Ames."I'll soil my hands by doing it; but it is for you.Now tell me," she
went on eagerly, "what about Colombia?Have you any further news from
Wenceslas?"The Church is
with the Government, and they will win--although your money may be
tied up for a few years.Still, you can't lose in the end."The woman sat for some moments gazing into the fire.Then:

"Lafelle was here again to-day.""Hold him, too," said Ames quickly."Looks as if I had made you a sort
of holding company, doesn't it?""But we
shall have good use for these fellows.""He gave me some very interesting news," she said; and then went on to
relate the conversation in detail.Ames laughed loudly as he
listened."And now, Wilton," said the Beaubien, a determined look
coming into her face, "you have always said that you never forgave me
for making you let Jim Crowles off, when you had him by the throat.Well, I'm going to give you a chance to get more than even.Jim's fat
widow is after your wife's scalp.I intend that she shall lose her own
in the chase.I've got my plans all laid, and I want your wife to meet
the lovely Mrs.Hawley-Crowles at the Fitch's next Thursday afternoon.It will be just a formal call--mutual introductions--and, later, an
invitation from Mrs.Meantime, I want you
to get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles involved in a financial way, and shear her
of every penny!"My dear," said he, taking her hand, "you are charming this
evening.she deprecated, although the smile she gave him
attested her pleasure in the compliment."Well," she continued
briskly, "if I'm so beautiful, you can't help loving me; and if you
love me, you will do what I ask."Really,
I've long since forgotten him.Do you realize that that was more than
ten years ago?""Please don't mention years, dear," she murmured, shuddering a little."Tell me, what can we do to teach this fat hussy a lesson?""Well," he suggested, laughing, "we might get Ketchim after her, to
sell her a wad of his worthless stocks; then when he goes down, as he
is going one of these days, we will hope that it will leave her on the
rocks of financial ruin, eh?""Why, among other innocent novelties, a scheme bearing the sonorous
title of Simiti Development Company, I am told by my brokers."Why--I've heard Carmen mention that name.I wonder--"

"Well, and who is Carmen?""My little friend--the one and only honest person I've ever dealt
with, excepting, of course, present company."And now where does this Carmen enter the
game?""Why, she's--surely you know about her!""Well, she is a little Colombian--"

"Colombian!"Came up with the engineers who
went down there for Ketchim to examine the Molino properties.She
lived all her life in a town called Simiti until she came up here."Ames leaned over and looked steadily into the fire."Never heard of
the place," he murmured dreamily."Well," said the Beaubien eagerly, "she's a--a wonderful child!I'm
different when I'm with her."He roused from his meditations and smiled down at the woman."Then I'd
advise you not to be with her much, for I prefer you as you are."Then the woman looked up at her
companion.The man started; then drew himself up and gave a little nervous laugh."Of you," he replied evasively, "always."She reached up and slapped his cheek tenderly."You were dreaming of
your awful business deals," she said."What have you in hand
now?--besides the revolution in Colombia, your mines, your mills, your
banks, your railroads and trolley lines, your wheat and potato
corners, your land concessions and cattle schemes, and--well, that's a
start, at least," she finished, pausing for breath.I'm buying every bale I can find, in Europe, Asia, and
the States.""But, Will, you've been caught in cotton before, you know.And I don't
believe you can get away with it again.Unless--"

"That's it--unless," he interrupted."And that's just the part I have
taken care of.The cotton schedule will go
through as I have it outlined.They
don't dare refuse to pass the measure.In a few
months the tariff on cotton products will be up.The new tariff-wall
sends the price of raw stuff soaring.I
was beaten on the last deal simply because of faulty weather
prognostications.I'll let you in, if you wish.But these other fellows have got
to stay out.""I haven't a penny to invest, Will," she replied mournfully."You got
me so terribly involved in this Colombian revolution.""Oh, well," he returned easily, "I'll lend you what you need, any
amount.And you can give me your advice and suggestions from time to
time.As for your Colombian investments, haven't I guaranteed them,
practically?""Not in writing," she said, looking up at him with a twinkle in her
eyes."No, certainly not," she returned, giving him a glance of admiration.Hawley-Crowles is going to be received into your
wife's set, and you are going to give her a good financial whipping?"Hawley-Crowles
shall go to the poor-house, if you say the word.But now, my dear,
have William order my car.Hawley-Crowles at Fitch's?"Yes, dear," murmured the Beaubien, reaching up and kissing him; "next
Thursday at three.Call me on the 'phone to-morrow."CHAPTER 12


The Ames building, a block from the Stock Exchange, was originally
only five stories in height.But as the Ames interests grew, floor
after floor was added, until, on the day that Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
pointed it out to Carmen from the window of her limousine, it had
reached, tower and all, a height of twenty-five stories, and was
increasing at an average rate of two additional a year.It was not its
size that aroused interest, overtopped as it was by many others, but
its uniqueness; for, though a hive of humming industry, it did not
house a single business that was not either owned outright or
controlled by J. Wilton Ames, from the lowly cigar stands in the
marble corridors to the great banking house of Ames and Company on the
second floor.The haberdashers, the shoe-shining booths, the soda
fountains, and the great commercial enterprises that dwelt about them,
each and all acknowledged fealty and paid homage to the man who
brooded over them in his magnificent offices on the twenty-fifth floor
in the tower above.It was not by any consensus of opinion among the financiers of New
York that Ames had assumed leadership, but by sheer force of what
was doubtless the most dominant character developed in recent
years by those peculiar forces which have produced the American
multimillionaire."And," he once added, when, despite his anger, he could
not but admire Ames's tactical blocking of his piratical move, which
the former's keen foresight had perceived threatened danger at
Washington, "it is not by any tacit agreement that we accept him,
but because he knows ten tricks to our one, that's all."To look at the man, now in his forty-fifth year, meant, generally, an
expression of admiration for his unusual physique, and a wholly
erroneous appraisal of his character.His build was that of a
gladiator.He stood six-feet-four in height, with Herculean shoulders
and arms, and a pair of legs that suggested nothing so much as the
great pillars which supported the facade of the Ames building.Those
arms and legs, and those great back-muscles, had sent his college
shell to victory every year that he had sat in the boat.They had won
every game on the gridiron in which he had participated as the
greatest "center" the college ever developed.For baseball he was a
bit too massive, much to his own disappointment, but the honors he
failed to secure there he won in the field events, and in the
surreptitiously staged boxing and wrestling bouts when, hidden away in
the cellar of some secret society hall, he would crush his opponents
with an ease and a peculiar glint of satisfaction in his gray eyes
that was grimly prophetic of days to come.His mental attitude toward
contests for superiority of whatever nature did not differ essentially
from that of the Roman gladiators: he entered them to win.If he fell,
well and good; he expected "thumbs down."If he won, his opponent need
look for no exhibition of generosity on his part.When his man lay
prone before him, he stooped and cut his throat.And he would have
loathed the one who forbore to do likewise with himself.In scholarship he might have won a place, had not the physical side of
his nature been so predominant, and his remarkable muscular strength
so great a prize to the various athletic coaches and directors.Ames
was first an animal; there was no stimulus as yet sufficiently strong
to arouse his latent spirituality.And yet his intellect was keen; and
to those studies to which he was by nature or inheritance especially
attracted, economics, banking, and all branches of finance, he brought
a power of concentration that was as stupendous as his physical
strength.His mental make-up was peculiar, in that it was the epitome
of energy--manifested at first only in brute force--and in that it was
wholly deficient in the sense of fear.Because of this his daring was
phenomenal.Immediately upon leaving college Ames became associated with his
father in the already great banking house of Ames and Company.But the
animality of his nature soon found the confinement irksome; his
father's greater conservatism hampered his now rapidly expanding
spirit of commercialism; and after a few years in the banking house he
withdrew and set up for himself.The father, while lacking the boy's
fearlessness, had long since recognized dominant qualities in him
which he himself did not possess, and he therefore confidently
acquiesced in his son's desire, and, in addition, gave him _carte
blanche_ in the matter of funds for his speculative enterprises.Four years later J. Wilton Ames, rich in his own name, already
becoming recognized as a power in the world of finance, with
diversified enterprises which reached into almost every country of the
globe, hastened home from a foreign land in response to a message
announcing the sudden death of his father.The devolving of his
parent's vast fortune upon himself--he was the sole heir--then
necessitated his permanent location in New York.And so, reluctantly
giving up his travels, he gathered his agents and lieutenants about
him, concentrating his interests as much as possible in the Ames
building, and settled down to the enjoyment of expanding his huge
fortune.A few months later he married, and the union amalgamated the
proud old Essex stock of Ames, whose forbears fought under the
Conqueror and were written in the Doomsday Book, to the wealthy and
aristocratic Van Heyse branch of old Amsterdam.To this union were
born a son and a daughter, twins.The interval between his graduation from college and the death of his
father was all but unknown to the cronies of his subsequent years in
New York.Though he had spent much of it in the metropolis, he had
been self-centered and absorbed, even lonely, while laying his plans
and developing the schemes which resulted in financial preeminence.With unlimited money at his disposal, he was unhampered in the choice
of his business clientele, and he formed it from every quarter of the
globe.Much of his time had been spent abroad, and he had become as
well known on the Paris bourse and the exchanges of Europe as in his
native land.Confident and successful from the outset; without any
trace of pride or touch of hauteur in his nature; as wholly lacking in
ethical development and in generosity as he was in fear; gradually
becoming more sociable and companionable, although still reticent of
certain periods of his past; his cunning and brutality increasing with
years; and his business sagacity and keen strategy becoming the talk
of the Street; with no need to raise his eyes beyond the low plane of
his material endeavors; he pursued his business partly for the
pleasure the game afforded him, partly for the power which his
accumulations bestowed upon him, and mostly because it served as an
adequate outlet for his tremendous, almost superhuman, driving energy.If he betrayed and debauched ideals, it was because he was utterly
incapable of rising to them, nor felt the stimulus to make the
attempt.If he achieved no noble purpose, it was because when he
glanced at the mass of humanity about him he looked through the lenses
of self.His glance fell always first upon J. Wilton Ames--and he
never looked beyond.The world had been created for him; the cosmos
but expressed his Ego.On the morning after his conversation with the Beaubien regarding the
social aspirations of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the financier sat at his
rich mahogany desk on the top floor of the Ames building in earnest
discussion with his lawyer, Alonzo Hood.The top floor of the tower
was divided into eight rooms.Two of these constituted Ames's inner
_sanctum_; one was Hood's private office; and the rest were devoted
to clerks and stenographers.A telegrapher occupied an alcove
adjoining Hood's room, and handled confidential messages over
private wires to the principal cities in the country.A private
telephone connected Ames's desk with the Beaubien mansion.Private
lines ran to the Stock Exchange and to various other points
throughout the city.The telegraph and telephone companies gave his
messages preference over all others.At a word he would be placed in
almost instant communication with New Orleans, San Francisco, London,
Berlin, or Cairo.Private lines and speaking tubes ran to every room
or floor of the building where a company, firm, or individual was
doing business.At the office of the Telegraph Service up-town he
maintained messengers who carried none but his own despatches.In
the railroad yards his private car stood always in readiness; and in
the harbor his yacht was kept constantly under steam.A motor car
stood ever in waiting in the street below, close to the shaft of a
private automatic elevator, which ran through the building for his
use alone.This elevator also penetrated the restaurant in the
basement of the building, where a private room and a special waiter
were always at the man's disposal.A private room and special
attendant were maintained in the Turkish baths adjoining, and he
had his own personal suite and valet at his favorite club up-town.This morning he was at his desk, as usual, at eight o'clock.Before
him lay the various daily reports from his mines, his mills, his
railroads, and his bank.These disposed of, there followed a quick
survey of the day's appointments, arranged for him by his chief
secretary.As the latter entered, Ames was
absorbed in the legend of the stock ticker."C. and R. closed yesterday at twenty-six," he commented.Then,
swinging back in his chair, "What's Stolz doing?""For one thing, he has made Miss Fagin his private stenographer,"
replied Hood."Now we will begin to get real information," he
remarked."Tell Miss Fagin you will give her fifty dollars a week from
now on; but she is to deliver to you a carbon copy of every letter she
writes for Stolz.And I want those copies on my desk every morning
when I come down.Hood," he continued, abruptly turning the
conversation, "what have you dug up about Ketchim's new company?""Very little, sir," replied Hood with a trace of embarrassment."His
lawyer is a fledgeling named Cass, young, but wise enough not to talk.I called on him yesterday afternoon to have a little chat about the
old Molino company, representing that I was speaking for certain
stockholders.But he told me to bring the stockholders in and he would
talk with them personally."Ames laughed, while the lawyer grinned sheepishly."Is that the sort
of service you are rendering for a hundred-thousand-dollar salary?""Hood, I'm ashamed of you!""I can't blame you; I am ashamed of myself," replied the lawyer."Well," continued Ames good-naturedly, "leave Ketchim to me.I've got
three men now buying small amounts of stock in his various companies.I'll call for receiverships pretty soon, and we will see this time
that he doesn't refund the money.Now about other matters: the Albany
post trolley deal is to go through.Work up
the details and let me have them at once.Have you got the senate bill
drawn for Gossitch?"As it stands now, the repealing
section gives any city the right to grant saloon licenses of
indefinite length, instead of for one year."We want the bill so drawn that it will become
practically impossible to revoke a license.""As it now reads," said Hood, "it makes a saloon license assignable.That creates a property right that can hardly be revoked.""As I figure, it will create a value of some
twenty millions for those who own saloons in New York.And if the United States ever reaches the point
where it will have to buy the saloons in order to wipe them out, it
will face a very handsome little expenditure."Ames, a very large part of the stock of American brewing
companies is owned in Europe.How are you--"

"Nominally, it is.But for two years, and more, I have been quietly
gathering in brewing stock from abroad, and to-day I have some ten
millions in my own control, from actual purchases, options, and so
forth.I'm going to organize a holding company, when the time arrives,
and I figure that within the next year or so we will practically
control the production of beer and spirituous liquors in the United
States and Europe.The formation of that company will be a task worthy
of your genius, Hood.""It will be a pleasure to undertake it," replied Hood with animation.Ames, I got in touch with Senator Mall last evening
at the club, and he assures me that the senate committee have so
changed the phraseology of the tariff bill on cotton products that the
clause you wish retained will be continued with its meaning unaltered.In fact, the discrimination which the hosiery interests desire will be
fully observed.Your suggestion as to an ad valorem duty of fifty per
cent on hose valued at less than sixty-five cents a dozen pairs is
exceptionally clever, in view of the fact that there are none of less
than that value.""Triumphant Republicanism," he commented."And
right in the face of the President's message.Wire Mall that I will be
in Washington Thursday evening to advise with him further about it.Hood, we've got a fight on in regard to
the President's idea of granting permission in private suits to use
judgments and facts brought out and entered in government suits
against combinations.And the
regulation of security issues of railroads--preposterous!If Mall and Gossitch and Wells don't oppose
that in the Senate, I'll see that they are up before the lunacy
commission--and I have some influence with that body!""There is nothing to fear, I think," replied Hood reassuringly."An
important piece of business legislation like that will hardly go
through this session.And then we will have time to prepare to
frustrate it.The suggestion to place the New York Stock Exchange
under government supervision is a much more serious matter, I think.""See here, Hood," said Ames, leaning forward and laying a hand upon
that gentleman's knee, "when that happens, we'll have either a
Socialist president or a Catholic in the White House, with Rome
twitching the string.Then I shall move to my Venezuelan estates, take
the vow of poverty, and turn monk.""Which reminds me again that by your continued relations with Rome you
are doing much to promote just that state of affairs," returned the
lawyer sententiously."But I find the Catholic Church
convenient--indeed, necessary--for the promotion of certain plans.But I shall
abruptly sever my relations with that institution some day--when I am
through with it.At present I am milking the Church to the extent of a
brimming pail every year; and as long as the udder is full and
accessible I shall continue to tap it.I tapped the Presbyterian
Church, through Borwell, last year, if you remember."Willett, chief secretary to Ames, entered at that moment with the
morning mail, opened and sorted, and replies written to letters of
such nature as he could attend to without suggestions from his chief."By the way," remarked Hood when he saw the letters, "I had word from
Collins this morning that he had secured a signed statement from that
fellow Marcus, who was crushed in the Avon mills yesterday.Marcus
accepted the medical services of our physicians, and died in our
hospital.Just before he went off, his wife accepted a settlement of
one hundred dollars.Looked big to her, I guess, and was a bird in the
hand."That reminds me," said Ames, looking up from his mail; "we are going
to close the mills earlier this year on account of the cotton
shortage.""Four thousand hands idle for three months, I suppose.we just escaped disaster last year, you remember.""It will be more than three months this time," commented Ames with a
knowing look.Then--"Hood, I verily believe you are a coward."Ames," replied the latter slowly, "I certainly would
hesitate to do some of the things you do.Yet you seem to get away
with them.""Perk up, Hood," laughed Ames."I've got real work for you as soon as
I get control of C. and R. I'm going to put you in as president, at a
salary of one hundred thousand per annum.Then you are going to buy
the road for me for about two million dollars, and I'll reorganize and
sell to the stockholders for five millions, still retaining control.The road is only a scrap heap, but its control is the first step
toward the amalgamation of the trolley interests of New England.Laws
are going to be violated, Hood, both in actual letter and in spirit.It's up to you to get around the
Interstate Commerce Commission in any way you can, and buttress this
little monopoly against competition and reform-infected legislatures."We'll send Crabbe to the Senate," Ames coolly replied."You seem to forget that senators are now elected by the people, Mr.The people are New York City, Buffalo, and
Albany.And Tammany at present is in my pocket.Buffalo and Albany can be swept by the Catholic vote.And I have that
in the upper right hand drawer of my private file.The 'people' will
therefore elect to the Senate the man I choose.In fact, I prefer
direct election of senators over the former method, for the people are
greater fools _en masse_ than any State Legislature that ever
assembled."He took up another letter from the pile on his desk and glanced
through it."Protests against the way
you nullified the Glaze-Bassett red-light injunction bill.I really didn't think it was in you."said Hood, puffing a little with
pride.But for that, the passage of the bill would have wiped out the
whole red-light district, and quartered the rents I now get from my
shacks down there.Now next year we will be better prepared to fight
the bill.The press will be with us then--a little cheaper and a
trifle more degraded than it is to-day."Ames read it and handed
it to his lawyer."The _Proteus_ has reached the African Gold Coast at
last," he said.Then he threw back his head and laughed heartily."Do
you know, Hood, the _Proteus_ carried two missionaries, sent to the
frizzle-topped Zulus by Borwell and his outfit.Deutsch and Company
cable that they have arrived.""But," said Hood in some perplexity, "the cargo of the _Proteus_ was
rum!""Just so," roared Ames; "that's where the joke comes in.I make it a
point that every ship of mine that carries a missionary to a foreign
field shall also carry a cargo of rum.The combination is one that the
Zulu finds simply irresistible!""So," commented Hood, "the Church goes down to Egypt for help!""I carry the missionaries free on my rum
boats.Great saving to the Board of Foreign Missions, you know."Hood looked at the man before him in undisguised admiration of his
cunning."And did you likewise send missionaries to China with your
opium cargoes?""I once sent Borwell himself to Hongkong on a boat
loaded to the rails with opium.We had insisted on his taking a needed
vacation, and so packed him off to Europe.In Bombay I cabled him to
take the _Crotus_ to Hongkong, transportation free.That was my last
consignment of opium to China, for restrictions had already fallen
upon our very Christian England, and the opium traffic was killed.I
had plans laid to corner the entire opium business in India, and I'd
have cleaned up a hundred million out of it, but for the pressure of
public sentiment.However, we're going to educate John Chinaman to
substitute whiskey for opium.But now," glancing at the great electric
wall clock, "I've wasted enough time with you.By the way, do you know
why this Government withheld recognition of the Chinese Republic?""No," replied Hood, standing in anticipation."Thirty thousand chests of opium," returned Ames laconically."Ames and Company had advanced to the English banks of Shanghai and
Hongkong half this amount, loaned on the opium.That necessitated a
few plain words from me to the President, and a quick trip from
Washington to London afterwards to interview his most Christian
British Majesty.A very pleasant and profitable trip, Hood, very!Hood threw his chief another look of intense admiration, and left the
room."Get Lafelle here some time to-day when I have a vacant hour,"
commanded Ames."Cable to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, of Cartagena, and
ask him if an American mining company is registered there under the
name of Simiti Development Company, and what properties they have and
where located.Tell him to cable reply, and follow with detailed
letter."He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes."The Congregation of
the Sacred Index has laid the ban on--what's the name of the book?"He
drew out a card-index drawer and selected a card, which he tossed to
the secretary.He seemed to
muse a while, then went on slowly."Carlos Madero, of Mexico, is in
New York.Learn where he is staying, and arrange an interview for me.Wire Senator Wells, Washington, that the bill for a Children's Bureau
must not be taken from the table.Wire the Sequana Coal
Company that I want their report to-morrow, without fail.Wire
Collins, at Avon, to tell the Spinners' Union I have nothing to
discuss with them.As Hood was chief of the Ames legal department, and Willett the chief
of his army of secretaries, so Hodson was the captain of his force of
brokers, a keen, sagacious trader, whose knowledge of the market and
whose ability in the matter of stock trading was almost uncanny."What's your selection for to-day, Hodson?"asked Ames, as the man
entered.Hodson laid on his desk three lists of suggested deals on the
exchanges of New York, London, and Paris.Ames glanced over them
hurriedly, drawing his pencil through certain that did not meet his
approval, and substituting others in which for particular reasons he
wished to trade that morning."What's your reason for thinking I ought
to buy Public Utilities?""They have the letting of the Hudson river tunnel contract," replied
Hodson.Ames studied the broker's face a moment.Then his own brightened, as
he began to divine the man's reason.he ejaculated, "you
think there's quicksand along the proposed route?""I know it," said Hodson calmly."Pick up ten thousand shares, if you can get them," returned Ames
quickly.Then--"I'm going to attend a meeting of the Council of
American Grain Exchanges at two to-day.I want you to be just outside
the door."Ames concluded, "I guess that's all.I'm at the bank at ten; at the Board of Trade at ten-thirty; Stock
Exchange at eleven; and lunch at Rector's at twelve sharp, returning
here immediately afterward."Hodson again bowed, and left the office to undertake his various
commissions.For the next half hour Ames pored over the morning's quota of letters
and messages, making frequent notes, and often turning to the
telephone at his hand.Then he summoned a stenographer and rapidly
dictated a number of replies."In my next vacant hour, following the one devoted to Lafelle, I want
to see Reverend Darius Borwell," he directed."Also," he continued,
"wire Strunz that I want a meeting of the Brewers' Union called at the
earliest possible date.By the way, ask Lafelle if he can spend the
night with me on board the _Cossack_, and if so, notify Captain
McCall.Here is a bundle of
requests for charity, for contributions to hospitals, orphan asylums,
and various homes.'Phone to the
City Assessor to come over whenever you can arrange an hour and go
over my schedule with me.By the way, tell Hood to take steps at once
to foreclose on the Bradley estate.Did you find out where Ketchim
does his banking?""Yes, sir," replied the secretary, "the Commercial State.""Very well, get the president, Mr.A few moments later Ames had purchased from the Commercial State bank
its note against the Ketchim Realty Company for ten thousand dollars."I thought Ketchim would be borrowing again," he chuckled, when he had
completed the transaction."His brains are composed of a disastrous
mixture of hypocrisy and greed.I've thrown another hook into him
now."At nine forty-five Ames left his private office and descended in his
elevator to the banking house on the second floor.He entered the
directors' room with a determined carriage, nodding pleasantly to his
associates.Taking his seat as chairman, he promptly called the
meeting to order.Some preliminary business occupied the first few minutes, and then
Ames announced:

"Gentlemen, when the State of New York offered the public sixty
millions of four per cent bonds last week, and I advised you to take
them at a premium of six per cent, you objected.I overruled you, and
the bank bought the bonds.Within forty-eight hours they were resold
at a premium of seven per cent, and the bank cleared six hundred
thousand.Now let me suggest that the
psychology of this transaction is worth your study.A commodity is a
drug on the market at one dollar, until somebody is willing to pay a
dollar and a half for it.Then a lot of people will want it, until
somebody else offers a bid of two.Then the price will soar, and the
number of those who covet the article and scramble for it will
increase proportionably.A murmur of admiration rose from the directors."I think," said one,
"that we had better send Mr.Ames to Washington to confer with the
President in regard to the proposed currency legislation.""That is already arranged," put in Ames."I meet the President next
Thursday for a conference on this matter.""Why, in that case," returned Ames with a knowing smile, "I think we
had better give him a little lesson to take out of office with
him--one that will ruin his second-term hopes--and then close our
bank."From the bank, the Board of Trade, the Stock Exchange, and his
luncheon with Senator Gossitch, Ames returned to his office for the
private interviews which his chief secretary had arranged.Then
followed further consultations with Hood over the daily, weekly, and
monthly reports which Ames required from all the various commercial,
financial, and mining enterprises in which he was interested; further
discussions of plans and schemes; further receipt and transmission of
cable, telegraphic, and telephone messages; and meetings with his
heads of departments, his captains, lieutenants, and minor officers,
to listen to their reports and suggestions, and to deliver his quick,
decisive commands, admonitions, and advice.From eight in the morning
until, as was his wont, Ames closed his desk and entered his private
elevator at five-thirty in the evening, his office flashed with the
superenergy of the man, with his intense activity, his decisive words,
and his stupendous endeavors, materialistic, absorptive, ruthless
endeavors.If one should ask what his day really amounted to, we can
but point to these incessant endeavors and their results in augmenting
his already vast material interests and his colossal fortune, a
fortune which Hood believed ran well over a hundred millions, and
which Ames himself knew multiplied that figure by five or ten.And the
fortune was increasing at a frightful pace, for he gave nothing, but
continually drew to himself, always and ever drawing, accumulating,
amassing, and absorbing, and for himself alone.Snapping his desk shut, he held a brief conversation over the wire
with the Beaubien, then descended to his waiting car and was driven
hastily to his yacht, the _Cossack_, where Monsignor Lafelle awaited
as his guest.It was one of the few pleasures which Ames allowed
himself during the warm months, to drop his multifarious interests and
spend the night aboard the _Cossack_, generally alone, rocking gently
on the restless billows, so typical of his own heaving spirit, as the
beautiful craft steamed noiselessly to and fro along the coast, well
beyond the roar of the huge _arena_ where human beings, formed of
dust, yet fatuously believing themselves made in the image of infinite
Spirit, strive and sweat, curse and slay, in the struggle to prove
their doubtful right to live.CHAPTER 13


The _Cossack_, with its great turbines purring like a sleeping kitten,
and its twin screws turning lazily, almost imperceptibly in the dark
waters, moved through the frosty night like a cloud brooding over the
deep.Yet it was a cloud of tremendous potentiality, enwrapping a
spirit of energy incarnate.From far aloft its burning eye pierced a
channel of light through the murky darkness ahead.In its wake it drew
a swell of sparkling phosphorescence, which it carelessly tossed off
on either side as a Calif might throw handfuls of glittering coins to
his fawning beggars.From somewhere in the structure above, the
crackling, hissing wireless mechanism was thrusting its invisible
hands out into the night and catching the fleeting messages that were
borne on the intangible pulsations of the mysterious ether.From time
to time these messages were given form and body, and despatched to the
luxurious suite below, where, in the dazzling sheen of silver and cut
glass, spread out over richest napery, and glowing beneath a torrent
of white light, sat the gigantic being whose will directed the
movements of this floating palace."You see, Lafelle, I look upon religion with the eye of the
cold-blooded business man, without the slightest trace of sentimentalism.From the business standpoint, the Protestant Church is a dead failure.It doesn't get results that are in any way commensurate with its
investment.But your Church is a success--from the point of dollars and
cents.In fact, in the matter of forming and maintaining a monopoly, I
take off my hat to the Vatican.Every day I learn something of value by studying your methods of
operating upon the public.And so you see why I take such pleasure in
talking with really astute churchmen like yourself."Monsignor Lafelle studied the man without replying, uncertain just
what interpretation to put upon the remark.The Japanese servant was
clearing away the remnants of the meal, having first lighted the
cigars of the master and guest."Now," continued Ames, leaning back in his luxurious chair and musing
over his cigar, "the purgatory idea is one of the cleverest schemes
ever foisted upon the unthinking masses, and it has proved a veritable
Klondike.if I could think up and put over a thing like that I'd
consider myself really possessed of brains."Ames," he replied adroitly, "you
do not know your Bible."I don't suppose I ever in my life read a whole
chapter in the book.I can't swallow such stuff, Lafelle--utterly
unreasonable, wholly inconsistent with facts and natural laws, as we
know and are able to observe them.Even as a child I never had any
use for fairy-tales, or wonder-stories.I always wanted facts,
tangible, concrete, irrefutable facts, not hypotheses.The Protestant
churches hand out a mess of incoherent guesswork, based on as many
interpretations of the Bible as there are human minds sufficiently
interested to interpret it, and then wax hot and angry when
hard-headed business men like myself refuse to subscribe to it.If they had anything tangible to
offer, it would be different.But I go to church for the looks of
the thing, and for business reasons; and then stick pins into myself
to keep awake while I listen to pedagogical Borwell tell what he
doesn't know about God and man.Then at the close of the service I
drop a five-dollar bill into the plate for the entertainment, and
go away with the feeling that I didn't get my money's worth.From a
business point of view, a Protestant church service is worth about
twenty-five cents for the music, and five cents for the privilege of
sleeping on a soft cushion.So you see I lose four dollars and
seventy cents every time I attend.You Catholic fellows, with your
ceremonial and legerdemain, give a much better entertainment.Besides, I like to hear your priests soak it to their cowering
flocks.""I shall have to class you with the incorrigibles," he
said with a rueful air."I am sorry you take such a harsh attitude
toward us.We are really more spiritual--"

Ames interrupted with a roar of laughter."Why, Lafelle, you old fraud, I look upon your
Church as a huge business institution, a gigantic trust, as mercenary
and merciless as Steel, Oil, or Tobacco!Why, you and I are in the
same business, that of making money!And I'd like to borrow some of
your methods.Only, you've got it over me, for you
hurl the weight of centuries of authority upon the poor, trembling
public; and I have to beat them down with clubs of my own making.Moreover, the law protects you in all your pious methods; while I have
to hire expensive legal talent to get around it.""You seem to be fairly successful, even at that," retorted Lafelle.Then, too politic to draw his host into an acrimonious argument that
might end in straining their now cordial and mutually helpful
friendship, he observed, looking at his cigar: "May I ask what you pay
for these?--for only an inexhaustible bank reserve can warrant their
like."He had struck the right chord, and Ames softened at once."These," he
said, tenderly regarding the thick, black weed in his fingers, "are
grown exclusively for me on my own plantation in Colombia.They cost
me about one dollar and sixty-eight cents each, laid down at my door
in New York.I searched the world over before I found the only spot
where such tobacco could be grown."continued Lafelle, lifting his glass of sparkling
champagne."On a little hillside, scarcely an acre in extent, in Granada, Spain,"
replied Ames."I have my own wine press and bottling plant there."Lafelle could not conceal his admiration for this man of luxury."And
does your exclusiveness extend also to your tea and coffee?""I grow tea for my table in both China and
Ceylon.And I have exclusive coffee plantations in Java and Brazil.But I'm now negotiating for one in Colombia, for I think that, without
doubt, the finest coffee in the world is grown there, although it
never gets beyond the coast line.""_Fortuna non deo_," murmured the churchman; "you man of chance and
destiny!""My friend," said he, "I have always insisted
that I possessed but a modicum of brains; but I am a gambler.With ordinary judgment and horse-sense, I take risks that
no so-called sane man would consider.The curse of the world is
fear--the chief instrument that you employ to hold the masses to your
churchly system.I know that as long as a
business opponent has fear to contend with, I am his master.Fear is
at the root of every ailment of mind, body, or environment.I repeat,
I know not the meaning of the word.Hence my position in the business
world.Hence, also, my freedom from the limitations of superstition,
religious or otherwise."Yes," replied Lafelle, drawing a long sigh, "in a sense I do.But you
greatly err, my friend, in deprecating your own powerful intellect.I
know of no brain but yours that could have put South Ohio Oil from one
hundred and fifty dollars up to over two thousand a share.I had a few
shares of that stock myself."Sorry I didn't know about it," he said.I didn't own a dollar's worth of South Ohio.Oh,
yes," he added, as he saw Lafelle's eyes widening in surprise, "I
pushed the market up until a certain lady, whom you and I both know,
thought it unwise to go further, and then I sprung the sudden
discovery of Colombian oil fields on them; and the market crashed
like a burst balloon.The lady cleared some two millions on the rig.No, I didn't have a drop of Colombian oil to grease the chute.It was
American nerve, that's all.""If you had lived in the Middle Ages you'd
have been burnt for possessing a devil!""On the contrary," quickly amended Ames, his eyes twinkling, "I'd have
been made a Cardinal."Both men laughed over the retort; and then Ames summoned the valet to
set in motion the great electrical pipe-organ, and to bring the
whiskey and soda.For the next hour the two men gave themselves up to the supreme luxury
of their magnificent environment, the stimulation of their beverage
and cigars, and the soothing effect of the soft music, combined with
the gentle movement of the boat.Then Ames took his guest into the
smoking room proper, and drew up chairs before a small table, on which
were various papers and writing materials."Now," he began, "referring to your telephone message of this morning,
what is it that you want me to do for you?Is it the old question of
establishing a nunciature at Washington?"Lafelle had been impatiently awaiting this moment.He therefore
plunged eagerly into his subject.Ames," said he, "I know you to
have great influence at the Capital.In the interests of humanity, I
ask you to use that influence to prevent the passage of the
immigration bill which provides for a literacy test."There was no need of this request; for, in the
interests, not of humanity, but of his own steamship companies, he
intended that there should be no restriction imposed upon immigration.But the Church was again playing into his hands, coming to him for
favors.And the Church always paid heavily for his support.he exclaimed with an assumption of interest, "so you ask me to
impugn my own patriotism!""I don't quite understand," he said."Why," Ames explained, "how long do you figure it will take, with
unrestricted immigration, for the Catholics to so outnumber the
Protestants in the United States as to establish their religion by law
and force it into the schools?""But your Constitution provides toleration for all
religions!""And the Constitution is quite flexible, and wholly subject to
amendment, is it not?"Lafelle flared out in unrestrained anger."What a bugaboo you
Protestants make of Roman Catholicism!"Why,
one would think that we Catholics were all anarchists!Are we such a
menace, such a curse to your Republican institutions?Do you ever stop
to realize what the Church has done for civilization, and for your
own country?And where, think you, would art and learning be now but
for her?Have you any adequate idea what the Church is doing
to-day for the poor, for the oppressed?You Protestants,
a thousand times more intolerant than we, treat us as if we were
Hindoo pariahs!This whole country is suffering from the delirium of
Roman Catholic-phobia!"There, my friend, calm yourself," soothed Ames, laying a hand on the
irate churchman's arm."And please do not class me with the
Protestants, for I am not one of them.You Catholic fellows have made
admirable gains in the past few years, and your steady encroachments
have netted you about ninety per cent of all the political offices in
and about Washington, so you have no complaint, even if the Church
isn't in politics.Meantime, his brain was working
rapidly."By the way, Lafelle," he said, abruptly resuming the
conversation, "you know all about church laws and customs, running way
back to mediaeval times.Can't you dig up some old provision whereby I
can block a fellow who claims to own a gold mine down in Colombia?If
you can, I'll see that the President vetoes every obnoxious
immigration bill that's introduced this term."Lafelle roused from his sulk and gulped down his wrath.Ames went on
to express his desire for vengeance upon one obscure Philip O. Ketchim,
broker, promoter, church elder, and Sunday school superintendent.Then at length Ames rose and rang for his valet."My God, Lafelle, the
idea's a corker!""From a book entitled 'Confessions of a Roman
Catholic Priest,' written anonymously, but, they say, by a young
attache of the Vatican who was insane at the time.However, he was apparently well informed on matters Colombian.""The law of _'en manos muertas'_," replied Lafelle."Well," exclaimed Ames, "again I take off my hat to your churchly
system!And now," he continued eagerly, "cable the Pope at once.I'll
have the operator send your code ashore by wireless, and the message
will go to Rome to-night.Tell the old man you've got influence at
work in Washington that is--well, more than strong, and that the
prospects for defeating the immigration bill are excellent."Lafelle arose and stood for a moment looking about the room."Before I
retire, my friend," he said, "I would like to express again the
admiration which the tasteful luxury of this smoking room has aroused
in me, and to ask, if I may, whether those stained-glass windows up
there are merely fanciful portraits?"Ames quickly glanced up at the faces of the beautiful women portrayed
in the rectangular glass windows which lined the room just below the
ceiling.They were exquisitely painted, in vivid colors, and so set as
to be illuminated during the day by sunlight, and at night by strong
electric lamps behind them."Because," returned Lafelle, "if I mistake not, I have seen a portrait
similar to that one," pointing up at one of the windows, where a sad,
wistful face of rare loveliness looked down upon them.In his complete absorption he had not noticed the
effect of his query upon Ames."I do not know," he replied slowly."London--Paris--Berlin--no, not there.And yet, it was in Europe, I am
sure."In the--Royal Gallery--at Madrid!""Yes," continued Lafelle confidently, still studying the portrait, "I
am certain of it.But," turning abruptly upon Ames, "you may have
known the original?""I assure you I never had that
pleasure," he said lightly."These art windows were set in by the
designer of the yacht.Adds much to the
general effect, don't you think?By the way, if a portrait similar to
that one hangs in the Royal Gallery at Madrid, you might try to learn
the identity of the original for me.It's quite interesting to feel
that one may have the picture of some bewitching member of royalty
hanging in his own apartments.By all means try to learn who the lady
is--unless you know."He stopped and searched the churchman's face.But--that picture
has haunted me from the day I first saw it in the Royal Gallery."Crafts, of 'Storrs and Crafts,'" replied Ames.Lafelle moved thoughtfully toward the door.The valet appeared at that
moment."Show Monsignor to his stateroom," commanded Ames."Good night,
Monsignor, good night.Remember, we dock at seven-thirty, sharp."Returning to the table, Ames sat down and rapidly composed a message
for his wireless operator to send across the dark waters to the city,
and thence to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, in Cartagena.This done, he
extinguished all the lights in the room excepting those which
illuminated the stained-glass windows above.Drawing his chair up in
front of the one which had stirred Lafelle's query, he sat before it
far into the morning, in absorbed contemplation, searching the sad
features of the beautiful face, pondering, revolving, sometimes
murmuring aloud, sometimes passing a hand across his brow, as if he
would erase from a relentless memory an impression made long since and
worn ever deeper by the recurrent thought of many years.CHAPTER 14


Almost within the brief period of a year, the barefoot, calico-clad
Carmen had been ejected from unknown Simiti and dropped into the midst
of the pyrotechnical society life of the great New World metropolis.Only an unusual interplay of mental forces could have brought about
such an odd result.But that it was a very logical outcome of the
reaction upon one another of human ambitions, fears, lust, and greed,
operating through the types of mind among which her life had been
cast, those who have followed our story thus far can have no doubt.The cusp of the upward-sweeping curve had been reached through the
insane eagerness of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to outdo her wealthy society
rivals in an arrogant display of dress, living, and vain, luxurious
entertaining, and the acquisition of the empty honor attaching to
social leadership.The coveted prize was now all but within the
shallow woman's grasp.she knew not that when her itching
fingers closed about it the golden bauble would crumble to ashes.The program as outlined by the Beaubien had been faithfully followed.Hawley-Crowles--whom, of course, she
had long desired to know more intimately--and an interchange of calls
had ensued, succeeded by a grand reception at the Ames mansion, the
first of the social season.Hawley-Crowles floated, as
upon a cloud, attired in a French gown which cost fifteen hundred
dollars, and shoes on her disproportioned feet for which she had
rejoiced to pay thirty dollars each, made as they had been from
specially selected imported leather, dyed to match her rich robe.It
was true, her pleasure had not been wholly unalloyed, for she had been
conscious of a trace of superciliousness on the part of some of the
gorgeous birds of paradise, twittering and hopping in their hampering
skirts about the Ames parlors, and pecking, with milk-fed content, at
the rare cakes and ices.But she only held her empty head the higher,
and fluttered about the more ostentatiously and clumsily, while
anticipating the effect which her charming and talented ward would
produce when she should make her bow to these same vain, haughty
devotees of the cult of gold.And she had wisely planned that Carmen's
_debut_ should follow that of Kathleen Ames, that it might eclipse her
rival's in its wanton display of magnificence.On the heels of the Ames reception surged the full flood of the
winter's social orgy.Early in November Kathleen Ames was duly
presented.The occasion was made one of such stupendous display that
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles first gasped, then shivered with apprehension,
lest she be unable to outdo it.She went home from it in a somewhat
chastened frame of mind, and sat down at her _escritoire_ to make
calculations.Could she on her meager annual income of one hundred and
fifty thousand hope to meet the Ames millions?She had already allowed
that her wardrobe would cost not less than twenty-five thousand
dollars a year, to say nothing of the additional expense of properly
dressing Carmen.But she now saw that this amount was hopelessly
inadequate.She therefore increased the figure to seventy-five
thousand.Could she maintain her
city home, entertain in the style now demanded by her social position,
and spend her summers at Newport, as she had planned?No, her income would not suffice; she would be obliged to
draw on the principal until Carmen could be married off to some
millionaire, or until her own father died.if he would only
terminate his useless existence soon!But, in lieu of that delayed desideratum, some expedient must be
devised at once.That obscure, retiring
woman was annually making her millions.A tip now and then from her, a
word of advice regarding the market, and her own limited income would
expand accordingly.She had not seen the Beaubien since becoming a
member of Holy Saints.But on that day, and again, two months later,
when the splendid altar to the late lamented and patriotic citizen,
the Honorable James Hawley-Crowles, was dedicated, she had marked the
woman, heavily veiled, sitting alone in the rear of the great church.She had shuddered as she
thought the tall, black-robed figure typified an ominous shadow
falling athwart her own foolish existence.But there was no doubt of Carmen's hold on the strange, tarnished
woman.And so, smothering her doubts and pocketing her pride, she
again sought the Beaubien, ostensibly in regard to Carmen's
forthcoming _debut_; and then, very adroitly and off-handedly, she
brought up the subject of investments, alleging that the added burden
of the young girl now rendered it necessary to increase the rate of
interest which her securities were yielding.The Beaubien proved herself the soul of candor and generosity.Not
only did she point out to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles how her modest income
might be quadrupled, but she even offered, in such a way as to make it
utterly impossible for that lady to take offense, to lend her whatever
amount she might need, at any time, to further Carmen's social
conquest.And during the conversation she announced that she herself
was acting on a suggestion dropped by the great financier, Ames, and
was buying certain stocks now being offered by a coming power in world
finance, Mr.Hawley-Crowles had heard of this man!Was he not
promoting a company in which her sister's husband, and the girl
herself, were interested?And if such investments were good enough for
a magnate of Ames's standing, they certainly were good enough for her.Indeed, why had she not thought of
this before!She would get Carmen to hypothecate her own interest in
this new company, if necessary.That interest of itself was worth a
fortune.Hawley-Crowles and Carmen so desired, the
Beaubien would advance them whatever they might need on that
security alone.Or, she would take the personal notes of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles--"For, you know, my dear," she said sweetly, "when
your father passes away you are going to be very well off, indeed, and
I can afford to discount that inevitable event somewhat, can I
not?"Hawley-Crowles soared into the empyrean, and this
self-absorbed woman, who never in her life had earned the equivalent
of a single day's food, launched the sweet, white-souled girl of
the tropics upon the oozy waters of New York society with such
_eclat_ that the Sunday newspapers devoted a whole page, profusely
illustrated, to the gorgeous event and dilated with much extravagance
of expression upon the charms of the little Inca princess, and
upon the very important and gratifying fact that the three hundred
fashionable guests present displayed jewels to the value of not less
than ten million dollars.The function took the form of a musicale, in which Carmen's rich
voice was first made known to the _beau monde_.The girl instantly
swept her auditors from their feet.The splendid pipe-organ, which
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles had hurriedly installed for the occasion,
became a thing inspired under her deft touch.It seemed in that
garish display of worldliness to voice her soul's purity, its
wonder, its astonishment, its lament over the vacuities of this
highest type of human society, its ominous threats of thundered
denunciation on the day when her tongue should be loosed and the
present mesmeric spell broken--for she was under a spell, even
that of this new world of tinsel and material veneer.Gannette wept on Carmen's shoulder, and went
home vowing that she would be a better woman and cut out her night-cap
of Scotch-and-soda.Others crowded about the girl and showered their
fulsome praise upon her.Ames and her daughter
Kathleen.They stared at the lovely _debutante_ with wonder and
chagrin written legibly upon their bepowdered visages.And before the
close of the function Kathleen had become so angrily jealous that she
was grossly rude to Carmen when she bade her good night.For her own
feeble light had been drowned in the powerful radiance of the girl
from Simiti.And from that moment the assassination of the character
of the little Inca princess was decreed.But, what with incessant striving to adapt herself to her environment,
that she might search its farthest nook and angle; what with ceaseless
efforts to check her almost momentary impulse to cry out against the
vulgar display of modernity and the vicious inequity of privilege
which she saw on every hand; what with her purity of thought; her rare
ideals and selfless motives; her boundless love for humanity; and her
passionate desire to so live her "message" that all the world might
see and light their lamps at the torch of her burning love for God and
her fellow-men, Carmen found her days a paradox, in that they were
literally full of emptiness.After her _debut_, event followed event
in the social life of the now thoroughly gay metropolis, and the poor
child found herself hustled home from one function, only to change her
attire and hurry again, weary of spirit, into the waiting car, to be
whisked off to another equally vapid.It seemed to the bewildered girl
that she would never learn what was _de rigueur_; what conventions
must be observed at one social event, but amended at another.Her
tight gowns and limb-hampering skirts typified the soul-limitation of
her tinsel, environment; her high-heeled shoes were exquisite torture;
and her corsets, which her French maid drew until the poor girl gasped
for air, seemed to her the cruellest device ever fashioned by the
vacuous, enslaved human mind.Frequently she changed her clothing
completely three and four times a day to meet her social demands.Night became day; and she had to learn to sleep until noon.She found
no time for study; none even for reading.And conversation, such as
was indulged under the Hawley-Crowles roof, was confined to insipid
society happenings, with frequent sprinklings of racy items anent
divorce, scandal, murder, or the debauch of manhood.From this she
drew more and more aloof and became daily quieter.It was seldom, too, that she could escape from the jaded circle of
society revelers long enough to spend a quiet hour with the Beaubien.But when she could, she would open the reservoirs of her soul and give
full vent to her pent-up emotions."Oh," she would often exclaim, as
she sat at the feet of the Beaubien in the quiet of the darkened music
room, and gazed into the crackling fire, "how can they--how can
they!"Then the Beaubien would pat her soft, glowing cheek and murmur, "Wait,
dearie, wait."And the tired girl would sigh and close her eyes and
dream of the quiet of little Simiti and of the dear ones there from
whom she now heard no word, and yet whom she might not seek, because
of the war which raged about her lowly birthplace.The gay season was hardly a month advanced when Mrs.Ames angrily
admitted to herself that her own crown was in gravest danger.The
South American girl--and because of her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her
blase sister--had completely captured New York's conspicuous circle.Hawley-Crowles apparently did not lack for funds, but entertained
with a display of reckless disregard for expense, and a carelessness
of critical comment, that stirred the city to its depths and aroused
expressions of wonder and admiration on every hand.The newspapers
were full of her and her charming ward.Surely, if the girl's social
prestige continued to soar, the Ames family soon would be relegated to
the social "has-beens."Ames and her haughty daughter held
many a serious conference over their dubious prospects.Night after night, when the Beaubien's dinner
guests had dispersed, he would linger to discuss the social war now in
full progress, and to exchange with her witty comments on the
successes of the combatants.One night he announced, "Lafelle is in
England; and when he returns he is coming by way of the West Indies.I
shall cable him to stop for a week at Cartagena, to see Wenceslas on a
little matter of business for me."Hawley-Crowles has become
nicely enmeshed in his net," she returned."The altar to friend Jim is
a beauty.Also, I hear that she is going to finance Ketchim's mining
company in Colombia.""I learned to-day that Ketchim's engineer, Harris,
has returned to the States.Couldn't get up the Magdalena river, on
account of the fighting.There will be nothing doing there for a year
yet.""Just as well," commented the Beaubien.Then abruptly--"By the way, I
now hold Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's notes to the amount of two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars.I want you to buy them from me and be ready to
turn the screws when I tell you."he exclaimed, pinching her
cheek.I'll take them off your hands to-morrow.And by the
way, I must meet this Carmen.""You let her alone," said the Beaubien quickly in a low voice.*       *       *       *       *

The inauguration of the Grand Opera season opened to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
another avenue for her astonishing social activities.With rare
shrewdness she had contrived to outwit Mrs.Ames and secure the center
box in the "golden horseshoe" at the Metropolitan.There, like a gaudy
garden spider in its glittering web, she sat on the opening night,
with her rapt _protegee_ at her side, and sent her insolent challenge
broadcast.Multimillionaires and their haughty, full-toileted dames were
ranged on either side of her, brewers and packers, distillers and
patent medicine concoctors, railroad magnates and Board of Trade
plungers, some under indictment, others under the shadow of death,
all under the mesmeric charm of gold.In the box at her left sat the
Ames family, with their newly arrived guests, the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her son.Ames was smiling
and affable when she exchanged calls with the gorgeous occupants of
the Hawley-Crowles box."So chawmed to meet you," murmured the heir of Altern, a callow youth
of twenty-three, bowing over the dainty, gloved hand of Carmen.Then,
as he adjusted his monocle and fixed his jaded eyes upon the fresh
young girl, "Bah Jove!"The gigantic form of Ames wedged in between the young man and Carmen."I've heard a lot about you," he said genially, in a heavy voice that
harmonized well with his huge frame; "but we haven't had an
opportunity to get acquainted until to-night."For some moments he stood holding her hand and looking steadily at
her.The girl gazed up at him with her trustful brown eyes alight, and
a smile playing about her mouth.While she chatted brightly Ames held her hand and laughed at her
frank, often witty, remarks.But then a curious, eager look came into
his face, and he became quiet and reflective.He seemed unable to take
his eyes from her.And when the girl gently drew her hand from his he
laughed again, nervously."I--I know something about Colombia," he said, "and speak the language
a bit.We'll have to get together often, so's I can brush up."Hawley-Crowles and her sister for the
first time--"Oh, so glad to see you both!Camorso's in fine voice
to-night, eh?"He wheeled about and stood again looking at Carmen, until she blushed
under his close gaze and turned her head away.But throughout the evening, whenever the girl looked in the
direction of the Ames family, she met the steady, piercing gaze of the
man's keen gray eyes.And they seemed to her like sharp steel points,
cutting into the portals of her soul.Night after night during the long season Carmen sat in the box and
studied the operas that were produced on the boards before her
wondering gaze.Hawley-Crowles was with her.And
generally, too, the young heir of Altern was there, occupying the
chair next to the girl--which was quite as the solicitous Mrs."Aw--deucedly fine show to-night, Miss Carmen," the youth ventured one
evening, as he took his accustomed place close to her."The music is always beautiful," the girl responded."But the play,
like most of Grand Opera, is drawn from the darkest side of human
life.It is a sordid picture of licentiousness and cruelty.Only for
its setting in wonderful music, Grand Opera is generally such a
depiction of sex-passion, of lust and murder, that it would not be
permitted on the stage.A few years from now people will be horrified
to remember that the preceding generation reveled in such blood
scenes--just as we now speak with horror of the gladiatorial contests
in ancient Rome.""But--aw--Miss Carmen," he
hazarded, "we must be true to life, you know!"Having delivered
himself of this oracular statement, the youth adjusted his monocle and
settled back as if he had given finality to a weighty argument."You voice the cant of the modern
writer, 'true lo life.'True to the horrible, human sense of life,
that looks no higher than the lust of blood, and is satisfied with it,
I admit.True to the unreal, temporal sense of existence, that is here
to-day, and to-morrow has gone out in the agony of self-imposed
suffering and death.True to that awful, false sense of life which we
must put off if we would ever rise into the consciousness of _real_
life, I grant you.But the production of these horrors on the stage,
even in a framework of marvelous music, serves only to hold before us
the awful models from which we must turn if we would hew out a better
existence.Are you the better for seeing an exhibition of wanton
murder on the stage, even though the participants wondrously sing
their words of vengeance and passion?""But--aw--they serve as warnings; they show us the things we ought not
to do, don't you know.""The sculptor who would chisel a beautiful form, does he
set before him the misshapen body of a hunchback, in order that he may
see what not to carve?""And we who would transform the
human sense of life into one of freedom from evil, can we build a
perfect structure with such grewsome models as this before us?You
don't see it now," she sighed; "you are in the world, and of it; and
the world is deeply under the mesmeric belief of evil as a stern
reality.But the day is coming when our musicians and authors will
turn from such base material as this to nobler themes--themes which
will excite our wonder and admiration, and stimulate the desire for
purity of thought and deed--themes that will be beacon lights, and
true guides.Hawley-Crowles frowned heavily as she listened to this
conversation, and she drew a sigh of relief when Carmen, sensing the
futility of any attempt to impress her thought upon the young man,
turned to topics which he could discuss with some degree of
intelligence.Late in the evening Ames dropped in and came directly to the
Hawley-Crowles box.He brought a huge box of imported candy and a
gorgeous bouquet of orchids, which he presented to Carmen.Hawley-Crowles beamed upon him like the effulgent midday sun."Kathleen wants you, Reggy," Ames abruptly announced to the young man,
whose lips were molding into a pout.His huge bulk loomed over the younger man like a
mountain as he took him by the shoulders and turned him toward the
exit.protested the youth, with a vain show
of resistance.Ames said nothing; but his domineering personality forced the boy out
of the box and into the corridor.Then he took the seat which his evicted nephew
had vacated, and bent over Carmen.With a final hopeless survey of the
situation, Reginald turned and descended to the cloak room, muttering
dire but futile threats against his irresistible relative.Ames's manner unconsciously assumed an air of
patronage."This is the first real opportunity I've had to talk with
you.Tell me, what do you think of New York?""Well," she began uncertainly, "since I have
thawed out, or perhaps have become more accustomed to the cold, I have
begun to make mental notes.But they
are not yet classified, and so I can hardly answer your question, Mr.But I am sure of one thing, and that is that for the first few
months I was here I was too cold to even think!""Yes," he agreed, "the change from the tropics was
somewhat abrupt."It is like awaking from a deep sleep," answered Carmen meditatively."In Simiti we dream our lives away.In New York all is action; loud
words; harsh commands; hurry; rush; endeavor, terrible, materialistic
endeavor!Every person I see seems to be going somewhere.He may not
know where he is going--but he is on the way.He may not know why he
is going--but he must not be stopped.He has so few years to live; and
he must pile up money before he goes.He must own an automobile; he
must do certain things which his more fortunate neighbor does, before
his little flame of life goes out and darkness falls upon him.I
sometimes think that people here are trying to get away from
themselves, but they don't know it.I think they come to the opera
because they crave any sort of diversion that will make them forget
themselves for a few moments, don't you?"well, I can't say," was Ames's meaningless reply, as he sat
regarding the girl curiously."And," she continued, as if pleased to have an auditor who at least
pretended to understand her, "the thing that now strikes me most
forcibly is the great confusion that prevails here in everything, in
your government, in your laws, in your business, in your society, and,
in particular, in your religion.Why, in that you have hundreds of
sects claiming a monopoly of truth; you have hundreds of churches,
hundreds of religious or theological beliefs, hundreds of differing
concepts of God--but you get nowhere!Why, it has come to such a pass
that, if Jesus were to appear physically on earth to-day, I am sure he
would be evicted from his own Church!""Well, yes, I guess that's so," commented Ames, quite at sea in such
conversation."But we solid business men have found that religious
emotion never gets a man anywhere.Makes a man
effeminate, and utterly unfits him for business.I wouldn't have a man
in my employ who was a religious enthusiast.""But Jesus was a religious enthusiast," she protested."I doubt if there ever was such a person," he answered dryly."Why, the Bible--"

"Is the most unfortunate and most misunderstood piece of literature
ever written," he interrupted."And the Church, well, I regard it as
the greatest fraud ever perpetrated upon the human race.""You mean that to apply to every church?"But their thoughts were running in widely divergent
channels.The conversational topic of the moment had no interest
whatsoever for the man.But this brilliant, sparkling girl--there was
something in those dark eyes, that soft voice, that brown hair--by
what anomaly did this beautiful creature come out of desolate,
mediaeval Simiti?Ames, you do not know what religion is.""It is that which binds us to God."No, he knew not the meaning of the word.His thought
broke restraint and flew wildly back--but he caught it, and rudely
forced it into its wonted channel.But, did he love his fellow-men?What would that profit him in dollars and cents?The thought brought a cynical laugh to
his lips.Carmen looked up at him wonderingly."You will have to, you
know," she said quixotically.Then she reached out a hand and laid it on his.He looked down at it,
so soft, so white, so small, and he contrasted it with the huge, hairy
bulk of his own.He felt it, felt
himself yielding.He was beginning to look beyond the beautiful
features, the rare grace and charm of physical personality, which had
at first attracted only the baser qualities of his nature, and was
seeing glimpses of a spiritual something which lay back of all
that--infinitely more beautiful, unspeakably richer, divine, sacred,
untouchable."Of course you will attend the Charity Ball, Mr.Hawley-Crowles jarred upon his ear like a shrill discord."But I shall be represented by my family.Hawley-Crowles, taking the query to
herself."That is, if my French dressmaker does not fail me.She
arched her brows at him as she propounded this innocent question."I'll tell you what it is this year," he sagely
replied.He gave a sententious nod of
his head."I overheard Kathleen and her mother discussing plans.And--do you want to know next season's innovation?He stopped and laughed heartily at his own treasonable
deceit.Hawley-Crowles eagerly, as she drew her
chair closer."One condition," replied Ames, holding up a thick finger."Well, I want to get better acquainted with your charming ward," he
whispered."Of course; and I want you to know her better." wigs," said Ames, with a knowing look.Hawley-Crowles settled back with a smile of supreme satisfaction.She would boldly anticipate next season at the coming Charity Ball.Then, leaning over toward Ames, she laid her fan upon his arm."Can't
you manage to come and see us some time, my sister and Carmen?"Just call me up a little in advance."The blare of trumpets and the crash of drums drew their attention
again to the stage.A business
associate in a distant box had beckoned him.Hawley-Crowles
dismissed him reluctantly; then turned her wandering attention to the
play.But Carmen sat shrouded in thoughts that were not stimulated by the
puppet-show before her.The tenor shrieked out his tender passion, and
the tubby soprano sank into his inadequate arms with languishing
sighs.Carmen heeded not their stage amours.She saw in the glare
before her the care-lined face of the priest of Simiti; she saw the
grim features and set jaw of her beloved, black-faced Rosendo, as he
led her through the dripping jungle; she saw Anita's blind, helpless
babe; she saw the little newsboy of Cartagena; and her heart welled
with a great love for them all; and she buried her face in her hands
and wept softly.CHAPTER 15

"Wait, my little princess, wait," the Beaubien had said, when Carmen,
her eyes flowing and her lips quivering, had again thrown herself into
that strange woman's arms and poured out her heart's surcease."I want to go back to Simiti, to Padre Jose, to my home," wailed the
girl."I don't understand the ways and the thoughts of these people.They don't know God--they don't know what love is--they don't know
anything but money, and clothes, and sin, and death.When I am with
them I gasp, I choke--"

"Yes, dearest, I understand," murmured the woman softly, as she
stroked the brown head nestling upon her shoulder.And many even of the 'four hundred' are suffering from the
same disease; but they would die rather than admit it.To no one could the attraction which had drawn Carmen and the Beaubien
together seem stranger, more inexplicable, than to that lone woman
herself.And both acknowledged it, nor
would have had it otherwise.To Carmen, the Beaubien was a sympathetic
confidante and a wise counselor.The girl knew nothing of the woman's
past or present life.She tried to see in her only the reality which
she sought in every individual--the reality which she felt that Jesus
must have seen clearly back of every frail mortal concept of humanity.And in doing this, who knows?--she may have transformed the sordid,
soiled woman of the world into something more than a broken semblance
of the image of God.To the Beaubien, this rare child, the symbol of
love, of purity, had become a divine talisman, touching a dead soul
into a sense of life before unknown.If Carmen leaned upon her, she,
on the other hand, bent daily closer to the beautiful girl; opened her
slowly warming heart daily wider to her; twined her lonely arms daily
closer about the radiant creature who had come so unexpectedly into
her empty, sinful life."But, mother dear"--the Beaubien had long since begged Carmen always
to address her thus when they were sharing alone these hours of
confidence--"they will not listen to my message!They laugh and jest
about real things!"And yet you tell me that the Bible says wise men
laughed at the great teacher, Jesus."And his message--oh, mother dearest, his message would have
helped them so, if they had only accepted it!It would have changed
their lives, healed their diseases, and saved them from death.And my
message"--her lip quivered--"my message is only his--it is the message
of love.But--I am so out of place among them.Their talk is so coarse, so
low and degraded.They don't
know what miserable failures they all are.Hawley-Crowles--"

The Beaubien's jaw set.--she will not let me speak of God in her house.She told me to keep
my views to myself and never voice them to her friends.And she says I
must marry either a millionaire or a foreign noble."And become a snobbish expatriate!Marry a decadent count, and
then shake the dust of this democratic country from your feet forever!Go to London or Paris or Vienna, and wear tiaras and coronets, and
speak of disgraceful, boorish America in hushed whispers!She forgets that the tarnished name she bears was
dragged up out of the ruck of the impecunious by me when I received
Jim Crowles into my house!And that I gave him what little gloss he
was able to take on!""Mother dear--I would leave them--only, they need love, oh, so much!"The Beaubien strained her to her bosom."They need you, dearie; they
little realize how they need you!I, myself, did not know until you
came to me.There, I didn't mean to let those tears get away from
me."She laughed softly as Carmen looked up anxiously into her face."Now come," she went on brightly, "we must plan for the Charity
Ball."A look of pain swept over the girl's face.The Beaubien bent and
kissed her."You will not leave society
voluntarily.They
will light their own lamps at yours--or they will thrust you from
their doors.And then," she muttered, as her teeth snapped together,
"you will come to me."Close on the heels of the opera season followed the Charity Ball, the
Horse Show, and the Fashion Show in rapid succession, with numberless
receptions, formal parties, and nondescript social junketings
interspersed.During these fleeting hours of splash and glitter Mrs.Hawley-Crowles trod the air with the sang-froid and exhilaration of an
expert aviator.Backed by the Beaubien millions, and with the
wonderful South American girl always at her right hand, the
worldly ambitious woman swept everything before her, cut a social
swath far wider than the glowering Mrs.Ames had ever attempted, and
marched straight to the goal of social leadership, almost without
interference.She had apparently achieved other successes, too, of
the first importance.She had secured the assistance of Ames himself
in matters pertaining to her finances; and the Beaubien was
actively cooeperating with her in the social advancement of Carmen.It is true, she gasped whenever her thought wandered to her notes
which the Beaubien held, notes which demanded every penny of her
principal as collateral.And she often meditated very soberly over
the large sums which she had put into the purchase of Simiti stock,
at the whispered suggestions of Ames, and under the irresistibly
pious and persuasive eloquence of Philip O. Ketchim, now president
of that flourishing but as yet non-productive company.But then, one
day, an idea occurred to her, and she forthwith summoned Carmen into
the library."You see, my dear," she said, after expounding to the girl certain of
her thoughts anent the famous mine, "I do not want Mr.Ketchim to have
any claim upon you for the expense which he incurred on account of
your six months in the Elwin school.That thought, as well as others
relating to your complete protection, makes it seem advisable that you
transfer to me your share in the mine, or in the Simiti company.See,
I give you a receipt for the same, showing that you have done this as
part payment for the great expense to which I have been put in
introducing you to society and in providing for your wants here.It is
merely formal, of course.And it keeps your share still in our
family, of which you are and always will be a member; but yet removes
all liability from you.Of course, you know nothing about business
matters, and so you must trust me implicitly.Which I am sure you do,
in view of what I have done for you, don't you, dear?"Of course Carmen did; and of course she unhesitatingly transferred her
claim on La Libertad to the worthy Mrs.Whereupon the
good woman tenderly kissed the innocent child, and clasped a string of
rich pearls about the slender, white neck.And Carmen later told the
Beaubien, who said nothing, but frowned darkly as she repeated the
tidings over her private wire to J. Wilton Ames.But that priest of
finance only chuckled and exclaimed: "Excellent, my dear!By the way, I had a cable from Lafelle this morning, from
Cartagena.But the
Beaubien hung up the receiver with a presentiment that everything was
far from right, despite his bland assurance.And she regretted
bitterly now that she had not warned Carmen against this very thing.The Charity Ball that season was doubtless the most brilliant function
of its kind ever held among a people who deny the impossible.The
newspapers had long vied with one another in their advertisements and
predictions; they afterward strove mightily to outdo themselves in
their vivid descriptions of the gorgeous _fete_.The decorative
effects far excelled anything ever attempted in the name of
"practical" charity.The display of gowns had never before been even
closely approximated.The scintillations from jewels whose value
mounted into millions was like the continuous flash of the electric
spark.And the huge assemblage embraced the very cream of the
nobility, the aristocracy, the rich and exclusive caste of a great
people whose Constitution is founded on the equality of men, and who
are wont to gather thus annually for a few hours to parade their
material vestments and divert their dispirited mentalities under the
guise of benefaction to a class for whom they rarely hold a loving
thought.Hawley-Crowles had planned and executed a _coup_.Ames had subscribed the munificent sum of twenty-five thousand
dollars to charity a week before the ball.Hawley-Crowles had
waited for this.Then she gloated as she telephoned to the various
newspaper offices that her subscription would be fifty thousand.Did
she give a new note to the Beaubien for this amount?That she
did--and she obtained the money on the condition that the little Inca
princess should lead the grand march.Hawley-Crowles
knew that she must gracefully yield first place to the South American
girl; and yet she contrived to score a triumph in apparent defeat.Ames and her daughter Kathleen at the
last moment refused to attend the function, alleging fatigue from a
season unusually exacting.Hawley-Crowles had
previously secured the languid young Duke of Altern as a partner for
Carmen--and then was most agreeably thwarted by Ames himself, who,
learning that his wife and daughter would not attend, abruptly
announced that he himself would lead the march with Carmen.Was it not quite proper that the city's leading man of
finance should, in the absence of his wife and daughter, and with
their full and gratuitous permission--nay, at their urgent request, so
it was told--lead with this fair young damsel, this tropical flower,
who, as rumor had it, was doubtless a descendant of the royal dwellers
in ancient Cuzco?"Quite proper, _O tempora, O mores_!"murmured one Amos A. Hitt,
erstwhile Presbyterian divine, explorer, and gentleman of leisure, as
he settled back in his armchair in the fashionable Weltmore apartments
and exhaled a long stream of tobacco smoke through his wide nostrils."And, if I can procure a ticket, I shall give myself the pleasure of
witnessing this sacred spectacle, produced under the deceptive mask of
charity," he added.In vain the Beaubien labored with Ames when she learned of his
intention--though she said nothing to Carmen.Ames had yielded to her
previously expressed wish that he refrain from calling at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion, or attempting to force his attentions upon the
young girl.But in this matter he remained characteristically
obdurate.For the angry
Beaubien, striving to shield the innocent girl, had vented her
abundant wrath upon the affable Ames, and had concluded her
denunciation with a hint of possible exposure of certain dark facts of
which she was sole custodian.Ames smiled, bowed, and courteously
kissed her hand, as he left her stormy presence; but he did not yield.Through the perfumed air and the garish light tore the crashing notes
of the great band.The loud hum of voices ceased, and all eyes turned
to the leaders of the grand march, as they stepped forth at one end of
the great auditorium.Then an involuntary murmur arose from the
multitude--a murmur of admiration, of astonishment, of envy.The
gigantic form of Ames stood like a towering pillar, the embodiment of
potential force, the epitome of human power, physical and mental.His
massive shoulders were thrown back as if in haughty defiance of
comment, critical or commendatory.The smile which flitted about his
strong, clean-shaven face bespoke the same caution as the gentle
uplifting of a tiger's paw--behind it lay all that was humanly
terrible, cunning, heartless, and yet, in a sense, fascinating.His
thick, brown hair, scarcely touched with gray, lay about his great
head like a lion's mane.He raised a hand and gently pushed it back
over the lofty brow.Then he bent and offered an arm to the slender
wisp of a girl at his side.murmured a tall, angular man in the crowd."I don't know, Hitt," replied the friend addressed."But they say she
belongs to the Inca race."The graceful girl moving by the side of her giant escort seemed like a
slender ray of light, a radiant, elfish form, transparent, intangible,
gliding softly along with a huge, black shadow.She was simply clad,
all in white.About her neck hung a string of pearls, and at her waist
she wore the rare orchids which Ames had sent her that afternoon.No one marked the pure simplicity of her attire.The absence of sparkling jewels and resplendent raiment evoked no
comment.The multitude saw but her wonderful face; her big eyes,
uplifted in trustful innocence to the massive form at her side; her
rich brown hair, which glittered like string-gold in the strong light
that fell in torrents upon it.There's a nimbus about her head!""I could almost believe it," whispered that gentleman, straining his
long neck as she passed before him.Immediately behind Carmen and Ames strode the enraptured Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who saw not, neither heard, and who longed for no
further taste of heaven than this stupendous triumph which she had won
for herself and the girl.Her heavy, unshapely form was squeezed into
a marvelous costume of gold brocade.A double ballet ruffle of stiff
white tulle encircled it about the hips as a drapery.The bodice was
of heavy gold net.A pleated band of pale moire, in a delicate shade
of pink, crossed the left shoulder and was caught at the waist in a
large rose bow, ambassadorial style.A double necklace of diamonds,
one bearing a great pendant of emeralds, and the other an alternation
of emeralds and diamonds, encircled her short, thick neck.A diamond
coronet fitted well around her wonderful amber- wig--for, true
to her determination, she had anticipated the now _passee_ Mrs.Ames
and had boldly launched the innovation of  wigs among the smart
set.An ivory, hand-painted fan, of great value, dangled from her
thick wrist.And, as she lifted her skirts to an unnecessary height,
the gaping people caught the glitter of a row of diamonds in each
high, gilded heel.At her side the young Duke of Altern shuffled, his long, thin body
curved like a kangaroo, and his monocle bent superciliously upon the
mass of common clay about him."Aw, beastly crush, ye know," he
murmured from time to time to the unhearing dame at his right.And
then, as she replied not, he fell to wondering if she fully realized
who he was.Around and across the great hall the gorgeous pageant swept.The
big-mouthed horns bellowed forth their noisy harmony.In the distant
corridors great illuminated fountains softly plashed.At the tables
beyond, sedulous, touting waiters were hurriedly extracting corks from
frosted bottle necks.The rare porcelain and cut glass shone and
glittered in rainbow tints.The revelers waxed increasingly merry and
care-free as they lightly discussed poverty over rich viands and
sparkling Burgundy.Still further beyond, the massive oak doors, with
their leaded-glass panes, shut out the dark night and the bitter
blasts of winter.And they shut out, too, another, but none the less
unreal, externalization of the mortal thought which has found
expression in a social system "too wicked for a smile.""God, no--I'd get arrested!The frail, hungry woman who stood before the great doors clutched her
wretched shawl closer about her thin shoulders.Her teeth chattered as
she stood shivering in the chill wind.At the corner of the building the cold blast almost swept her off her
feet.A man, dirty and unkempt, who had been waiting in an alley, ran
out and seized her."I say, Jude, ain't ye goin' in?Git arrested--ye'd spend the night in
a warm cell, an' that's better'n our bunk, ain't it?""I'm goin' to French Lucy's," the woman whispered hoarsely.Ye've lost yer looks, Jude, an' ol' Lucy ain't a-goin' to take
ye in.We gotta snipe somepin quick--or starve!Look, we'll go down to
Mike's place, an' then come back here when it's out, and ye kin pinch
a string, or somepin, eh?For a moment she stood listening
to the music from within.A sob shook her, and she began to cough
violently.The man took her arm, not unkindly; and together they moved
away into the night.*       *       *       *       *

"Well, little girl, at last we are alone.He had, late in the evening,
secured seats well hidden behind a mass of palms, and thither had led
Carmen.Ever see
anything like this in Simiti?"She was
glad to get away for a moment from the crowd, from the confusion, and
from the unwelcome attentions of the now thoroughly smitten young Duke
of Altern."No," she finally made answer, "I didn't know there were such things
in the world."A new toy--one that would last a long time."Yes," he went on genially, "I'll wager there's millions of dollars'
worth of jewelry here to-night.""And are the people going to sell it and give the
money to the poor?""But--this is a--a charity--"

"Oh, I see.No, it's the money derived from the sale of
tickets that goes to the poor.""But--aren't you interested in the poor?""Of course, of course," he hastened to assure her, in his easy casual
tone.For a long time the girl sat reflecting, while he studied her,
speculating eagerly on her next remark.Then it came abruptly:

"Mr.Ames, I have thought a great deal about it, and I think you
people by your charity, such as this, only make more charity
necessary.Why don't you do away with poverty altogether?"Well, that's quite impossible, you know.'The poor
ye have always with you', eh?She was
deeply serious, for charity to her meant love, and love was all in
all."No," she finally replied, shaking her head, "you do _not_ know your
Bible.It is the poor thought that you have always with you, the
thought of separation from good.And that thought becomes manifested
outwardly in what is called poverty."He regarded her quizzically, while a smile played about his mouth."Why don't you get at the very root of the trouble, and destroy the
poverty-thought, the thought that there can be any separation from
God, who is infinite good?""Well, my dear girl, as for me, I don't know anything about God.As
for you, well, you are very innocent in worldly matters.Poverty, like
death, is inevitable, you know.""Well, well," he returned brightly, "that's good news!Then there is
no such thing as 'the survival of the fittest,' and the weak needn't
necessarily sink, eh?"Ames, that
you have survived as one of the fittest?"Well, now--what would you say about that?""I should say decidedly no," was the blunt reply.A dark shade crossed his face, and he bit his lip.People did not
generally talk thus to him.And yet--this wisp of a girl!how beautiful, as she sat there
beside him, her head erect, and her face delicately flushed.He
reached over and took her hand."You are the kind," she went on, "who give money to the poor, and then
take it away from them again.All the money which these rich people
here to-night are giving to charity has been wrested from the poor.And you give only a part of it back to them, at that.This Ball is
just a show, a show of dress and jewels.Why, it only sets an example
which makes others unhappy, envious, and discontented."My dear little girl," he said in a patronizing tone, "don't you think
you are assuming a great deal?I'm sure I'm not half so bad as you
paint me.""Well, the money you give away has got to come from
some source, hasn't it?And you manipulate the stock market and put
through wheat corners and all that, and catch the poor people and take
their money from them!But your idea of charity makes
me pity you.Up here I find a man can pile up hundreds of millions by
stifling competition, by debauching legislatures, by piracy and
legalized theft, and then give a tenth of it to found a university,
and so atone for his crimes.Oh, I know a lot
about such things!I've been studying and thinking a great deal since
I came to the United States."And there was a touch of
aspersion in his voice."I've come with a message," she replied eagerly."Well," he said sharply, "let me warn and advise you: don't join the
ranks of the muck-rakers, as most ambitious reformers with messages
do.I can tear down as easily as you or
anybody else.But to build something better is entirely another
matter.""Well, what is it, if I may
ask?"Well, perhaps that's so," he said, bending toward her and
again attempting to take her hand."I guess," she said, drawing back quickly, "you don't know what love
is, do you?""Of course I will," she said brightly.And you'll have to do just as I tell you," holding up an admonitory
finger."I'm yours to command, little woman," he returned in mock seriousness."Well," she began very softly, "you must first learn that love is just
as much a principle as the Binomial Theorem in algebra.And you must apply it just as you would apply any
principle, to everything."You sweet little thing," he murmured absently, gazing down into her
glowing face.I
wonder--I wonder if you really are a daughter of the Incas.""Yes," she said, "I am a
princess."You look like--I wonder--pshaw!"And--do you know?--I wish I might
be your prince."But then her bright
smile faded, and she looked off wistfully down the long corridor."I'll send him a challenge
to-night!""No," she murmured gently, "you can't.And,
oh, he was so good to me!He made me leave that country on account of
the war."This innocent girl little knew that one of
the instigators of that bloody revolution sat there beside her.Then a
new thought flashed into his brain."What is the full name of this
priest?""Jose--Jose de Rincon," she whispered reverently.Jose de Rincon--of Simiti--whom Wenceslas had made the scapegoat of
the revolution!And who, according to a
recent report from Wenceslas, had been arrested and--

"A--a--where did you say this--this Jose was, little girl?"You know, he never was a priest at heart.But, though he saw the
truth, in part, he was not able to prove it enough to set himself
free; and so when I came away he stayed behind to work out his
problem.And he will work it all out," she mused abstractedly, looking
off into the distance; "he will work it all out and come--to me.I
am--I am working with him, now--and for him.And--" her voice dropped
to a whisper, "I love him, oh, so much!"His mouth opened; then shut again with a
sharp snap.That beautiful creature now belonged to him, and to none
other!Were there other claimants, he would crush them without mercy!As for this apostate priest, Jose--humph!if he still lived he should
rot the rest of his days in the reeking dungeons of San Fernando!"When he comes to me," she said softly, "we are
going to give ourselves to the whole world.""And--perhaps--perhaps, by that time, you will be--be--"

"Well?"snapped the man, irritated by the return of her thought to
himself.Perhaps by that time you will--you will love everybody," she
murmured."Perhaps you won't go on piling up big mountains of money
that you can't use, and that you won't let anybody else use.""You will know then that Jesus founded his great empire on love.Your
empire, you know, is human business.But you will find that such
empires crumble and fall."Say," he exclaimed, turning full upon her and seeming to bear her
down by his tremendous personality, "you young and inexperienced
reformers might learn a few things, too, if your prejudices could be
surmounted.Has it ever occurred to you that we men of business think
not so much about accumulating money as about achieving success?Do
you suppose you could understand that money-making is but a side issue
with us?""Yes," the girl went on, as if in quiet soliloquy, "I suppose you
are--a tremendous worldly success.And this Ball--it is a splendid
success, too.Thousands of dollars will be raised for the poor.And
then, next year, the same thing will have to be done again.Your
charities cost you hundreds of millions every year up here.And,
meantime, you rich men will go right on making more money at the
expense of your fellow-men--and you will give a little of it to the
poor when the next Charity Ball comes around.It's like a circle,
isn't it?"she said, smiling queerly up at him."It has no end, you
know."Ames had now decided to swallow his annoyance and meet the girl with
the lance of frivolity."Yes, I guess that's so," he began."But of
course you will admit that the world is slowly getting better, and
that world-progress must of necessity be gradual.We can't reform all
in a minute, can we?""I don't know how fast you might reform if you
really, sincerely tried.And if
you, a great, big, powerful man, with the most wonderful opportunities
in the world, should really try to be a success, why--well, I'm sure
you'd make very rapid progress, and help others like you by setting
such a great example.For you are a wonderful man--you really are."Ames looked at her long and quizzically.Then
he took her hand, this time without resistance."Tell me, little girl--although I know there can be no doubt of
it--are you a success?"he ejaculated, "would
you mind telling me just why?"She smiled up at him, and her sweet trustfulness drew his sagging
heartstrings suddenly taut."Because," she said simply, "I strive every moment to 'acquire that
mind which was in Christ Jesus.'"From amusement to wonder, to irritation, to
anger, then to astonishment, and a final approximation to something
akin to reverent awe had been the swift course of the man's emotions
as he sat in this secluded nook beside this strange girl.The
poisoned arrows of his worldly thought had broken one by one against
the shield of her protecting faith.His badinage had returned to
confound himself.The desire to possess had utterly fled before the
conviction that such thought was as wildly impossible as iniquitous.Then he suddenly became conscious that the little body beside him had
drawn closer--that it was pressing against him--that a little hand had
stolen gently into his--and that a soft voice, soft as the summer
winds that sigh among the roses, was floating to his ears."To be really great is to be like that wonderful man, Jesus.It is to
know that through him the great Christ-principle worked and did those
things which the world will not accept, because it thinks them
miracles.It is to know that God is love, and to act that knowledge.It is to know that love is the Christ-principle, and that it will
destroy every error, every discord, everything that is unlike itself.It is to yield your present false sense of happiness and good to the
true sense of God as infinite good.It is to bring every thought into
captivity to this Christ-principle, love.It is to stop looking at
evil as a reality.It is to let go your hold on it, and let it fade
away before the wonderful truth that God is everywhere, and that there
isn't anything apart from Him.*       *       *       *       *

How long they sat in the quiet that followed, neither knew.Then the
man suffered himself to be led silently back to the ball room again.And when he had recovered and restored his worldly self, the bright
little image was no longer at his side."Stand here, Jude, an' when they begins to come out to their gasoline
carts grab anything ye can, an' git.The shivering woman crept closer to the curb, and the man slouched
back against the wall close to the exit from which the revelers would
soon emerge.A distant clock over a jeweler's window chimed the hour
of four.A moment later the door opened, and a lackey came out and
loudly called the number of the Hawley-Crowles car.That ecstatically
happy woman, with Carmen and the obsequious young Duke of Altern,
appeared behind him in the flood of light.As the big car drew softly up, the wretched creature whom the man had
called Jude darted from behind it and plunged full at Carmen.But the
girl had seen her coming, and she met her with outstretched arm.The
glare from the open door fell full upon them.With a quick movement the girl
tore the string of pearls from her neck and thrust it into Jude's
hand.The latter turned swiftly and darted into the blackness of the
street.Then Carmen hurriedly entered the car, followed by her
stupefied companions.It had all been done in a moment of time.Hawley-Crowles, when she had recovered her
composure sufficiently to speak.And the Duke of Altern rubbed his weak eyes
and tried hard to think.Hawley-Crowles sought her bed that morning the east was
red with the winter sun."The loss of the pearls is bad enough," she
exclaimed in conclusion, glowering over the young girl who sat before
her, "for I paid a good three thousand for the string!But, in
addition, to scandalize me before the world--oh, how could you?And
this unspeakable Jude--and that awful house--heavens, girl!Who would
believe your story if it should get out?"The worried woman's face was
bathed in cold perspiration."But--she saved me from--from that place," protested the harassed
Carmen."She was poor and cold--I could see that.Why should I have
things that I don't need when others are starving?"Hawley-Crowles shook her weary head in despair.Reed, who had sat fixing the girl with her cold eyes throughout the
stormy interview following their return from the ball, now offered a
suggestion."The thing to do is to telephone immediately to all the
newspapers, and say that her beads were stolen last night.""But they weren't stolen," asserted the girl."I gave them to her--"

"Go to your room!"Hawley-Crowles, at the limit of her
endurance."And never, under any circumstances, speak of this affair
to any one--never!"The social crown, which had rested none too securely upon the gilded
wig of the dynamic Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, had been given a jolt that set
it tottering.*       *       *       *       *

It was very clear to Mrs.J. Wilton Ames after the Charity Ball that
she was engaged in a warfare to the death, and with the most
relentless of enemies.Nothing short of the miraculous could now
dethrone the detested Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her beautiful,
mysterious ward.She dolefully acknowledged to herself and to the
sulking Kathleen that she had been asleep, that she had let her foot
slip, and that her own husband's conduct in leading the grand march
with Carmen bade fair to give the _coup de grace_ to a social prestige
which for many weeks had been decidedly on the wane."Mamma, we'll have to think up some new stunts," said the dejected
Kathleen over the teacups the noon following the ball."Why, they've
even broken into the front page of the newspapers with a fake jewelry
theft!Look, they pretend that the little minx was robbed of her
string of pearls last night on leaving the hall.Ames's lip curled in disdain as she read the news item."An Inca
princess, indeed!Why doesn't
somebody take the trouble to investigate her?They'd probably find her
an outcast.""Couldn't papa look her up?"She had no wish to discuss her husband, after
the affair of the previous evening.And, even in disregard of that,
she would not have gone to him with the matter.For she and her
consort, though living under the same roof, nevertheless saw each
other but seldom.At times they met in the household elevator; and for
the sake of appearances they managed to dine together with Kathleen in
a strained, unnatural way two or three times a week, at which times no
mention was ever made of the son who had been driven from the parental
roof.There were no exchanges of confidences or affection, and Mrs.Ames knew but little of the working of his mentality.She was wholly
under the dominance of her masterful husband, merely an accessory to
his mode of existence.He used her, as he did countless others, to
buttress a certain side of his very complex life.As for assistance in
determining Carmen's status, there was none to be obtained from him,
strongly attracted by the young girl as he had already shown himself
to be.Indeed, she might be grateful if the attachment did not lead to
far unhappier consequences!"Larry Beers said yesterday that he had something new," she replied
irrelevantly to Kathleen's question."He has in tow a Persian dervish,
who sticks knives through his mouth, and drinks melted lead, and bites
red-hot pokers, and a lot of such things.Larry says he's the most
wonderful he's ever seen, and I'm going to have him and a real Hindu
_swami_ for next Wednesday evening."New York's conspicuous set indeed would have languished often but for
the social buffoonery of the clever Larry Beers, who devised new
diversions and stimulating mental condiments for the jaded brains of
that gilded cult.His table ballets, his bizarre parlor circuses, his
cunningly devised fads in which he set forth his own inimitable
antics, won him the motley and the cap and bells of this tinseled
court, and forced him well out into the glare of publicity, which was
what he so much desired.And by that much it made him as dangerous as any stupid anarchist who
toils by candle-light over his crude bombs.For by it he taught the
great mass of citizenship who still retained their simple ideals of
reason and respect that there existed a social caste, worshipers of
the golden calf, to whom the simple, humdrum virtues were quite
unendurable, and who, utterly devoid of conscience, would quaff
champagne and dance on the raw, quivering hearts of their fellow-men
with glee, if thereby their jaded appetites for novelty and
entertainment might be for the moment appeased.And so Larry Beers brought his _swami_ and dervish to the Ames
mansion, and caused his hostess to be well advertised in the
newspapers the following day.And he caused the eyes of Carmen to
bulge, and her thought to swell with wonder, as she gazed.And he
caused the bepowdered nose of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to stand a bit
closer to the perpendicular, while she sat devising schemes to cast a
shade over this clumsy entertainment.The chief result was that, a week later, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, still
running true to form, retorted with a superb imitation of the French
_Bal de l'Opera_, once so notable under the Empire.The Beaubien had
furnished the inspiring idea--and the hard cash."Why do I continue
to lend her money and take her notes?I don't--I don't seem to feel that way now.Or is it because I hate that Ames woman so?I wonder if I do still
hate her?At any rate I'm glad to see Carmen oust the proud hussy from
her place.It's worth all I've spent, even if I burn the notes I hold
against Jim Crowles's widow."And often after that, when at night the Beaubien had sought her bed,
she would lie for hours in the dim light meditating, wondering.I'm not the same woman I was when she came into my life.Oh,
God bless her--if there is a God!"The mock _Bal de l'Opera_ was a magnificent _fete_.All the members of
the smart set were present, and many appeared in costumes representing
flowers, birds, and vegetables.Carmen went as a white rose; and her
great natural beauty, set off by an exquisite costume, made her the
fairest flower of the whole garden.The Duke of Altern, costumed as a
long carrot, fawned in her wake throughout the evening.The tubbily
girthy Gannette, dressed to represent a cabbage, opposed her every
step as he bobbed before her, showering his viscous compliments upon
the graceful creature.Kathleen Ames appeared as a bluebird; and she
would have picked the fair white rose to pieces if she could, so
wildly jealous did she become at the sight of Carmen's further
triumph.About midnight, when the revelry was at its height, a door at the end
of the hall swung open, and a strong searchlight was turned full upon
it.The orchestra burst into the wailing dead march from _Saul_, and
out through the glare of light stalked the giant form of J. Wilton
Ames, gowned in dead black to represent a King Vulture, and with a
blood-red fez surmounting his cruel mask.As he stepped out upon the
platform which had been constructed to represent the famous bridge in
"_Sumurun_," and strode toward the main floor, a murmur involuntarily
rose from the assemblage.It was a murmur of awe, of horror, of fear.The "_monstrum horrendum_" of Poe was descending upon them in the garb
which alone could fully typify the character of the man!When he
reached the end of the bridge the huge creature stopped and distended
his enormous sable wings.cried Gannette, as he thought of his tremendous financial
obligations to Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away from the awful spectacle."I want to
go," she said to the petrified Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had known
nothing of this feature of the program.Straight to the trembling, white-clad girl the great, black vulture
stalked.The revelers fell away from him on either side as he
approached.Carmen turned again and watched him come.A light came into her eyes, and a smile
wreathed her mouth.And when Ames reached her and extended his huge,
black wings again, she walked straight into them with a look of joy
upon her beautiful face.Then the wings closed and completely hid the
fair, white form from the gaping crowd.For a few moments dead silence reigned throughout the hall.Then the
orchestra crashed, the vulture's wings slowly opened, and the girl,
who would have gone to the stake with the same incomprehensible smile,
stepped out.The black monster turned and strode silently, ominously,
back to the end of the hall, crossed the bridge, and disappeared
through the door which opened at his approach.said the shaken Gannette to his perspiring wife.That girl's done for; and Ames has taken this
way to publicly announce the fact!There was another astonished watcher in the audience that evening.It
was the eminent Monsignor Lafelle, recently back from Europe by way of
the West Indies.And after the episode just related, he approached
Carmen and Mrs."A very clever, if startling, performance," he commented; "and with
two superb actors, Mr.Ames and our little friend here," bowing over
Carmen's hand."I am _so_ glad you could accept our invitation, Monsignor.I haven't got my breath yet," panted the steaming Mrs."Do take us, Monsignor, to the refectory.A few moments later, over their iced drinks, Lafelle was relating
vivid incidents of his recent travels, and odd bits of news from
Cartagena."No, Miss Carmen," he said, in reply to her anxious
inquiries, "I did not meet the persons you have mentioned.And as for
getting up the Magdalena river, it would have been quite impossible.Dismiss from your mind all thought of going down there now.And the
little town of Simiti which you mention, I doubt not it is quite shut
off from the world by the war."Carmen turned aside that he might not see the tears which welled into
her eyes."Your entertainment, Madam," continued Lafelle, addressing the now
recovered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "is superb, as have been all of your
social projects this winter, I learn.The thought which you expressed
to me some months ago regarding Catholic activity in social matters
certainly was well founded.I perceive that our Protestant rivals have
all but retired from the field."Hawley-Crowles swelled with pride.Carmen regarded the churchman
with wonder."And have you not found a sense of peace, of satisfaction and comfort,
since you united with the true Church?""Are you not
at last at rest?""Quite so," sighed the lady, though the sigh was scarcely one of
unalloyed relief."And our little friend here--can she still
remain an alien, now that she has some knowledge of her indebtedness
to the Church?""Why--"

It was now Lafelle's turn to sigh, as he directed himself again to
Mrs."She does not see, Madam, that it was by the
ladder of Holy Church that she mounted to her present enviable social
height.""But--what--what do you mean?""May I not come and explain it to her?"Then he suddenly
thought of his last conversation with the Beaubien.But he shrugged
his shoulders, and a defiant look sat upon his features.Hawley-Crowles dared not refuse the request.She knew she was now
too deeply enmeshed for resistance, and that Lafelle's control over
her was complete--unless she dared to face social and financial ruin.And under that thought she paled and grew faint, for it raised the
curtain upon chaos and black night."Would it be convenient for me to call to-morrow afternoon?"Hawley-Crowles in a scarcely audible
voice."By the way," Lafelle said, suddenly turning the conversation, "how,
may I ask, is our friend, Madam Beaubien?"Hawley-Crowles again trembled slightly."I--I have not seen her
much of late, Monsignor," she said feebly."A strong and very liberal-minded woman," returned Lafelle with
emphasis."I trust, as your spiritual adviser, Madam, I may express
the hope that you are in no way influenced by her."cried Carmen, who had bounded to her feet, her eyes ablaze,
"Madam Beaubien is a noble woman!"Lafelle grasped her hand and drew her back into her
chair.Madam Beaubien is a very dear
friend of ours, and we greatly admire her strength of character.She
certainly does not require your defense!A few moments later he rose and offered his arms to his companions to
lead them back to the hall.Delivering Carmen into the charge of the
eagerly waiting Duke of Altern, Lafelle remarked, as he took leave of
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I trust you will permit me to talk with your
beautiful ward to-morrow afternoon--alone."And when the lady
interpreted the significance of his look, her heart beat rapidly, as
she bowed her acknowledgment of abject submission.ejaculated the young Duke, clutching Carmen."Ye know, I
was deucedly afraid you had gone home, or that Uncle Wilton had you.Ye know, I think I'm jealous of him!"Carmen laughed merrily at the fellow.His grotesque costume made him
appear still more ridiculous."It's nothing to laugh at, Miss Carmen!It's a bally bore to have a
regular mountain like him always getting in the way; and to-night I
just made up my mind I wouldn't stand it any longer, bah Jove!He fixed his monocle savagely in his eye and strode rapidly toward
the refreshment hall.She heard his murmur of
gratification when his gaze lighted upon the chairs and table which
he had evidently arranged previously in anticipation of this
_tete-a-tete_."Ye know," he finally began, after they were seated and he had sat
some minutes staring at the girl, "ye know, you're deucedly clevah,
Miss Carmen!I told mother so to-day, and this time she had to agree.And that about your being an Inca princess--ye know, I could see that
from the very first day I met you.Mighty romantic, and all that,
don't ye know!"replied the girl, her thought drifting back to distant
Simiti."And all about that mine you own in South America--and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles making you her heiress--and all that--bah Jove!It's--it's romantic, I tell you!"His head continued to nod emphasis
to his thought long after he finished speaking."Ye know," he finally resumed, drawing a gold-crested case from a
pocket and lighting a monogrammed cigarette, "a fellow can always tell
another who is--well, who belongs to the aristocracy.Ames, ye
know, said she had some suspicions about you.But I could see right
off that it was because she was jealous.Mother and I knew what you
were the minute we clapped eyes on you.That's because we belong to
the nobility, ye know.""Bah Jove, Miss Carmen, I'm going to say it!""Mother wanted me to marry Lord Cragmont's filly; but, bah Jove, I
say, I'm going to marry you!"Carmen now heard, and she quickly sat up, her eyes wide and staring.You're a princess, ye know,
and so you're in our class.I'm not one of the kind that hands out a
title to the red-nosed daughter of any American pork packer just to
get her money.The girl I marry has got to be my equal.""It's all right for you to have money, of course.I won't marry a
pauper, even if she's a duchess.But you and I, Miss Carmen, are just
suited to each other--wealth and nobility on each side.I've got
thirty thousand good British acres in my own right, bah Jove!"By now Carmen had fully recovered from her surprise.She reflected a
moment, then determined to meet the absurd youth with the spirit of
levity which his audacity merited."But, Reginald," she said in mock
seriousness, "though your father was a duke, how about your mother?Was she not just an ordinary American girl, a sister of plain Mrs.Now on my side--"

"Now, Miss Carmen," cried the boy petulantly, "can't you see that, by
marrying my father, my mother became ennobled?Bah Jove, you don't
understand!he whispered, leaning far over the table toward her."Then we've simply _got_ to marry!""But," protested the girl, "in my country people love those whom they
marry.I haven't heard a word of that from you."It was
love that made me offer you my name and title!""My dear Reginald, you don't love me.You are madly in love, it is true; but it is
with the young Duke of Altern.""See here, you can't talk to me that way, ye know!""Bah Jove, I'm offering to make you a duchess--and I love you, too,
though you may not think it!""Of course you love me, Reginald," said Carmen in gentle reply, now
relinquishing her spirit of badinage; "and I love you.But I do not
wish to marry you."The young man started under the shock and stared at her in utter lack
of comprehension.Was it possible that this unknown girl was refusing
him, a duke?"A--a--I don't get you, Miss Carmen," he stammered."Come," she said, rising and holding out a hand."Let's not talk about
this any more.I do love you, Reginald,
but not in the way that perhaps you would like.I love the real _you_;
not the vain, foolish, self-adoring human concept, called the Duke of
Altern.And the love I feel for you will help you, oh, far more than
if I married you!"I--I expected we'd be engaged--I told mother--"

"Very well, Reginald, we are engaged.Engaged in handling this little
problem that has presented itself to you.And I will help
you to solve it in the right way.Reginald dear, I
didn't mean to treat your proposal so lightly.We're just awfully good friends, aren't we?And I do
love you, more than you think."Leaving the bewildered youth in the hall, Carmen fell afoul of the
very conservative Mrs.Gannette, whose husband, suffering from a sense
of nausea since the appearance of Ames as a King Vulture, had some
moments before summoned his car and driven to his favorite club to
flood his apprehensions with Scotch high-balls.Gannette, shaking a finger at
Carmen."I saw you with Reginald just now.Tell me, dear, when shall we be able to call you the Duchess
of Altern?Carmen's spirits sank, as, without reply, she submitted to the banal
boredom of this blustering dame's society gabble.Gannette hooked
her arm into the girl's and led her to a divan."It's a great affair,
isn't it?"she panted, settling her round, unshapely form out over the
seat.Thought that was better adapted to my shape.But when
I got the cloth form around me, do you know, I couldn't get through
the door!And my unlovely pig of a husband said if I came looking like
that he'd get a divorce."The corpulent dame shook and wheezed with
the expression of her abundant merriment."Well," she continued, "it wasn't his threat that hindered me,
goodness knows!A divorce would be a relief, after living forty years
with him!Speaking of divorce,
he's just got one.Billy Patterson
dared him to exchange wives with him one evening when they were having
a little too much gaiety at the Worley home, and the doctor took the
dare.Kate Worley gets an alimony of
fifty thousand per.Why, he has a
practice of not less than two hundred and fifty thousand a year!""I supposed," murmured Carmen, "that amount of money is a measure of
his ability, a proof of his great usefulness.""He's simply in with the
wealthy, that's all.Carmen glanced at the pale, slender woman across the hall, seated
alone, and wearing a look of utter weariness."I'd like to meet her," she said, suddenly drawn by the woman's mute
appeal for sympathy."She's going to be
dropped.Hawley-Crowles was thinking of to invite her to-night!Her estate is
being handled by Ames and Company, and J. Wilton says there won't be
much left when it's settled--

"My goodness!"she exclaimed, abruptly flitting to another topic.Look at her skirt--flounced at the knees, and
full in the back so's to give a bustle effect.I wish I could wear
togs cut that way--

"They say, my dear," the garrulous old worldling prattled on, "that
next season's styles will be very ultra.Hats
small and round, like the heads of butterflies.Waists and jackets
very full and quite loose in the back and shoulders, so's to give the
appearance of wings.Belts, but no drawing in at the waist.Skirts
plaited, plaits opening wide at the knees and coming close together
again at the ankle, so's to look like the body of a butterfly.Then
butterfly bows sprinkled all over.""Oh dear," she
lamented, "I'd give anything if I had a decent shape!I'd like to wear
those shimmering, flowing, transparent summer things over silk tights.I'd look like a potato busted wide open.Now you can
wear those X-ray dresses all right--

"Say, Kathleen Ames has a new French gown to wear to the Dog Show.Skirt slit clear to the knee, with diamond garter around the leg just
below.Carmen heard little of this vapid talk, as she sat studying the pale
woman across the hall.She had resolved to meet her just as soon as
the loquacious Mrs.But that
genial old gossip gave no present evidence of a desire to change."I'm _so_ glad you're going to marry young Altern," she said, again
swerving the course of her conversation."He's got a fine old ruined
castle somewhere in England, and seems to have wads of money, though I
hear that everything is mortgaged to Ames.Still, his bare title is worth something to an American girl.And you'll do a lot for his family.You know--but
don't breathe a word of this!--his mother never was recognized
socially in England, and she finally had to give up the fight.For a
while Ames backed her, but it wouldn't do.His millions couldn't buy
her the court entree, and she just had to quit.That's why she's over
here now.The old Duke--he was lots older than she--died a couple of
years ago.Ran through everything and drank himself to death.Before
and since that happy event the Duchess did everything under the
heavens to get a bid to court.She gave millions to charity and to
entertainments.You're
a princess, royal Inca, and such like.So you see what you're expected to do for the Altern crowd--

"Dear!catching her breath and switching quickly to another
theme, "have you heard about the Hairton scandal?You see, young Sidney Ames--"

Carmen's patience had touched its limit.she
begged, holding out a hand.Gannette raised her lorgnette and looked at the girl.The scandal's about Ames's son, you know.The
reason he doesn't go in society.You see--"

"My dear Mrs.Gannette," Carmen looked up at her with a beseeching
smile."You wouldn't deliberately give me poison to drink, would
you?"blustered that garrulous lady in astonishment."Then why do you poison my mind with such conversation?""You sit there pouring into my mentality thought after thought that is
deadly poisonous, don't you know it?""You don't mean to harm me, I know," pleaded the girl."But if you
only understood mental laws you would know that every thought entering
one's mind tends to become manifested in some way.Thoughts of
disease, disaster, death, scandal--all tend to become externalized in
discordant ways, either on the body, or in the environment.You don't
want any such things manifested to me, do you?But you might just as
well hand me poison to drink as to sit there and pour such deadly
conversation into me."Gannette slowly drew herself up with the hauteur of a grandee."I do not want to listen to these unreal
things which concern only the human mind," she said earnestly."Nor
should you, if you are truly aristocratic, for aristocracy is of the
thought.I am not going to marry Reginald.But one's thought--that alone is one's claim to _real_
aristocracy.I know I have offended you, but only because I refuse to
let you poison me.She left the divan and the petrified dame, and hurriedly mingled with
the crowd on the floor.Gannette, when she again found
herself.Carmen went directly to the pale woman, still sitting alone, who had
been one of the objects of Mrs.The
woman glanced up as she saw the girl approaching, and a look of wonder
came into her eyes."I am Carmen Ariza," she said simply.The woman roused up and tried to appear composed."Will you ride with me to-morrow?""Then we can talk
all we want to, with nobody to overhear.she
abruptly added, unable longer to withstand the appeal which issued
mutely from the lusterless eyes before her."I am poverty-stricken," returned the woman sadly."But I will give you money," Carmen quickly replied."My dear child," said the woman, "I haven't anything but money.That
is why I am poverty-stricken."the girl exclaimed, sinking into a chair at her side."Well,"
she added, brightening, "now you have me!And will you call me up,
first thing in the morning, and arrange to ride with me?"Yes," she murmured, "I will--gladly."In the small hours of the morning there were several heads tossing in
stubborn wakefulness on their pillows in various New York mansions.CHAPTER 17


On the morning following Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's very successful
imitation of the _Bal de l'Opera_, Monsignor Lafelle paid an early
call to the Ames _sanctum_.And the latter gentleman deemed the visit
of sufficient importance to devote a full hour to his caller.When the
churchman rose to take his leave he reiterated:

"Our friend Wenceslas will undertake the matter for you, Mr.Ames, but
on the conditions which I have named.But Rome must be communicated
with, and the substance of her replies must be sent from Cartagena to
you, and your letters forwarded to her.That might take us into early
summer.Ketchim's engineers will
make any further attempt before that time to enter Colombia.Harris is in Denver, at his old home, you
tell me.So we need look for no immediate move from them.""Quite satisfactory, Lafelle," returned Ames genially."In future, if
I can be of service to you, I am yours to command.Willett will
hand you a check covering your traveling expenses on my behalf."When the door closed after Lafelle, Ames leaned back in his chair and
gave himself up to a moment's reflection."I wonder," he mused, "I
wonder if the fellow has something up his sleeve that he didn't show
me?I'm going to drop him after this trap is
sprung.He's got Jim Crowles's widow all tied up, too.if he begins work on that girl I'll--"

He was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone bell.shouted Ames, "you say the girl insulted your
wife last evening?I don't believe she could--Yes, yes, I mean, I
don't think she meant to--certainly not, no aspersion whatever
intended--What?the girl will have to apologize?--Well!well--No,
not in a thousand years!--Yes, I'll back her!And if your society
isn't good enough for her--and I don't think it is--why, I'll form
a little coterie all by myself!""I want a dozen brokers watching Gannette now until I call them off,"
he commanded."I want you to take personal charge of them."Lucile
already has Gannette pretty well wound up in his Venezuelan
speculations--and they are going to smash--Lafelle has fixed that.And
I've bought her notes against Mrs.Hawley-Crowles for about a
million--which I have reinvested for her in Colombia.She'll
feed out of my hand now!La Libertad is mine when the trap falls.So
is C. and R. And that little upstart, Ketchim, goes to Sing Sing!"He turned to the morning paper that lay upon his desk."I don't like
the way the Colombian revolution drags," he mused."But certainly it
can't last much longer.And then--then--"

His thoughts wandered off into devious channels."So Jose de Rincon
is--well!But--where on earth did
that girl come from?There's a lot of experience coming to
her.And then she'll drop a few of her pious notions.Lucile says--but
Lucile is getting on my nerves!"*       *       *       *       *

Monsignor Lafelle found Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward awaiting him
when his car drove up at two that afternoon.Carmen had not left the
house during the morning, for Elizabeth Wall had telephoned early that
a slight indisposition would necessitate postponement of the
contemplated ride."Well," reflected Carmen, as she turned from the 'phone, "one who
knows that God is everywhere can never be disappointed, for all good
is ever present."And then she set about preparing for the expected
call of Monsignor Lafelle.When that dignitary entered the parlor Mrs.Hawley-Crowles graciously
welcomed him, and then excused herself."I will leave her with you,
Monsignor," she said, indicating Carmen, and secretly glad to escape a
presence which she greatly feared.Lafelle bowed, and then waved
Carmen to a seat."I have come to-day, Miss Carmen," he began easily, "on a mission of
vastest importance as concerning your welfare.I have talked with the acting-Bishop there, who, it seems,
is not wholly unacquainted with you.""Then," cried Carmen eagerly, "you know where Padre Jose is?And the
others--"

"No," replied Lafelle."I regret to say I know nothing of their
present whereabouts."I have long since done that," said Carmen softly."It is of yourself that I wish to speak," continued Lafelle."I have
come to offer you the consolation, the joy, and the protection of the
Church.Hawley-Crowles, has found peace
with us.Will you longer delay taking a step toward which you are by
race, by national custom, and by your Saviour admonished?I have come
to invite you to publicly confess your allegiance to the Church of
Rome.Hawley-Crowles, is one
of us.And you, my
daughter, now need the Church," he added with suggestive emphasis.Hawley-Crowles had hinted the probable
mission of the churchman, and the girl was prepared."I thank you, Monsignor," she replied simply."My child, it is quite
necessary!""But I have my salvation, ever present."My dear child, do not lean upon your pretty theories in the hope that
they will open the door of heaven for you.There is no salvation
outside of the Church.""Monsignor," said Carmen gently, "such talk is very foolish.Can you
prove to me that your Church ever sent any one to heaven?Have you any
but a very mediaeval and material concept of heaven?It is the consciousness of good only, without a trace of
materiality or evil.And I enter into that consciousness by means of
the Christ-principle, which Jesus gave to the world.It is very
simple, is it not?And it makes all your pomp and ceremony, and your
penance and rites quite unnecessary."He had certain suspicions, but he was not
ready to voice them.Carmen went on:

"Monsignor, I love my fellow-men, oh, _so_ much!I want to see every
one work out his salvation, as Jesus bade us all do, and without any
hindrance from others.And I ask but that same privilege from every
one, yourself included.Let me work out my salvation as my Father has
directed.""I have no wish to hinder you, child.On
the contrary, I offer you the assistance and infallible guidance of
the Church.Beginning nineteen
centuries ago, when we were divinely appointed custodian of the
world's morals, our history has been a glorious one.We have in that
time changed a pagan world into one that fears God and follows His
Christ.""But for nineteen hundred years, Monsignor, the various so-called
Christian sects of the world have been persecuting and slaying one
another over their foolish beliefs, basing their religious theories
upon their interpretations of the Bible.Surely that is not a glorious
history!"You unwittingly argue directly for our cause, my child.The
result which you have just cited proves conclusively that the
Scriptures can not be correctly interpreted by every one.That is
perfectly patent to you, I see.Thus you acknowledge the necessity of
an infallible guide.That is to be found only in the spiritual
Fathers, and in the Pope, the holy Head of the Church of Rome, the
present Vicegerent of Christ on earth.""Then your interpretation of the Bible is the only correct one?""And you Catholics are the only true followers of Christ?"Come, Monsignor, I will get my coat and hat.he asked in amazement, as he slowly got to
his feet."Jesus said: 'He that believeth on
me, the works that I do shall he do also.'I am going to take you over
to the home of old Maggie, our cook's mother.You will
heal her, for you are a true follower of Christ.""Well--but, hasn't she a doctor?""Yes, but he can't help her.You should be able to do the works
which he did.You can change the wafer and wine into the flesh and
blood of Jesus.How much easier, then, and vastly more practical, to
cure a sick woman!Wait, I will be back in a minute.""But, you impetuous child, I shall go on no such foolish errand as
that!""If the woman were dying or dead, and you were
summoned, you would go, would you not?"And if she were dying you would put holy oil on her, and pray--but it
wouldn't make her well.And if she were dead, you would say Masses for
the repose of her soul.Monsignor, did it never occur to you that the
great works which you claim to do are all done behind the veil of
death?You can do but little for mankind here; but you pretend to do
much after they have passed beyond the grave.Is it quite fair to the
poor and ignorant, I ask, to work that way?Did it never strike you as
remarkable and very consistent that Jesus, whenever he launched a
great truth, immediately ratified it by some great sign, some sign
which the world now calls a miracle?The Gospels are full of such
instances, where he first taught, then came down and immediately
healed some one, thus at once putting his teaching to the proof.Your Church has taught and thundered and denounced
for ages, but what has it proved?You teach the so-called practical Christianity which makes a reality
of evil and an eternal necessity of hospitals and orphan asylums.If
you did his works the people would be so uplifted that these things
would be wiped out.Your Church has had nineteen hundred years in
which to learn to do the works which he did.Now come over to Maggie's
with me and prove that you are a true follower and believer, and that
the Church has given you the right sort of practical instruction!"Gradually the girl's voice waxed stronger while she delivered this
polemic.Slowly the churchman's face darkened, as he moved backward
and sank into his chair."Now, Monsignor, having scolded you well," the girl continued, smiling
as she sat down again, "I will apologize.But you needed the
scolding--you know you did!And nearly all who profess the name of
Christ need the same.Monsignor, I love you all, and every one,
whether Catholic or Protestant, or whatever his creed.But that does
not blind my eyes to your great need, and to your obstinate refusal to
make any effort to meet that need."A cynical look came into the man's face."May I ask, Miss Carmen, if
you consider yourself a true follower and believer?""Monsignor," she quickly replied, rising and facing him, "you hope by
that adroit question to confound me.Listen: when I was a child my purity of thought was such that I knew
no evil.I could not see sickness or
death as anything more than unreal shadows.And that wonderful
clearness of vision and purity of thought made me a channel for the
operation of the Christ-principle, God himself.And thereby the sick
were healed in my little home town.Then, little by little, after my
beloved teacher, Jose, came to me, I lost ground in my struggle to
keep the vision clear.They did not mean to, but he and my dearest
padre Rosendo and others held their beliefs of evil as a reality so
constantly before me that the vision became obscured, and the
spirituality alloyed.The unreal forces of evil seemed to concentrate
upon me.I know why now, for the greatest good always stirs up the
greatest amount of evil--the highest truth always has the lowest lie
as its opposite and opponent.I see now, as never before, the
unreality of evil.I see now, as never before, the marvelous truth
which Jesus tried, oh, _so_ hard, to impress upon the dull minds of
his people, the truth which you refuse to see.And ceaselessly I am
now striving to acquire 'that mind,' that spiritual consciousness,
which was in him.I have been
wonderfully shielded, led, and cared for.And I shall heal, some day,
as he did.I shall regain my former spirituality, for it has never
really been lost.But, Monsignor, do not ask me to come into your
Church and allow my brightening vision to become blurred by your very
inadequate concept of God--a God who is moved by the petitions of
Saints and Virgin and mortal men.Unless," she added,
brightening, "you will let me teach your Church what I know."You see," she
said, "your Church requires absolute submission to its age-worn
authority.According to you, I have nothing to give.Very well, if
your Church can receive nothing from me, and yet can give me nothing
more than its impossible beliefs, undemonstrable this side of the
grave, at least--then we must consider that a gulf is fixed between
us."Oh, Monsignor," she pleaded, after a moment's silence, "you see, do
you not?When Jesus said that he gave his disciples power over all
evil, did he not mean likewise over all physical action, and over
every physical condition?But did he mean that they alone should have
such power?No, he meant that every
one who followed him and strove ceaselessly for spirituality of
thought should acquire that spirituality, and thereby cleanse himself
of false beliefs, and make room for the Christ-principle to operate,
even to the healing of the sick, to the raising of those mesmerized by
the belief of death as a power and reality, and to the dematerializing
of the whole material concept of the heavens and earth.Can't you, a
churchman, see it?And can't you see how shallow your views are?Don't
you know that even the physical body is but a part of the human,
material concept, and therefore a part of the 'one lie' about God, who
is Spirit?"But now his time had come to speak in
rebuttal.And yet, he would make no attempt to assail her convictions.He knew well that she would not yield--at least, to-day."Miss Carmen," he said gently, "the Church is ever doing beneficent
deeds which do not come to light, and for which she receives no praise
from men.Hawley-Crowles's elevation to social
leadership came through her.There is also a rumor that the Church
afforded you an asylum on your first night in this city, when, if
ever, you needed aid.The Church shielded and cared for you even in
Simiti.Indeed, what has she not done for you?"Monsignor," replied Carmen, "I am not unmindful of the care always
bestowed upon me.But my gratitude is to my
God, who has worked through many channels to bless me.Leave it there, and fear not that I shall prove ungrateful
to Him, to whom my every thought is consecrated."Then he spoke low and earnestly, while he held
his gaze fixed upon the girl's bright eyes."Miss Carmen, if you knew
that the Church now afforded you the only refuge from the dangers that
threaten, you would turn to her as a frightened child to its mother.""I fear nothing, Monsignor," replied the girl, her face alight with a
smile of complete confidence."I am not the kind who may be driven by
fear into acceptance of undemonstrable, unfounded theological beliefs.Fear has always been a terrible weapon in the hands of those who have
sought to force their opinions upon their fellow-men.But it is
powerless to influence me.Indeed, according to the Bible
allegory, it began in the very garden of Eden, when poor, deceived
Adam confessed to God that he was afraid.If God was infinite then, as
you admit you believe Him to be now, who or what made Adam afraid?For, 'God hath not given us
the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.'"But, surely, Miss Carmen, you will not stubbornly close your eyes to
threatening evil?""Monsignor, I close my eyes to all that is unlike God.I know nothing but Him and His perfect manifestation."The picture which he and the
young girl formed was one of rare beauty and interest: he, weighted
with years, white of hair, but rugged of form, with strikingly
handsome features and kindly eyes--she, a child, delicate, almost
wraith-like, glowing with a beauty that was not of earth, and, though
untutored in the wiles of men, still holding at bay the sagacious
representative of a crushing weight of authority which reached far
back through the centuries, even to the Greek and Latin Fathers who
put their still unbroken seal upon the strange elaborations which they
wove out of the simple words of the Nazarene.When the churchman again looked up and felt himself engulfed in the
boundless love which emanated from that radiant, smiling girl, there
surged up within him a mighty impulse to go to her, to clasp her in
his arms, to fall at her feet and pray for even a mite of her own rare
spirituality.The purpose which he had that morning formulated died
within him; the final card which he would have thrown lay crushed in
his hand."The people believe you a child of the ancient Incas," he said slowly,
taking her hand."What if I should say that I know better?""I would say that you were right, Monsignor," she replied gently,
looking up into his face with a sweet smile."Then you admit the identity of your father?"The man bent for a moment over the little white hand, and then
immediately left the house.CHAPTER 18

Monsignor Lafelle in his interview with Carmen had thrown out a hint
of certain rumors regarding her; but the days passed, and the girl
awoke not to their significance.Then, one morning, her attention was
attracted by a newspaper report of the farewell address of a young
priest about to leave his flock.When she opened the paper and caught
sight of the news item she gave a little cry, and immediately forgot
all else in her absorption in the closing words:

  "--and I have known no other ambition since the day that little
  waif from a distant land strayed into my life, lighting the dead
  lamp of my faith with the torch of her own flaming spirituality.She said she had a message for the people up here.Would to God
  she might know that her message had borne fruit!"The newspaper slipped from the girl's hands to the floor.Her eyes,
big and shining, stared straight before her."And I will lead the
blind by a way that they know not--" she murmured.It was Miss Wall, ready now for the postponed
ride.Carmen clapped her hands and sang for joy as she summoned the
car and made her preparations."We'll go over to his church," she said
aloud.She hurried back to the newspaper to get the
address of the church from which he had spoken the preceding day."They will know where he is," she said happily."Oh, isn't it just
wonderful!"A few minutes later, with Miss Wall at her side, she was speeding to
the distant suburb where the little church was located."We are going to find a priest," she said simply."Oh, you mustn't ask
me any questions!Hawley-Crowles doesn't like to have me talk
about certain things, and so I can't tell you."But the happy, smiling countenance
disarmed suspicion."Now tell me," Carmen went on, "tell me about yourself.I'm a
missionary, you know," she added, thinking of Father Waite.Well, are you trying to convert the society world?""Yes, by Christianity--not by what the missionaries are now teaching
in the name of Christianity.I'll tell you all about it some day.Now
tell me, why are you unhappy?Why is your life pitched in such a minor
key?Perhaps, together, we can change it to a major."Miss Wall could not help joining in the merry laugh."I am unhappy," she said, "because I have arrived
nowhere."Carmen looked at her inquiringly."Well," she said, "that shows you
are on the wrong track, doesn't it?""I'm tired of life--tired of everything, everybody!"Miss Wall sank
back into the cushions with her lips pursed and her brow wrinkled."No, you are not tired of life," said Carmen quietly; "for you do not
know what life is.""No, I suppose not," replied the weary woman."Oh, don't mention that name, nor quote Scripture to me!"cried the
woman, throwing up her hands in exasperation."I've had that stuff
preached at me until it turned my stomach!I hope you are not an
emotional, weepy religionist."Padre Jose used to say--"

"Who's he?"demanded Miss Wall, somewhat curtly."Oh, he is a priest--"

"A priest!do you constantly associate with priests, and talk
religion?""Well," she responded, "I've had a good deal
to do with both.""Tell me something about your
life," she said."Surely I am a princess," returned Carmen, laughing merrily."Listen;
I will tell you about big, glorious Simiti, and the wonderful castle I
lived in there, and about my Prime Minister, Don Rosendo, and--well,
listen, and then judge for yourself if I am not of royal extraction!"Laughing again up into the mystified face of Miss Wall, the
enthusiastic girl began to tell about her former life in far-off
Guamoco.As she listened, the woman's eyes grew wide with interest.At times
she voiced her astonishment in sudden exclamations.And when the girl
concluded her brief recital, she bent upon the sparkling face a look
of mingled wonder and admiration.After going through all
that, how can you be so happy now?And with all your kin down there in
that awful war!"Don't you think I am a princess now?"Carmen asked, smiling up at
her."And--you don't want to know what it was that kept me through it all,
and that is still guiding me?"The bright, animated face looked so
eagerly, so lovingly, into the world-scarred features of her
companion."Not if you are going to talk religion.Tell me, who is this priest
you are seeking to-day, and why have you come to see him?"He is the one who found me--when I got lost--and took
me to my friends."The big car whirled around a corner and stopped before a dingy little
church edifice surmounted by a weather-beaten cross.On the steps of a
modest frame house adjoining stood a man.Carmen threw wide the door of the car and sprang out.A light came into the startled man's eyes.Then he
stepped back, that he might better see her.More than a year had
passed since he had taken her, so oddly garbed, and clinging tightly
to his hand, into the Ketchim office.And in that time, he thought,
she had been transformed into a vision of heavenly beauty.And
with that she threw her arms about him and kissed him loudly on both
cheeks.The man and Miss Wall gave vent to exclamations of astonishment.He
 violently; Miss Wall sat with mouth agape.pursued the girl, again grasping his
hands."An angel from heaven could not be more
welcome," he said.But his voice was low, and the note of sadness was
prominent."Well, I am an angel from heaven," said the laughing, artless girl.But,
whoever I am, I am, oh, so glad to see you again!I--" she looked
about carefully--"I read your sermon in the newspaper this morning."Yes, I meant you," he softly answered."Come with me now," said the eager girl."Impossible," he replied, shaking his head."Then, will you come and see me?""Why have
you never been to see me?Didn't you know I was still in the city?""I used to see your name in the papers, often.And I have followed your career with great interest.But--you moved in
a circle--from which I--well, it was hardly possible for me to come to
see you, you know--"

"It was!""But, never mind, you are coming now.Here," drawing a card from her bag, "this is the address of Madam
Beaubien.Will you come there to-morrow afternoon, at two, and talk
with me?"He looked at the card which she thrust into his hand, and then at the
richly-gowned girl before him.But he
nodded his head slowly."Tell me," she whispered, "how is Sister Katie?"Ah, if the girl could have known how that great-hearted old soul had
mourned her "little bairn" these many months."I will go to see her," said Carmen."But first you will come to me
to-morrow."She beamed upon him as she clasped his hands again.Then
she entered the car, and sat waving her hand back at him as long as he
could see her.It would be difficult to say which of the two, Miss Wall or Father
Waite, was the more startled by this abrupt and lively _rencontre_.But to Carmen, as she sat back in the car absorbed in thought, it had
been a perfectly natural meeting between two warm friends."You haven't anything but money, and
fine clothes, and automobiles, and jewels, you think.asked the wondering woman, marveling at this strange
girl who went about embracing people so promiscuously.The woman's lip trembled slightly when she heard this, but she did not
reply."And I'm going to love you," the girl continued.You're
tired of society gabble and gossip; you're tired of spending on
yourself the money you never earned; you're not a bit of use to
anybody, are you?You're a sort of tragedy, aren't
you?There are just lots of them in high society, just as
weary as you.And they lack the very
greatest thing in all of life, the very thing that no amount of money
will buy, just love!they don't realize that, in
order to get, they must give.In order to be loved, they must
themselves love.Now you start right in and love the whole world, love
everybody, big and little.And, as you love people, try to see only
their perfection.Never look at a bad trait, nor a blemish of any
sort.In a week's time you will be a new woman.""I have _always_ done it," replied Carmen."I don't know anything but
love.I never knew what it was to hate or revile.I never could see
what there was that deserved hatred or loathing.I don't see anything
but good--everywhere.""I--I don't mind your talking
that way to me," she whispered."But I just couldn't bear to listen to
any more religion."Love is the
tie that binds all together and all to God.Why, Miss Wall--"

"Call me Elizabeth, please," interrupted the woman."Well then, Elizabeth," she said softly, "all creeds have got to merge
into just one, some day, and, instead of saying 'I believe,' everybody
will say 'I understand and I love.'Why, the very person who loved
more than anybody else ever did was the one who saw God most clearly!He knew that if we would see God--good everywhere--we would just
simply _have_ to love, for God _is_ love!"Do you love me, Carmen, because you pity me?""God's children are not to be
pitied--and I see in people only His children.""Well, why, then, do you love me?"The girl replied quickly: "God is love."And now," she continued cheerily, "we are going to work together,
aren't we?And then you are
going to see just what is right for you to do--what work you are to
take up--what interests you are to have."Tell me, Carmen, why are you in society?What keeps you there, in an
atmosphere so unsuited to your spiritual life?""But--"

"Well, Elizabeth dear, every step I take is ordained by Him, who is my
life.I leave everything to Him, and then
keep myself out of the way.If He wishes to use me elsewhere, He will
remove me from society.How could this girl, who, in her
few brief years, had passed through fire and flood, still love the
hand that guided her!CHAPTER 19


To the great horde of starving European nobility the daughters of
American millionaires have dropped as heavenly manna.It was but dire
necessity that forced low the bars of social caste to the transoceanic
traffic between fortune and title.Hawley-Crowles might ever aspire to the purchase of a
decrepit dukedom had never entered her thought.A tottering earldom
was likewise beyond her purchasing power.She had contented herself
that Carmen should some day barter her rare culture, her charm, and
her unrivaled beauty, for the more lowly title of an impecunious count
or baron.But to what heights of ecstasy did her little soul rise when
the young Duke of Altern made it known to her that he would honor her
beautiful ward with his own glorious name--in exchange for La Libertad
and other good and valuable considerations, receipt of which would be
duly acknowledged."I--aw--have spoken to her, ye know, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," that worthy
young cad announced one afternoon, as he sat alone with the successful
society leader in the warm glow of her living room.she said we were engaged, ye know--really!Said we were awfully good
friends, ye know, and all that.For Reginald had done much thinking of late--and his creditors were
restless.Hawley-Crowles,
beaming like a full-blown sunflower.Only--ye know, she'll have to be--coached a bit, ye
know--told who we are--our ancestral history, and all that.Why, she just couldn't help loving you!""No--aw--no, of course--that is--aw--she has excellent
prospects--financial, I mean, eh?Mines, and all that, ye know--eh?""Why, she owns the grandest gold mine in all South America!I--aw--I never was so attracted to a girl in all me
blooming life!You will--a--speak to her, eh?"Never fear, Reginald" she's yours.Certainly not--not when she knows about our family.And--aw--mother will talk with you--that is, about the details.She'll
arrange them, ye know.And the haughty mother of the young Duke did call shortly thereafter
to consult in regard to her son's matrimonial desires.The nerve-racking
round of balls, receptions, and other society functions was quite
forgotten by the elated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose ears tingled
deliciously under the pompous boastings of the Dowager Lady Altern.Hawley-Crowles was convinced, after a
half hour's conversation with this proud mother, that the royal house
of Brunswick was but an impudent counterfeit!Reed, who had
hastily appraised it, had said that there was a mountain of gold there,
only awaiting Yankee enterprise.There was proof positive
that she was an Inca princess.Hawley-Crowles was so honored
by the deep interest which the young Duke manifested in the wonderful
girl!And she would undertake negotiations with her at once.Hawley-Crowles had to plan very carefully.She was terribly
in debt; yet she had resources.The Beaubien was inexhaustible.Ames,
too, might be depended upon.And La Libertad--well, there was Mr.Philip O. Ketchim to reckon with.So she forthwith summoned him to a
consultation.But, ere her talk with that prince of finance, another bit of good
fortune fell into the lady's spacious lap.Reed had written that he
was doing poorly with his western mining ventures, and would have to
raise money at once.He therefore offered to sell his interest in the
Simiti Company.Moreover, he wanted his wife to come to him and make
her home in California, where he doubtless would spend some years.Hawley-Crowles offered him twenty-five thousand dollars for his
Simiti interest; of which offer Reed wired his immediate acceptance.Then the lady packed her rueful sister Westward Ho!and laid her newly
acquired stock before the Beaubien for a large loan.That was but a
day before Ketchim called."Madam," said that suave gentleman, smiling piously, "you are a
genius.Our ability to announce the Duke of Altern as our largest
stockholder will result in a boom in the sales of Simiti stock.The
Lord has greatly prospered our humble endeavors.Er--might I ask,
Madam, if you would condescend to meet my wife some afternoon?We are
rapidly acquiring some standing in a financial way, and Mrs.Ketchim
would like to know you and some of the more desirable members of your
set, if it might be arranged."Hawley-Crowles beamed her joy.She drew herself up with a regnant
air.The people were coming to her, their social queen, for
recognition!"And there's my Uncle Ted, you know, Madam.He's president of the C.
and R."Hawley-Crowles nodded and looked wise."Possibly we can arrange
it," she said.What is Joplin
Zinc doing?"The lady wondered, for Joplin Zinc was not yet in operation, according
to the latest report.*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, while Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was still laying her plans to herd
the young girl into the mortgaged dukedom of Altern, Father Waite kept
his appointment, and called at the Beaubien mansion on the afternoon
Carmen had set.He was warmly received by the girl herself, who had
been watching for his coming."Now," she began like a bubbling fountain, when they were seated in
the music room, "where's Jude?Why, I haven't the slightest idea to whom you refer," returned
the puzzled man."The woman who took me to the Sister Superior," explained Carmen."Well," said the girl confidently, "I saw her, but she got away from
me.But I shall find her--it is right that I should.Now tell me, what
are you going to do?"Earn my living some way," he replied meditatively."You have lots of friends who will help you?""I am an apostate, you know.""Well, that means that you're free.The chains have dropped, haven't
they?""You are not dazed, nor confused!Why, you're like a prisoner coming
out of his dungeon into the bright sunlight.You're only blinking,
that's all.And, as for confusion--well, if I would admit it to be
true I could point to a terrible state of it!Just think, a duke wants
to marry me; Mrs.Hawley-Crowles is determined that he shall; I am an
Inca princess, and yet I don't know who I am; my own people apparently
are swallowed up by the war in Colombia; and I am in an environment
here in New York in which I have to fight every moment to keep myself
from flying all to pieces!But I guess God intends to keep me here for
the present.Oh, yes, and Monsignor Lafelle insists that I am a
Catholic and that I must join his Church.""Is Monsignor Lafelle working with
Madam Beaubien, your friend?"Hawley-Crowles--"

"Was it through him that she became a communicant?"Ames's sister, the Dowager Duchess, in England.The young Duke is also
going to join the faith, I learn.He stopped suddenly and
looked searchingly at her.At that moment a maid entered, bearing a card.Close on her heels
followed the subject of their conversation, Monsignor himself.As he entered, Carmen rose hastily to greet him.Then, as he straightened up, his glance fell upon Father Waite.For a moment the two men stood
eying each other sharply.Then Lafelle looked from Father Waite to
Carmen quizzically."I beg your pardon," he said, "I was not aware
that you had a caller.Madam Beaubien, is she at home?"murmured Lafelle, looking significantly from the girl to Father
Waite, while a smile curled his lips.He bowed again, and turned toward the exit.She had caught the
churchman's insinuating glance and instantly read its meaning."Monsignor Lafelle, you will remain!"The churchman's brows arched with surprise, but he came back and stood
by the chair which she indicated."And first," went on the girl, standing before him like an incarnate
Nemesis, her face flushed and her eyes snapping, "you will hear from
me a quotation from the Scripture, on which you assume to be
authority: 'As a man thinketh in his heart, so _is_ he!'"Finally a bland
smile spread over his features, and he sat down."Now, Monsignor Lafelle," she continued severely, "you have urged me
to unite with your Church.When you asked me to subscribe to your
beliefs I looked first at them, and then at you, their product.You
have come here this afternoon to plead with me again.The thoughts
which you accepted when you saw Father Waite here alone with me, are
they a reflection of love, which thinketh no evil?Or do they reflect
the intolerance, the bigotry, the hatred of the carnal mind?You told
me that your Church would not let me teach it.Think you I will let it
or you teach me?"Father Waite sat amazed at the girl's stinging rebuke.When she
concluded he rose to go.You have left the Church
of which Monsignor Lafelle is a part.Either you have done that
Church, and him, a great injustice--or he does ignorant or wilful
wrong in insisting that I unite with it.""My dear child," said Lafelle gently, now recovered and wholly on his
guard, "your impetuosity gets the better of your judgment.This is no
occasion for a theological discussion, nor are you sufficiently
informed to bear a part in such.As for myself, you unintentionally do
me great wrong.As I have repeatedly told you, I seek only your
eternal welfare.Else would I not labor with you as I do.""Is my eternal welfare dependent upon
acceptance of the Church's doctrines?""No," he said, in a scarcely audible voice.A cynical look came into Lafelle's eyes.But he replied affably: "When
preachers fall out, the devil falls in.Waite, comes
quite consistently from one who has impudently tossed aside
authority.""My authority, Monsignor," returned the ex-priest in a low tone, "is
Jesus Christ, who said: 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.'"murmured Lafelle; "then it was love that prompted you to abandon
your little flock?""I left my pulpit, Monsignor, because I had nothing to give my people.I no longer believe the dogmas of the Church.And I refused longer to
take the poor people's money to support an institution so politically
religious as I believe your Church to be.I could no longer take their
money to purchase the release of their loved ones from an imagined
purgatory--a place for which there is not the slightest Scriptural
warrant--"

"You mistake, sir!""Very well, Monsignor," replied Father Waite; "grant, then, that there
is such Scriptural warrant; I would nevertheless know that the
existence of purgatory was wholly incompatible with the reign of an
infinite God of love.And, knowing that, I have ceased to extort gifts
of money from the ignorance of the living and the ghastly terrors of
the dying--"

"And so deceive yourself that you are doing a righteous act in
removing their greatest consolation," the churchman again interrupted,
a sneer curving his lip.The consolation which the stupifying drug affords, yes!Ah, Monsignor, as I looked down into the faces of my poor people, week
after week, I knew that no sacerdotal intervention was needed to remit
their sins, for their sins were but their unsolved problems of life.Oh, the poor, grief-stricken mothers who bent their tear-stained eyes
upon me as I preached the 'authority' of the Fathers!Well I knew
that, when I told them from my pulpit that their deceased infants, if
baptized, went straight to heaven, they blindly, madly accepted my
words!And when I went further and told them that their dead babes had
joined the ranks of the blessed, and could thenceforth be prayed to,
could I wonder that they rejoiced and eagerly grasped the false
message of cheer?They believed because they wanted it to be so.And
yet those utterances of mine, based upon the accepted doctrine of
Holy Church, were but narcotics, lulling those poor, afflicted minds
into a false sense of rest and security, and checking all further
human progress.""It is to be regretted," he said
coldly, "that such narrowness of view should be permitted to impede
the salvation of souls.""Ah, how many souls
have I not saved!--and yet I know not whether they or I be really
saved!From misery,
disease, suffering in this life?Ah, my friend, saved only from the torments of a hell and a purgatory
constructed in the fertile minds of busy theologians!""Some other day, perhaps--when it may be
more convenient for us both--and you are alone--"

Carmen laughed."Don't quit the field, Monsignor--unless you surrender
abjectly.And you were quite
indiscreet, if you will recall.""You write my faults in brass," he gently
lamented."When you publish my virtues, if you find that I am
possessed of any, I fear you will write them in water.""Your virtues should advertise themselves,
Monsignor.""Ah, then do you not see in me the virtue of desiring your welfare
above all else, my child?""And the welfare of this great country, which you have come here to
assist in making dominantly Catholic, is it not so, Monsignor?"Then he smiled genially back at the girl."It is an ambition which I am not ashamed to own," he returned
gently."But, Monsignor," Carmen continued earnestly, "are you not aware of
the inevitable failure of your mission?Do you not know that mediaeval
theology comports not with modern progress?""True, my child," replied the churchman."And more, that our
so-called modern progress--modernism, free-thinking, liberty of
conscience, and the consequent terrible extravagance of beliefs and
false creeds--constitutes the greatest menace now confronting this
fair land."Monsignor," said Carmen, "in the Middle Ages the Church was supreme.Emperors and kings bowed in submission before her.Would you be willing, for the sake of Church
supremacy to-day, to return to the state of society and civilization
then obtaining?"I point you to Mexico, Cuba, the Philippines, South America, all
Catholic now or formerly, and I ask if you attribute not their
oppression, their ignorance, their low morals and stunted manhood, to
the dominance of churchly doctrines, which oppose freedom of
conscience and press and speech, and make learning the privilege of
the clergy and the rich?""It is an old argument, child," deprecated Lafelle."May I not point
to France, on the contrary?""She has all but driven the Church from her borders.""And England, though Anglican,
calls herself Catholic.Germany is
forsaking Luther, as she sees the old light shining still undimmed."The latter read in her glance an
invitation further to voice his own convictions."Monsignor doubtless misreads the signs of the times," he said slowly."The hour has struck for the ancient and materialistic theories
enunciated with such assumption of authority by ignorant, often
blindly bigoted theologians, to be laid aside.The religion of our
fathers, which is our present-day evangelical theology, was derived
from the traditions of the early churchmen.They put their seal upon
it; and we blindly accept it as authority, despite the glaring,
irrefutable fact that it is utterly undemonstrable.Why do the people
continue to be deceived by it?only because of its mesmeric
promise of immortality beyond the grave."Monsignor bowed stiffly in the direction of Father Waite."Fortunately,
your willingness to plunge the Christian world into chaos will fail of
concrete results," he said coldly."I but voice the sentiments of millions, Monsignor.For them, too, the
time has come to put by forever the paraphernalia of images, candles,
and all the trinkets used in the pagan ceremonial which has so
quenched our spirituality, and to seek the undivided garment of the
Christ.""The world to-day, Monsignor, stands at the door of a new era, an era
which promises a grander concept of God and religion, the tie which
binds all to Him, than has ever before been known.And we are at
last beginning to work with true scientific precision and system.As
in chemistry, mathematics, and the physical sciences, so in matters
religious, we are beginning to _prove_ our working hypotheses.And so
a new spiritual enlightenment is come.People are awaking to a dim
perception of the meaning of spiritual life, as exemplified in Jesus
Christ.And they are vaguely beginning to see that it is possible to
every one.The abandonment of superstition, religious and other, has
resulted in such a sudden expansion of the human mind that the most
marvelous material progress the world has ever witnessed has come
swiftly upon us, and we live more intensely in a single hour to-day
than our fathers lived in weeks before us.Oh, yes, we are already
growing tired of materiality.But, Monsignor, let not the Church boast itself that the
acceptance of her mediaeval dogmas will meet the world's great need.That need will be met, I think, only as we more and more clearly
perceive the tremendous import of the mission of Jesus, and learn how
to grasp and apply the marvelous Christ-principle which he used and
told us we should likewise employ to work out our salvation."During Father Waite's earnest talk Lafelle sat with his eyes fixed
upon Carmen.When the ex-priest concluded, the churchman ignored him
and vouchsafed no reply.said the girl, after waiting some moments in
expectation.Then, nodding his shapely head, he said in
a pleading tone:

"Have I no champion here?Would you, too, suddenly abolish the Church,
Catholic and Protestant alike?Why, my dear child, with your
ideals--which no one appreciates more highly than I--do you continue
to persecute me so cruelly?Can not you, too, sense the unsoundness of
the views just now so eloquently voiced?"You speak wholly without authority or proof,
as is your wont.""Well," he said, "there are several hundred
million Catholics and Protestants in the world to-day.Would you
presume to say that they are all mistaken, and that you are right?Indeed, I think you set the
Church an example in that respect.""Monsignor, there were once several hundred millions who believed that
the earth was flat, and that the sun revolved about it.But the--"

"And, Monsignor, there are billions to-day who believe that matter is
a solid, substantial reality, and that it possesses life and
sensation.There are billions who believe that the physical eyes see,
and the ears hear, and the hands feel.Yet these beliefs are all
capable of scientific refutation."I am not unacquainted with philosophical speculation," he returned
suggestively."This is not mere speculation, Monsignor," put in Father Waite."The
beliefs of the human mind are its fetish.Such beliefs become in time
national customs, and men defend them with frenzy, utterly wrong and
undemonstrable though they be.Then they remain as the incubus of true
progress.By them understanding becomes degraded, and the human mind
narrows and shrinks.And the mind that clings to them will then
mercilessly hunt out the dissenting minds of its heretical neighbors
and stone them to death for disagreeing.So now, you would stone me
for obeying Christ's command to take up my bed on the Sabbath day.""Still you blazon my faults," he said in
a tone of mock sadness, and addressing Carmen."But, like the Church
which you persecute, I shall endure.We have been martyred throughout
the ages.Our wayward children forsake us,"
nodding toward Father Waite, "and yet we welcome their return when
they have tired of the husks.The press teems with slander against us;
we are reviled from east to west.But our reply is that such slander
and untruth can best be met by our leading individual lives of such an
exemplary nature as to cause all men to be attracted by our holy
light.""I agree with you, Monsignor," quickly replied Carmen."Scurrilous
attacks upon the Church but make it a martyr.Vilification returns
upon the one who hurls the abuse.One can not fling mud without
soiling one's hands.I oppose not men, but human systems of thought.Whatever is good will stand, and needs no defense.And there is no excuse, for salvation is at hand.""_Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts_,"
she replied earnestly."_To him that soweth righteousness_--right
thinking--_shall be a sure reward_.Ah, Monsignor, do you at heart
believe that the religion of the Christ depends upon doctrines, signs,
dogmas?But signs and proofs naturally and inevitably
follow the right understanding of Jesus' teachings, even according to
these words: _These signs shall follow them that believe_.Paul gave the
formula for salvation, when he said: _But we all with open face beholding
as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord_.Can you see that, taking Jesus as our model and
following his every command--seeing Him only, the Christ-principle, which
is God, good, without any admixture of evil--we change, even though
slowly, from glory to glory, step by step, until we rise out of all
sense of evil and death?And this is done by the Spirit which is God.""Yes," said Father Waite, taking up the conversation when she paused."Even the poorest human being can understand that.Why, then, the
fungus growth of traditions, ceremonies, rites and forms which have
sprung up about the Master's simple words?Why the wretched
formalistic worship throughout the world?Why the Church's frigid,
lifeless traditions, so inconsistent with the enlarging sense of God
which marks this latest century?The Church has yet to prove its
utility, its right to exist and to pose as the religious teacher of
mankind.Else must it fall beneath the axe which is even now at the
root of the barren tree of theology.Her theology, like the Judaism of
the Master's day, has no prophets, no poets, no singers.And her
priests, as in his time, have sunk into a fanatical observance of
ritual and form.""And yet," observed Carmen, "you still urge me to unite with it."Moreover, it irked him sore to be made a
target for the unassailable logic of the apostate Waite.Then, too,
the appearance of the ex-priest there that afternoon in company with
this girl who held such radical views regarding religious matters
portended in his thought the possibility of a united assault upon the
foundations of his cherished system.She
nettled and exasperated him.Did he
have the power to silence her?he asked, with a show of gaiety."Yes," replied Carmen, "you may go now."He, Monsignor, a dignitary of
Holy Church?He turned upon the girl and her
companion, furious with anger."I have been very patient with you both," he said in a voice that he
could not control.Abuse the Church
as you will, the fact remains that the world fears her and trembles
before her awful voice!Because the world recognizes her mighty
power, a power of unified millions of human beings and exhaustless
wealth.She is the leader, the guide, the teacher, the supreme object
of worship of a countless army who would lay down their lives to-day
for her.Her subjects gather from every quarter of the globe.They are
English, French, German, American--_but they are Catholics first_!Emperor, King, Ruler, or Government--all are alike subject to her
supreme, divine authority!Nationalities, customs, family ties--all
melt away before her, to whom her followers bow in loyal consecration.The power which her supreme leader and head wields is all but
omnipotent!He is by divine decree Lord of the world.Hundreds of
millions bend before his throne and offer him their hearts and swords!I say, you have good reason to quake!The onward march of Holy Church is not disturbed by the croaking
calumnies of such as you who would assault her!And to you I say,
beware!"His face was purple, as he stopped and mopped his damp brow."What we have to beware of, Monsignor," said Father Waite gravely, "is
the steady encroachments of Rome in this country, with her weapons of
fear, ignorance, and intolerance--"

"Intolerance!Why, in this country, whose
Constitution provided toleration for every form of religion--"

Carmen had risen and gone to the man."Monsignor," she said, "the
founders of the American nation did provide for religious tolerance--and
they were wise according to their light.But we of this day are
still wiser, for we have some knowledge of the wonderful working of
mental laws.I, too, believe in toleration of opinion.You are
welcome to yours, and I to mine.But--and here is the great point--the
opinion which Holy Church has held throughout the ages regarding those
who do not accept her dogmas is that they are damned, that they are
outcasts of heaven, that they merit the stake and rack.The Church's
hatred of heretics has been deadly.Her thought concerning them has
not been that of love, such as Jesus sent out to all who did not
agree with him, but deadly, suggestive hatred.Now our Constitution
does not provide for tolerance of hate and murder-thoughts, which enter
the minds of the unsuspecting and work destruction there in the form
of disease, disaster, and death.That is what we object to in you,
Monsignor.And toward such thoughts we have a right to be very intolerant, even to
the point of destroying them in human mentalities.Again I say, I war
not against people, but against the murderous carnal thought of the
human mind!"Monsignor had fallen back before the girl's strong words.His face
had grown black, and his hands were working convulsively."Monsignor," continued Carmen in a low, steady voice, "you have
threatened me with something which you apparently hold over me.You
are very like the people of Galilee: if you can not refute by reason,
you would circumvent by law, by the Constitution, by Congress.Instead of threatening us with the flames
of hell for not being good, why do you not show us by the great
example of Jesus' love how to be so?Are you manifesting love now--or
the carnal mind?I judge your Church by such as manifest it to me.How, then, shall I judge it by you to-day?"He rose slowly and took her by the hand."I beg your pardon," he said
in a strange, unnatural voice.And I assure you that you quite
misunderstand me, and the Church which I represent."Surely, Monsignor," returned the girl heartily."A debate such as
this is stimulating, don't you think so?""Ah, Monsignor," she said lightly, as she stepped into the room.Why have you avoided me since your return to America?""Madam," replied Lafelle, in some confusion, "no one regrets more than
I the press of business which necessitated it.But your little friend
has told me I may return.""Always welcome, Monsignor," replied the Beaubien, scanning him
narrowly as she accompanied him to the door."By the way, you forgot
our little compact, did you not?""Madam, I came out of a sense of duty.""Of that I have no doubt, Monsignor.She returned again to the music room, where Carmen made her acquainted
with Father Waite, and related the conversation with Lafelle.While
the girl talked the Beaubien's expression grew serious.Then Carmen
launched into her association with the ex-priest, concluding with:
"And he must have something to do, right away, to earn his living!"She always did when Carmen, no matter how
serious the conversation, infused her sparkling animation into it."That isn't nearly as important as to know what he thinks about
Monsignor's errand here this afternoon, dearie," she said."Madam," he said with great seriousness, "I would
be very wide awake."The Beaubien studied him for a moment."I think--I think--" He hesitated, and looked at Carmen."I think he--has been greatly angered by--this girl--and by my
presence here."Then abruptly: "What are you going to do
now?""I have funds enough to keep me some weeks, Madam, while making plans
for the future.""Then remain where I can keep in touch with you."For the Beaubien had just returned from a two hours' ride with J.
Wilton Ames, and she felt that she needed a friend.CHAPTER 20


The Beaubien sat in the rounded window of the breakfast room.Carmen
nestled at her feet.The maid had just removed the remains of the
light luncheon."Dearest, please, _please_ don't look so serious!"The Beaubien twined her fingers through the girl's flowing locks."I
will try, girlie," she said, though her voice broke.Carmen looked up into her face with a wistful yearning."Ever since Monsignor Lafelle and Father Waite
were here you have been so quiet; and that was nearly a week ago.I
know I can help, if you will only let me.""By knowing that God is everywhere, and that evil is unreal and
powerless," came the quick, invariable reply.Why, if I were chained to a stake, with fire all around me, I'd
know it wasn't true!""I think you are chained--and the fire has been kindled," said the
woman in a voice that fell to a whisper."Then your thought is wrong--all wrong!And wrong thought just _can't_
be externalized to me, for I know that 'There shall no mischief happen
to the righteous,' that is, to the right-thinking.The Beaubien got up and walked slowly around
the room, as if to summon her strength."I'm going to tell you," she said firmly."You are right, and I have
been wrong.I--I
have lost a great deal of money."I have discovered in the past few months that there are better
things in life.But--" her lips tightened, and her eyes half
closed--"he can _not_ have you!"Listen, child: I know not why it is, but you awaken something in
every life into which you come.The woman I was a year ago and the
woman I am to-day meet almost as strangers now.The only answer I
can give is, you.I don't know what you did to people in South
America; I can only surmise.Yet of this I am certain, wherever you
went you made a path of light.But the effect you have on people
differs with differing natures.Just why this is, I do not know.It
must have something to do with those mental laws of which I am so
ignorant, and of which you know so much."Carmen looked at her in wondering anticipation.The Beaubien smiled
down into the face upturned so lovingly, and went on:

"From what you have told me about your priest, Jose, I know that you
were the light of his life.He loved you to the complete obliteration
of every other interest.You have not said so; but I know it.How,
indeed, could it be otherwise?On the other hand, that heartless
Diego--his mad desire to get possession of you was only animal.Why
should you, a child of heaven, arouse such opposite sentiments?""Dearest," said the girl, laying her head on the woman's knees, "that
isn't what's worrying you.""No--but I think of it so often.And, as for me, you have turned me
inside-out.""Well, I think this side wears better,
don't you?""It is softer--it may not," returned the woman gently."But I have no
desire to change back."Ames
and I have been--no, not friends.I had no higher ideals than he, and
I played his game with him.And at a time when he had
involved me heavily financially.The Colombian revolution--his cotton
deal--he must have foreseen, he is so uncanny--he must have known that
to involve me meant control whenever he might need me!He needs me
now, for I stand between him and you.""God stands between me and every
form of evil!"She sat down on the arm of the Beaubien's chair."Is it
because you will not let him have me that he threatens to ruin you
financially?"He couldn't ruin me in reputation, for--" her voice again faded
to a whisper, "I haven't any."cried the girl, throwing her arms about the
woman's neck."Your true self is just coming to light!The Beaubien suddenly burst into a flood of tears.The strain of weeks
was at last manifesting."Oh, I have been in the gutter!--he dragged
me through the mire!--and I let him!I schemed and plotted with him; I ruined and pillaged
with him; I murdered reputations and blasted lives with him, that I
might get money, dirty, blood-stained money!Oh, Carmen, I didn't know
what I was doing, until you came!And now I'd hang on the cross if I
could undo it!And he has you and me in his
clutches, and he is crushing us!"She bent her head and sobbed
violently."Be still, and _know_ that I am
God."The Beaubien raised her head and smiled feebly through her
tears."He governs all, dearest," whispered Carmen, as she drew the woman's
head to her breast.cried the Beaubien, starting up.No, we will stay and meet them, right here!"The Beaubien's hand shook as she clasped Carmen's."I can't turn to
Kane, nor to Fitch, nor Weston.I've
ruined Gannette myself--for him!Hawley-Crowles--"

"Mrs.sobbed the suffering woman, clinging to the girl."I lent her money--took her notes--which I sold again to Mr."Well, you can buy them back, can't you?"Most that I have is mortgaged to him on the investments I made at his
direction," wailed the woman."I will try--I am trying, desperately!But--there is Monsignor Lafelle!"And I'm sure he holds something over
you and me.But, I will send for him--I will renew my vows to his
Church--anything to--"

"Listen, dearest," interrupted Carmen.If I am the cause of it all, I can--"

"You will not!"The desperate woman put her head in the girl's lap and sobbed
bitterly."There is a way out, dearest," whispered Carmen."I _know_ there is,
no matter what seems to be or to happen, for 'underneath are the
everlasting arms.'Hawley-Crowles told me this
morning that Mrs.Ames intends to give a big reception next week.And--it will be right, I
know."And Carmen sat with the repentant woman all that day, struggling with
her to close the door upon her sordid past, and to open it wide to
"that which is to come."*       *       *       *       *

The days following were busy ones for many with whom our story is
concerned.Every morning saw Carmen on her way to the Beaubien, to
comfort and advise.Every afternoon found her yielding gently to the
relentless demands of society, or to the tiresome calls of her
thoroughly ardent wooer, the young Duke of Altern.Carmen would have
helped him if she could.But she found so little upon which to build.And she bore with him largely on account of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, for
whom she and the Beaubien were now daily laboring.The young man
tacitly assumed proprietorship over the girl, and all society was agog
with expectation of the public announcement of their engagement.Hawley-Crowles still came and went upon a tide of unruffled joy.The cornucopia of Fortune lay full at her feet.Her broker, Ketchim,
basked in the sunlight of her golden smiles--and quietly sold his own
Simiti stock on the strength of her patronage.Society fawned and
smirked at her approach, and envied her brilliant success, as it
copied the cut of her elaborate gowns--all but the deposed Mrs.Ames
and her unlovely daughter, who sulked and hated, until they received a
call from Monsignor Lafelle.This was shortly after that gentleman's
meeting with Carmen and Father Waite in the Beaubien mansion.And he
left the Ames home with an ominous look on his face."The girl is a
menace," he muttered, "and she deserves her fate."The Ames grand reception, promising to be the most brilliant event of
the year, barring the famous _Bal de l'Opera_, was set for Thursday.Hawley-Crowles nor Carmen had received invitations.To the former it was evident that there was some mistake."For it
can't be possible that the hussy doesn't intend to invite us!"Hawley-Crowles
drenched with tears of anxiety and vexation."I'd call her up and ask,
if I dared," she groaned.And, to the
amazement of the exclusive set, the brilliant function was held
without the presence of its acknowledged leaders, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
and her ward, the Inca princess.*       *       *       *       *

On Wednesday night Harris arrived from Denver.His arrival was
instantly made known to J. Wilton Ames, who, on the morning following,
summoned both him and Philip O. Ketchim to his private office.There
were present, also, Monsignor Lafelle and Alonzo Hood.The latter was observed to change color as he
timidly entered the room and faced the waiting audience."Be seated, gentlemen," said Ames genially, after cordially shaking
hands with them and introducing the churchman.Then, turning to
Harris, "You are on your way to Colombia, I learn.Going down to
inaugurate work on the Simiti holdings, I suppose?"Harris threw a quick glance at Ketchim.The latter sat blank,
wondering if there were any portions of the earth to which Ames's long
arms did not reach."As a matter of fact," Ames continued, leaning back in his chair and
pressing the tips of his fingers together before him, "a hitch seems
to have developed in Simiti proceedings.Ketchim," turning suddenly and sharply upon that gentleman, "because
my brokers have picked up for me several thousand shares of the
stock.""But," proceeded Ames calmly, "now that I have put money into it, I
learn that the Simiti Company has no property whatever in Colombia."A haze slowly gathered before Ketchim's eyes."How do you make that out, Mr.he
heard Harris say in a voice that seemed to come from an infinite
distance."I myself saw the title papers which old Rosendo had, and
saw them transferred to Mr.Moreover,
I personally visited the mine in question."The
property was relocated by this Rosendo, and he secured title to it
under the name of the Chicago mine.It was that name which deceived
the clerks in the Department of Mines in Cartagena, and caused them to
issue title, not knowing that it really was the famous old La
Libertad.""Well, I don't see that there is any ground for confusion.""Simply this," returned Ames evenly: "La Libertad mine, since the
death of its former owner, Don Ignacio de Rincon, has belonged to the
Church.""By what right does it belong to the
Church?""By the ancient law of _'en manos muertas'_, my friend," replied Ames,
unperturbed."Our friend, Monsignor Lafelle, representing the Church, will
explain," said Ames, waving a hand toward that gentleman."I deeply regret this unfortunate
situation, gentlemen," he began.Ames has pointed out,
the confusion came about through issuing title to the mine under the
name Chicago.Don Ignacio de Rincon, long before his departure from
Colombia after the War of Independence, drew up his last will, and,
following the established custom among wealthy South Americans of that
day, bequeathed this mine, La Libertad, and other property, to the
Church, invoking the old law of _'en manos muertas'_ which, being
translated, means, 'in dead hands.'Pious Catholics of many lands have
done the same throughout the centuries.Such a bequest places property
in the custody of the Church; and it may never be sold or disposed of
in any way, but all revenue from it must be devoted to the purchase of
Masses for the souls in purgatory.It was through the merest chance, I
assure you, that your mistake was brought to light.Ames, had purchased stock in your company, I took the
pains to investigate while in Cartagena recently, and made the
discovery which unfortunately renders your claim to the mine quite
null."turning savagely
upon the paralyzed Ketchim."That," interposed Ames with cruel significance, "is a matter which he
will explain in court."Fleeting visions of the large blocks of stock which he had sold; of
the widows, orphans, and indigent clergymen whom he had involved; of
the notes which the banks held against him; of his questionable deals
with Mrs.Hawley-Crowles; and of the promiscuous peddling of his own
holdings in the now ruined company, rushed over the clouded mind of
this young genius of high finance.His tongue froze, though his
trembling body dripped with perspiration.Somehow he found the door, and groped his way to a descending
elevator.And somehow he lived through that terror-haunted day and
night.But very early next morning, while his blurred eyes were drinking in
the startling report of the Simiti Company's collapse, as set forth in
the newspaper which he clutched in his shaking hand, the maid led in a
soft-stepping gentleman, who laid a hand upon his quaking shoulder and
read to him from a familiar-looking document an irresistible
invitation to take up lodgings in the city jail.*       *       *       *       *

There were other events forward at the same time, which came to light
that fateful next day.Hawley-Crowles, after a
night of mingled worry and anger over the deliberate or unintentional
exclusion of herself and Carmen from the Ames reception the preceding
night, descended to her combined breakfast and luncheon.At her plate
lay the morning mail, including a letter from France.She tore it
open, hastily scanned it, then dropped with a gasp into her chair."Father--married to--a French--adventuress!The long-cherished hope of a speedy inheritance of his snug fortune
lay blasted at her feet.The telephone bell rang sharply, and she rose dully to answer it.The
call came from the city editor of one of the great dailies."It is
reported," said the voice, "that your ward, Miss Carmen Ariza, is the
illegitimate daughter of a <DW64> priest, now in South America.We
would like your denial, for we learn that it was for this reason that
you and the young lady were not included among the guests at the Ames
reception last evening."Hawley-Crowles's legs tottered under her, as she blindly wandered
from the telephone without replying.Carmen--the daughter of a priest!Her father a <DW64>--her mother, what?The stunned woman mechanically took up the morning paper which lay on
the table.Her glance was at once attracted to the great headlines
announcing the complete exposure of the Simiti bubble.Her eyes nearly
burst from her head as she grasped its fatal meaning to her.With a
low, inarticulate sound issuing from her throat, she turned and groped
her way back to her boudoir.*       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, the automobile in which Carmen was speeding to the
Beaubien mansion was approached by a bright, smiling young woman, as
it halted for a moment at a street corner.Carmen recognized her as
a reporter for one of the evening papers, who had called often at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion that season for society items."I was on my way
to see you.Our office received a report this morning from some source
that your father--you know, there has been some mystery about your
parentage--that he was really a priest, of South America.His
name--let me think--what did they say it was?"The problem
of her descent had really become a source of amusement to her."It began with a D, if I am not mistaken.I'm not up on Spanish
names," the young woman returned pleasantly."Well, I'm sure I can't say."But--you think it was, don't you?""Well, I don't believe it was Padre Diego--he wasn't a good man."I was in his house, in Banco.He used to insist that I
was his child."By the way, you knew a woman named Jude, didn't you?But she took you out of a house down on--"

"Yes.And I've tried to find her ever since.""You know Father Waite, too, the ex-priest?""You and he going to work together, I suppose?""Why, I'm sure I don't know.You think this Diego might
have been your father?That is, you can't say positively that he
wasn't?"You can come up to the
house and talk about South America, if you want to."She nodded pleasantly, and the car moved away.The innocent, ingenuous
girl was soon to learn what modern news-gathering and dissemination
means in this great Republic.But she rode on, happy in the thought
that she and the Beaubien were formulating plans to save Mrs."We'll arrange it somehow," said the Beaubien, looking up from her
papers when Carmen entered."Go, dearie, and play the organ while I
finish this.Then I will return home with you to have a talk with Mrs.For hours the happy girl lingered at the beloved organ.The Beaubien
at her desk below stopped often to listen.And often she would hastily
brush away the tears, and plunge again into her papers."I suppose I
should have told Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," she said."But I couldn't give
her any hope.And yet," she reflected
sadly, "who would believe _me_?"The morning papers lay still unread
upon her table.Late in the afternoon the Beaubien with Carmen entered her car and
directed the chauffeur to drive to the Hawley-Crowles home.As they
entered a main thoroughfare they heard the newsboys excitedly crying
extras.Of a sudden a vague, unformed presentiment of impending evil came to
the girl.She half rose, and clutched the Beaubien's hand.Then there
flitted through her mind like a beam of light the words of the
psalmist: "A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee."She sank back against
the Beaubien's shoulder and closed her eyes.Presently the chauffeur turned and said something
through the speaking tube.cried the Beaubien, springing from the seat.A loud cry escaped her as she took the sheet and glanced at the
startling headlines.James Hawley-Crowles, financially ruined,
and hurled to disgrace from the pinnacle of social leadership by the
awful exposure of the parentage of her ward, had been found in her
bedroom, dead, with a revolver clasped in her cold hand.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The chill winds of another autumn swirled through the masonry-lined
canons of the metropolis and sighed among the stark trees of its
deserted parks.They caught up the tinted leaves that dropped from
quivering branches and tossed them high, as Fate wantons with human
hopes before she blows her icy breath upon them.They shrieked among
the naked spars of the _Cossack_, drifting with her restless master
far out upon the white-capped waves.They moaned in low-toned agony
among the marble pillars of the Crowles mausoleum, where lay in
pitying sleep the misguided woman whose gods of gold and tinsel had
betrayed her.On the outskirts of the Bronx, in a newly opened suburb, a slender
girl, with books and papers under her arm, walked slowly against the
sharp wind, holding her hat with her free hand, and talking rapidly to
a young man who accompanied her.Toward them came an old <DW64>,
leaning upon a cane.As he stepped humbly aside to make room, the girl
looked up.Then, without stopping, she slipped a few coins into his
coat pocket as she passed.The <DW64> stood in dumb amazement.He was poor--his clothes were thin
and worn--but he was not a beggar--he had asked nothing.The girl
turned and threw back a smile to him.Then of a sudden there came into
the old man's wrinkled, care-lined face such a look, such a
comprehension of that love which knows neither Jew nor Gentile, Greek
nor Barbarian, as would have caused even the Rabbis, at the cost of
defilement, to pause and seek its heavenly meaning.A few blocks farther on the strong wind sternly disputed the girl's
right to proceed, and she turned with a merry laugh to her companion.But as she stood, the wind fell, leaving a heap of dead leaves about
her feet.She stooped and
took up a two-dollar bill.Her companion threw her a wondering look; but the girl made no
comment.In silence they went on, until a few minutes more of brisk
walking brought them to a newly built, stucco-coated bungalow.Running
rapidly up the steps, the girl threw wide the door and called, "Mother
dear!"The Beaubien rose from her sewing to receive the hearty embrace.she said, devouring the sparkling creature with eager
eyes.Lewis begins his law course at once, and I may take
what I wish.Hitt's coming to call to-night and bring a
friend, a Mr.The Beaubien drew the girl to her and kissed her again and again.Then
she glanced over her shoulder at the man with a bantering twinkle in
her eyes and said, "Don't you wish you could do that?"Yes he can, too, mother," asserted the girl."I'm afraid it wouldn't look well," he said."And, besides, I don't dare lose my heart to her."With a final squeeze the girl tore herself from the Beaubien's
reluctant arms and hurried to the little kitchen."What is it
to-night, Jude?"she demanded, catching the domestic in a vigorous
embrace."Well, then, liver and bacon, with floating island," she whispered,
very mysteriously.Returning to the little parlor, Carmen encountered the fixed gaze of
both the Beaubien and Father Waite.she demanded, stopping and
looking from one to the other.said the Beaubien, in a tone of mock
severity."Oh," laughed the girl, running to the woman and seating herself in
the waiting lap, "he told, didn't he?Can't I ever trust you with a
secret?"in a tone of rebuke, turning to the man."Surely," he replied, laughing; "and I should not have divulged
this had I not seen in the incident something more than mere
chance--something meant for us all.""I--I think I have seen the working of a
stupendous mental law--am I not right?""You saw
a need, and met it, unsolicited.You found your own in another's
good."The girl smiled at the Beaubien without replying."What about it,
dearie?""She need not answer," said Father Waite, "for we know.She but cast
her bread upon the unfathomable ocean of love, and it returned to her,
wondrously enriched.""If you are going to talk about me, I shall not stay," declared
Carmen, rising.And she departed for the
kitchen, but not without leaving a smile for each of them as she went.The Beaubien and Father Waite remained some moments in silence."She is the light that is
guiding me.This little incident which you have just related is but a
manifestation of the law of love by which she lives.She gave,
unasked, and with no desire to be seen and advertised.There was no chance, no
miracle, no luck about it.It was--it
was--only the working of her beloved Christ-principle.if
we only knew--"

"We _shall_ know, Madam!""Her secret is
but the secret of Jesus himself, which was open to a world too dull to
comprehend.And," his eyes brightening, "to
that end I have been formulating a great plan.That's why I've asked
Hitt to come here to-night.Remember, my
dear friend, we are true searchers; and 'all things work together for
good to them that love God.'Our love of truth and real good is so
great that, like the consuming desire of the Jewish nation, it is
_bound_ to bring the Christ!"*       *       *       *       *

For three months the Beaubien and Carmen had dwelt together in this
lowly environment; and here they had found peace, the first that the
tired woman had known since childhood.The sudden culmination of those
mental forces which had ejected Carmen from society, crushed Ketchim
and a score of others, and brought the deluded Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to
a bitter end, had left the Beaubien with dulled sensibilities.Even
Ames himself had been shocked into momentary abandonment of his
relentless pursuit of humanity by the unanticipated _denouement_.But
when he had sufficiently digested the newspaper accounts wherein were
set forth in unsparing detail the base rumors of the girl's parentage
and of her removal from a brothel before her sudden elevation to
social heights, he rose in terrible wrath and prepared to hunt down to
the death the perpetrators of the foul calumny.Whence had come this
tale, which even the girl could not refute?He had
sailed for Europe--though but a day before.The man was
cringing like a craven murderer in his cell, for none dared give him
bail.Was it revenge for his own sharp move in regard to
La Libertad?He would have given all he possessed to lay his heavy
hands upon the guilty ones!The editors of the great newspapers,
perhaps?Ames raged like a wounded lion in the office of every editor
in the city.But they were perfectly safe, for the girl, although she
told a straightforward story, could not say positively that the
published statements concerning her were false.Yet, though few knew
it, there were two city editors and several reporters who, in the days
immediately following, found it convenient to resign their positions
and leave the city before the awful wrath of the powerful man.And, after weeks of terror, that
browbeaten woman, her hair whitening under the terrible persecution of
her relentless master, fled secretly, with her terrified daughter, to
England, whither the stupified Duke of Altern and his scandalized
mother had betaken themselves immediately following the expose.Thereupon Ames's lawyer drew up a bill of divorce, alleging desertion,
and laid it before the judge who fed from his master's hand.Meantime, the devouring wrath of Ames swept like a prairie fire over the
dry, withering stalks of the smart set.He vowed he would take Carmen
and flaunt her in the faces of the miserable character-assassins who
had sought her ruin!He swore he would support her with his untold
millions and force society to acknowledge her its queen!He had it
in his power to wreck the husband of every arrogant, supercilious
dame in the entire clique!He commenced at once with the unfortunate
Gannette.The latter, already tottering, soon fell before the subtle
machinations of Hodson and his able cohorts.Then, as a telling example
to the rest, Ames pursued him to the doors of the Lunacy Commission,
and rested not until that body had condemned his victim to a living
death in a state asylum.Kane, Fitch, and Weston fled to cover, and
concentrated their guns upon their common enemy.The Beaubien alone
stood out against him for three months.Her existence was death in
life; but from the hour that she first read the newspaper intelligence
regarding Carmen and the unfortunate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, she hid the
girl so completely that Ames was effectually balked in his attempts at
drastic vindication in her behalf.But this served only to intensify his anger, and he thereupon turned
its full force upon the lone woman.Driven to desperation, she stood
at length at bay and hurled at him her remaining weapon.Again the
social set was rent, and this time by the report that the black cloud
of bigamy hung over Ames.It was a fat season for the newspapers, and
they made the most of it.As a result, several of them found
themselves with libel suits on their hands.The Beaubien herself was
confronted with a suit for defamation of character, and was obliged to
testify before the judge whom Ames owned outright that she had but the
latter's word for the charge, and that, years since, in a moment of
maudlin sentimentalism, he had confessed to her that, as far as he
knew, the wife of his youth was still living.Ames then took his heavy toll, and retired within himself to sulk
and plan future assaults and reprisals.The Beaubien, crushed, broken, sick at heart, gathered up the scant
remains of her once large fortune, disposed of her effects, and
withdrew to the outskirts of the city.She would have left the
country, but for the fact that the tangled state of her finances
necessitated her constant presence in New York while her lawyers
strove to bring order out of chaos and placate her raging persecutor.To flee meant complete abandonment of her every financial resource to
Ames.And so, with the assistance of Father Waite and Elizabeth Wall,
who placed themselves at once under her command, she took a little
house, far from the scenes of her troubles, and quietly removed
thither with Carmen.One day shortly thereafter a woman knocked timidly at her door.Carmen
saw the caller and fled into her arms.The woman had come to return the string of pearls which the girl had
thrust into her hands on the night of the Charity Ball.She had not been able to bring herself to sell them.She
had wanted--oh, she knew not what, excepting that she wanted to see
again the girl whose image had haunted her since that eventful night
when the strange child had wandered into her abandoned life.Yes, she
would have given her testimony as to Carmen; but who would have
believed her, a prostitute?And--but the radiant girl gathered her in
her arms and would not let her go without a promise to return.And each time there was a change in
her.The Beaubien always forced upon her a little money and a promise
to come back.It developed that Jude was cooking in a cheap down-town
restaurant."Why not for us, mother, if she will?"And, though the sin-stained woman demurred and protested her
unworthiness, yet the love that knew no evil drew her irresistibly,
and she yielded at length, with her heart bursting.Then, in her great joy, Carmen's glad cry echoed through the little
house: "Oh, mother dear, we're free, we're free!"But the Beaubien was not free.Night after night her sleepless pillow
was wet with bitter tears of remorse, when the accusing angel stood
before her and relentlessly revealed each act of shameful meanness, of
cruel selfishness, of sordid immorality in her wasted life.And,
lastly, the weight of her awful guilt in bringing about the
destruction of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles lay upon her soul like a mountain.Oh, if she had only foreseen even a little of it!Oh, that Carmen had
come to her before--or not at all!And yet she could not wish that she
had never known the girl.The day of judgment was bound
to come.And, but for the comforting presence of
that sweet child, she had long since become a raving maniac.It was
Carmen who, in those first long nights of gnawing, corroding remorse,
wound her soft arms about the Beaubien's neck, as she lay tossing in
mental agony on her bed, and whispered the assurances of that infinite
Love which said, "Behold, I make all things new!"It was Carmen who
whispered to her of the everlasting arms beneath, and of the mercy
reflected by him who, though on the cross, forgave mankind because of
their pitiable ignorance.It is ignorance, always ignorance of what
constitutes real good, that makes men seek it through wrong channels.The Beaubien had sought good--all the world does--but she had never
known that God alone is good, and that men cannot find it until they
reflect Him.And so she had "missed the mark."Oh, sinful, mesmerized
world, ye shall find Me--the true good--only when ye seek Me with all
your heart!And yet, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins."Only a God who is love could voice such a promise!And Carmen knew;
and she hourly poured her great understanding of love into the empty
heart of the stricken Beaubien.Then at last came days of quiet, and planning for the future.The
Beaubien would live--yes, but not for herself.Nay, that life had gone
out forever, nor would mention of it pass her lips again.The
Colombian revolution--her mendacious connivances with Ames--her
sinful, impenitent life of gilded vice--aye, the door was now closed
against that, absolutely and forever more.She had passed through the
throes of a new birth; she had risen again from the bed of anguish;
but she rose stripped of her worldly strength.Carmen was now the
staff upon which she leaned.And Carmen--what had been her thought when foul calumny laid its sooty
touch upon her?What had been the working of her mind when that world
which she had sought to illumine with the light of her own purity had
cast her out?When the blow fell the portals of her mind closed at once against
every accusing thought, against every insidious suggestion of defeat,
of loss, of dishonor.The arrows of malice, as well as those of
self-pity and condemnation, snapped and fell, one by one, as they
hurtled vainly against the whole armor of God wherewith the girl stood
clad.Self sank into service; and she gathered the bewildered,
suffering Beaubien into her arms as if she had been a child.She would
have gone to Ames, too, had she been permitted--not to plead for
mercy, but to offer the tender consolation and support which, despite
the havoc he was committing, she knew he needed even more than the
Beaubien herself."Paul had been a murderer," she often said, as she sat in the darkness
alone with the suffering woman and held her trembling hand."But he
became the chief of apostles.When the light came, he
shut the door against the past.If he hadn't, dearest, he never could
have done what he did.Ames, will have to do the
same."And this the Beaubien could do, and did, after months of
soul-racking struggle.But Ames sat in spiritual darkness, whipped by
the foul brood of lust and revenge, knowing not that the mountainous
wrath which he hourly heaped higher would some day fall, and bury him
fathoms deep.Throughout the crisis Father Waite had stood by them stanchly."I've just longed for some reasonable
excuse to become a social outcast," the latter had said, as she was
helping Carmen one day to pack her effects prior to removing from the
Hawley-Crowles mansion."I long for a hearthstone to which I can
attach myself--"

"Then attach yourself to ours!""For I know that now you are really
going to live--and I want to live as you will.Moreover--" She paused
and smiled queerly at the girl--"I am quite in love with your hero,
Father Waite, you know."Harris, too, made a brief call before departing again for Denver."I've got to hustle for a living now," he explained, "and it's me for
the mountains once more!New York is no place for such a tender lamb
as I. Oh, I've been well trimmed--but I know enough now to keep away
from this burg!"While he was yet speaking there came a loud ring at the front door of
the little bungalow, followed immediately by the entrance of the
manager of a down-town vaudeville house.He plunged at once into his
errand.He would offer Carmen one hundred dollars a week, and a
contract for six months, to appear twice daily in his theater.but she did put it over
the society ginks."And the Beaubien, shivering at the awful
proposal, was glad Harris was there to lead the zealous theatrical man
firmly to the door.Lastly, came one Amos A. Hitt, gratuitously, to introduce himself as
one who knew Cartagena and was likely to return there in the not
distant future, where he would be glad to do what he might to remove
the stain which had been laid upon the name of the fair girl.The
genuineness of the man stood out so prominently that the Beaubien took
him at once into her house, where he was made acquainted with Carmen."Oh," cried the girl, "Cartagena!Why, I wonder--do you know Padre
Jose de Rincon?""A priest who once taught there in the University, many years ago?And
who was sent up the river, to Simiti?Then Carmen fell upon his neck; and there in that moment was begun a
friendship that grew daily stronger, and in time bore richest fruit.It soon became known that Hitt was giving a course of lectures that
fall in the University, covering the results of his archaeological
explorations; so Carmen and Father Waite went often to hear him.And
the long breaths of University atmosphere which the girl inhaled
stimulated a desire for more.Besides, Father Waite had some time
before announced his determination to study there that winter, as long
as his meager funds would permit."I shall take up law," he had one day said."It will open to me the
door of the political arena, where there is such great need of real
men, men who stand for human progress, patriotism, and morality.I
shall seek office--not for itself, but for the good I can do, and the
help I can be in a practical way to my fellow-men.Carmen shared the inspiration; and so she, too, with the Beaubien's
permission, applied for admittance to the great halls of learning, and
was accepted.*       *       *       *       *

"And now," began Father Waite that evening, when Hitt and his friend
had come, and, to the glad surprise of Carmen, Elizabeth Wall had
driven up in her car to take the girl for a ride, but had yielded to
the urgent invitation to join the little conference, "my plan, in
which I invite you to join, is, briefly, _to study this girl_!"Carmen's eyes opened wide, and her face portrayed blank amazement, as
Father Waite stood pointing gravely to her.Nor were the others less
astonished--all but the Beaubien."Let me explain," Father Waite continued."We are assembled here
to-night as representatives, now or formerly, of very diversified
lines of human thought.I have stood as the
embodiment of Christly claims, as the active agent of one of the
mightiest of human institutions, the ancient Christian Church.For
years I have studied its accepted authorities and its all-inclusive
assumptions, which embrace heaven, earth, and hell.For years I sought
with sincere consecration to apply its precepts to the dire needs of
humanity.I have traced its origin in the dim twilight of the
Christian era and its progress down through the centuries, through
heavy vicissitudes to absolute supremacy, on down through schisms and
subsequent decline, to the present hour, when the great system seems
to be gathering its forces for a life and death stand in this, the New
World.I have known and associated with its dignitaries and its humble
priests.I know the policies and motives underlying its quiet
movements.And so I
withdrew from it my allegiance."Carmen's thought, as she listened, was busy with another whose
experience had not been dissimilar, but about whom the human coils had
been too tightly wound to be so easily broken.Hitt," Father Waite went on, "represented
the great protest against the abuses and corruption which permeated
the system for which I stood.He, like myself, embodied the eternal
warfare of the true believer against the heretic.Yet, without my
churchly system, I was taught to believe, he and those who share his
thought are damned.we both claimed the same
divine Father, and accepted the Christly definition of Him as Love.We
were two brothers of the same great family, yet calling each other
_anathema_!""And to-day," he continued, "we
brothers are humbly meeting on the common ground of failure--failure
to understand the Christ, and to meet the needs of our fellow-men with
our elaborate systems of theology.""I heard another priest, years ago, make a similar confession," said
Hitt reflectively."I would he were here to-night!""He is here, in spirit," replied Father Waite; "for the same spirit of
eager inquiry and humble desire for truth that animates us no doubt
moved him.I have reason to think so," he added, looking at Carmen."For this girl's spiritual development I believe to be very largely
his work."He knew but little as yet of her
past association with the priest Jose.Hitt, represented the greatest systems of so-called
Christian belief," pursued Father Waite."Madam Beaubien, on the other
hand, has represented the world that waits, as yet vainly, for
redemption.We have not been able to afford it her.Yet--pardon my
frankness in thus referring to you, Madam.It is only to benefit us
all--that the means of redemption _have_ been brought to her, we must
now admit."She started to speak, but Father
Waite raised a detaining hand."Miss Wall
represents the weariness of spirit and unrest abroad in the world
to-day, the spirit that finds life not worth the while; and Mr.Haynerd voices the cynical disbelief, the agnosticism, of that great
class who can not accept the childish tenets of our dogmatic systems
of theology, yet who have nothing but the philosophy of stoicism or
epicureanism to offer in substitute.""You have me correctly classified," he said."I'm a Yankee, and from Missouri.""And now, having placed us," said the Beaubien, "how will you classify
Carmen?"Father Waite looked at the girl reverently."Hers is the leaven," he
replied gently, "which has leavened the whole lump."My good friends," he went on earnestly, "like all priests and
preachers, I have been but a helpless spectator of humanity's
troubles.I have longed and prayed to know how to do the works which
Jesus is said to have done; yet, at the sick-bed or the couch of
death, what could I do--I, to whom the apostolic virtue is supposed to
have descended in the long line of succession?I could give promises of
remitted sins--though I knew I spoke not truth.I could comfort by
voicing the insipid views of our orthodox heaven.And yet I know that
what I gave was but mental nostrums, narcotics, to stupify until death
might end the suffering."And if you were a good orthodox priest," interposed Haynerd, "you
would refuse burial to dissenters, and bar from your communion table
all who were not of your faith, eh?""I would have to, were I consistent; for Catholicism is
the only true faith, founded upon the revealed word of God, you know."He smiled pathetically as he looked around at the little group."Now," he continued, "you, Mr.Haynerd, are a man of the world.You
are not in sympathy with the Church.You are an infidel, an
unbeliever.And therefore are you '_anathema_,' you know.""But you can not deny that at times you think very
seriously.And, I may go farther: you long, intensely, for something
that the world does not offer.Now, what is it but truth that you are
seeking?""I want to know," answered Haynerd quickly.I
am fond of exhibitions of sleight-of-hand and jugglery.But the
priestly thaumaturgy that claims to transform a biscuit into the
flesh of a man dead some two thousand years, and a bit of grape juice
into his blood, irritates me inexpressibly!And so does the
jugglery by which your Protestant fellows, Hitt, attempt to reconcile
their opposite beliefs.Why, what difference can it possibly make
to the Almighty whether we miserable little beings down here are
baptised with water, milk, or kerosene, or whether we are immersed,
sprinkled, or well soused?for nearly twenty centuries
you have been wandering among the non-essentials.Isn't it time to get
down to business, and instead of burning at the stake every one who
differs with you, try conscientiously to put into practice a few of
the simple moral precepts, such as the Golden Rule, and loving
one's neighbor as one's self?""There," commented Father Waite, "you have a bit of the world's
opinion of the Church!Can we say that the censure is not just?Would
not Christ himself to-day speak even more scathingly to those who
advocate a system of belief that puts blinders on men's minds, and
then leads them into the pit of ignorance and superstition?""Ye have taken away the key of knowledge," murmured Carmen; "ye
entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye
hindered."exclaimed Haynerd, looking at the girl who stood as a
living protest against all that hampers the expansion of the human
mind; that quenches its note of joy, and dulls its enlarging and ever
nobler concept of God."Now I want to know, first, if there is a God;
and, if so, what He is, and what His relation is to me.I want to know
what I am, and why I am here, and what future I may look forward to,
if any.I don't care two raps about a God who can't help me here on
earth, who can't set me right and make me happy--cure my ills, meet my
needs, and supply a few of the luxuries as well.And if there is a
God, and we can meet Him only by dying, then why in the name of common
sense all this hullabaloo about death?Why, in that case, death is the
grandest thing in life!But
you preacher fellows fight death tooth and nail.You're scared stiff
when you contemplate it.You make Christianity just a grand
preparation for death.Yet it isn't the gateway to life to you, and
you know it!Then why, if you are honest, do you tell such rubbish to
your trusting followers?""I would remind you," returned Hitt with a little laugh, "that I
don't, now.""Well, friends," interposed Father Waite, "it is to take up for
earnest consideration just such questions as Mr.Haynerd propounds,
that I have my suggestion to make, namely, that we meet together once
or twice a week, or as often as we may agree upon, to search for--"
his voice dropped to a whisper--"to search for God, and with this
young girl as our guide.For I believe she is very close to Him.The
world knows God only by hearsay.Carmen has _proved_ Him."Men ask why it is," he went on, "that God remains hidden from them;
why they can not understand Him.They forget that Jesus revealed God
as Love.And, if that is so, in order to know Him all mankind must
love their fellow-men.But they go right on hating one another,
cheating, abusing, robbing, slaying, persecuting, and still wondering
why they don't know God, regardless of the only possible way of ever
working out from the evils by which they are beset, if we believe that
Jesus told the truth, or was correctly reported."He paused and
reflected for a moment.Then:

"The ancient prophet said: 'Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye
shall search for me with all your hearts.'It is my proposal that we
bind ourselves together in such a search.To it we can bring diverse
talents.To our vast combined worldly experience, I bring knowledge of
the ancient Greek and Latin Fathers, together with Church history.Hitt brings his command of the Hebrew language and history, and an
intimate acquaintance with the ancient manuscripts, and Biblical
interpretation, together with a wide knowledge of the physical
sciences.Madam Beaubien, Miss Wall, and Mr.Haynerd contribute their
earnest, searching, inquisitive spirit, and a knowledge of the world's
needs.Moreover, we all come together without bias or prejudice.And
Carmen--she contributes that in which we have all been so woefully
lacking, and without which we can _never_ know God, the rarest,
deepest spirituality.Shall we
undertake the search, my friends?It means a study of her thought, and
the basis upon which it rests."The Beaubien raised her hand to her moist eyes.She was thinking of
that worldly coterie which formerly was wont to meet nightly in her
magnificent mansion to prey upon their fellows.Oh, how different the
spirit of this little gathering!"You will meet here, with me," she said in a broken voice.There were none there unacquainted with the sorrows of this penitent,
broken woman.Each rose in turn and clasped her hand.Carmen threw
her arms about her neck and kissed her repeatedly."You see," said the Beaubien, smiling up through her tears, "what this
child's religion is?Would the swinging of incense burners and the
mumbling of priestly formulae enhance it?""Jesus said, 'Having seen me ye have seen God,'" said Father Waite."And I say," replied the Beaubien, "that having seen this child, you
have indeed seen Him."CHAPTER 2


"I'm afraid," Haynerd was saying, as he and Father Waite were wending
their way to the Beaubien home a few evenings later, "that this Carmen
is the kind of girl you read about in sentimental novels; the kind who
are always just ready to step into heaven, but who count for little in
the warfare and struggle of actual mundane existence.She
isn't quite true to life, you know, as a book critic would say of an
impossible heroine.""You mistake, my friend," replied Father Waite warmly."She is the
very kind we would see oftener, were it not for the belief that years
bring wisdom, and so, as a consequence, the little child is crushed
beneath a load of false beliefs and human laws that make it reflect
its mortal parents, rather than its heavenly one.""But I'd like to see her under stress--"

"Under stress!You haven't the slightest conception
of the stress she's been under most of her life!But your criticism
unconsciously pays her the highest tribute, for her kind never show by
word, deed, or look what they are enduring.That frail-appearing girl
has stood up under loads that would have flattened you and me out like
gold leaf!"She's so far and away ahead
of mortals like you and me that she doesn't admit the reality and
power of evil--and, believe me, she's got her reasons for not
admitting it, too!Only try humbly to
attain a little of her understanding and faith; and try to avoid
making yourself ridiculous by criticising what you do not comprehend.That, indeed, has been mankind's age-long blunder--and they have
thereby made asses of themselves!"Edward Haynerd, or "Ned," as he was invariably known, prided himself
on being something of a philosopher.And in the name of philosophy he
chose to be quixotic.That one who hated the dissimulations and shams
of our class aristocracy so cordially should have earned his
livelihood--and a good one, too--as publisher of the Social Era, a
sprightly weekly chronicle of happenings in fashionable society, would
have appeared anomalous in any but a man gifted in the Greek
sophistries and their modern innumerable and arid offshoots.Haynerd
was a laughing Democritus, an easy-going, even-tempered fellow, doomed
to be loved, and by the same graces thoroughly cheated by the world in
general.He had in his rapid career of some thirty-five years dipped
deeply into things mundane, and had come to the surface, sputtering
and blowing, with his face well smeared with mud from the shallow
depths.Whereupon he remarked that such an existence was a poor way of
serving the Lord, and turned cynic.It
was likewise his capital and stock-in-trade.By it he won a place for
himself in the newspaper world, and later, as a credit asset, had
employed it successfully in negotiating for the Social Era.It taking
over the publication of this sheet he had remarked that life was
altogether too short to permit of attempting anything worth while; and
so he forthwith made no further assaults upon fame--assuming that he
had ever done so--but settled comfortably down to the enjoyment of his
sinecure.And as justification for his
self-imposed celibacy he pompously quoted Kant: "I am a bachelor, and
I could not cease to be a bachelor without a disturbance that would be
intolerable to me."He simply shirked
responsibility and ease-threatening risk."You see," he remarked, explaining himself later to Carmen, "I'm a
pseudo-litterateur--I conduct a 'Who's It?'for the quidnunces of this
blase old burg.And I really meet a need by furnishing an easy method
of suicide, for my little vanity sheet is a sort of social mirror,
that all who look therein may die of laughter.By the way, I had to
run those base squibs about you; but, by George!I'm going to make a
retraction in next Saturday's issue.I'll put a crimp in friend Ames
that'll make him squeal.I'll say he has ten wives, and eight of 'em
Zulus, at that!""We have enough to meet, without
going out of our way to stir up more.Let it all work out now, as it
will, in the right way."Say, don't you
think that in formulating a new religion you're carrying coals to
Newcastle?Seems to me we've got enough now, if we'd practice 'em."Haynerd, is only the practice of the teachings of a
Nazarene Jew, named Jesus," she replied gently."Well, my religion is Socialism, I guess," he said lightly.So we
meet on common ground, don't we?"She held out her hand, and he took
it, a puzzled expression coming into his face."Well," he said, glancing about, "we'll have to dispute that later.I
see Father Waite is about to open this little religious seminar.But
we'll get back to the discussion of myself," he added, his eyes
twinkling."For, like Thoreau, I prefer to discuss that subject,
because there's no other about which I know so much.""Nor so little," she added, laughing and squeezing his hand as she
turned from him.The little coterie took their places around the dining room table,
which was well strewn with books of reference and writing materials.A deep, reverent silence fell
upon the group."Friends," began Father Waite slowly, "we are inaugurating to-night a
mission of the most profound significance.No question so vitally
touches the human race as the one which we shall reverently discuss in
this and subsequent meetings.I thought as I came in here to-night of
the wisdom of Epictitus, who said, 'What do I want?To acquaint myself
with the true order of things and comply with it.'I am sure no
statement so fully expresses our common desire as that.""If Adam was a Baptist, I want to know
and comply with the fact."Then Father Waite held up a hand and again
became serious."Can we treat lightly even the Adam story, when we consider how much
misery and rancor its literal acceptance has caused among mankind?Out of deepest sympathy for a world in search of truth, let us pity
their stumblings, and take heed that we fall not ourselves."Carmen's hand stole toward the
Beaubien's and clasped it tightly."In these days, as of old, it is still said, 'There is no God!'And
yet, though the ignorant and wilful admit it not, mankind's very
existence is a function of their concept of a Creator, a sole
cause of all that is.No question, economic, social, political, or
other, is so vitally related to humanity as this: 'Is there a God?'And the corollary: 'What is His relation to me?'For there can be
nothing so important as a knowledge of truth.Can the existence
of a God be demonstrated?Can He be shown to be beneficent, in
view of the world's testimony?If the
Bible, then can its authenticity be established?The greatest of
our so-called civilizations are known as Christian.But who can say
by them what Christianity really is?""I am quite prepared to say what it is not!""Doubtless," resumed Father Waite.But at present
we are seeking constructive criticism, not solely destructive.There
has been quite enough of that sort in the world.But, to go a step
further, can we say positively that the truth is to be found even in
Christianity?""Please explain your question," said Miss Wall, with a puzzled look."The first essential is always facts," he continued."The deduction of
right conclusions will follow--provided, as Matthew Arnold so tersely
said, we have sufficient delicacy of perception, subtlety, wisdom, and
tact.And, I may add, sufficient freedom from prejudice and mental
bias--ah, there is the stumbling block!""Matthew Arnold," ventured Haynerd, "was dubbed a first-class infidel,
as I recall it."As have been many of the world's most earnest searchers.Yet he enunciated much truth, which we to-day are acknowledging.But,
to resume, since Christianity as we know it is based upon the
personality of a man, Jesus, we ask: Can the historicity of Jesus be
established?"queried Miss Wall in greater
surprise than before.And if so, is he correctly reported in what we call the Gospels?Then, did he reveal the truth to his followers?And, lastly, has that
truth been correctly transmitted to us?""And," added Hitt, "there is still the question: Assuming that he gave
us the truth, can we apply it successfully to the meeting of our daily
needs?""The point is well taken," replied Father Waite."For, though I may
know that there are very abstruse mathematical principles, yet I may
be utterly unable to demonstrate or use them.But now," he went on,
"we are brought to other vital questions concerning us.They are, I
think, points to which the theologian has given but scant thought.If
we conclude that there is a God, we are confronted with the material
universe and man.And what are their natures and
import?""Seems to me you've cut out a large
assignment for this little party.Those are questions that the world
has played football with for thousands of years.Do you think we can
settle them in a few evenings' study?We can't spare you," laughed Father Waite.Then he glanced at
Carmen, who had sat quiet, apparently unhearing, during the remarks."I think you will hear things soon that will set you thinking," he
said."But now we are going to let our traveled friend, Mr.Hitt,
give us just a word in summation of his thought regarding the
modern world and its attitude toward the questions which we have been
propounding."The explorer leaned back in his chair and assumed his customary
attitude when in deep thought.All eyes turned upon him in eager
expectation."The world," he began reflectively, "presents to me to-day the most
interesting aspect it has assumed since history began.True, the age
is one of great mental confusion.Quite as true, startling discoveries
and astounding inventions have so upset our staid old mediaeval views
that the world is hurriedly crowding them out, together with its God.Doctrines for which our fathers bled and burned are to-day lightly
tossed upon the ash heap.The searchlight is turned never so
mercilessly upon the founder of the Christian religion, and upon the
manuscripts which relate his words and deeds.Yet most of us have
grown so busy--I often wonder with what--that we have no time for that
which can not be grasped as we run.We work desperately by day,
building up the grandest material fabric the world has ever seen; and
at night we repair the machine for the next day's run.Even our
college professors bewail the lack of time for solid reading and
research.And if our young pursue studies, it is with the almost
exclusive thought of education as a means of earning a material
livelihood later, and, if possible, rearing a mansion and stocking its
larder and garage.It is, I repeat, a grandly materialistic age,
wherein, to the casual observer, spirituality is at a very low ebb."He thrust his long legs under the table and cast his eyes upward to
the ceiling as he resumed:

"The modern world is still in its spiritual infancy, and does not
often speak the name of God.Not that we are so much irreverent as
that we feel no special need of Him in our daily pursuits.Since we
ceased to tremble at the thunders of Sinai, and their lingering echoes
in bulls and heresy condemnations, we find that we get along just as
well--indeed, much better.And it really is quite bad form now to
speak continually of God, or to refer to Him as anything real and
vital.To be on such terms of intimacy with Him as this girl Carmen
is--in thought, at least--would be regarded to-day as evidence of
sentimentalism and weakness."He paused again, to marshal his thought and give his auditors an
opportunity for comment.Then, as the silence remained unbroken, he
continued:

"Viewing the world from one standpoint, it has achieved remarkable
success in applying the knout to superstition and limitation.But,
like a too energetic housekeeper, it has swept out much that is
essential with the _debris_.When spirituality ceases to be real or
vital to a people, then a grave danger threatens them.Materiality has
never proved a blessing, as history shows.Life that is made up of
strain and ceaseless worry is not life.The incessant accumulation of
material wealth, when we do not know how really to enjoy it, is folly.To pamper the flesh, to the complete ignoring of the spirit, is
suicide.The increased hankering after physical excitements and animal
pleasures, to the utter abandonment of the search for that which is
real and satisfying, is an exhibition of gross, mesmeric stupidity, to
say the least.It shows that our sense of life is awry.""But the world is surely attempting its own betterment," protested
Haynerd."I grant you that," replied Hitt."But legislation and coercion are
the wrong means to employ."Oh, well, you are not going to change the race until the individual
himself changes.""Quite the contrary, that is the
pith of my observations.And no sane
man will maintain that general reform can ever come until the
individual's needs are met--his daily, hourly, worldly needs.""I think I get your point," said Father Waite."It is wholly a
question of man's concept of the cause of things, himself included,
and their purpose and end, is it not?""The restless spirit of the modern world is
hourly voicing its discontent with a faltering faith which has no
other basis than blind belief.It wants demonstrable fact upon which
to build.In plain words, _mankind would be better if they but knew
how_!""Well, we show them how," asserted Haynerd."But they don't do as we
tell 'em.""Are you quite sure that you show them how?""What do you
ever do toward showing them how permanently to eradicate a single
human difficulty?""Oh, well, putting it that way, nothing, of course."And so
the world continues to wait for surcease from woe in a life beyond the
grave.But now, returning to our survey, let me say that amid all the
folly of vain pursuits, of wars and strife, of doleful living and
pitiable dying, there are more encouraging and hopeful signs hung out
to the inquiring thought to-day than ever before in history.If I
misread not, we are already entered upon changes so tremendous that
their end must be the revolutionizing of thought and conduct, and
hence of life.Our present age is one of great extremes: though we
touch the depths, we are aiming likewise at the heights.I doubt if
there ever was a time when so many sensed the nothingness of the
pleasures of the flesh.I doubt if ever there was such a quickening of
the business conscience, and such a determined desire to introduce
honesty and purity into our dealings with one another.Never was the
need of religion more keenly felt by the world than it is to-day; and
that is why mankind are willing to accept any religious belief,
however eccentric, that comes in the guise of truth and bearing the
promise of surcease from sin, sickness, and sorrow here this side of
the grave.The world was never so hungry for religious truth; and this
fact is a perpetual challenge to the Church.There is a tremendous
world-yearning to know and to do better.I
answer, a growing appreciation of the idea that 'the kingdom of
harmony is within you.'""Jesus said that," murmured Carmen, looking up."He but amplified and gave form to the great fact that there was
an influence for better things always existent in the ancient Jews,
that'something not ourselves,' if you will, 'that makes for
righteousness.'And he showed that that influence could be outwardly
externalized in freedom from the ills which beset humanity.""Very good," put in Haynerd."That'something not ourselves' is the germ of the true idea of God,"
answered Hitt."The terms are synonymous," said Hitt."And now let me conclude with a
final observation.Mankind's beliefs are in a whirl.Orthodoxy and conservatism are hanging desperately to the
world's flying skirts, but they will eventually drop off.No change in
thought has been greater than that concerning God.The absentee Lord
who started the universe and then withdrew has gone to the scrap heap,
with the ridiculous views of predestination and infant damnation.The
idea of a God who at divers times interfered with His creation and
temporarily set aside His own laws to convince puny man of His
greatness, is likewise obsolescent.The world is slowly growing into a
conception of a creator, of some kind, but at least mental, and
universally present.Nay, more, available for all our problems and
needs.And the end will be the adoption of that conception, enlarged
and purified still further, and taken into the minutest affairs of our
daily life--as this girl has done.The day of patient suffering in
this world, under the spell of a promise of compensating reward in the
heavenly future, has all but passed.We are gradually becoming
conscious of the stupendous fact that the kingdom of all harmony,
immortality, and good, is _right here within us_--and therefore can be
naught but a consciousness of absolute good, perfectly attainable by
humanity as the 'old man' of Paul is laid off, but not gained,
necessarily, through what we call death."The silence which followed was broken at length by Miss Wall."And
what constitutes the 'old man'?""Largely, I think," said Hitt, "the belief that matter is real."exclaimed Haynerd, almost rising from his chair."I stand on my statement," he replied.Father Waite rose slowly, as if lost in thought."History shows," he
said, meditatively, "that man's progress has been proportionate to his
freedom from the limitation of ignorance and undemonstrable belief.And that freedom has come as man's concept of God has grown less and
less material, and more and more spiritual.From the animal nature of
the savage, to whom all is matter, down--or up--to the man of to-day,
to whom mind is assuming ever greater ascendency, man's progress has
been marked by a throwing off of limiting beliefs, theological or
other, in material power and substance.The development of the least
material forces, steam, electricity, the X-ray, has come only as the
human mind has thrown off a portion of its hampering material beliefs.I am astounded when I think of it, and of its marvelous message to
future generations!For, from the premise that the creator of all
things is spirit, or mind, as you will, comes the corollary that the
creation itself must of necessity be _mental_.And from this come such
deductions as fairly make me tremble.Carmen has told me of the
deductions which her tutor, the priest Jose, drew from the single
premise that the universe is infinite in extent--a premise which I
think we all will accept.""There can be no question about it," said Hitt, nodding his head."Well," continued Father Waite, "that granted, we must likewise grant
its creator to be infinite, must we not?""And that puts the creator out of the matter-class entirely.The
creator must be--"

"Mind," said Carmen, supplying the thought ever-present with her."I see no other conclusion," said Father Waite."But, that granted, a
flood of deductions pours in that sends human beliefs and reasoning
helter-skelter.For an infinite mind would eventually disintegrate if
it were not perfect in every part.""Perhaps it is already disintegrating, and that's what causes the evil
in the world," hazarded Haynerd."Utterly untenable, my friend," put in Hitt."For, granted an infinite
mind, we must grant the concomitant fact that such a mind is of very
necessity omnipotent, as well as perfect.What, then, could ever cause
disintegration in it?""You are right," resumed Father Waite."And such a mind, of very
necessity perfect, omnipotent, and, of course, ever-present, must
likewise be eternal.For there would be nothing to contest its
existence.Age, decay, and death would be unknown to it."And that," said Carmen, rising, "is my God."Father Waite nodded significantly to the others, and sat down, leaving
the girl facing them, her luminous eyes looking off into unfathomed
distances, and her face aglow with spiritual light."My God is infinite Good, to whom evil is unknown," she said."And
good includes all that is real.It includes wisdom, intelligence,
truth, life, and love--none of them material.Oh, not
by human reasoning, whereby you seek to establish the fact of His
existence, but by proof, daily proof, and in the hours when the floods
of suppositional evil have swept over me.You would rest your faith on
your deductions.But, as Saint Gregory said, no merit lies in faith
where human reason supplies the proof; and that you will all some day
know.And He ceaselessly expresses Himself in and
through His ideas, which He is constantly revealing.And these ideas express that goodness and
infinitude, from the tiniest up to the idea of God himself.And that
grandest idea is--man.Oh, no, not the men and women you think you see
about you in your daily walk.But the man that Jesus always saw back of every human concept.That
man is God's own idea of Himself.That is the man we shall all put on when we have
obeyed Paul and put off the old man, its counterfeit.""Then, Carmen," said Father Waite, "you believe all things to be
mental?""Yes, everything--man himself--and matter.""But, if God is mind, and infinite, He must include all things.Hence
He must include this imperfect representation, called the physical
man."Did not Jesus speak often of
the one lie about his Father, God?The material man and the material
universe are but parts of that lie.And a lie is always a supposition;
not real.All evil is contained in that supposition--a supposition
that there is power and life and substance apart from God.""A supposition is not made," replied Carmen quietly."I don't quite get that," interposed Miss Wall, her brows knitting.Carmen smiled down at the inquiring woman."The
creator of all things is mind.But you would have that
mind the creator of evil, also.Yet, your own reasoning has shown
that, on the premise of mind as infinite, such mind must be forever
whole, harmonious, perfect.The thoughts and ideas by which that mind
expresses itself must be likewise pure and perfect.Then that creative
mind can not create evil.For, a mind that creates evil must itself be
evil.And, being infinite, such a mind must include the evil it
creates.We would have, then, either a mind wholly evil, or one of
mixed evil and good.In either case, that mind must then destroy
itself."Your reasoning is, certainly," admitted Miss Wall."But, how to
account for evil, when God is infinite good--"

"To account for it at all," replied Carmen, "would be to make it
something real.Jesus would account for it only by classing it as a
lie about God.Now God, as the creative mind, must likewise be truth,
since He is perfection and harmony.Very well, a lie is always the
opposite of truth."Yes," said Father Waite, nodding his head as certain bright memories
returned to him."That is what you told me that day when I first
talked with you."Is it strange that God should have a suppositional opposite?""Has not everything with which you are concerned a
suppositional opposite?His suppositional opposite is
the great lie of evil.And matter is just as
mental as the thoughts which you are now holding.And so, evil and the lie are unreal.""The distinction seems to me theoretical," protested Miss Wall."That word'real,'" he said, "is perhaps
what is causing your confusion.The real is that which, according to
Spencer, does not pass away.We used to believe matter indestructible,
forever permanent.We learn that our views regarding it were very
incorrect."And yet," said Father Waite, "in this universe of constant change,
_something_ endures.What is it but the mind that is God, expressing
itself in such immaterial and permanent things as law, love, life,
power?""But now we have been brought back again to
the question of matter.If we can prove that matter is mental, and not
real substance, we will have established Carmen's premise that
everything is mental.Then there remains but the distinction between
the mind that is God, and its suppositional opposite, as expressed in
human existence.Let us conclude, therefore, that to-night we have
established, at least as a working hypothesis, that, since a thing
existing implies a creator; and since the existent universe, being
infinite, demands an infinite creator; and since a creator can not be
infinite without being at once mind, perfect, eternal, omnipotent,
omniactive, and good, we are fully justified in assuming that the
creator of all things still exists, and is infinite, ever-present
mind.Further than that we are not prepared to go, until we have
discussed the questions of matter and the physical universe and man.Let us leave those topics for a subsequent meeting.And now I suggest
that we unite in asking Carmen to sing for us, to crown the unity that
has marked this discussion with the harmony of her own beautiful
voice."A few moments later, about the small upright piano which the Beaubien
had rented for Carmen, the little group sat in reverent silence, while
the young girl sent out through the little room the harmonious
expression of her own inner life, the life that had never left heaven
for earth.CHAPTER 3


With her exit from the _beau monde_ and her entrance upon the broad
stage of University life, Carmen seemed to have awakened from the
lethargy which her abrupt transition from mediaeval Simiti into the
modern world had occasioned.The static struggle to hold her own
against the rushing currents of materialism had turned at length in
her favor.The lethal influences which
rose about her like stupifying fumes in the courts of fashion had been
lifted and swept away by the fresher and more invigorating breezes
into which her bark had now been drawn.She plunged into her new work joyously; yet not without a deeper
comprehension of its meaning than that of her fellow-students.She
knew that the University was but another stepping-stone, even as her
social life had been; another series of calls and opportunities to
"prove" her God to be immanent good.For she was keenly alive to the materialistic leadings of
the "higher education," and she would stand as a living protest
against them.It had not taken her long to discover the impotence lying at the heart
of so-called modern education.She had not been slow to mark the
disappointment written upon the faces of many of her fellow-students,
who had sought in vain a great awakening light in those sacred
precincts of learning, but, their confidence betrayed, were now
floundering in the devouring morass of materialism.To her keen
insight the University stood revealed as the great panderer to this
latest century's obsessing idea that the true function of education is
expressed in the imparting of changing, human information and a
training for the business of earning one's daily bread according to
the infamous code of the world's carnal social system.The University
did not meet the most urgent need of the race by equipping men to
stand against the great crises of human experience.It did not teach
men to lay aside the counterfeit man of material sense; but rather
emphasized the world's belief in the reality of this man by minutely
detailed courses in his mundane history and the manifestations of his
pitiable ignorance in his wanton crimes and watery ambitions.To
Carmen, God was the most insistent fact of creation.And mankind's
existence could find its only justification in ceaseless, consecrated
manifestation of His harmonious activity.True, the University vaguely
recognized God as infinitely competent.But in the same breath it
confessed its utter ignorance of a demonstrable knowledge of Him, to
know whom alone is life.But their hollow prayers bore no hope, for they knew not how to gain
answers to them.And yet the girl remained in her new environment, awaiting the call to
"come up higher."And meantime she strove to gain daily a wider
knowledge of the Christ-principle, and its application to the needs
and problems of her fellow-men.Her business was the reflection of her
Father's business.The weak, transient,
flighty, so-called intellectual life which she saw about her sent no
call across the calm currents of her thought.Her education was
religious in the strictest, deepest sense, for she was learning to
know God.Though the girl pursued her way quietly, unwilling that the notoriety
which had been fastened upon her should mark her as an object of
curiosity, yet her story soon spread among University circles, and the
first semester was a scant two weeks old before her name had been
debated in the numerous Sororities and Women's Clubs, and quietly
dropped.<DW64> blood coursed in her veins; and the stigma of parental
disgrace lay dark upon her.She lived with a woman of blackened
reputation--a reputation which waxed no brighter under the casual,
malicious comments of J. Wilton Ames, whose great financial strength
had made him a Trustee of this institution of learning.If Carmen
divined the comment that was passed concerning herself, she gave no
indication.But Hitt and Father Waite knew that the girl had not found
favor in the social and fraternal organizations of her mates; and they
knew why.mused Hitt, when he could no longer
restrain himself.Then he called a student to his desk one day, at the
conclusion of his lecture."Miss West," he said, "you are leader in the most prominent Sorority
in the University.I want you to give Miss Carmen Ariza a bid."the girl asked, as she arched her brows.But--well, what if she were a negress?Hers is the
most brilliant mind in the entire student-body!"Race segregation is a divine tenet, scripturally justified.What though the girl's skin vied with the lilies and rosebuds?What
though her hair was the brown of ripe fields?Had not God Almighty
decreed that the <DW64> should remain a drawer of water?Had the Lord designed him the equal of the noble white, He would
have bleached his face, and bridged his flat nose.And the reference to her dark-skinned sisters caused a
little _moue_ of disgust, as she flatly declined to consider Carmen an
eligible candidate for membership in her Society.ejaculated Hitt, who had been brooding over the incident
as he walked home with Father Waite."That toadying, sycophantic,
wealth-worshiping Miss West can see no farther than the epidermis!If
we could have maintained Carmen's reputation as an Inca princess, this
same girl would have fawned at her feet, and begged to kiss the edge
of her robe!And she would have used every art of cajolery to
ingratiate herself into Carmen's favor, to catch the social crumbs
that our girl might chance to drop!""There, there, Hitt," soothed Father Waite."Have you any idea that
Carmen is at all injured by Miss West's supercilious conduct?"You're forgetting the girl's influence, aren't
you?"Hitt gulped his wrath down his long throat."Waite," he blurted, "that
girl's an angel!"She's so real that we don't
understand her--so real that she has been totally misunderstood by the
petty minds that have sought to crush her here in New York, that's
all.""But certainly she is unique--"

"Ah, yes; unique in that she goes about putting her arms around people
and telling them that she loves them.And she is unique in that her purity and goodness hang about her like
an exquisite aura, and make people instinctively turn and look after
her as she passes.Unique in that in her sweet presence one seems to
hear a strain of heavenly music vibrating on the air.So unique that
the dawn, the nesting birds, the wild flowers, the daily sunset,
fairly intoxicate her with ecstasy and make her life a lyric."Hitt essayed to reply; but the words hung in his throat."Yes," continued Father Waite, "she is so unique that when the
empty-headed, vain young Duke of Altern, learning that she had been
thrown out of society because of the base rumor regarding her
parentage, sent her a written statement to the effect that there was
no engagement between them, and demanded that she sign it, she did
so, with a happy smile, with an invocation, with a prayer for blessing
upon those who had tried to ruin her."Hawley-Crowles and Ames and Lafelle
filched La Libertad from her, she would have given them the clothes on
her back with it, if they had demanded them.Yes, she's unique--so
unique that again and again I hear her murmur, as she looks off
absently into space: 'If it is right that he should have a son, then I
want it to be so.'""Referring to--that priest--Jose de Rincon?"And time and again I have heard her say: 'God is
light.Old
Rosendo's grandson, you know.""Waite," he said earnestly, "she is simply illustrating
what would happen to any of us if we threw ourselves wholly upon
God's protecting care, and took our thoughts only from Him.That's
why she can lose her home, her family, her reputation, that
mine--everything--and still stand._She does what we don't dare to
do!_"

"She is a living illustration," replied Father Waite, "of the mighty
fact that there is nothing so practical as _real_ Christianity.I want
you to tell Professor Cane that.He calls her 'the girl with the
Utopian views,' because of her ingenuous replies in his sociological
class.But I want you to show him that she is very far from being
impractical.""I'll do it," said Hitt emphatically."I'll prove to Cane that her
religion is not a visionary scheme for regulating a world inhabited
only by perfect beings, but is a working principle for the every-day
sinner to use in the solution of his daily problems.Moreover, Waite,
she is a vivid illustration of the fact that when the individual
improves, the nation does likewise."I not only get you, but I stand as a proof of your statement,"
returned Father Waite gently.Carmen, her thoughts above, though her feet trod the earth, came and
went, glad and happy.The change in her mode of living from the
supreme luxury of the Hawley-Crowles mansion to the common comforts of
the home where now she dwelt so simply with the Beaubien, seemed not
to have caused even a ripple in the full current of her joy.Her life
was a symphony of thanksgiving; an antiphony, in which all Nature
voiced its responses to her in a diapason, full, rich, and harmonious.Often that autumn she might have been seen standing among the tinted
leaves on the college campus, and drinking in their silent message.And then she might have been heard to exclaim, as she turned her rapt
gaze beyond the venerable, vine-clad buildings: "Oh, I feel as if I
just couldn't stand it, all this wealth of beauty, of love, of
boundless good!"For her dark
story had reared a hedge about her; the taboo rested upon her; and
even in the crowded classrooms the schoolmates of her own sex looked
askance and drew their skirts about them.But if the students avoided her, the faculty did not.And those like
Professor Cane, who had the opportunity and the ability to peer into
the depths of the girl's soul, took an immediate and increasing
interest in her.Often her own naive manners broke down the bars of
convention, and brought her enduring friendships among the men of
learning.This was especially the case with Doctor Morton, Dean of the
School of Surgery.Yielding to a harmless impulse of curiosity, the
girl one afternoon had set out on a trip of exploration, and had
chosen the Anatomy building to begin with.Many odd sights greeted her
eager gaze as she peered into classrooms and exhibit cases; but she
met with no one until she chanced to open the door of Doctor Morton's
private laboratory, and found that eminent man bending over a human
brain, which he was dissecting.The doctor looked up, surprise
written large upon his features as he noted his fair caller.queried the girl, twisting around and
looking at the name on the door to make certain."Yes," replied the genial doctor, with growing interest.He was a
gray-haired, elderly man, slightly inclined to embonpoint, and with
keen, twinkling eyes."Yes, indeed," returned the girl; "I'd love to."Most everybody seems to have heard of me," sighed the girl."Well, it
doesn't make any difference about my coming in here, does it?"She
looked up at him so wistfully that he felt a great tug at his
heartstrings."You're as welcome as the April
sun.""Now tell me," she said eagerly,
looking about."That," said he, taking up the pulpy gray object, "is the brain of my
erstwhile friend and collaborator, Doctor Bolton.murmured Carmen, a facetious twinkle coming into
her eyes as she looked at it."In the interests of science," returned the man, studying her."That
we may increase our knowledge of this marvelous mechanism of thought,
and the laws by which it operates in mental processes.""Then you still blindly seek the living among the dead, don't you?""You think that this poor thing held life, and you
search now among its ashes for the living principle.But, God is life;
and 'Canst thou by searching find out God?'"The man regarded her intently without replying.She bent for a while
over the half-dissected brain in deep thought."Doctor," she said, "life is not structural.God is life; and to know
Him is to reflect life.Doctor, don't
you think it is about time to do away with this business of dying?"The man of science started visibly, and his eyes opened wider.The
abrupt question quite swept him off his feet."You didn't really expect to find anything in this brain, did you?""Why, mostly water, with a few commonplace salts," he answered,
wondering what the next question would be."And can a compound of water and a few commonplace salts _think_?"she
asked, looking intently at him."N--no," he answered tentatively."The brain is not the cause of thought, then, but an effect, is it
not?""Why, really, my dear Miss Carmen, we don't know.We call it the organ
of thought, because in some way thought seems to be associated with
it, rather than with--well, with the liver, or muscles, for example.And we learn that certain classes of mental disturbances are
intimately associated with lesions or clots in the brain.Then:

"Doctor, you wouldn't cut up a machine to discover the motive power,
would you?But that is just what you are doing there with that brain.You are hoping by dissecting it to find the power that made it go,
aren't you?And the power that made it go was mind--life.""But the life is not in the brain now," hazarded the doctor."You see," she went on, "if
the brain was ever alive, it could never cease to be so.If it ever
lived, it could never die.It
manifested only a false sense of life.Who
or what says that the man who owned that brain is dead?Why, the human
mind--human belief.It is the human mind, expressing its belief in
death, and in a real opposite to life, or God.She returned his look
with a confident smile."You believe in evolution, don't you?""Oh, surely," he replied unhesitatingly."Well, then, in the process of evolution, which was evolved first, the
brain, or the mind which operates it and through it?""Why," he replied meditatively, "it is quite likely that they evolved
simultaneously, the brain being the mind's organ of expression.""But don't you see, Doctor, that you are now making the mind really
come first?For that which expresses a thing is always secondary to
the thing expressed.""At any rate, it is quite immaterial to a
practical knowledge of how to meet the brain's ills.I am a practical
man, you know.""I'm sorry to hear that," she said simply."Practical men are so
stupid and ignorant."he exclaimed, putting his hands on his hips and
staring down at the smiling face."And you are so nice and friendly, I wouldn't want to think you stupid
and ignorant," she went on blandly.Well, that kind o' takes the edge off your former classification
of me," he said, greatly amused, yet wondering just what appraisal to
place upon this frank girl."And evolution," she continued, "is an unfolding, isn't it?You see,
the great fact of creation is the creator, infinite mind.Well, that
mind expresses itself in its ideas.And these it is unfolding all the
time.Now a fact always gives rise to a suppositional opposite.The
opposite of a fact is an error.And that is why error has been called
'negative truth.'Of course, there isn't any such thing as negative
truth!And so all error is simply falsity, supposition, without real
existence."Now, the human, or
carnal, mind is the negative truth of the real mind, God.It is
infinite mind's suppositional opposite.And it imitates the
infinite mind, but in a very stupid, blundering way.And so the whole
physical universe manifests evolution, too--an unfolding, or
revealing, of material types, or mental concepts.And all these
manifest the human mind's sense of life, and its equally strong
sense of death.The universe, animals, men, are all human types,
evolved, or unfolded, or revealed, in the human mind.And all are
the human mind's interpretations of infinite mind's real and eternal
and perfect ideas."You know," she laughed, "speaking of 'negative truth', the first
chapter of Genesis sets forth positive truth, and the second chapter
sets forth its opposite, negative truth.But
there it is for everybody to read.And the human mind, of course, true
to its beliefs, clings to the second chapter as the reality.Meantime, Carmen's attention had been attracted to a large microscope
that stood on the table near her.Going to it, she peeped curiously
down into the tube.Well," she suddenly asked, "have
you got the fear germ here?"But when the girl looked up, her face was quite
serious."You do not know it, Doctor, for you are a practical man, but you
haven't anything but fear germs under this glass," she said in a low
voice."Why, those are germs of typhoid and tuberculosis!""And manifestations, externalizations, of the fear germ itself, which
is mental," she added."These things don't cause disease," she went
on, pointing to the slide.Do you scientists know why people die, Doctor?""We really do not know why people die.""Then I'll tell you," she said."_It's because they don't know enough
to live._ This poor Doctor Bolton died because he didn't know that God
was life.He committed sickness, and then paid the penalty, death.He
sinned by believing that there were other powers than God, by
believing that life and thought were in matter.And so he paid the
wages of sin, death.He simply missed the mark, that's all.""You haven't asked me
to sit down," she commented brightly."But, if you don't mind, I
will."the doctor exclaimed, coloring, and hastily
setting out a chair."I really was so interested in what you were
saying that I forgot my manners.""No," she said, shaking her head as she declined the proffered chair,
"I'll sit here, so's I can look straight into your eyes.You go ahead
and cut up poor Yorick, and I'll talk.""You are much more interesting," he
returned, "than poor Bolton, dead or alive.In fact, he really was
quite a bore.But you are like a sparkling mountain rill, even if you
do give me a severe classification.""Well," she replied, "then you are honestly more interested in life
than in death, are you?"Death is _such_ a mistake; and I haven't a bit of use
for it," she continued."It's like making mistakes in music, or
mathematics.Now when we make mistakes in those, we never stop to
discuss them.The world has nearly
talked its poor old head off about the mistakes of sickness and death.It never seems to occur to the world that Jesus always associated
sickness with sin.You know, the Rabbis of his day seem to have hit
upon a great truth, although they didn't make it really practical.They maintained that a sick man could not be healed of his diseases
until all his sins had been forgiven.And so they attempted to forgive
sins and make men clean by their elaborate ceremonies.And nobody got to the root of the difficulty until
Jesus came.And that cured
the disease that was the manifestation of sin.Now I ask, why do you,
nearly two thousand years after his time, still do as the old Rabbis
did, and continue to treat the body--the effect--instead of the mental
cause?But," looking down in meditation, "I suppose if you did that
the people would cry, 'He hath a devil!'They thought I was a witch in
Simiti.""Then you do not believe that disease is
caused by microbes, I take it?"It is a
manifestation of the human mind again.And, as with typhoid fever,
diphtheria, and other diseases, the human mind applies its own
cherished, ignorant beliefs in certain methods, and then renders
innocuous its own manifestations, microbes.The human mind makes its
own diseases, and then in some cases removes the disease, but still by
human, material methods.At last it
yields itself to its false beliefs, and then goes out in what it calls
death.It is all a mental process--all human thought and its various
manifestations.Now why not get beyond microbes and reach the cause,
even of them, the human mind itself?Why do not you men of science do likewise?"Doctor Morton himself took the chair which he had set out for the
girl."What you say," he replied slowly, "is not new to me.But I can
only answer that the world is not ready yet for the great change which
you suggest."What mesmerism you are laboring
under!"Well, then, would he be accepted to-day, if he had not come before?""And I quite agree with you," she said firmly."Now the world has
doctored for more than four thousand years, despite the fact that
health is not sold in bottle or pill form.Doctor, what does the
history of all these centuries of drugging show you?"Carmen waited a moment; then continued:

"Don't they demonstrate the absolute inability of medicines to cure
disease?""Any more than putting men in prison cures
crime?""They at least prove that medication has not _permanently_ removed
disease," he ventured, not wishing to go too far."Doctor," she said earnestly, "that man Jesus, who, according to you,
came too soon, said: 'Without me ye can do nothing.'Well, didn't he
come very, very close to the truth when he made that statement?He did
not say that without drugs or material remedies we could do nothing,
but that without the Christ-principle mankind would continue, as
before, to miss the mark.He showed that disease and discord result
from sin.Sin is lack of righteousness, lack of right-thinking about
things.Its effect,
disease, is mental--a state of discordant consciousness.Can you with
drugs change a state of mind?""Whiskey and opium cause changes in
one's state of mind.""But the human belief of power inherent in whiskey
and opium, or of the human body's reaction to them, causes a change in
the human thought-activity that is called consciousness.The state of
human consciousness changes with the belief, but not the real state of
mind.And Doctor Bolton--"

"Bolton was not sick.He died of natural causes, old age, and general
breakdown," was the doctor's refuge.Carmen laughed and sprang down from the table."What an obstinately
obdurate lot you scientific men are!""Don't you know
that you doctors are only a development of the old'medicine-man'?Bolton isn't dead; and, in the second, there
are no _natural_ causes of death.Why, that's gone out of
fashion, long since.""Then," with a note of banter in his voice, "I take it that you do not
expect to die.""I expect good, nothing but
good, ever!Don't you know that physiologists themselves admit that
the human body is composed of eighty-five per cent water and fifteen
per cent ordinary salts?Can such a combination have intelligence and
sensation?Do you still believe that life is dependent upon lungs,
stomach, or liver?Why, the so-called 'unit cell' breathes, digests,
and manifests life-functions, and yet it has no lungs, no mouth, no
stomach, no organs.It is the human mind, assuming knowledge and power
which it does _not_ possess, that says the sense of life shall depend
upon such organs in the one case and not in the other.And the human
mind could be utterly refuted if men would only learn to use the
Christ-principle.Jesus and Paul used it, and proved material laws to
be only false beliefs.""Well," he replied meditatively, "if you are correct, then the
preachers are way off the track.And I have long since come to the
conclusion that--Well," changing abruptly back to the previous topic,
"so you refute the microbe theory, eh?""I said I did and did not," she laughed."Listen: fear, worry, hatred,
malice, murder, all of which are mental things in themselves, manifest
to the human mind as microbes.These are the hurtful microbes, and
they produce toxins, which poison the system.It is
the Christ-principle.Now you can learn that principle, and how to
apply it.But if you don't care to, why, then you must go on with your
material microbes and poisons, and with your diseases and death, until
you are ready to leave them and turn to that which is real.For all
human-mind activity and manifestation, whether in microbes, death, or
life, is mental, and is but the counterfeit of the real activity of
divine mind, God."Do you know," she pursued earnestly, "I heard a lecture the other day
in which it was said that life is a sort of fermentation in the body.Well, as regards human life, I guess that is so.For the human body is
only a manifestation of the human mind; and the human mind surely is
in a continuous state of ferment!""The lecturer," she continued, "said that the
range of life was from ultra-microbe to man, and that Shakespeare
began as a single cell.The mundane concept of
Shakespeare's body may have unfolded from a cell-concept; but
Shakespeare was a manifestation of mind!And that mind was an
interpretation, though very imperfect, of the mind that is God.Why
can't you materialists raise your eyes above the dust?Why, you would
choke the very avenues of the spirit with mud!"Well, your education seems to be--"

"Yes," she interrupted, "my education is beyond the vagaries that are
so generally taught in the name of knowledge.It does nothing for mankind, except to give them a false
culture.Were the so-called great men of the past really educated?Here is an extract which I copied this afternoon from Hawthorne."She
opened her note book and read:

  "'Ah, but there is a half-acknowledged melancholy like to this
  when we stand in the perfected vigor of our life and feel that
  Time has now given us all his flowers, and that the next work of
  his never-idle fingers must be to steal them one by one away.'"Now," she asked, "was that man really educated?But that theology _could not solve his least earthly problem, nor
meet his slightest need_!Oh, what inexpressibly sad lives so many of
your greatest men have lived!Your Hawthorne, your Longfellow, they
yearned for the rest which they were taught was to follow death.If they
believed in the Christ--and they thought they did--why, then, did they
not rise up and do as he bade them do, put death out?He taught no
such resignation to human beliefs as they practiced!He showed men how
to overcome the world.He looked at her intently for some moments.She seemed, as she stood
there before him, like a thing of gossamer and sunshine that had
drifted into his laboratory, despite the closed door."Say," he suddenly exclaimed, as a new thought struck him, "I'd like
to have you talk with my friend, Reverend Patterson Moore!Pat and I
have barked at each other for many years now, and I'm getting tired.I'd like to shift him to a younger and more vigorous opponent.I
believe you've been providentially sent to relieve me.""You can tell Professor Hitt, and--"

"Hitt, eh?He is very much interested
in these things that you and I have been talking about to-day.We have
regular meetings, with Father Waite, and Mr.Haynerd, and--"

"Well, no wonder you can argue!But--suppose I have Hitt bring me to one of your meetings, eh?"The genial doctor laughed long and incontinently."I imagine Reverend
Pat wouldn't thank you for referring to him that way," he said."He is
a very high Anglican, and his dignity is marvelous--to say nothing of
his self-esteem.Well, we'll see, we'll see."I didn't really mean to come in here, you
know.But I guess I was led, don't you?"And when the door had closed upon her, the doctor sat silently beside
the pulseless brain of his deceased comrade and pondered long.*       *       *       *       *

When Carmen entered the house, late that afternoon, she found the
Beaubien in conversation with Professor Williams, of the University
School of Music.That gentleman had learned through Hitt of the girl's
unusual voice, and had dropped in on his way home to ask that he might
hear and test it.With only a smile for reply, Carmen tossed her books
and hat upon the sofa and went directly to the piano, where she
launched into the weird Indian lament which had produced such an
astounding effect upon her chance visitors at the Elwin school that
day long gone, and which had been running in her thought and seeking
expression ever since her conversation with Doctor Morton a short
while before.For a full half hour she sang, lost in the harmony that poured from
her soul.Father Waite entered, and quietly took a seat.Song after song, most of them the characteristic soft
melodies of her people, and many her own simple improvisations, issued
from the absorbed girl's lips.The Beaubien rose and stole softly from
the room.Father Waite sat with his head resting on his hand, striving
to interpret the message which welled from the depths of his own
being, where hidden, unused chords were vibrating in unison with those
of this young girl.Then, abruptly, the singing stopped, and Carmen turned and faced her
auditors."There," she said, with a happy sigh, "that just _had_ to
come out!""Who, may I ask, was your
teacher?"he said, in a voice husky with emotion.A look of astonishment came into the man's face.He turned to Father
Waite inquiringly.The latter nodded his confirmation of the girl's
words."I wonder if you realize what you
have got, Miss Carmen?""It's a beautiful gift, isn't it?""But--I had thought of asking you to let me train you--but--I--I dare
not undertake to handle such a voice as yours.May I--may I send
Maitre Rossanni to you, the great Italian?"Oh, yes," returned the girl; "I'll sing for anybody.The gift isn't
mine, you know.When the professor had taken his reluctant departure, the Beaubien
returned and handed Carmen a letter.With a cry of joy the girl seized
it and tore it open.It was from Colombia, the second one that her
beloved Rosendo had succeeded in getting down the river to the distant
coast.It had been written three months prior, and it bore many stains
and evidences of the vicissitudes through which it had emerged.Yes,
Rosendo and his family were well, though still at Maria Rosa, far up
the Boque, with Don Nicolas.The war raged below them, but they were
safe."And not a word from Padre Jose, or about him," murmured the girl,
sinking into a chair and clasping the soiled letter to her breast.Father Waite thought of the little newsboy of Cartagena, and his
possible share in the cause of Jose's silence.CHAPTER 4


Carmen's first serious test of her knowledge of English composition
was made early in the semester, in an essay on town life in Colombia;
and so meritorious did her instructor consider it that he advised her
to send it to a prominent literary magazine.The result was that the
essay was accepted, and a request made for further contributions.The girl bubbled with new-found happiness.Then she wrote another, and
still another article on the life and customs of her people.Both
were given publication; and with the money which she received for them
she bought a silk dress for Jude, much to that adoring woman's
surprise and vehement protest.Carmen might have saved the money
toward a piano--but, no; that would have been thinking of herself, and
was inadmissible.Nor did the Beaubien offer any objection."Indeed,"
commented that fond shepherd of this lone lamb, "she would have poured
the money out into somebody's open hand anyway, and it might as well
be Jude's."Then she choked back the tears as she added: "The girl comes home
every night with an empty purse, no matter how full it may have been
in the morning.Carmen's slight success in the field of letters still further aroused
Haynerd's interest.The peacefully somnolent Social Era, he thought,
might awaken to new things under the stimulus of such fresh writing as
hers.Perhaps life did hold something of real value after all.Would
she furnish him with a column or two on the peculiar social aspect of
the metropolis?And the result was that the staid conservative
sheet was given a smart shaking; and several prominent society people
sat up and blinked.It but threw a clear light from a somewhat unusual
angle upon certain phases of New York's social life, and uncovered a
few of the more subtly hidden springs of its peculiar activity.Among those who read her essay in the Social Era was J. Wilton Ames.He first lay back in his chair and laughed uproariously.And then,
when his agents discovered for him the identity of the author, he
glowered.The Beaubien was still standing between him and this budding
genius.And though he might, and would, ultimately ruin the Beaubien
financially, yet this girl, despite her social ostracism, bade fair to
earn with her facile pen enough to maintain them both in luxury.So he
bent anew to his vengeful schemes, for he would make them come to him.As Trustee, he would learn what courses the girl was pursuing in the
University--for he had long known that she was in attendance there.Then he would learn who her associates were; what suggestions and
advice her instructors gave her; and her plans for the future.And he
would trace her sources of income and apply pressure at the most vital
point.He had never in his life been successfully balked.Then Haynerd came to congratulate Carmen again, and to request that
she attend with him the formal opening of the new Ames mansion, the
great Fifth Avenue palace, for he wanted her vivid, first-hand
impressions for his account of the brilliant affair in the Social Era.As reporters, he explained, they would of necessity remain in
seclusion, and the girl might disguise to such an extent as to prevent
recognition, if she chose.It was business for him, and an opportunity
for rich experience for her.And the fearless girl went, because it
would help Haynerd, though the Beaubien inwardly trembled.Invitations to the number of three hundred had been issued to the
_elite_ of New York, announcing the formal opening of the newly
finished, magnificent Ames dwelling.These invitations were wrought in
enamel on cards of pure gold.A month prior to the opening, the
newspapers had printed carefully-worded announcements of the return of
Mrs.J. Wilton Ames and her daughter, after a protracted stay at
various foreign baths and rest-cures in the hope of restoring the
former's impaired health.Ames now felt that she could no
longer deprive society of her needed activities, and so had returned
to conduct it through what promised to be a season of unusual
brilliancy.The papers did not, however, state that J. Wilton had
himself recalled her, after quietly destroying his bill of divorce,
because he recognized the necessity of maintaining the social side of
his complicated existence on a par with his vast business affairs.As Carmen and Haynerd approached the huge, white marble structure,
cupolaed, gabled, buttressed, and pinnacled, an overwhelming sense of
what it stood for suddenly came upon the girl, and she saw revealed in
a flash that side of its owner's life which for so many months she had
been pondering.The great shadows that seemed to issue from the
massive exterior of the building swept out and engulfed her; and she
turned and clasped Haynerd's arm with the feeling that she would
suffocate were she to remain longer in them."Perk up, little one," said Haynerd, taking her hand."We'll go round
to the rear entrance, and I will present my business card there.Ames's secretary telephoned me instructions, and I said I was going to
bring a lady reporter with me."Carmen caught her breath as she passed through the tall, exquisitely
wrought iron gateway and along the marble walk which led to the rear.Up the winding steps to the front entrance, where swung the marvelous
bronze doors which had stirred the imaginations of two continents,
streamed the favored of the fashionable world.Among them Carmen saw
many whom she recognized.The buffoon, Larry Beers, was there,
swinging jauntily along with the bejeweled wife of Samson, the
multimillionaire packer.Kane and his wife, and Weston followed.Outside the gates there was incessant chugging of automobiles, mingled
with the shouted orders of the three policemen detailed to direct the
traffic.A pinched, ragged urchin and his tattered little sister crept
up and peered wildly through the iron pickets of the fence; but a
sharp rap from a policeman's club sent them scattering.Carmen stood
for a moment in the shadows and watched the swarm mount the marble
steps and enter through those wonderful doors.There were congressmen
and senators, magnates and jurists, distillers and preachers.Each one
owed his tithe of allegiance to Ames.Some were chained to him hard
and fast, nor would break their bonds this side of the grave.There were those who grew white under his most casual
glance.There were others who knew that his calloused hand was closing
about them, and that when it opened again they would fall to the
ground, dry as dust.Others, like moths, not yet singed, were hovering
ever closer to the bright, cruel flame.Reverend Darius Borwell,
bowing and smiling, alighted from his parochial car and tripped
blithely up the glistening marble steps.Each and all, wrapping the
skeleton of grief, greed, shame, or fear beneath swart broadcloth and
shimmering silk, floated up those ghostly steps as if drawn by a
tremendous magnet incarnate in the person of J. Wilton Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away.Hawley-Crowles sigh in the wake of that gilded assembly?Did the moans
of poor, grief-stricken Mrs.Gannette, sitting in her poverty and
sorrow, die into silence against those bronze doors?Was he, the being
who dwelt in that marble palace, the hydra-headed embodiment of the
carnal, Scriptural, age-old power that opposes God?How many others there were
scattered through the house itself, Haynerd could only guess.But he
passed inspection and was admitted with the girl.A butler took
immediate charge of them, and led them quickly through a short passage
and to an elevator, by which they mounted to another floor, where,
opening a paneled oak door, the dignified functionary preceded them
into a small reception hall, with lavatories at either end.Here he
bade them remove their wraps and await his return."Well," commented Haynerd, with a light, nervous laugh, "we've crossed
the Rubicon!A moment later the butler returned with a sharp-eyed young woman, Mrs."You will be very careful in your report," the latter began at once in
a business-like manner."And you will submit the same to me for
approval before it is published in your magazine.Ames deems that
imperative, since your recent publication of an essay on modern
society in this city.I have a list here of the guests, their business
and social standing, and other data.You
will say that this is the most brilliant assemblage ever gathered
under one roof in New York.The wealth represented here to-night will
total not less than three billion dollars.The jewels alone displayed
will foot up not less than twenty millions.Now, let me see," again
consulting her notes.Haynerd stole a covert glance at Carmen and winked."The chef," the secretary resumed, "was brought over from Paris by
Mrs.His name, Pierre Lotard, descendant of
the famous chef of the Emperor Napoleon First.He considers that his
menu to-night surpasses anything he ever before achieved.""May I ask," interrupted Haynerd, "the probable cost of the supper?""Yes, perhaps you had better mention that item.It will be in the
neighborhood of three hundred dollars a plate.House and table
decorations, about eight thousand dollars.The menu cards were hand-illuminated by Parisian
artists, and each bears a sketch illustrative or suggestive of the
guest to whom it is given.""Three thousand, if I correctly recall it," was the nonchalant reply."As to the viands, you will mention that they have been gathered from
every part of the world.Now come with me, and I will give you a hasty
sketch of the house, while the guests are assembling in the grand
salon.Then you will remain in the balcony, where you will make what
notes you wish on the dress displayed.Refreshments will be served to
you later in this waiting room.I need not remind you that you are not
expected to mingle with the guests, nor to address any one.Keep to
the balcony, and quite out of view."Opening a door opposite the one through which she had entered, the
young woman led her charges directly out upon the great marble balcony
overlooking the grand salon below.A rush of brilliant light engulfed
them, and a potpourri of chatter and laughter, mingled with soft music
from a distant organ, and the less distinct notes of the orchestra in
the still more distant ballroom, rose about them in confused babel, as
they tiptoed to the exquisitely carved marble railing and peered down
upon the gorgeous pageant.The ceiling rose far above them, delicately
tinted like a soft Italian sky.The lofty walls dropped, like
gold-gray veils, to the richly carved paneled wainscoting beneath,
which had once lined the halls of a mediaeval castle on the Rhine.The
great windows were hidden behind rare Venetian lace curtains, over
which fell hangings of brocade, repeating the soft tints of the wall
and the brocade-covered chairs and divans ranged close about the sides
of the splendid room.On the floor lay a massive, priceless Persian
carpet, dating from the fifteenth century.Haynerd drew a long breath, and whistled softly.From the end of the
salon he could mark the short flight of steps which led to the
mezzanine, with its walls heavily tapestried, and broken by rich oak
doors opening into lavatories and lounging rooms, itself widening at
the far end into the grand billiard and smoking parlors, done off in
Circassian walnut, with tables and furniture to harmonize.From the
mezzanine he saw the grand stairway falling away in great, sweeping
curves, all in blended marble from the world's greatest quarries, and
delicately chased and carved into classic designs.Two tapestries,
centuries old, hung from the walls on either side.Far above, the oak
ceiling, for which the _Schwarzwald_ had been ranged, was overlaid
with pure gold leaf.The whole was suffused with the glow of myriad
hidden and inverted lights, reflected in a thousand angles from
burnished gold and marble and rarest gems.He groped in the chambers of
his imagery for some superlative adjective to express his emotion
before this colossal display of wealth.But his ample vocabulary had
faded quite.He could only shake his head and give vent to the inept
remark, "Swell--by George!"The secretary, without replying, motioned them to follow.Passing
noiselessly around the balcony to the opposite side, she indicated a
door below, leading off to the right from the grand salon."That room beyond," she said, "is the petit salon.It is
in panels from French chateaux, covered with Gobelin tapestry.Now
from here you can see a bit of the music room.The grand organ cost,
installed, about two hundred thousand dollars.It is electrically
controlled, with its pipes running all around the room, so as to give
the effect of music coming from every corner.""There are three art galleries beyond, two for paintings, and one for
sculpture.Ames has without doubt the finest art collection in
America.It includes several Titians, Veroneses, da Vincis, Turners,
three Rubens, and two Raphaels.By the way, it may interest you to
know that his negotiations for the Murillo Madonna were completed
to-day, and the picture will be sent to him immediately.""Might I ask what he paid for it?""You may say that he paid something over three hundred thousand
dollars for it," she replied, in a quite matter of fact tone."Now,"
she continued, "you will go back to your first position, near the door
of the waiting room, and remain there until I return.I may have an
opportunity later to show you the library.Great
carved stone fireplace, taken from a Scotch castle.Hundreds of rare
volumes and first editions.Now, if any one approaches, you can step
behind the screen and remain out of view.You have chairs and a table
there for your writing.With this final injunction she turned and disappeared into the little
waiting room from which they had emerged.For some moments Carmen and Haynerd stood looking alternately at
each other and about them at their magnificent environment.Both had
seen much of the gilded life, and the girl had dwelt some months in
its alien atmosphere.But neither had ever witnessed such a
stupendous display of material wealth as was here unfolded before
their astonished gaze.At the head of the grand stairway stood the
Ames trio, to receive their resplendent guests.The women were
magnificently gowned.But Ames's massive form in its simple black
and chaste linen was the cynosure of all eyes.Even Haynerd could
not suppress a note of admiration as he gazed at the splendid figure."And yet," he murmured, "a victim, like the rest, of the great
delusion."Carmen laid down the opera glasses through which she had been studying
the man."He is an expression," she said, "of the American ideal--the
ideal of practical material life.It is toward his plane of life that
this country's youth are struggling, at, oh, what a cost!Think,
think, what his immense, misused revenue could do, if unselfishly
used!Why, the cost of this single night's show would put two hundred
men like Father Waite through a four-year course in the University,
and train them to do life's work!"Oh, further opportunities to increase his pile, I suppose," returned
Haynerd, shrugging his shoulders.And does he need further
opportunities to accumulate money?Does he not rather need some one to
show him the meaning of life, how to really live?"And it may be your mission, Carmen, to do just that.But if you don't, then I sincerely hope the man may die before he
discovers that all that he has achieved, his wealth, his prestige, his
power, have not been worth striving for!""He hasn't the slightest idea of the meaning of life," she murmured,
looking down upon the glittering throng."They put me in mind of Carlyle's famous remark, as
he stood looking out across the London Strand: 'There are in this city
some four million people, mostly fools.'How mean, narrow and hard
their lives are!These are the high priests of vested privilege, of
mediaevalism, of old institutions whose perpetual maintenance, even in
a generation that has progressed far beyond them, is a fungus blight
upon us.Ah, there's little Willie Van Wot, all dolled out!He's
glorifying his Creator now by devoting his foolish little existence to
coaching trips along the New England shore.He reminds me of the Fleet
street poet who wrote a century ago of the similar occupation of a
young dandy of that day--

                  What can little T. O. do?Why, drive a Phaeton and Two!!!Can little T. O. do no more?Yes, drive a Phaeton and Four!!!!"He's an interesting outgrowth of our unique social system, eh?""We must follow Emerson and treat them all as we do pictures, look at
them in the best light," murmured Carmen."Aye, hang them in the best light!""But make sure
they're well hung!There goes the pseudo-princess, member of the royal
house of England.I tell you, under
the splash and glitter you can see the feet of clay, eh?""Yes," smiled Carmen, "resting upon the high heel."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture of disgust."The women of
fashion seem to feel that the Creator didn't do a good job when He
designed the feminine sex--that He should have put a hump where the
heel is, so's to slant the foot and make comfortable walking
impossible, as well as to insure a plentiful crop of foot-troubles and
deformities.The Chinese women used to manifest a similarly insane
thought.The human mind is a cave
of black ignorance!"Carmen did not reply, but bent her attention again to the throng
below."Look there," said Haynerd, indicating a stout, full-toiletted woman,
resplendent with diamonds."That's our eminent French guest, Madam
Carot.She severed herself from her tiresome consort last year by
means of a bichloride tablet deftly immersed in his coffee, and then,
leaving a sigh of regret hovering over his unhandsome remains,
hastened to our friendly shores, to grace the _beau monde_ with her
gowns and jewels."Carmen turned to him with a remonstrance of incredulity."The Social Era got the whole spicy
story.See, she's drifted up to young Watson!Coquetting for a
husband still, the old buzzard!""Well, it's fact, anyway," persisted the society monitor."And there
beyond her is fat little Mrs.Stuffenheimer, with her two unlovely,
red-faced daughters.Ah, the despairing mamma is still vainly angling
for mates for her two chubby Venuses!If they're not married off
properly and into good social positions soon, it's mamma for the scrap
heap!it's positively tragic to see these anxious mothers
at Newport and Atlantic City and other fashionable places, rushing
madly hither and yon with their marriageable daughters, dragging them
from one function to another in the wild hope that they may ultimately
land a man.Worry and pain dig deep furrows into poor mamma's face if
she sees her daughters fading into the has-been class.It requires
heroism, I say, to travel in society!Well,"
taking up his notebook, "we must get busy now.By the way, how's your
shorthand progressing?""Oh, splendidly," replied the girl, her eyes still upon the massive
figure of Ames.Then, recovering from her abstraction, "I can write as
fast in it now as in longhand."For more than an hour the two sat in the seclusion of the splendid
balcony, looking down upon the scene of magnificence below.Through
the mind of the young girl ran a ceaseless paean of thanksgiving for
her timely deliverance from the trammels which she so well knew
enshackled these glittering birds of paradise.With it mingled a
great, consuming desire, a soul-longing to pour into the vacuity of
high society the leaven of her own pure thought.In particular did her
boundless love now go out to that gigantic figure whose ideals of life
this sumptuous display of material wealth and power expressed.Was it only a vainglorious
exhibition of his own human prowess?Was it an announcement,
magnificent beyond compare, that he, J. Wilton Ames, had attained the
supreme heights of gratified world ambition?That the world at last
lay at his feet?And that over it brooded the giant's lament that
there remained nothing more to conquer?But, if so, the girl at least
knew that the man's herculean efforts to subdue the material world
were as nothing.The real conquest lay still before him, the conquest
of self.And when that were faced and achieved, well she knew that no
such garish display as this would announce the victory to a breathless
world.The bustling little social secretary again appeared, and briefly
announced the production of an opera in the auditorium, to which she
had come to conduct them.Passing through the little waiting room and
to the elevator, they quickly mounted to the unoccupied gallery of the
theater above.The parquet, which would seat nearly a thousand
spectators, was rapidly filling with an eager, curious throng.The
Ames trio and some of the more distinguished guests were already
occupying the gorgeously decorated boxes at the sides.An orchestra of
fifty pieces was visible in the hollow below the stage.Caroni, the
famous grand opera leader, stood ready to conduct.The opera itself
was the much discussed music drama, Salome."Now," commented Haynerd to his fair, wondering companion, who was
lost in contemplation of the magnificent mural decorations of the
little theater, "we will see something rare, for this opera has been
called the most artistic piece of indecency known to the stage.Ames has got Marie Deschamps for the title role.She'll cost
him not less than five thousand dollars for this one night.And--see
here," drawing Carmen's attention to the bill, "Marcou and Corvalle
besides!These stars get three thousand
dollars a night during the regular season."Every phase of sophistication was manifested in that glittering
audience when the curtain rose and the sensational theme was
introduced.But to none came thoughts like those which clamored for
admittance at the portals of Carmen's mentality.In the bold challenge
of the insanely sensual portrayal of a carnal mind the girl saw the
age-old defiance of the spirit by the flesh.In the rolls of the
wondrous music, in its shrieks, its pleadings, and its dying echoes,
she heard voiced again the soul-lament of a weary world searching
vainly in the mazes of human thought for truth.As the wonderful
Deschamps danced weirdly before her in the ghastly light and fell
gloating over her gory trophy, Carmen saw but the frantic struggles of
a diseased soul, portrayed as the skilled surgeon lays bare the
malignant growth that is eating the quivering tissues of a human
frame.The immodesty of dress, the sensual suggestiveness of the
dance, the brutal flouting of every element of refinement and
delicacy, blazoned in frenzied tone and movement the bloody orgy and
dance of death which goes on incessantly upon the stage of human life,
and ends in the mad whirl and confusion and insane gibbering over the
lifeless trophies for which mankind sell their very souls.commented Haynerd, when the final
curtain dropped."Yes, even to a vitiated taste.The passionate thirst
for the sensational has led to this sickening display of salacity--"

"Splendid, wasn't it?"came in tones of admiration from the social
secretary, who had returned to conduct her charges back to the balcony
before the guests emerged from the theater."You will run the program
in full, and comment at some length on the expense attached," she went
on."You have just witnessed the private production of a full opera,
unabridged, and with the regular operatic cast.Supper will follow in
a half hour.Meantime, you will remain in the balcony where you were
before."Returning to their former position, Carmen sank into a chair at the
little table behind the screen, and strove to orient her thought.Haynerd sat down beside her to arrange his voluminous notes.Presently
footsteps were heard, and the sound of voices.Haynerd glanced through
the hinge of the screen.he whispered, "here comes Ames
and--who's with him?Showing him about, I
suppose."Carmen gazed at the approaching men with fascinated eyes, although she
saw but one, the towering magician who had reared this fairy palace.She saw Ames lead his companion to the door of the little waiting room
at their right, and heard the congressman protest against entering."But we can talk undisturbed in here," urged Ames, his hand on the
door."Better remain out here on the balcony," replied the congressman
nervously, as he moved toward the railing.He understood the
man's repugnance fully."You know, Wales," he said easily, going to the railing and peering
over at the brilliant assemblage below, "if I could get the heathen
Chinee to add an extra half-inch to his shirt length, I'd make a
hundred millions.And then, perhaps, I wouldn't need to struggle with
your Ways and Means Committee as I do.By the way, the cotton schedule
will be reported out unchanged, I presume."He turned and looked
quizzically at his companion as he said this.Wales trembled slightly when he replied to the question he had been
awaiting."Parsons will vote for it," he said
suggestively.Ames, is committed to
the high tariff principle.We can not let in a flood of foreign
cotton--"

"Then you want the fight between the farmers and spinners to continue,
eh?""You don't seem to realize that in the
end both will get more money than they are getting now, and that it
will come from the consumer, who will pay vastly higher for his
finished products, in addition to the tariff.Ames," returned the congressman
tenaciously."Look here, Wales," said Ames, turning savagely upon his companion.Their
cooeperative associations must be smashed.The tariff schedule which
you have before your Committee will do it.Ames," replied the congressman, "I--I am opposed to the constant
manipulation of cotton by you rich men.I--"

"There," interrupted Ames, "never mind explaining your conscientious
scruples.What I want to know is, do you intend to cast your vote for
the unaltered schedule?"Ames, I can't--"

"H'm," murmured Ames.Then, with easy nonchalance, turning to an
apparently irrelevant topic as he gazed over the railing, "I heard
just before coming from my office this evening that the doors of the
Mercantile Trust would not open to-morrow.A lot of my
personal friends are heavily involved.Ames and Company will take over their tangible assets; I believe
you were interested, were you not?"He glanced at the trembling man
out of the corners of his eyes.His hands shook as he grasped the railing before
him and tried to steady himself."It--it--yes--very hard," murmured the dazed man.But step into the waiting room and 'phone the newspapers.Representative Wales was serving his first term in Congress.His
election had been a matter of surprise to everybody, himself included,
excepting Ames.Wales knew not that his detailed personal history had
been for many months carefully filed in the vaults of the Ames tower.Nor did he ever suspect that his candidacy and election had been
matters of most careful thought on the part of the great financier
and his political associates.But when he, a stranger to congressional
halls, was made a member of the Ways and Means Committee, his
astonishment overleaped all bounds.Then Ames had smiled his own
gratification, and arranged that the new member should attend the
formal opening of the great Ames palace later in the year.Meantime,
the financier and the new congressman had met on several occasions,
and the latter had felt no little pride in the attention which the
great man had shown him.And so the path to fame had unrolled steadily before the guileless
Wales until this night, when the first suspicions of his thraldom had
penetrated and darkened his thought.Then, like a crash from a clear
sky, had come the announcement of the Mercantile Trust failure.And as
he stood there now, clutching the marble railing, his thought busy
with the woman and the two fair children who would be rendered
penniless by this blow, the fell presence of the monster Ames seemed
to bend over him as the epitome of ruthless, brutal, inhuman cunning."How much are you likely to lose by this failure?""Not less than fifty thousand
dollars," he replied in a husky voice.stooping and apparently taking up an object that had
been lying on the floor back of the congressman.Wales took the book in a dazed, mechanical way."Why--I have no--this
is not mine," he murmured, gazing alternately at the pass book and at
Ames."Your name's on it, at least," commented Ames laconically."And the
book's been issued by our bank, Ames and Company.Guess you've
forgotten opening an account there, let me see, yes, a week ago."He
took the book and opened it."Ah, yes, I recall the incident now.The book, made out in his name on Ames
and Company, showed a deposit to his credit of fifty thousand
dollars!Ames slipped his arm through the confused congressman's, and started
with him down the balcony."You see," he said, as they moved away,
"the Mercantile failure will not hit you as hard as you thought.Now,
about that cotton schedule, when you cast your vote for it, be sure
that--" The voice died away as the men disappeared in the distance,
leaving Carmen and Haynerd staring blankly at each other."We must save them both," said Carmen quietly."I could make my everlasting fortune out of this!"exclaimed Haynerd
excitedly."And lose your soul," replied the girl.Ames, and
tell him that we overheard his conversation.Haynerd then smiled, but it was a hard smile, coming from one who knew
the world."Listen, my dear girl," he said, "we will keep quiet, you
and I. To mention this would be only to court disaster at the hands of
one who would strangle us at the slightest intimation of our
knowledge."I can see but the right," returned Carmen determinedly."But, my dear girl," cried Haynerd, now thoroughly alarmed both for
himself and her, "he would ruin us!We had
no intention of hearing; and so let it be as if we had not heard."Haynerd, I could not, if I
would.Ames is being used by evil; and it is making him a channel
to ruin Mr.Shall I stand idly by and permit it?She rose, with a look of fixed resolution on her face.Haynerd sprang
to his feet and laid a detaining hand upon her arm.As he did so, the
screen was quickly drawn aside, and Kathleen Ames and two of her young
companions bent their curious gaze in upon them.Absorbed in their
earnest conversation, Carmen and Haynerd had not heard the approach of
the young ladies, who were on a tour of inspection of the house before
supper."Reporters for the Social Era, Miss Ames," explained Haynerd, hastily
answering the unspoken question, while he made a courteous bow.she cried, instantly
recognizing Carmen, and drawing back.asked one of the young ladies, as her eyes roved
over Carmen's tense, motionless figure.cried Kathleen, spurting her venom at Carmen, while
her eyes snapped angrily and her hands twitched."When the front door
is closed against you, you sneak in through the back door!Leave this
house, instantly, or I shall have you thrown into the street!""She is a low, <DW64> wench!"She foisted herself upon society, and was discovered
and kicked out!Her father is a dirty <DW64> priest, and her mother a
low--"

Haynerd rushed to the maddened girl and clapped his hand over her
mouth."Hush, for God's sake, Miss Ames!"Then, to her companions,
"Take her away!"But a house detective, attracted by the loud conversation, had come up
and interposed."I can not put them out if they have his
permission to remain," he explained to the angry Kathleen.In a few moments, during which the little group stood tense and quiet,
Ames himself appeared.turning inquiringly to Haynerd.Her article in last week's Social Era was a corker.But,"
staring from Kathleen to the others, "what's the row?""I want that creature put out of the house!"demanded Kathleen,
trembling with rage and pointing to Carmen."Tut, tut," returned Ames easily."She's on business, and has my
permission to remain.that's a good joke," winking at
Haynerd and breaking into a loud laugh."You put one over on us there,
old man!"Scalding tears of anger and humiliation were streaming down
Kathleen's face."If she remains, I shall go--I shall leave the
house--I will not stay under the same roof with the lewd creature!""Very well, then, run along," said Ames, taking the humiliated
Kathleen by the shoulders and turning her about."I will settle this
without your assistance."Then he motioned to the house detectives to
depart, and turned to Haynerd and Carmen."Come in here," he said,
leading the way to the little waiting room, and opening the door.but you belong down stairs with the rest," he ejaculated as he
faced Carmen, standing before him pale but unafraid."There isn't one
down there who is in your class!"he exclaimed, placing his hands upon
her shoulders and looking down into her beautiful face."And," he
continued with sudden determination, "I am going to take you down, and
you will sit at the table with me, as my special guest!"A sudden fear gripped Haynerd, and he started to interpose.An expression of surprise and inquiry came into Ames's face."You mean Congressman--"

Then he stopped abruptly, and looked searchingly at Carmen and her
companion.Ames's expression
of surprise gave place to one dark and menacing."You were behind that screen when Congressman Wales and I--"

"Yes," returned Carmen calmly.Ames stood like a huge, black cloud, glowering down upon the slender
girl."You are going to tell him that the fifty thousand dollars are just a
loan, and that he may vote as he chooses, aren't you?""You
will not ruin his life, and the lives of his wife and babies, will
you?You would never be happy, you know, if you did."Her voice was as
quiet as the morning breeze."You come into my house to play spy, eh?And
if I had not caught you when I did you would have written another
interesting article for the Social Era, wouldn't you?I'll
break you, Haynerd, and your infernal sheet into a million pieces if
you dare print any such rot as this!And as for you, young lady--"

"You can do nothing to me, Mr.Ames; and you don't really want to,"
said Carmen quickly."My reputation, you know--that is, the one which
you people have given me--is just as black as it could be, isn't it?"It doesn't really make any
difference to you, Mr.Ames," she said, "whether the cotton schedule
is passed or not.You still have your millions--oh, so much more
than you will ever know what to do with!Wales, he has his
wife and his babies and his good reputation--would you rob him of
those priceless treasures, just to make a few dollars more for
yourself?--dollars that you can't spend, and that you won't let
others have?"During the girl's quiet talk Ames was regaining his self-control.When
she concluded he turned to Haynerd."Miss Carmen can step out into the
balcony.You and I will arrange this matter together," he said."Now," said Ames significantly, and in a low voice, "what's your
price?"Instantly the girl turned back and threw herself between the two men.she cried, her eyes flashing as she confronted
Ames.shouted Ames, who had lost himself completely, "I will
crush him like a dirty spider!And you, I'll drag you through the
gutters and make your name a synonym of all that is vile in
womanhood!"Carmen stepped quietly to the elevator and pressed the signal button.cried the enraged Ames, starting
toward her.The girl drew herself up with splendid dignity, and faced him
fearlessly."We _shall_ leave your house, and now, Mr."You and that for which you stand can not touch us!The carnal
mind is back of you!She moved away from him, then turned and stood for a moment, flashing,
sparkling, radiant with a power which he could not comprehend.You are blinded and deceived by human lust and
greed.But the god you so ignorantly worship now will some day totter
and fall upon you.Then you will awake, and you will see your present
life as a horrid dream."Carmen and the dazed Haynerd stepped quickly
into it and descended without opposition to the lower floor.A few
moments later they were again in the street and hurrying to the
nearest car line."Girlie," said Haynerd, mopping the perspiration from his brow, "we're
in for it now--and I shall be crushed!But you--I think your God will
save you.""His arm is not shortened," she murmured, "that
He can not save us both."CHAPTER 5

ON the Monday morning following the Ames reception the society columns
of the daily papers still teemed with extravagant depictions of the
magnificent affair.On that same morning, while Haynerd sat gloomily
in the office of the Social Era, meditating on his giant adversary's
probable first move, Carmen, leaving her studies and classes, sought
out an unpretentious home in one of the suburbs of the city, and for
an hour or more talked earnestly with the timid, frightened little
wife of Congressman Wales.Then, her work done, she dismissed the
whole affair from her mind, and hastened joyously back to the
University."But," she
reflected, as she dwelt on his conduct and words of the previous
Saturday evening, "he is not ready for it yet.And when he is, I will
go to him.And Kathleen--well, I will help her by seeing only the real
child of God, which was hidden that night by the veil of hatred and
jealousy.And that veil, after all, is but a shadow."That evening the little group of searchers after God assembled again
in the peaceful precincts of the Beaubien cottage.It was their third
meeting, and they had come together reverently to pursue the most
momentous inquiry that has ever stimulated human thought.Haynerd and Carmen had said little relative to the Ames reception; but
the former, still brooding over the certain consequences of his brush
with Ames, was dejected and distraught.Carmen, leaning upon her
sustaining thought, and conceding no mite of power or intelligence to
evil, glowed like a radiant star.she asked of Haynerd, drawing him to one
side."Are you giving ear to the voices of evil, or good?For those thoughts which are real to you
will become outwardly manifested, you know."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture signifying
defeat."And the insults of that arrogant daughter of his--"

"She did not insult me," said Carmen quickly."She could not, for she
doesn't know me.She merely denounced her concept of me, and not my
real self.She vilified what she thought was Carmen Ariza; but it was
only her own thought of me that she insulted.And such
a concept of me as she holds deserves denouncing, doesn't it?""Well, what are we going to do?""We are going to know," she whispered, "that we two with God
constitute an overwhelming majority."She said nothing about her visit
to the Wales home that morning, but pressed his hand, and then went to
take her place at the table, where Father Waite was already rapping
for order."My friends," began that earnest young man, looking lovingly about at
the little group, "as we are gathered here we symbolize that
analytical, critical endeavor of the unbiased human mind to discover
the essence of religion.Religion is that which binds us to absolute
truth, and so is truth itself.If there is a God, we believe from our
former investigations that He must be universal mind.This belief
carries with it as necessary corollaries the beliefs that He must be
perfect, eternal, and self-existent.must
then receive its sufficient answer in the staggering statement that He
has always existed, unchanged and unchangeable."A sigh from Haynerd announced that quizzical soul's struggle to grasp
a statement at once so radical and stupendous."True," continued Father Waite, addressing himself to his doubting
friend, "the acceptance as fact of what we have deduced in our
previous meetings must render the God of orthodox theology quite
obsolete.But, as a compensation, it gives to us the most enlarged and
beautiful concept of Him that we have ever had.It ennobles, broadens,
purifies, and elevates our idea of Him.It destroys forever our
belittling view of Him as but a magnified human character, full of
wrath and caprice and angry threats, and delighting in human
ceremonial and religious thaumaturgy.And, most practical of all for
us, it renders the age-long problem of evil amenable to solution."Just then came a ring at the front door; and a moment later the
Beaubien ushered Doctor Morton into the room.All rose and hastened to
welcome him."I--I am sure," began the visitor, looking at Carmen, "that I am not
intruding, for I really come on invitation, you know.Miss Carmen,
first; and then, our good friend Hitt, who told me this afternoon that
you would probably meet this evening.I--I pondered the matter some
little time--ah, but--well, to make it short, I couldn't keep away
from a gathering so absolutely unique as this--I really couldn't."she exclaimed, her eyes dancing,
"I am glad you came.""And I, too," interposed Haynerd dryly, "for now we have two
theological Philistines."Ah, my friend," replied the doctor, "I am simply an advocate of
religious freedom, not a--"

"And religious freedom, as our wise Bill Nye once said, is but the art
of giving intolerance a little more room, eh?"returned Haynerd with a
laugh."You are a Philistine," he said.Carmen took the doctor by the arm and led him to a place beside her at
the table."You--you didn't bring poor Yorick?"she whispered, with a
glint of mischief in her bright eyes."No," laughed the genial visitor, "he's a dead one, you told me.""Yes," replied the girl, "awfully dead!He is an outward manifestation
of dead human beliefs, isn't he?But now listen, Father Waite is going
to speak."After a brief explanation to the doctor of the purpose of the
meeting, and a short resume of their previous deductions, Father Waite
continued the exposition of his subject."The physical universe," he said, "is to human beings a reality.And
yet, according to Spencer's definition of reality, we must admit that
the universe as we see it is quite unreal.For the real is that which
endures.""And you mean to say that the universe will not endure?""The phenomena of the universe, even as
we see it, are in a state of ceaseless change.Birth, growth,
maturity, decay, and death seems to be the law for all things
material."But," again urged Haynerd, "matter itself remains, is indestructible.""Our friend, Doctor Morton, will
corroborate my statement, I am sure.""It is quite true," he said in reply.The discovery, in the past few years, of the
tremendously important fact that matter disintegrates and actually
disappears, has revolutionized all physical science and rendered the
world's text books obsolete.""The radium atom, we find, lasts some
seventeen hundred years, or a trifle longer.What becomes of it when
it is destroyed?We can only say that it disappears from human
consciousness.""And so you reason that the whole material universe will ultimately
disappear from the human consciousness?""Yes," returned Hitt, "I feel certain of it.Let us consider of what
the universe consists.For many months I have been pondering this
topic incessantly.I find that I can agree, in a measure, with those
scientists who regard the physical universe as composed of only a few
elementary constituents, namely, matter, energy, space, and time--"

"Each one of these elements is mental," interrupted Carmen."And the physical universe, even from the
human standpoint, is, therefore, wholly mental.""No," interposed Father Waite; "we see only our mental concept of a
universe, for seeing is wholly a mental process."But now," resumed Hitt, "to get back to the supposed reality of the
physical universe, let us examine its constituents.First, let us
consider its unity established by the harmonious interplay of the
forces permeating it.This great fact is what led Herbert Spencer to
conclude that the universe could have but one creator, one ruler, and
that polytheism was untenable.""We are quite agreed regarding that," said Father Waite."If the
Creator is mind, He is of very necessity infinite and omnipotent;
hence there can be but one Creator."Would it exist, but as a convenience for the human mind?Is
it not really a creation of that mind?And, lastly, is it not merely a
mental concept?""Our consciousness of time," replied Carmen, "is only our awareness of
a continuous series of mental states.""That classifies it exactly," said Hitt, "and renders it wholly
mental."We are accustomed to say,
loosely, that space is that in which we see things about us.But in
what does the process of seeing consist?What I
really mean is that I am conscious of a chair.The process of seeing,
we are told, is this: light, coming from the chair, enters the eye and
casts an image of the chair upon the retina, much as a picture is
thrown upon the ground glass of a camera.Then, in some way, the
little rods and cones--the branching tips of the optic nerve which
project from the retina--are set in motion by the light-waves.This
vibration is in some mysterious manner carried along the optic nerve
to a center in the brain, and--well, then the mind becomes cognizant
of the chair out there, that's all.""Do you mean
to say," she queried, "that, after thousands of years of thought and
investigation, mankind now know nothing more than that about the
process of seeing?""Then all I've got to say," put in Haynerd, "is that the most
remarkable thing about you learned men is your ignorance!""I find it is only the fool who is cocksure," he
replied."Now," said Hitt, resuming the conversation, "let us go a step further
and inquire, first, What is light?since the process of seeing is
absolutely dependent upon it.""Light," offered the doctor, "is vibrations, or wave-motion, so
physicists tell us.""Light, we say, consists of vibrations.Not
vibrations of anything tangible or definitely material, but--well,
just vibrations in the abstract.Now
let us concede that these vibrations in some way get to the brain
center; and then let us ask, Is the mind there, in the brain, awaiting
the arrival of these vibrations to inform it that there is a chair
outside?"Haynerd indulged in a cynical laugh."It is too serious for laughter, my friend," said Hitt."For to such
crude beliefs as this we may attribute all the miseries of mankind.""Simply because these beliefs constitute the general belief in a
universe of matter without and about us.As a plain statement of fact,
_there is no such thing_.But, I ask again, Is the mind within the
brain, waiting for vibrations that will give it information concerning
the external world?Or does the mind, from some focal point without
the brain, look first at these vibrations, and then translate them
into terms of things without?Do these vibrations in some way suggest
form and color and substance to the waiting mind?Does the mind first
look at vibrating nerve-points, and then form its own opinions
regarding material objects?"No," admitted the doctor; "unless we believe that vibrations _per se_
are material.""Now I ask, Is the mind reduced to such slavery that it must depend
upon vibrations for its knowledge of an outside world?""And vibrations of minute pieces of flesh, at that!Flesh that
will some day decay and leave the mind helpless!""Why doesn't the mind look directly at
the chair, instead of getting its knowledge of the chair through
vibrations of bits of meat?Or isn't there any chair out there to look
at?""Now you've put your mental finger upon it.And now we are ready to nail to the cross of ignominy one of the
crudest, most insensate beliefs of the human race._The human mind
gets nothing whatsoever from vibrations, from the human, fleshly eye,
nor from any one of the five so-called physical senses!_ The physical
sense-testimony which mankind believe they receive from the eyes, the
ears, and the other sense organs, can, even at best, consist only of a
lot of disconnected, unintelligible vibrations; and anything that the
mind may infer from such vibrations is inferred _without any outside
authority whatsoever!ejaculated Miss Wall and Haynerd in a breath."And, further," continued Hitt, "we are forced to admit that all that
the mind knows is the contents of itself, of its own consciousness,
and nothing more.Then, instead of seeing, hearing, and feeling real
material objects outside of ourselves, we are in reality seeing,
hearing, and feeling our own mental concepts of things--in other
words, _our own thoughts of things!"_

A deep silence lay for some moments over the little group at the
conclusion of Hitt's words.Then Doctor Morton nodded his acquiescence
in the deduction."And that," he said, "effectually disposes of the
question of space.""There is no space, Doctor," replied Hitt.The human mind sees, hears, and feels nothing but its own
thoughts.These it posits within itself with reference to one another,
and calls the process'seeing material objects in space.'The mind as
little needs a space in which to see things as in which to dream them.I repeat, we do not see external things, or things outside of
ourselves.We see always and only the thoughts that are within our own
mentalities."That's why," murmured Carmen, "Jesus said, 'The kingdom of heaven is
within you.'""Did he not call evil, and all that originates
in matter, the lie about God?I tell you,
the existence of a world outside of ourselves, an objective world
composed of matter, is wholly inferred--it is mental visualizing--and
it is unreal, for it is not based upon fact, upon truth!""Then," queried Haynerd, "our supposed 'outer world' is but our
collection of thought-concepts which we hold within us, within our own
consciousness, eh?""We are ready for that again," replied Hitt."We have said that in the
physical universe all is in a state of incessant change.Since the
physical universe is but a mental concept to each one of us, we must
admit that, were the concept based upon truth, it would not change.Our concept of the universe must be without the real causative and
sustaining principle of all reality, else would it not pass away.And
yet, beneath and behind all these changes, _something_ endures.There is an enduring substance, invisible to human
sight, but felt and known through its own influence.But none of these things is in any sense
material.The material is the fleeting, human concept, composed of
thought that is _not_ based upon reality.These other things, wholly
mental, or spiritual, if you prefer, are based upon that'something'
which does endure, and which I will call the Causative Principle."I think," interposed Doctor Morton at this juncture, "that I can
throw some light upon the immaterial character of matter, if I may so
put it; for even our physical reasoning throws it entirely into the
realm of the mental."The doctor sat for some moments in a deep study.Then he began:

"The constitution of matter, speaking now from an admittedly
materialistic standpoint, that of the physical sciences, is a subject
of vastest interest and importance to mankind, for human existence
_is_ material."The ultimate constituent of matter has been called the atom.But we
have said little when we have said that.The atom was once defined as
a particle of matter so minute as to admit of no further division.That definition has gone to the rubbish heap, for the atom can now be
torn to pieces.But--and here is the revolutionary fact in modern
physical science--_it is no longer held necessary that matter should
consist of material particles!_ In fact, the great potential discovery
of our day is that matter is electrical in composition, that it is
composed of what are called 'electrons,' and that these electrons are
themselves composed of electric charges.It is without weight, bulk, dimensions, or
tangibility.Well, then, it comes dangerously near being a mental
thing, known to the human mind solely by its manifestations, does it
not?And of course our comprehension of it is entirely mental, as is
our comprehension of everything."He paused for a moment, that his words might be fully grasped.Then he
went on:

"Now these atoms, whatever they are, are supposed to join together to
form molecules.Why, it is--well, law, if you please.Then, going a step further,
molecules are held together by cohesion to form material objects,
chairs, trees, coal, and the like."But, Doctor--" interrupted Haynerd."Now we
have the very latest word from our physical scientists regarding the
constitution of matter: _it is composed of electric charges, held
together by law._ Again, you may justly ask: Is matter material--or
mental?"He paused again, and took up a book that lay before him."Here," he continued, "I hold a solid, material, lumpy thing,
composed, you will say, of matter.And yet, in essence, and if we can
believe our scientists, this book is composed of billions of electric
charges--invisible things, without form, without weight, without
color, without extension, held together by law, and making up a
material object which has mass, color, weight, and extension.From
millions of things which are invisible and have no size, we get an
object, visible and extended.""Yet, the doctor is giving the very latest
deductions of the great scientists.""But, Doctor," said Father Waite, "the scientists tell us that they
have experimental evidence in support of the theories which you have
stated regarding the composition of matter.Electricity has been
proven granular, or atomic, in structure.And every electrical
charge consists of an exact number of electrical atoms spread out
over the surface of the charged body."Admitted," said Hitt, taking up the challenge."And their very
calculations and deductions are rapidly wearing away the'materialistic
theory' of matter.You will admit that mathematics is wholly
confined to the realm of mind.It is a strictly mental science, in no
way material.It loses definiteness when 'practically' applied to
material objects.Kant saw this, and declared that a science might be
regarded as further removed from or nearer to perfection in proportion
to the amount of mathematics it contained.Now there has been an
astonishing confirmation of this great truth just lately.At a banquet
given in honor of the discoverer of wireless telegraphy it was stated
that the laws governing the traversing of space by the invisible
electric waves were more exact than the general laws of physics,
where very complex formulas and coefficients are required for
correcting the general laws, due to surrounding material conditions.The greater exactness of laws governing the invisible electric waves
was said to be due to the absence of matter.And it was further
stated that _whenever matter had to be taken into consideration there
could be no exact law of action!"That matter admits of no definite laws," replied Hitt."That there
are no real laws of matter.And that definiteness is attained only as
we dematerialize matter itself.""In other words, get into the realm of the mental?"I have said that we do not
receive any testimony whatsoever through the so-called material
senses, but that we see, hear, feel, taste, and smell our own
thoughts--that is, the thoughts which, from some source, come into our
mentalities.Very well, our scientists show us that, as they get
farther away from dense material thoughts, and deal more and more with
those which have less material structure, less material composition,
their laws become more definite, more exact.Following this out to its
ultimate conclusion, we may say, then, that _only those laws which
have to do with the non-material are perfect_.""And those," said Carmen, "are the laws of mind."And now the history of physical science shows that there has
been a constant deviation from the old so-called fixed 'laws of
matter.'The law of impenetrability has had to go.A great physicist
tells us that, when dealing with sufficiently high speeds, matter has
no such property as impenetrability.The law of indestructibility has had to go.Matter deteriorates and
goes to pieces.The decided
tendency of belief is toward a single element, of which all matter is
composed, and of which the eighty-odd constituent elements of matter
accepted to-day are but modifications.That unit element may be the
ether, of course.And the great Russian chemist, Mendeleef, so
believed.But to us, the ether is a mental thing, a theory.But,
granting its existence, _its universal penetrability renders matter,
as we know it, non-existent_.Everything reduces to the ether, in the
final analysis.And all energy becomes vibrations in and of the
ether.""And the ether," supplemented the doctor, "has to be without mass,
invisible, tasteless, intangible, much more rigid than steel, and at
the same time some six hundred billion times lighter than air, in
order to fulfill all the requirements made of it and to meet all
conditions.""Yes; and yet the ether is a very necessary theory, if we are going to
continue to explain the phenomena of force on a material basis.""Then," said Carmen, "matter reduces to what it really is, the human
mind's _interpretation_ of substance.""Yes," said Hitt, turning to her; "I think you are right; matter is
the way real substance--let us say, spirit--looks to the human
mentality.It is the way the human mind interprets its ideas of
spirit.In other words, the human mind looks at the material thoughts
and ideas which enter it, and calls them solid substance, occupying
space--calls them matter, with definite laws, and, in certain forms,
containing life and intelligence.""And that has been the terrible
mistake of the ages, the one great error, the one lie, that has caused
us all to miss the mark and come short, far short, of the glory of the
mind that is God._There is the origin of the problem of evil!_"

"Undoubtedly," replied Hitt."For evil is in essence but evil thought.The origin of
all evil is matter itself.And matter, we find, is but a mental
concept, a thing of thought."Well," put in Haynerd, who had been twitching nervously in his chair,
"let's get to the conclusion of this very learned discussion.I'm a
plain man, and I'd like to know just where we've landed.What have you
said that I can take home with me?The earth still revolves around the
sun, even if it is a mean mud ball.And I can't see that I can get
along with less than three square meals a day.""We have arrived," replied Hitt gravely, "at a most momentous
conclusion, deduced by the physical scientists themselves, namely,
that _things are not what they seem_.In other words, all things
material seem to reduce to vibrations in and of the ether; the basis
of all materiality is energy, motion, activity--mental things.All the
elements of matter seem to be but modifications of one all-pervading
element.That element is probably the ether, often called the'mother
of matter.'The elements, such as carbon, silicon, and the others, are
not elementary at all, but are forms of one universal element, the
ether.The so-called rare elements are
rare only because their lives are short.They disintegrate rapidly and
change into other forms of the universal element--or disappear.'Atoms
are but fleeting phases of matter,' we are told.They are by no means
eternal, even though they may endure for millions of years.""A great scientist of our own day," Hitt continued, "has said that
'the ether is so modified as to constitute matter, in some way.'Simply that 'visible matter and invisible ether are
one and the same thing.'But to the five so-called physical senses the
ether is utterly incomprehensible.So, then, matter is wholly
incomprehensible to the five physical senses.What is it, then, that
we call matter?It can be nothing more than the human mind's
interpretation of its idea of an all-pervading, omnipresent
_something_, a something which represents substance to it.""Let me add a further quotation from the great physical scientist to
whom you have referred," said the doctor."He has said that the ether
is _not_ matter, but that it is material.And further, that we can not
deny that the ether may have some mental and spiritual functions to
subserve in some other order of existence, as matter has in this.It
is wholly unrelated to any of our senses.The sense of sight takes
cognizance of it, but only in a very indirect and not easily
recognized way.And yet--stupendous conclusion!--_without the ether
there could be no material universe at all_!""In other words," said Hitt, "the whole fabric of the material
universe depends upon something utterly unrecognizable by the five
physical senses.""Then," concluded Hitt, "the physical senses give us no information
whatsoever of a real physical universe about us.""And so," added Father Waite, "we come back to Carmen's statement,
namely, that seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling are
mental processes, in no way dependent upon the outer fleshly organs of
sense--"

"Nonsense!""Why is it, then, that if the eyes
are destroyed we do not see?""Simply, my friend, because of human belief," replied Hitt."The human
mind has been trained for untold centuries to dependence upon beliefs
in the reality of matter, and beliefs in its dependence upon material
modes for sight, hearing, touch, and so on.It is because of its
erroneous beliefs that the human mind is to-day enslaved by matter,
and dependent upon it for its very sense of existence.The human mind
has made its sense of sight dependent upon a frail, pulpy bit of
flesh, the eye.As long as that fleshly organ remains intact, the
human mind sees its sense of sight externalized in the positing of its
mental concepts about it as natural objects.But let that fleshly eye
be destroyed, and the human mind sees its belief of dependence upon
the material eye externalized as blindness.When the fleshly eye is
gone the mind declares that it can no longer see.And what it declares
as truth, as fact, becomes externalized to it.I repeat, the human
mind sees and hears only its thoughts, its beliefs.And holding to
these beliefs, and making them real to itself, it eventually sees them
externalized in what it calls its outer world, its environment, its
universe.And yet, the materialistic scientists themselves show that
the human mind can take no cognizance whatever through the five
physical senses of the all-pervading basis of its very existence, the
ether.it is but a theory which we find necessary
for any intelligible explanation of the farce of human existence on a
material basis."retorted Haynerd, rising and giving expression to his
protest by means of emphatic gestures.You
tell me that the existence of things demands a creator, and I admit
it, for there can be no effect without a cause.Then you say that the
universe is infinite; and I admit that, too, for the science of
astronomy finds no limits to space, and no space unoccupied.You say
that the unity manifested in the universe proves that there can be but
one creator.Moreover, to create an infinite universe there must needs
be an omnipotent creator; and there can be but one who is omnipotent.Further, I can see how that creator must be
mind--infinite mind.And I can see why that mind must be absolutely
perfect, with no intelligence of evil whatsoever, else would it be a
house divided against itself.Now I admit that the universe must be the manifestation, the
expression, of that infinite creative mind.But--and here's the
sticking point--the universe is both good and evil!Hence, the mind
which it manifests is likewise both good and evil--and the whole
pretty theory blows up!"He sat down abruptly, with the air of having given finality to a
perplexing question.All eyes then turned to Carmen, who slowly rose and surveyed the
little group."It is not surprising," she said, smiling at the confused Haynerd,
"that difficulties arise when you attempt to reach God through human
reasoning--spirit through matter.You have taken the unreal, and,
through it, have sought to reach back to the real.""Well," interrupted Haynerd testily, "kindly explain the difference.""Then, first," replied Carmen, "let us adopt some common meeting
ground, some basis which we can all accept, and from which we can
rise.Are you all agreed that, in our every-day life, everything is
mental?--every action?--every object?--and that, as the philosopher
Mill said, 'Everything is a feeling of which the mind is conscious'?Let me illustrate my meaning," she continued, noting Haynerd's rising
protest."I see this book; I take it up; and drop it upon the table.No; I have been conscious of thoughts which
I call a book, nothing more.A real material book did not get into my
mind; but _thoughts_ of a book did.And the activity of such thought
resulted in a state of consciousness--for consciousness is mental
activity, the activity of thought.Remember that, even according to
your great physical scientists, this book is composed of millions of
charges of electricity, or electrons, moving at a tremendously high
rate of speed.And yet, regardless of its composition, I am conscious
only of my thoughts of the book.It is but my thoughts that I see,
after all."She paused and waited for the protest which was not voiced."Very well," she said, continuing; "so it is with the sense of touch;
I had the thought of touching it, and that thought I saw; I was
conscious of it when it became active in my mentality.So with sound;
when I let the book drop, I was conscious of my thought of sound.If
the book had been dropped in a vacuum I should not have been conscious
of a thought of sound--why?Hitt has told us, the
human mind has made its sense-testimony dependent upon vibrations.And
yet, there is a clock ticking up there on the wall."Yes," replied Haynerd; "now that you've called my attention to it.""You hear it when your thought is
directed to it.And yet the air was vibrating all the time, and, if
hearing is dependent upon the fleshly ear, you should have heard it
incessantly when you were not thinking of it, as well as you hear it
now when you are thinking of it."Well, perhaps so," assented Haynerd with some reluctance."We hear, see, and feel," continued the girl, "when our thought is
directed to these processes.And the processes are wholly mental--they
take place within our mentalities--and it is there, within our minds,
that we see, hear, and feel _all_ things.And it is there, within our
minds, that the universe exists for us.It is there that we hold our
world, our fleshly bodies, everything that we call material._The
universe that we think we see all about us consists of the mental
concepts, made up of thought, which we hold within our mentalities_."Carmen proceeded with the
exposition of her theme."Whence come these material thoughts that are within us?They are real to us, at any rate,
are they not?And if they are thoughts of pain and suffering and
death, they are terribly real to us.But let us see, now that we can
reason from the basis of the mental nature of all things.We have
agreed that the creative principle is mind, and we call it God.This
infinite mind constantly expresses and manifests itself in ideas.Why,
that is a fundamental law of mind!You express yourself in your ideas
and thoughts, which you try to externalize materially.But the
infinite mind expresses itself in an infinite number and variety of
ideas, all, like itself, pure, perfect, eternal, good, without any
elements or seeds of decay or discord.And the incessant expression of
the creative mind in and through its numberless ideas constitutes the
never-ending process of creation.""Let me add here," interrupted Hitt, "that the Bible states that God
created the heavens and earth in seven days.But numbers, we must
remember, were mystical things to the ancient Hebrews, and were
largely used symbolically.The number seven, for example, was used to
express wholeness, completeness.So we must remember that its use in
Genesis has a much wider meaning than its absurd theological
interpretation into seven solar days.As Carmen says, the infinite
creative mind can never cease to express itself; creation can never
cease; and creation is but the whole, complete revelation or
unfoldment of infinite mind's ideas.""And infinite mind," continued Carmen, "requires infinite time in
which to completely express itself.So time ceases to be, and we find
that all real things exist now, in an endless present.Now, the ideas
of infinite mind range throughout the realm of infinity, but the
greatest idea that the creative mind can have is the idea of itself.That idea is the image and likeness of the infinite creative mind.It
is the perfect reflection of that mind--its perfect expression.That
idea is what the man Jesus always saw back of the human concept of
man."That's quite a different proposition from
the mud-men that I do business with daily."If they were real," said Carmen, "they would have to be children of
God.But then they would not be'mud-men.'Now I have just spoken of
the real, the spiritual creation.That is the creation mentioned in
the first chapter of Genesis, where all was created--revealed,
unfolded--by God, and He saw that it was perfect, good.'In the
beginning,' says the commentator.That is, 'To begin with--God.'Everything begins with God in the realm of the real.And the creation, or unfoldment, is like its creative
principle, eternal and good.""But," persisted Haynerd, "how about the material man?""Having created all things spiritually," continued the girl, "was it
necessary that the creative mind should repeat its work, do it over
again, and produce the man of dust described in the second chapter of
Genesis?Is that second account of the creation an inspiration of
truth--or a human comment?""Call it what you will," said the cynical Haynerd; "the fact remains
that the mud-man exists and has to be reckoned with.""Both of your premises are wholly incorrect," returned the girl
gently."He does _not_ exist, excepting in human, mortal thought.He
is a product of only such thought.He and his material universe are
seen and dealt with only in such thought.And such thought is the
direct antithesis of God's thought.It is
the supposition, the lie, the mist that went up and darkened the
earth.""Is just what you have said, a hue of a man, a dark hue, the shadowy
opposite which seems to counterfeit the real, spiritual man and claim
all his attributes.He is not a compound of mind and matter, for we
have seen that all things are mental, even matter itself.He is a sort
of mentality, a counterfeit of real mind.His body and his universe
are in himself.And, like all that is unreal, he is transient,
passing, ephemeral, mortal.""No, for he does not exist, excepting in supposition.If so, then not even truth can destroy it.No, the human mind is the
'old man' of Paul.He is to be put off by knowing his nothingness, and
by knowing the unreality of his supposed material environment and
universe.As he goes out of consciousness, the real man, the idea of
God, perfect, harmonious, and eternal, comes in.""And there," said Father Waite impressively, "you have the whole
scheme of salvation, as enunciated by the man Jesus.""There is no doubt of it," added Hitt.how
futile, how base, how worse than childish now appear the whole
theological fabric of the churches, their foolish man-made dogmas,
their insensate beliefs in a fiery hell and a golden heaven.Oh, how
belittling now appear their concepts of God--a God who can damn
unbaptised infants, who can predestine his children to eternal sorrow,
who creates and then curses his handiwork!Do you wonder that sin,
sorrow, and death remain among us while such awful beliefs hold sway
over the human mind?Haynerd, who had been sitting quietly for some moments, deep in
thought, rose and held out his hands, as if in entreaty.It seems--it seems as if a curtain had been raised suddenly.And what I
see beyond is--"

Carmen went swiftly to the man and slipped an arm about him."That
infinite creative Mind, so misunderstood and misinterpreted by human
beings, is back of you," she whispered."But had I not seen the proof in you, no amount of reasoning would
have convinced me."And, bowing to the little group, he went out.said Hitt, turning inquiringly to the doctor."If these things are true," he made answer
slowly, "then I shall have to recast my entire mentality, my whole
basis of thinking.""It is just what you _must_ do, Doctor, if you would work out your
salvation," said Carmen."Jesus said we must repent if we would be
saved.Repentance--the Greek _metanoia_--means a complete and radical
change of thought.""But--do you mean to say that the whole world has been mistaken?That
the entire human race has been deceived for ages?""Why," said Hitt, "it was only in our own day, comparatively speaking,
that the human race was undeceived in regard to the world being round.And there are thousands of human beings to-day who still believe in
witchcraft, and who worship the sun and moon, and whose lives are
wholly under the spell of superstition.Human character, a great
scientist tells us, has not changed since history began.""But we can't revamp our thought-processes!""Then we must go on missing the mark, sinning, suffering, sorrowing,
and dying, over and over and over again, until we decide that we can
do so," said Hitt.The doctor looked at Carmen and met that same smile of unbounded love
which she gave without stint to a sin-weary world."I--I'll come again," he said."Yes," said Carmen, rising and coming around to him."And," in a
whisper, "bring Pat."CHAPTER 6


The Social Era had for many years made its weekly appearance every
Saturday morning, that its fashionable clientele might appease their
jaded appetites on the Sabbath day by nibbling at its spicy pabulum.But, though the Ames reception had fallen on a Saturday night, the
following Friday morning found the columns of the Era still awaiting
a report of the notable affair.Whenever he set his pen to the task, there loomed before him only the
scene in the little waiting room, and he could write of nothing else.He found himself still dwelling upon the awful contrast between the
slender wisp of a girl and her mountainous opponent, as they had stood
before him; and the terrifying thoughts of what was sure to follow in
consequence drenched his skin with cold perspiration.On the desk before him lay the essay which he had asked Carmen to
write during the week, as her report of the brilliant event.He had
read it through three times, and each time had read into it a new
meaning.Not that it ridiculed or condemned--at
least, not openly--but because every one of its crisp comments
admitted of an interpretation which revealed the hidden depths of the
social system, and its gigantic incarnation, as if under the glare of
a powerful searchlight.It was in no sense a muck-raking exposition.Rather, it was an interpretation, and a suggestion.It was, too, a
prediction; but not a curse.The girl loved those about whom she
wrote.And yet, he who read the essay aright would learn that her love
stopped not at the flimsy veil of the flesh, but penetrated until it
rested upon the fair spiritual image beyond.And then Haynerd saw that
the essay was, in substance, a social clinic, to which all searchers
after truth were bidden, that they might learn a great lesson from her
skillful dissection of the human mind, and her keen analysis of its
constituent thought.As he sat wrapped in reflection, the early morning mail was brought
in.He glanced up, and then started to his feet.The letters spread
over his desk like an avalanche of snow; and the puffing mail carrier
declared that he had made a special trip with them alone.Haynerd
began to tear them open, one after another.Then he called the office
boy, and set him at the task.There were more than five hundred of
them, and each contained a canceled subscription to the Social Era.A dark foreboding settled down over Haynerd's mind.He rose and went
to the card-index to consult his subscription list.He
stood confusedly for a moment, then hastened to the window that looked
out upon a fire-escape.He turned
and rushed to the vault, which, reflecting his own habitual
carelessness, was never locked.His ledgers and account books were not
there.Then he crept back to his desk and sank into a chair.The noon mail brought more letters of like nature, until the office
boy tallied nearly eight hundred.Then Haynerd, as if rousing from a
dream, reached for the telephone and summoned Hitt to his rescue.Its mailing list had contained some
fifteen hundred names.The subscription price was twelve dollars a
year--and never, to his knowledge, had it been paid in advance by his
ultra-rich patrons, most of whom were greatly in arrears.Haynerd saw
it all vanishing now as quietly as the mist fades before the summer
sun.Within an hour the wondering Hitt was in conference with him, and
Haynerd had told the story of the theft, of the Ames bribe, and the
encounter following."But," he cried, "can Ames kill my entire
subscription list, and in a single week?""Easily," replied Hitt, "and in any one of several ways.Apparently he
had caused your subscription list and books to be stolen.Or, rather, Ames has lifted it bodily from the sky."Carmen
and I saw him bribe Wales!"Forget all that," he said, laying a hand on the excited
man's arm."Remember, that Wales would never dare breathe a word of
it; Carmen has no reputation or standing whatsoever now in this city;
and Ames would make out a case of blackmail against you so quickly
that it would sweep you right into the Tombs.And first, let
us get the girl herself down here."He took the telephone and called up several of the University
departments, after first ascertaining that she was not at her home.Then, having located her, he plunged into a study of the situation
with the distracted publisher."Here I waste my
evenings in learned philosophical discussions with you people, and
meantime, while we're figuring out that there is no evil, that
monster, Ames, stretches out a tentacle and strangles me!Fine
practical discussions we've been having, ain't they?I tell you, I'm
through with 'em!"He brought his fist down upon the desk with a
crash."Ned," said Hitt, "you're a fool."Here I had a nice, clean
business, no work, good pay--and, just because I associated with you
and that girl, the whole damn thing goes up the flue!Pays to be good,
doesn't it?"H'm; well, Ned, you're not only a fool, but a blooming idiot,"
replied Hitt calmly."And if you run out of
epithets, I'll supply a few!I'm a--"

The door swung open, and Carmen entered, fresh as the sea breeze, and
panting with her haste."Do you know," she began eagerly, "two men
followed me all the way down from the University!They watched me
come in here, and--but, what is wrong with you two?"She stopped and
looked inquiringly from one to the other."Well," began Hitt hesitatingly, "we were reflecting--"

"Reflecting?"We were just holding a wake, that's all," muttered Haynerd.Hitt pushed out a chair for the girl, and bade her sit down.Then he
briefly related the events which had led to her being summoned."And
now," he concluded, "the question is, does Wales know that you and Ned
saw Ames try to bribe him?""I did--last Monday morning, early," answered the wondering girl.ejaculated Haynerd, turning upon Hitt and waving
his arms about."What do you--"

"Hold your tongue, Ned!"Then, to Carmen, "Why did
you tell her?""Why--to save her, and her husband, and babies!"But, to save them, you have ruined Ned," pursued Hitt.The girl turned to Haynerd, who sat doubled up in his chair, the
picture of despair.It was the first time
she had used this name in addressing him.And if you have been pushed out of this business, it is because
it isn't fit for you, and because you've been awakened.You are for
higher, better things than the publishing of such a magazine as the
Social Era.I knew you just couldn't stay at this work.You have got
to go up--"

"Eh!"Haynerd had roused out of his torpor.Yes, I've gone up,
nicely!And I was making ten thousand dollars a year out of it!"I wasn't speaking of money," she said."When I talk, it's in dollars and
cents!""And that's why your talk is mostly nonsense," put in Hitt."The
girl's right, I guess.You've stagnated here long enough, Ned.There's
no such thing as standing still."You now have a grand opportunity," said Carmen, taking his hand."Yes; every trial in this life is an opportunity to prove that there
is no evil," she said."Listen; you have been trained as a publisher.Very well, the world is waiting for the right kind of publications.Oh, I've seen it for a long, long time.The demand is simply
tremendous.Haynerd looked confusedly from Carmen to Hitt."What, exactly, do you mean, Carmen?""Let him publish now a clean magazine, or paper; let him print real
news; let him work, not for rich people's money, but for all people.Why, the press is the greatest educator in the world!But, oh, how it
has been abused!Now let him come out boldly and stand for clean
journalism.Let him find his own life, his own good, in service for
others.""But, Carmen," protested Hitt, "do the people want clean journalism?"It could, if it had the right thought back of it," returned the
confident girl.Haynerd had again lapsed into sulky silence.But Hitt pondered the
girl's words for some moments.She was not the first nor the only one
who had voiced such sentiments.He himself had even dared to hold the
same thoughts, and to read in them a leading that came not from
material ambitions.Then, of a sudden, an idea flamed up in his mind.Hitt's eyes widened with his expanding
thought."Carlson, editor of the Express, wants to sell," he
continued, speaking rapidly."It's a semi-weekly newspaper, printed only for country circulation;
has no subscription list," commented Haynerd, with a cynical shrug of
his shoulders.The abruptness of the strange, apparently irrelevant question
startled the girl."Why," she replied slowly, "as old as--as God."And, as human beings reckon time, eighteen, eh?"Hitt then turned to
Haynerd."How much money can you scrape together, if you sell this lot
of junk?"he asked, sweeping the place with a glance."Five or six thousand, all told, including bank account, bonds, and
everything, I suppose," replied Haynerd mechanically."Carlson wants forty thousand for the Express.I'm not a rich man, as
wealth is estimated to-day, but--well, oil is still flowing down in
Ohio.It isn't the money--it's--it's what's back of the cash."Carmen reached over and laid a hand on his arm."We can do it," she
whispered.Hitt hesitated a moment longer, then sprang to his feet."I've pondered and studied this scheme for a year,
but I've only to-day seen the right help.That is your tremendous,
driving thought," he said, turning to Carmen."That thought is a
spiritual dynamite, that will blast its way through every material
obstacle!Ned," seizing Haynerd by the shoulder and shaking him out of
his chair, "rouse up!Now I'll 'phone Carlson
right away and make an appointment to talk business with him.Haynerd blinked for a few moments, like an owl in the light.But then,
as a comprehension of Hitt's plan dawned upon his waking thought, he
straightened up.The clientele of the Express will not be made up
of his puppets!"But--your University work, Hitt?""I was only biding my time," she replied gently.Tears began to trickle slowly down Haynerd's cheeks, as the tension in
his nerves slackened.He rose and seized the hands of his two friends."Hitt," he said, in a choking voice, "I--I said I was a fool.The real man has waked up, and--well, what are you
standing there for, you great idiot?*       *       *       *       *

Again that evening the little group sat about the table in the dining
room of the Beaubien cottage.But only the three most directly
concerned, and the Beaubien, knew that the owner of the Express had
received that afternoon an offer for the purchase of his newspaper,
and that he had been given twenty-four hours in which to accept it.Doctor Morton was again present; and beside him sat his lifelong
friend and jousting-mate, the very Reverend Patterson Moore.Hitt
took the floor, and began speaking low and earnestly."We must remember," he said, "in conjunction with what we have deduced
regarding the infinite creative mind and its manifestations, that we
mortals in our daily mundane existence deal only and always with
phenomena, with appearances, with effects, and never with ultimate
causes.And so all our material knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only.Of the ultimate essence of things, the human mind
knows nothing.A phenomenon may be
so-and-so with regard to another; but that either is absolute truth we
can not affirm.And yet--mark this well--as Spencer says, 'Every one
of the arguments by which the relativity of our knowledge is
demonstrated distinctly postulates the positive existence of something
beyond the relative.'""It is a primitive statement of what is sometimes called the 'Theory
of suppositional opposites'", replied Hitt."It means that to every
reality there is the corresponding unreality.For every truth there
may be postulated the supposition.We can not, as the great
philosopher says, conceive that our knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only, without at the same time conceiving a reality of
which they are appearances.He further amplifies this by saying that
'every positive notion--the concept of a thing by what it is--suggests
a negative notion--the concept of a thing by what it is not.But,
though these mutually suggest each other, _the positive alone is
real_.'For, interpreted, it means: we
must deny the seeming, or that which appears to human sense, in order
to see that which is real."exclaimed Miss Wall, glancing about to note the
effect of the speaker's words on the others.But Carmen nodded her thorough agreement, and added: "Did not Jesus
say that we must deny ourselves?Why, the self that
appears to us, the matter-man, the dust-man, the man of the second
chapter of Genesis.We must deny his reality, and know that he is
nothing but a mental concept, formed out of suppositional thought, out
of dust-thought."Undoubtedly correct," said Hitt, turning to Carmen."But, before we
consider the astonishing teachings of Jesus, let us sum up the
conclusions of philosophy.To begin with, then, there is a First
Cause, omnipotent and omnipresent, and of very necessity perfect.That
Cause lies back of all the phenomena of life; and, because of its real
existence, there arises the suppositional existence of its opposite,
its negative, so to speak, which is unreal.The phenomena of human
existence have to do _only_ with the suppositional existence of the
great First Cause's opposite.They are a reflection of that
supposition.Hence all human knowledge of an external world is but
phenomenal, and consists of appearances which have no more real
substance than have shadows._We, as mortals, know but the shadowy,
phenomenal existence._ _We do not know reality._ _Therefore, our
knowledge is not real knowledge, but supposition._

"Now," he went on hastily, for he saw an expression of protest on
Reverend Moore's face, "we are more or less familiar with a phenomenal
existence, with appearances, with effects; and our knowledge of these
is entirely mental.These thoughts, such
as feeling, seeing, hearing, and so on, we ignorantly attribute to the
five physical senses.This is what Ruskin calls the 'pathetic
fallacy.'And because we do so, we find ourselves absolutely dependent
upon these senses--in belief.Moreover, quoting Spencer again, only
the absolutely real is the absolutely persistent, or enduring.The truth of the multiplication table will endure
eternally."No," admitted Miss Wall, speaking for the others."And, as regards material objects which we seem to see and touch,"
went on Hitt, "we appear to see solidity and hardness, and we conceive
as real objects what are only the mental signs or indications of
objects.Remember, matter does not and can not get into the mind.Only
thoughts and ideas enter our mentalities.We see our _thoughts_ of
hardness, solidity, and so on; and these thoughts point to something
that is real.I repeat: _the ideas of the
infinite creative Mind_.The thoughts of size, shape, hardness, and so
on, which we group together and call material chairs, trees,
mountains, and other objects, are but'relative realities,' pointing
to the absolute reality, infinite mind and its eternal ideas and
thoughts."But all seemed absorbed in his
statements.Then he resumed:

"Our concept of matter, which is now proven to be but a mental
concept, built up out of false thought, points to _mind_ as the real
substance.Our concept of measurable space and distance is the direct
opposite of the great truth that infinite mind is ever-present.Our
concept of time is the opposite of infinity.Age is the opposite of eternity--and the old-age thought
brings extinction.So, _to every reality there is the corresponding
unreality_.If the infinite creative
mind is good--and we saw that by very necessity it _must_ be so--then
evil becomes an awful unreality, and is real only to the false thought
which entertains or holds it.If life is real--and infinite mind must
itself be life--then death becomes the opposite unreality.And, as
Jesus said, it can be overcome.But were it real, _no power_, _divine
or human_, _could ever overcome or destroy it_!""Seems to me," remarked Haynerd dryly, "that our study so far simply
goes to show, as Burke puts it, 'what shadows we are and what shadows
we pursue.'""When the world humiliates itself to the point that it
will accept that, my friend," he said, "then it will become receptive
to truth."But now let us go a little further," he went on."The great Lamarck
voiced a mighty fact when he said, 'Function precedes structure.'For
by that we mean that the egg did not produce the bird, but the bird
the egg.The world seems about to pass from the very foolish belief
that physical structure is the cause of life, to the great fact that a
_sense_ of life produces the physical structure.The former crude
belief enslaved man to his body.The latter tends to free him from
such slavery.""You see, Doctor," interrupted Carmen, "the brain which you were
cutting up the other day did not make poor Yorick's mind and thought,
but his mind made the brain."The doctor smiled and shook a warning finger at the girl."The body," resumed Hitt, "is a manifestation of the human mind's
activity.What constitutes the difference between a bird and a steam
engine?This, in part: the engine is made by human hands from without;
the bird makes itself, that is, its body, from within.But the ignorant human mind--ignorant _per se_--falls
a slave to its own creation, the mental concept which it calls its
physical body, and which it pampers and pets and loves, until it can
cling to it no longer, because the mental concept, not being based on
any real principle, is forced to pass away, having nothing but false
thought to sustain it.""But now," interposed Haynerd, who was again waxing impatient, "just
what is the practical application of all this abstruse reasoning?""The very greatest imaginable, my friend," replied Hitt.And so matter can not become non-existent _unless it
is already nothing_!The world is beginning to recognize the
tremendous fact that from nothing nothing can be made.Very well,
since the law of the conservation of energy seems to be established as
regards energy _in toto_, why, we must conclude that there is no such
thing as _annihilation_.And that means that _there is no such thing
as absolute creation_!The shadow
never was real, and does not exist.And so creation becomes unfolding,
or revelation, or development, of what already exists, and has always
existed, and always will exist.Therefore, if matter, and all it
includes as concomitants, evil, sin, sickness, accident, chance, lack,
and death, is based upon unreal, false thought, then it can all be
removed, put out of consciousness, by a knowledge of truth and a
reversal of our accustomed human thought-processes.""And that," said Carmen, "is salvation.It is based on righteousness,
which is right-thinking, thinking true thoughts, and thinking truly.""And knowing," added Hitt, "that evil, including matter, is the
suppositional opposite of truth.The doctrine of materialism has been
utterly disproved even by the physicists themselves.For physicists
have at last agreed that inertia is the great essential property of
matter.That is, matter is not a cause, but an effect.It does not
operate, but is operated upon.It is not a law-giver, but is subject
to the human mind's so-called laws concerning it.It of itself is
utterly without life or intelligence."Now Spencer said that matter was a
manifestation of an underlying power or force.Physicists tell us that
matter is made of electricity, that it is an electrical phenomenon,
and that the ultimate constituent of matter is the electron.The
electron is said by some to be made up of superimposed layers of
positive and negative electricity, and by others to be made up of only
negative charges.I rather prefer the latter view, for if composed of
only negative electricity it is more truly a negation.Matter is the
_negative_ of real substance.Hence matter is a form of
energy also.But our comprehension of it is _wholly mental_.The only real energy there is or can be is the energy of the
infinite mind we call God.This the human mind copies, or imitates,
by reason of what has been called 'the law of suppositional
opposites,' already dwelt upon at some length.Gravitation is regarded by some physicists as the negative aspect of
radiation-pressure, the latter being the pressure supposed to be
exerted by all material bodies upon one another.The third law of
motion illustrates this so-called law, for it states that action
and reaction are equal and opposite.There can be no positive action
without a resultant negative one.The divine
mind, God, has His opposite in the communal human, or mortal, mind.The latter is manifested by the so-called minds which we call mankind.And from these so-called minds issue matter and material forms and
bodies, with their so-called material laws."Yes, the material universe is running down.The
entire human concept is running down.Matter, the human mental
concept, is not eternally permanent.Neither, therefore, are its
concomitants, sin and discord.Matter disintegrates and passes
away--out of human consciousness.The whole material universe--the
so-called mortal-mind concept--is hastening to its death!""But as yet I think you have not given Mr.Haynerd the practical
application which he asks," suggested Father Waite, as Hitt paused
after his long exposition."I am now ready for that," replied Hitt."We have said that the
material is the relative.But,
that being so, we can go a step further and add that human error is
likewise relative.And now--startling fact!--_it is absolutely
impossible to really know error_!""Can you know that two plus two
equals seven?""Let me make this statement of truth: nothing can be known definitely
except as it is explained by the principle which governs it.Now what
principle governs an error, whether that error be in music,
mathematics, or life conduct?"And that
is why God--infinite Mind--can not behold evil.And now, friends, I
have come to the conclusion of a long series of deductions.If
infinite mind is the cause and creator, that is, the revealer, of all
that really exists, its suppositional opposite, its negative, must
likewise simulate a creation, or revelation, or unfolding, for this
opposite must of very necessity pose as a creative principle.It must
simulate all the powers and attributes of the infinite creative mind.If the creative mind gave rise to a spiritual universe and spiritual
man, by which it expresses itself, then this suppositional opposite
must present its universe and its man, opposite in every particular to
the reality._It is this sort of man and this sort of universe that
we, as mortals, seem to see all about us, and that we refer to as
human beings and the physical universe._ And yet, all that we see,
feel, hear, smell, or taste is the false, suppositional thought that
comes into our so-called mentalities, and by its suppositional
activity there causes what we call consciousness or awareness of
things.""Then," said Father Waite, more to enunciate his own thought than to
question the deduction, "what the human consciousness holds as
knowledge is little more than belief and speculation, with no basis of
truth, no underlying principle."And it brings out the fruits of such beliefs in discord,
decay, and final dissolution, called death.For this human consciousness
forms its own concept of a fleshly body, and a mind-and-matter man.It
makes the laws which govern its body, and it causes its body to obey
these false laws.Upon the quality of thought entering this human
consciousness depend all the phenomena of earthly life and environment
which the mortal experiences.The human consciousness, in other words,
is a _self-centered mass of erroneous thought, utterly without any basis
of real principle, but actively engaged in building up mental images,
and forming and maintaining an environment in which it supposes
itself to live_._This false thought in the human consciousness forms
into a false concept of man, and this is the soul-and-body man, the
mind-and-matter man, which is called a human being, or a mortal._"

"And there," commented Carmen, with a dreamy, far-away look, "we have
what Padre Jose so long ago spoke of as the 'externalization of
thought.'It is the same law which Jesus had in mind when he said, 'As
a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.'""For we know only what enters our mentalities and
becomes active there.And every thought that does so enter, tends at
once to become externalized.That is, there is at once the tendency
for us to see it visualized in some way, either as material object, or
environment, or on our bodies.And it is the very activity of such
thought that constitutes the human mentality, as I have already
said.""And that thought is continually changing," suggested Father Waite.Its very lack of true principle requires that it should
change constantly, in order to simulate as closely as possible the
real.That accounts for the fleeting character of the whole human
concept of man and the physical universe.The human personality is
never fixed, although the elements of human character remain; that is,
those elements which are essentially unreal and mortal, such as lust,
greed, hatred, and materiality, seem to remain throughout the ages.They will give way only before truth, even as Paul said.But not until
truth has been admitted to the human mentality and begins its solvent
work there, the work of denying and tearing down the false
thought-concepts and replacing them with true ones.""And will truth come through the physical senses?"Their supposed testimony is the material thought which enters
the human mentality and becomes active there, resulting in human
consciousness of both good and evil.And that thought will have to
give way to true thought, before we can begin to put off the 'old man'
and put on the 'new.'Human thoughts, or, as we say, the physical
senses, do not and can not testify of absolute truth.exclaimed Haynerd, rousing up."There goes the Church, and
original sin, and fallen man!""There is no such thing as 'fallen man,' my friend," said Hitt
quietly."The spiritual man, the image and likeness, the reflection,
of the infinite creative mind, is perfect as long as its principle
remains perfect--and that is eternally.He is a product of false, suppositional thought.He did not fall, because he has had no perfection
to lose."Reverend Patterson Moore, who had sat a silent, though not wholly
sympathetic listener throughout the discussion, could now no longer
withhold his protest."No wonder," he abruptly exclaimed, "that there
are so few deep convictions to-day concerning the great essentials of
Christianity!As I sit here and listen to you belittle God and rend
the great truths of His Christ, as announced in His Word, the Bible, I
am moved by feelings poignantly sorrowful!The Christ has once been
crucified; and will you slay him again?""No," said Carmen, her eyes dilating with surprise, "but we would
resurrect him!Don't you think you have kept him in the tomb long
enough?The Christ-principle is intended for use, not for endless
burial!"My dear Miss Carmen, it is I who preach the risen Christ!""And
because of centuries of such preaching the world has steadily sunk
from the spiritual to the material, and lip service has taken the
place of that genuine spiritual worship which knows no evil, and
which, because of that practical knowledge, heals the sick and raises
the dead.""No, I state facts," said Carmen."Paul made some mistakes, for he was
consumed with zeal.But he stated truth when he said that the second
coming of Christ would occur when the 'old man' was put off.We have
been discussing the 'old man' to-night, and showing how he may be put
off.Now do you from your pulpit teach your people how that may be
done?""I teach the vicarious atonement of the Christ, and prepare my flock
for the world to come," replied the minister with some heat."But I am interested in the eternal present," said the girl, "not in a
suppositional future.'I am that which is, and which was, and which is to come,' says
the infinite, ever-present mind, God!""I see no Christianity whatsoever in your speculative philosophy,"
retorted the minister."If what you say is true, and the world should
accept it, all that we have learned in the ages past would be blotted
out, and falsehood would be written across philosophy, science, and
religion.By wafting evil lightly aside as unreal, you dodge the
issue, and extend license to all mankind to indulge it freely.Evil is
an awful, a stupendous fact!And it can not be relegated to the realm
of shadow, as you are trying to do!""You know, Duns Scotus
said: 'Since there is no real being outside of God, evil has no
substantial existence.Perfection and reality are synonyms, hence
absolute imperfection is synonymous with absolute unreality.'And do you really think he looked upon
evil as a _reality_?""Then, if that is true," said the girl, "I will have to reject him.But come, we are right up to the point of discussing him and his
teachings, and that will be the subject of our next meeting.It is love, you know, that has drawn us all
together."It's an open forum, Moore," said the doctor, patting him on the back."Wisdom isn't going to die with you."I am quite well satisfied with my present one, Doctor," replied the
minister tartly."Well, then, come and correct us when we err.It's your duty to save
us if we're in danger, you know.""And now, Carmen, the piano awaits you.By
the way, what did Maitre Rossanni tell you?""Oh," replied the girl lightly, "he begged me to let him train me for
Grand Opera.""He said I would make a huge fortune," she laughed."I told him I carried my wealth with me, always, and that my fortune
was now so immense that I couldn't possibly hope to add to it."Hitt," she said, going to him and looking up into his
face, "I am too busy for Grand Opera and money-making.I couldn't be happy if I made people pay to hear
me sing."With that she turned and seated herself at the piano, where she
launched into a song that made the very Reverend Patterson Moore raise
his glasses and stare at her long and curiously.CHAPTER 7


Man reasons and seeks human counsel; but woman obeys her instincts.Her life had been one of utter freedom from
dependence upon human judgment.The burden of decision as to the
wisdom of a course of action rested always upon her own thought.Never
did she seek to make a fellow-being her conscience.When the day of
judgment came, the hour of trial or vital demand, it found her
standing boldly, because her love was made perfect, not through
instinct alone, but through conformity with the certain knowledge that
he who lacks wisdom may find it in the right thought of God and man.And so, when on the next day she joined Hitt and Haynerd in the office
of the Social Era, and learned that Carlson had met their terms,
eagerly, and had transferred to them the moribund Express, she had no
qualms as to the wisdom of the step which they were taking.Haynerd was a composite picture of doubt
and fear, as he sat humped up in his chair.Hitt was serious to the
point of gloom, reflecting in a measure his companion's dismal
forebodings."I was scared to death for fear he wouldn't sell," Haynerd was saying
as the girl entered; "and I was paralyzed whenever I thought that he
would."Carmen laughed aloud when she heard these words."Do you know," she
said, "you remind me of Lot's wife.She was told to go ahead, along
the right course.But she looked back--alas for her!Now you two being
started right are looking back; and you are about to turn to salt
tears!"Now listen," she continued, as Haynerd began to remonstrate; "don't
voice a single fear to me!You couldn't make me believe them true even
if you argued for weeks--and we have no time for such foolishness
now.The first thing that you have got to do, Ned, is to start a
little cemetery.In it you must bury your fears, right away, and
without any mourning.Put up little headstones, if you wish; but don't
ever go near the place afterward, excepting to plant the insults, and
gibes, and denouncements, and vilifications which the human mind will
hurl at you, once the Express starts out on its new career.Good is
bound to stir up evil; and the Express is now in the business of good.Remember, the first thing the Apostles always did was to be afraid.And they kept Jesus busy pointing out the nothingness of their
fears.""I guess we'll find
ourselves a bit lonely in it, too!""True, humanly speaking," replied the girl, taking a chair beside him."But, Ned, let me tell you of the most startling thing I have found in
this great, new country.It is this: you Americans have, oh, so much
animal courage--and so little true moral courage!You know that the
press is one of the most corrupt institutions in America, don't you?Going into thousands of homes every day, it is
a deadlier menace than yellow fever.You know that it is muzzled by
so-called religious bodies, by liquor interests, by vice-politicians,
by commercialism, and its own craven cowardice.And yet, Ned, despite
your heart-longing, you dare not face the world and stand boldly for
righteousness in the conduct of the Express!"Now," she went on hurriedly, "let me tell you more.While you have
been debating with your fears as you awaited Mr.Carlson's decision, I
have been busy.If I had allowed my mentality to become filled with
fear and worry, as you have done, I would have had no room for real,
constructive thought.But I first thanked God for this grand
opportunity to witness to Him; and then I put out every mental
suggestion of failure, of malicious enmity from the world, and from
those who think they do not love us, and with it every subtle argument
about the unpreparedness of the human mind for good.After that I set
out to visit various newspaper offices in the city.I have talked with
four managing and city editors since yesterday noon.I have their
viewpoints now, and know what motives animate them.I know, in part, what the Express will have to meet--and how to
meet it."Both men stared at her in blank amazement.Haynerd's jaw dropped as he
gazed.He had had a long apprenticeship in the newspaper field, but
never would he have dared attempt what this fearless girl had just
done."I have found out what news is," Carmen resumed."It is wholly _a
human invention_!It is the published vagaries of the carnal mind.In
the yellow journal it is the red-inked, screaming report of the
tragedies of sin.Fallom if he knew anything about mental
laws, and the terrible results of mental suggestion in his paper's
almost hourly heralding of murder, theft, and lust.But he only
laughed and said that the lurid reports of crime tended to keep people
alive to what was going on about them.He couldn't see that he was
making a terrible reality of every sort of evil, and holding it so
constantly before an ignorant, credulous world's eyes that little else
could be seen.The moral significance of his so-called news reports
had no meaning whatsoever for him!"asked Haynerd, not believing that she would
have dared visit that journalistic demon."Yes," answered the girl, to his utter astonishment.Adams said
he had no time for maudlin sentimentalism or petticoat sophistry.He
was in the business of collecting and disseminating news, and he
wanted that news to go _shrieking_ out of his office!You can see how the report of an Italian
wife-murder shrieks in red letters an inch high on the very first
page.Or has
he further prostituted journalism by this ignorant act?""The people want it, Carmen," said Hitt slowly, though his voice
seemed not to sound a real conviction."If the church and the
press were not mortally and morally blind, they would see the deadly
destruction which they are accomplishing by shrieking from pulpit and
sanctum: 'Evil is real!Pietro Lasanni cuts his wife's throat!"But, Carmen, while what you say is doubtless true, it must be
admitted that the average man, especially the day laborer, reads his
yellow journal avidly, and--"

"Yes, he does," returned the girl.The average man, as
you call him, is a victim of _the most pernicious social system
ever devised by the human mind_!Swept along in the mad rush of
commercialism, or ground down beneath its ruthless wheels, his
jaded, jarred nerves and his tired mind cry out for artificial
stimulation, for something that will for a moment divert his wearied
thought from his hopeless situation.The Church offers him little
that is tangible this side of the grave.But whiskey, drugs, and
yellow journalism do.Hitt--can't you, Ned--that
the world's cry for sensationalism is but a cry for something that
will make it forget its misery for a brief moment?The average man
feels the superficiality of the high speed of this century of mad
rush; he longs as never before for a foundation of truth upon which to
rest; he is tired of theological fairy-tales; he is desperately
tired of sin, and sickness, and dying.He cares little about a
promised life beyond the grave.He wants help here and now to solve
his problems.Little beyond a recount
of his own daily miseries, and reports of graft and greed, and
accounts of vulgar displays of material wealth that he has not and
can not have.And these reports divert his jaded mind for a moment and
give him a false, fleeting sense of pleasure--and then leave him
sunk deeper than before in despair, and in hatred of existing
conditions!""The girl is right," said Hitt, turning to Haynerd."And we knew it,
of course.This steam-calliope
age reflects the human-mind struggle for something other than its own
unsatisfying ideas.It turns to thrills; it expresses its restlessness
and dissatisfaction with itself by futurist and cubist art, so-called;
by the rattle and vibration of machinery; by flaring billboards that
insult every sense of the artistic; and by the murk and muck of yellow
journalism, with its hideous  supplements and spine-thrilling
tales.But the publisher himself--well, he
battens materially, of course, upon the tired victims of our degrading
social system.He sees but the sordid revenue in dollars and cents."And they can't," said Haynerd."Decent journalism wouldn't
pay--doesn't--never did!Other papers have tried it, and miserably
failed!""Then," returned Hitt calmly, after a moment's reflection, "oil will
meet the deficit.As long as my paternal wells flow in Ohio the
Express will issue forth as a clean paper, a dignified, law-supporting
purveyor to a taste for better things--even if it has to create that
taste.Its columns will be closed to salacious sensation, and its
advertising pages will be barred to vice, liquor, tobacco, and
drugs.""And now we've got to get right down to
business.""Just so," said Hitt, rising."It is my intention to issue the Express
one more week on its present basis, and then turn it into a penny
morning daily.I'm going to assume the management myself, with you, Carmen, as
my first assistant."But, first, how far may
I go?""The limit," replied Hitt, rubbing his hands together."You are my
brain, so to speak, henceforth.As to financial resources, I am
prepared to dump a hundred thousand dollars right into the Express
before a cent of revenue comes back.""Another question, then: will you issue a Sunday edition?""For a while, yes," he said."We'll see how it works, for I have some
ideas to try out.""Well, then," resumed the girl eagerly, "I want this paper to be for
_all_ the people; to be independent in the truest sense of the term;
and to be absolutely beyond the influence of political and religious
sectarianism--you'll soon enough learn what that will cost you--to be
an active, constructive force in this great city, and a patient,
tireless, loving educator."grunted Haynerd, although he was listening very carefully."The Express will succeed," the girl went on, without noticing him,
"because our thought regarding it is successful._We_ have already
succeeded; and that success will be externalized in our work.It makes
no difference what the people may think of _us_; but it makes a lot of
difference what _we_ think of _them_ and _ourselves_.We assume superiority over adverse conditions, and we
claim success, because we know that these things are mental, and that
they are divinely ours.Lot's wife didn't have the sort of confidence
that wins--she looked back.But
there is no doubt of the outcome.And so there is no doubt lurking in
us to take the edge off our efforts, is there?The thought regarding
the Express has not been timidly born within us; it has come forth
flashing vigor!Yes it has, Ned, despite your doubts!And we have
within us a power mightier than any force outside of us.That is the
knowledge of infinite mind's omnipotence, and our ability to use the
Christ-principle to meet _every_ problem.Haynerd began to rouse up with a returning sense of confidence.Hitt
smiled and nodded to Carmen.The girl went on rapidly and eagerly:

"We are going to give the people news from a new standpoint, aren't
we?We are not going on the assumption that the report of mankind's
errors is the report of real news.The only thing that is really new
is _good_.Adams's office two
items came in over the 'phone.One was the report of a jewel robbery,
and the other was an announcement of the draining by the Government of
submerged lands in Louisiana, so as to give an additional opportunity
to those seeking farms.Adams put in bold type on
the front page?I was unable to locate the latter
anywhere in the paper, although it was a timely bit of news.""Now another thing," continued the girl, "I want the Sunday edition of
the Express to contain a resume of the important and vital news of the
week, with the very clearest, most impartial and enlightening
editorial comment upon it.This calls for nice discrimination in the
selection of those items for our comment.It means, however, the best
practical education for the people.This was John Ruskin's idea, and
certainly is a splendid one.Still another thing, the Express will
stand shoulder to shoulder with the women for equal suffrage."It is the women who will clean up
and regenerate this world, not the men.Reform is now in the hands of
the women.And India proves that
backward women mean a backward nation.""Then," continued Carmen, "make a distinct Women's Department in the
Express, and put Miss Wall on the staff.""A daily educational department for foreigners, our immigrants, giving
them every possible aid in suggestions regarding their naturalization,
the languages, hotels, boarding houses, employment, and so on.""The Express is going to maintain a social service, and night schools.It is going to establish vacation and permanent homes for girls.It is
going to provide for vocational training.It is going to establish a
lecture bureau--for lectures on _good_.It is going to build a model
city for workingmen.Then it is going to found a model city for
everybody.It is going to establish clubs and meeting places for
workingmen, places where they may meet, and play games, and read, and
have social intercourse, and practical instruction.It is going to
establish the same for young boys.It is going to take the lead for
civic betterment in this city, and for child-welfare, and for--"

By this time Haynerd was sitting erect and staring in bewilderment at
the girl."Aren't you wandering
somewhat beyond strict newspaper limits?"And haven't I told you," returned the girl promptly, "that the only
thing new in this world is _good_?Our news is going to be _good_
news--the collection and dissemination of _good_ to all mankind.People who read our paper will no longer feel that it is dangerous to
be alive, but a glorious privilege.Hitt said I could go the limit, you know."Hitt had caught the girl's infectious enthusiasm, and his face was
beaming."It's your unlimited thought, Carmen, that
we old dry-bones want!What is anything in this life, compared with real
service to our fellow-men?_The Express is not in business to make
money!_ It is in the business of collecting and scattering the news of
good.Its dividends will be the happiness and joy it gives to mankind.For _good is the greatest success there
is_!"It is likely that Hitt did not catch the full meaning of the girl's
words; and it is certain that Haynerd did not.But her boundless
enthusiasm did penetrate in large degree into their souls, and they
ceased to insist on the query, Will it pay?The broader outlook was
already beginning to return profits to these men, as the newer
definition of 'news' occupied their thought.Seizing their hats, they bade Carmen go with them to inspect the plant
of the Express, and meet its staff."There's a question I'd like to ask," said Haynerd, as they pursued
their way toward their recent purchase."I want to know what our
editorial policy will be.Do we condone the offenses of our grafters
and spoilsmen by remaining silent regarding their crimes?"We will let their guilt expose and kill itself," quickly returned
Carmen.A few minutes later they entered the gloomy, dust-laden offices of the
Express.Hitt's spirits sank again as he looked about him.But Carmen
seemed to suffer no loss of enthusiasm.After a mental appraisal of
the dingy, uninviting environment she exclaimed: "Well, one nice thing
about this is that we don't have much to start with!"Hitt reflected upon her cryptical remark, and then laughed.It was evident that the sale of
his plant had removed a heavy load from his shoulders."My best reporter was out yesterday when you called," he said,
addressing Hitt."He--well, he was a little the worse for wear.Come into my office and I'll send for him."In a few minutes a tall, boyish fellow responded to the editor's
summons.He must have been well under twenty, thought Hitt, marveling
that so young a man should be regarded as Carlson's best news
gatherer.But his wonder grew apace when the editor introduced him as
Mr.The lad smiled pallidly, as he bent his gaze upon Carmen, and
addressed his reply to her."My governor," he said laconically.returned Haynerd, beginning to bristle.Carlson dismissed the reporter, and turned to the curious group."The boy has the making of a fine newspaper man in him.Has something
of his father's terrible energy.He used to come down here before his father threw him out.I
let him write little articles for the Express when he was barely
sixteen years old; and they were mighty good, too.But he got mixed up
in some scandal, and J. Wilton cut him off.The boy always did drink,
I guess.But since his family troubles he's been on the straight road
to the insane asylum."His father is no
friend of mine, and--"

"We _shall_ keep him," calmly interrupted Carmen."His father is a
_very_ good friend of mine."Carlson looked from one to the other quizzically."Well," squinting over his glasses at the girl, "this surely is
woman's era, isn't it?"*       *       *       *       *

A week later the Express, scarcely recognizable in its clean, fresh
type and modest headlines, with its crisp news and well written
editorials, very unostentatiously made its entry into the already
crowded metropolitan field.Adams picked it up and
laughed, a short, contemptuous laugh.Fallom glanced over it and
wondered.J. Wilton Ames, who had been apprised of its advent, threw
it into the waste basket--and then drew it out again.He re-read the
editorial announcing the policy of the paper.From that he began a
careful survey of the whole sheet.His eye caught an article on the
feminist movement, signed by Carmen Ariza.His lip curled, but he read
the article through, and finished with the mental comment that it was
well written."I want this sheet carefully watched," he commanded, tossing the paper
to his secretary."If anything is noticed that in any way refers to me
or my interests, call my attention to it immediately."A moment afterward Henry Claus,
nominal head of the great Claus brewing interests, was ushered in.cried the newcomer, rushing
forward and clasping the financier's hand."The city council last
night voted against the neighborhood saloon license bill!"Yes," commented the laconic Ames."Our aldermen are a very
intelligent lot of statesmen, Claus.They're wise enough to see that
their jobs depend upon whiskey.It requires very astute statesmanship,
Claus, to see that.But some of our congressmen and senators have
learned the same thing."The brewer pondered this delphic utterance and scratched his head."Well," continued Ames, "have you your report?""Sales
less than last month," he remarked dryly."It's the local option law what done it, Mr.Ames," replied the brewer
apologetically."Them women--"

"Bah!Let a few petticoats whip you, eh?But, anyway, you don't know
how to market your stuff.Look here, Claus, you've got to encourage
the young people more.We've got to get the girls and boys.If we get
the girls, we'll get the boys easily enough.It's the same in the
liquor business as in certain others, Claus, you've got to land them
young."Ames, I can't take 'em and pour it down their throats!""You could if you knew how," returned Ames.if I had
nothing else to do I'd just like to devote myself to the sales end of
the brewing business.I'd use mental suggestion in such a way through
advertising that this country would drown in beer!Beer is just plain
beer to you dull-wits.But suppose we convinced people that it was a
food, eh?Advertise a chemical analysis of it, showing that it has
greater nutriment than beef.Catch the clerks and poor stenographers
that way.Don't call it beer; call it Maltdiet, or something like
that.Why, we couldn't begin to supply the demand!""Billboards in every field and along all railroads and highways;
boards in every vacant lot in every town and city in the country;
electric signs everywhere; handbills; lectures--never thought of that,
did you?And samples--why, I'd put samples into every house in the
Union!I'd give away a million barrels of beer--and sell a hundred
million as a result!But I'd work particularly with the young people.Work on them with literature and suggestion; they're more receptive
than adults.The hypnotism that works through suggestive advertising,
Claus, is simply omnipotent!"We have all the papers, excepting the Express, Mr.You can
afford to pass it up.It's run by a college professor and a doll-faced
girl."Ames, our advertising manager tells me that the publishers
of the Express called a meeting of the managers of all the other city
papers, to discuss cutting out liquor advertising, and that since then
the rates have gone up, way up!You see, the example set by the
Express may--"

"Humph!"An example, backed by
absolute fearlessness--and he knew from experience that the publishers
of the Express were without fear--well, it could not be wholly
ignored, even if the new paper had no circulation worth the name.Ames," resumed the brewer, "the Express is in every newsstand in
the city.It's in every hotel, in every
saloon, in every store and business house here.It
isn't sold, it's given away!"Leave it to me, Claus," he said at length, dismissing the brewer."I'll send for you in a day or so."*       *       *       *       *

It was well after midnight when the little group assembled in the
dining room of the Beaubien cottage to resume their interrupted
discussions.Hitt and Haynerd were the last to arrive.With him had come, not without
some reluctance, his prickly disputant, Reverend Patterson Moore, and
another friend and colleague, Doctor Siler, whose interest in these
unique gatherings had been aroused by Morton."I've tried to give him a resume of our previous deductions," the
latter explained, as Hitt prepared to open the discussion."And he
says he has conscientious scruples--if you know what that means.""He's a Philistine, that's all, eh?""I am like my friend, Reverend Edward
Hull, who says--"

"There!""Your friend has a life job molding the
plastic minds of prospective preachers, and he doesn't want to lose
the sinecure.Got a wife and babies depending on
him.He still preaches hell-fire and the resurrection of the flesh,
doesn't he?Well, in that case we can dispense with his views, for
we've sent that sort of doctrine to the ash heap."Reverend Moore opened his mouth as if to protest; but Hitt prevented
him by taking the floor and plunging at once into his subject."The
hour is very late," he said in apology, "and we have much ground to
cover.Carmen stole a hand beneath the table and grasped the Beaubien's."As I sat in my office this morning," began Hitt meditatively, "I
looked often and long through the window and out over this great,
roaring city.Everywhere I saw tremendous activity, frantic hurry, and
nerve-racking strife.In the distance I marked the smoke curling
upward from huge factories, packing houses, and elevators.The
incessant seething, the rush and bustle, the noise, the heat, and
dust, all spelled business, an enormous volume of human business--and
yet, _not one iota of it contributed even a mite to the spiritual
nature and needs of mankind_!And then I looked down, far down, into the
streets below.And I saw,
too, men and women, rich and comfortable, riding along happily in
their automobiles, with not a thought beyond their physical
well-being.But, I asked myself, should they not ride thus, if they
wish?And yet, the hour will soon come when sickness, disaster, and
death will knock at their doors and sternly bid them come out."Just what I have sought to impress upon you whenever you advanced
your philosophical theories, Doctor," said Reverend Moore, turning to
Morton.The doctor glowered back at him without reply."Now what should the man in the automobile do?Is there anything he
_can_ do, after all?Jesus told such as he to seek
first the kingdom of harmony--a demonstrable understanding of truth.The automobile riding would follow after that, and with safety.Why,
oh, why, will we go on wasting our precious time acquiring additional
physical sensations in motor cars, amusement parks, travel, anywhere
and everywhere, instead of laboring first to acquire that real
knowledge which alone will set us free from the bitter woes of human
existence!""Jesus set us free, sir," interposed Reverend Moore sternly."And his
vicarious atonement opens the door of immortality to all who believe
on his name."Moore, you believe will be acquired only after
death.At present we see mankind laboring for that which even they
themselves admit is not meat.They waste their substance for what is
not bread.Because of their false beliefs of God and man,
externalized in a viciously cruel social system; because of their
dependence upon the false supports of _materia medica_, orthodox
theology, man-devised creeds, and human opinions."And yet, who hath believed our report?men in our
day think and read little that is serious; and they reflect hardly at
all upon the vital things of life.They want to be let alone in their
comfortable materialistic beliefs, even though those beliefs rend
them, rive them, rack and twist them with vile, loathsome disease, and
then sink them into hideous, worm-infested graves!The human mind does
not want its undemonstrable beliefs challenged.It does not want the
light of unbiased investigation thrown upon the views which it has
accepted ready-made from doctor and theologian.Because,
my friends, the human mind is inert, despite its seemingly tremendous
material activity.And its inertia is the result of its own
self-mesmerism, its own servile submission to beliefs which, as
Balfour has shown, have grown up under every kind of influence except
that of genuine evidence.Chief of these are the prevalent religious
beliefs, which we are asked to receive as divinely inspired."But that
gentleman sat stolid, with arms folded and a scowl upon his sharp
features."Religion," continued Hitt, "is that which binds us to the real.what a farce mankind have made of it.Because, in its mad
desire to make matter real and to extract all pleasures from it, the
human mind has tried to eliminate the soul.""We have been having a bad spell of materialism, that's true,"
interposed Doctor Morton."Well," Hitt replied, "perhaps so.Yet almost in our own day France
put God out of her institutions; set up and crowned a prostitute as
the goddess of reason; and trailed the Bible through the streets of
Paris, tied to the tail of an ass!And in this country we have enthroned so-called physical
science, and, as Comte predicted, are about to conduct God to the
frontier and bow Him out with thanks for His provisional services.As our droll philosopher, Hubbard, has said, 'Once
man was a spirit, now he is matter.Once he was a flame, now he is a
candlestick.Once he was a son of God, now he is a chemical formula.Once he was an angel, now he is plain mud.'""But," exclaimed Reverend Moore, visibly nettled, "that is because of
his falling away from the Church--"

"My friend," said Hitt calmly, "he fell away from the Church because
he could not stagnate longer with her and be happy.Orthodox theology
has largely become mere sentimentalism.The average man has a horror
of being considered a namby-pamby, religiously weak, wishy-washy,
so-called Christian.It makes him ashamed of himself to stand up
in a congregation and sing 'My Jesus, I love Thee,' and 'In
mansions of glory and endless delight.'And he is far more concerned about his little brick bungalow
and next month's rent than he is about celestial mansions.No; he leaves religion to women, whom he regards as the
weaker sex.He turns to the ephemeral wisdom of human science--and,
poor fool!Well, how
often nowadays do you hear the name of God on their lips?Is He ever the topic of conversation at
receptions and balls?No; that person was right who said that
religion 'does not rise to the height of successful gossip.'It
stands no show with the latest cabaret dance, the slashed skirt,
and the daringly salacious drama as a theme of discourse.Oh, yes,
we still maintain our innumerable churches.And, though religion is
the most vital thing in the world to us, we hire a preacher to talk
to us once a week about it!Would we hire men to talk once a week to
us about business?But religion is far, far less important to
human thought than business--for the latter means automobiles and
increased opportunities for physical sensation."Hitt," objected Doctor Siler, "I am sure this is not such a
godless era as you would make out.""We have many gods, chief of whom is matter.The
world's acknowledged god is not spirit, despite the inescapable fact
that the motive-power of the universe is spiritual, and the only
action is the expression of thought."But now," he continued, "we have in our previous discussions made
some startling deductions, and we came to the conclusion that there is
a First Cause, and that it is infinite mind.But, having agreed upon
that, are we now ready to admit the logical corollary, namely, that
there can be but _one_ real mind?For that follows from the premise
that there is but one God who is infinite.""We have but the one mind, God," he replied.Human men reflect the communal mortal
mind, which is the suppositional opposite of the divine mind that is
God.I repeat, the so-called human mind knows not God.It sees only its own interpretations of Him
and His manifestations."Well, they might be," suggested Doctor Siler."Well then," he said, "if you will not admit that all
things are mental--including the entire universe--you certainly are
forced to admit that your comprehension of things is mental.""Then you will likewise have to admit that you are not concerned with
_things_, but with your comprehension of things.""And so, after all, you deal only with mental things--and everything
is mental to you.""The Bible states clearly that He created _all_ things," returned that
gentleman a little stiffly."My friends," resumed Hitt very earnestly, "we are on the eve of a
tremendous enlightenment, I believe.And for that we owe much to the
so-called 'theory of suppositional opposites.'We have settled to our
satisfaction that, although mankind believe themselves to be dependent
upon air, food, and water for existence, nevertheless they are really
dependent upon something vastly finer, which is back of those things.That'something' we call God, for it is good.Matthew Arnold said that
the only thing that can be verified about God is that He is 'the
eternal power that makes for righteousness.'Very well, we are almost
willing to accept that alone--for that carries infinite implications.It makes God an eternal, spiritual power, omnipotent as an influence
for good.It makes Him the infinite patron, so to speak, of
right-thinking.So it makes Him
the sole creative force."But," he continued, "force, or power, is not material.God by very
necessity is mind, including all intelligence.And His operations are
conducted according to the spiritual law of evolution.Oh, yes,
evolution is not a theory, it is a fact.God, infinite mind, evolves,
uncovers, reveals, unfolds, His numberless eternal ideas.The greatest of these is the one that
includes all others and expresses and reflects Him perfectly.That is the man who was'made'--revealed, manifested--in
His image and likeness.There is no other image and likeness of God.Moreover, God has always existed, and always will.So His ideas,
including real man, have had no beginning.They were not created, as
we regard creation, but have been unfolded.But now we come to the peculiar part,
namely, the fact that _reality seems always to have its shadow in
unreality_.The magnet has
its opposite poles, one positive, the other negative.At the lowest ebb of the
world's morals appeared the Christ.The Christian religion springs
from the soil of a Roman Emperor's blood-soaked gardens.Errors hampering the solving of
mathematical problems.That
which stands the test of demonstration as to permanence, I say with
Spencer."And now we learn that it is the _communal mortal mind_ that stands as
the opposite and negative of the infinite mind that is God, and that
it is but a supposition, without basis of real principle or fact.It
has its law of evolution, too, and evolves its types in human beings
and animals, in mountain, tree, and stream.All material nature, in
fact, is but the manifestation, or reflection, of this communal mortal
mind."But, though God had no beginning, and will have no ending, this
communal mortal mind, on the contrary, did have a seeming beginning,
and will end its pseudo-existence.It seemingly
evolved its universe, and its earth as its lower stratum.It made its
firmament, and it gradually filled its seas with moving things that
manifested its idea of life.Slowly, throughout inconceivable eons of
time, it unrolled and evolved, until at last, through untold
generations of stupid, sluggish, often revolting animal forms, it
began to evolve a type of mind, a crude representation of the mind
that is God, and manifesting its own concept of intelligence."Now what was this communal mortal mind doing?Counterfeiting divine
mind, if I may so express it.But
types that were without basis of principle, and so they passed
away--the higher forms died, the lower disintegrated.Aye, death came
into the world because of sin, for the definition of sin is the
Aramaic word which Jesus used, translated '_hamartio_,' which means
'missing the mark.'Yes, sin came through Adam, for
Adam is the name of the communal mortal mind."Well, ages and ages passed, reckoned in the human mind concept of
time.The evolution was continually toward a higher and ever higher
type.Paleolithic man still died, because he did not have enough real
knowledge in his mortal mind to keep him from missing the mark.He
probably had no belief in a future life, for he did not bury his dead
after the manner of those who later manifested this belief.But, after
the lapse of centuries, Neolithic man was found manifesting such a
belief.This: the mortal mind was translating the
divine idea of immortality into its own terms and thus expressing it.The curtain began to rise upon what we call human
history.The idea of a power not itself began to filter through the
mist of mortal mind, and human beings felt its influence, the
influence that makes for righteousness.And then, at last, through the
mortal mind there began to filter the idea of the one God.The people
who best reflected this idea were the ancient Israelites.They called
themselves the 'chosen' people.Their so-called minds were, as Carmen
has expressed it, like window-panes that were a little cleaner than
the others.They let a bit more of the light through.God is light,
you know, according to the Scriptures.And little by little they began
to record their thoughts regarding their concept of the one God.And soon they were seeing their God
manifested everywhere, and hearing His voice in every sound of Nature.And thus began that strange and mighty
book, the Bible, _the record of the evolution of the concept of God in
the human mind_.""Do you mean to say that the Bible was not given by inspiration?""This filtering process that I have been speaking
about _is_ inspiration.Every bit of truth that comes to you or me
to-day comes by inspiration--the breathing in--of the infinite mind
that is truth."And so," he went on, "we have those reflections of the communal
mortal mind which we call the Israelites recording their thoughts and
ideas.Sometimes they recorded plain fact; sometimes they wrapped
their moral teachings in allegories and fables.Josephus says of Moses
that he wrote some things enigmatically, some allegorically, and the
rest in plain words, since in his account of the first chapter of
Genesis and the first three verses of the second he gives no hint of
any mystery at all.But when he comes to the fourth verse of the
second chapter he says Moses, after the seventh day was over, began
to talk philosophically, and so he understood the rest of the second
and third chapters in some enigmatical and allegorical sense.Quite
so, it appears to me, for the writer, whoever he was, was then
attempting the impossible task of explaining the enigma of evil, the
origin of which is associated always with the dust-man.""You deny the truth of the account of the creation as given in the
second chapter of Genesis, do you?""You deny
that man was tempted and fell?""Well," said Hitt, smiling, "of course there is no special reason for
denying that serpents may have talked, millions and millions of years
ago.In fact, they still have rudimentary organs of speech--as do most
animals.Snakes developed in the
Silurian Era, some twenty million years ago.In the vast intervening
stretch of time they may have lost their power to talk.But, as for
the second chapter of Genesis, Moses may or may not have written it.Indeed, he may not have written the first.The book of
Genesis shows plainly that it is a composite of several books by
various authors.I incline to the belief that some more materialistic
hand and mind than Moses's composed that second chapter.However that
may be, it is a splendid example of the human mind's crude attempt to
interpret the spiritual creation in its own material terms.It in a
way represents the dawning upon the human mind of the idea of the
spiritual creation.For when finite sense approaches the infinite it
must inevitably run into difficulties with which it can not cope; it
must meet problems which it can not solve, owing to its lack of a
knowledge of the infinite principle involved.That's why the world
rejected the first account of the creation and accepted the second,
snake-story, dust-man, apple tree, and all."exclaimed Haynerd, his eyes wide agape."You're like a
story-book!"We know that man appeared on this
earth in comparatively recent times.For millions and millions of
years before he was evolved animals and vegetables had been dying."Your difficulty arises from the fact that
we are accustomed to associate sin with human personality.But
remember, the physical universe has been evolved from the communal
mortal mind.It has been dying from
the very beginning of its seeming existence, for its seeming existence
alone is sin.The vegetables, the animals, and now the men, that have
been evolved from it, and that express it and reflect and manifest
it, must die, necessarily, because the so-called mind from which they
evolve is not based upon the eternal, immortal principle, God.And so
it and they miss the mark, and always have done so.You must cease to
say, Whose sin?Remember that the sin is inherent in the so-called
mind that is expressed by things material.The absence of the
principle which is God is sin, according to the Aramaic word,
translated '_hamartio_,' which Jesus used.The most lowly cell that
swam in the primeval seas manifested the communal mortal mind's sin,
and died as a consequence.""In other words, it manifested a supposition, as opposed to truth?""Its existence was quite suppositional," replied Hitt."It did not
manifest life, but a material sense of existence.And so the communal mortal mind,
so-called, determined these first lowly material and objective forms
of existence.They were its phenomena, and they manifested it.Different types now manifest it, after long ages.But all are equally
without basis of principle, all are subject to the mortal law that
everything material contains within itself the elements for its own
destruction, and all must pass away.In our day we are dealing with
the highest type of mortal mind so far evolved, the human man.He,
too, knows but one life, human life, the mortal-mind sense of
existence.His human life is demonstrably only a series of states of
material consciousness, states of thought-activity.The classification
and placing of these states of consciousness give him his sense of
time.The positing of his mental concepts give him his sense of space.His consciousness is a thought-activity, externalizing human opinions,
ideas, and beliefs, not based on truth.This consciousness--or
supposititious human mind--is very finite in nature, and so is
essentially self-centered.It attributes its fleshly existence to
material things.It believes that its life depends upon its fleshly
body; and so it thinks itself in constant peril of losing it.It goes
further, and believes that there are multitudes of other human minds,
each having its own human, fleshly existence, or life, and each
capable of doing it and one another mortal injury.It believes that it
can be deprived by its neighboring mortal minds of all that it needs
for its sustenance, and that it can improve its own status at their
expense, and vice versa.It is filled with fears--not knowing that God
is infinite good--and its fears become externalized as disaster, loss,
calamity, disease, and death at last.It has no basis of principle to rest upon, and so it
constantly shifts and changes to accord with its own shifting thought.It is here to-day, and gone
to-morrow.""Well, Ned," said Hitt, "there is this hope: human consciousness
always refers its states to something.It is infinite mind, God, and its infinite manifestation.The human
mind still translates or interprets God's greatest idea, Man, as 'a
suffering, sinning, troubled creature,' forgetting that this creature
is only a mental concept, and that the human mind is looking only at
its own thoughts, and that these thoughts are counterfeits of God's
real thoughts."Moreover, though the human mind is finite, and can not even begin to
grasp the infinite, the divine mind has penetrated the mist of error.There is a spark of real reflection in every mortal.That spark can be
made to grow into a flame that will consume all error and leave the
real man revealed, a consciousness that knows no evil.There is now
enough of a spark of intelligence in the human, so-called mind to
enable it to lay hold on truth and grow out of itself.And there is no
excuse for not doing so, as Jesus said.If he had not come we wouldn't
have known that we were missing the mark so terribly.""Well," observed Haynerd, "after that classification I don't see that
we mortals have much to be puffed up about!""All human beings, or mortals, Ned," said Hitt, "are interpretations
by the mortal mind of infinite mind's idea of itself, Man.These
interpretations are made in the human mind, and they remain posited
there.All are false,
and doomed to decay.How, then, can one mortal look down with
superciliousness upon another, when all are in the same identical
class?"Carmen's thoughts rested for a moment upon the meaningless existence
of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had anchored her life in the shifting
sands of the flesh and its ephemeral joys."Now," resumed Hitt, "we will come back to the question of progress.What is progress but the growing of the human mind out of itself under
the influence of the divine stimulus of demonstrable truth?And that
is made possible when we grasp the stupendous fact that the human,
mortal mind, including its man, is absolutely unreal and non-existent!The human man changes rapidly in mind, and, consequently, in its lower
stratum, or expression, the body.For that reason he need not carry
over into to-day the old, false beliefs which were manifested by him
yesterday.If he leaves them in the past, they cease to be manifested
in his present or future.Then, opening
himself to truth, he lays off the 'old man' and puts on the 'new.'He
denies himself--denies that there is any truth in the seeming reality
of the mortal, material self--as Jesus bade us do."His ideas and the thoughts regarding them must always have existed.He, as mind, is an inexhaustible
reservoir of thought.Now the human, mortal mind interprets His
thoughts, and so _seems_ to manufacture new thought.It makes new
interpretations, but not new thoughts.When you hear people chatting,
do you think they are manufacturing new thought?They
are but reflecting, or voicing, the communal so-called mortal mind's
interpretations of God's innumerable and real thoughts.""And so," suggested Father Waite, "the more nearly correct our
interpretations of His thoughts are, the nearer we approach to
righteousness.""There exist all sorts of real thoughts
about God's ideas.But the human mind
makes likewise all sorts of erroneous translations of them.We shall
solve our problem of existence when we correctly interpret His
thoughts, and use them only.When the human mentality becomes attuned
or accustomed to certain thoughts, that kind flow into it readily from
the communal mortal mind.Some people think for years along certain
erroneous or criminal lines.Their minds are set in that direction,
and invite such a flow of thought.But were they to reverse the'set,'
there would be a very different and better resulting externalization
in health, prosperity, and morals.""I think I see," said Miss Wall."And I begin to glimpse the true
mission of Jesus, and why he was ready to give up everything for it."And now a word further about the so-called mortal mind.For,
when we have collected and arranged all our data regarding it, we will
find ourselves in a position to begin to work out of it, and thereby
truly work out our salvation, even if with fear and trembling.I have
said in a previous talk that, judging by the deductions of the
physical scientists, everything seems about to leave the material
basis and turn into vibrations, and'man changes with velocity' of
these.They tell us that all life depends upon water; that life began,
eons ago, in the primeval sea.True, the human sense of existence, as
I have said, began in the dark, primeval sea of mist, the deep and
fluid mortal mind, so-called.And that sense of existence most
certainly is dependent upon the fluid of mortal mind.Bichat has said
that 'life is the sum of the forces that resist death.'Spencer has
defined life as the 'continuous adjustment of internal to external
relations.'Very good, as applied to the human sense of life.The
human mind makes multitudes of mental concepts, and then struggles
incessantly to adjust itself to them, and at length gives up the
struggle, hopelessly beaten.Scientists tell us that life is due to a
continuous series of bodily ferments.The body is in a constant state
of ferment, and that gives rise to life.We know that the human
mind is in a state of incessant ferment.The human mind is a
self-centered mass of writhing, seething, fermenting material thought.And that fermentation is outwardly manifested in its concept of body,
and its material environment.The scientists themselves are rapidly
pushing matter back into the realm of the human mind.Bodily states
are becoming recognized as manifestations of mental states--not vice
versa, as has been ignorantly believed for ages.A prominent physician
told me the other day that many a condition of nervous prostration now
could be directly traced to selfishness.We know that hatred and anger
produce fatal poisons.The rattlesnake is a splendid example of that.I am told that its poison and the white of an egg are formed of
_exactly the same amounts of the same elements_.The difference in
effect is the thought lying back of each.""You don't pretend that the snake
thinks and hates--"

"Doctor," said Hitt, "for thousands upon thousands of years the human
race has been directing hatred and fear-thoughts toward the snake.Is
it any wonder that the snake is now poisonous?That it now reflects
back that poisonous thought to mankind?""But some are not poisonous, you know.""Can we say how long they have not been so, or how soon our hatred
will make them all poisonous?Do you know, moreover, that sorrow,
remorse, all emotions, in fact, affect the perspiration that exudes
from the human body?Do you know that hatred will render human
perspiration the deadliest poison known to science?I am told that
in a few minutes of murderous hatred enough of this poisonous
perspiration is exuded from the human body to kill a man.And do
you know that the thought which manifests upon the body in such
deadly poison is just as deadly when sent into the mentality of a
human being?Think what the Church's deadly hatred of so-called
heretics has done in the last nineteen hundred years!Why, millions
have been killed by it alone!"But now," he said, consulting his watch, "I must go.Even a newspaper
man requires a little sleep.And I must make my apology for occupying
the floor to-night to the exclusion of you all.I have gradually been
filling up with these thoughts for some weeks, and I had to let them
out.Hitt," interrupted Father Waite, "I shall soon be ready to report
on those questions of Bible research which you assigned to me.""Well, have you found that Jesus really was
an historical character, or not?""I think," said Carmen, "that he has found that it really matters
little whether there ever was such a person as the human man Jesus.The Christ has always lived; and the Christ-principle which the man
Jesus is reported to have revealed to the world is with us, here, now,
and always.It is the principle, rather than the man Jesus, that
concerns us, is it not?""Miss Carmen," interposed Reverend Moore, "Jesus was the incarnate Son
of God, and your remarks concerning him are--"

"Slow up, Pat!""I'll fight that out with
you on the way home."We will take up that question in our next discussion," said Hitt."But, wait; Carmen must give us just a short song before we part."As she passed Hitt, she
squeezed his hand.A few minutes later the little group dispersed,
with the melody of the girl's voice trembling in their souls.CHAPTER 8


For several days Ames reflected, and waited.Judging by the data which
he was able to secure, the Express was eating up money at a fearful
pace.To continue at that rate meant certain financial disaster in the
near future.And yet the publishers of the rejuvenated sheet seemed
never to count the cost of their experiment.Already they had begun
the introduction of innovations that were startling and even
mirth-provoking to staid, conservative publishers in the journalistic
field.To survive the long period necessary for the education of the
public taste to such things as the Express stood for demanded a source
of income no less permanent than La Libertad itself.The Beaubien, of course, in her
crippled financial condition was affording the Express no monetary
assistance.Haynerd's few thousands were long
since dissipated.And
her estate was handled by Ames and Company!And handled, we may add,
in such a manner that Miss Wall knew naught regarding it, except that
she might draw upon it as one dips water from a hillside spring.And as he meditated upon the new paper and its
promoters, there gradually formed within him a consuming desire to see
again the fair young girl who had drawn him so strongly, despite his
mountainous wrath and his flaming desire to crush her when she boldly
faced him in his own house on the night of his grand reception.Why
had he let her escape him then?True, women had
meant little to him, at least in the last few years.But this girl had
seemed to stir within him new emotions, or those long slumbering.He
knew not, coarsely materialistic as was his current thought, that in
him, as in all who came within the radius of her pure affection, she
had swept chords whose music he had never heard before.And then one morning he took down
the receiver and called up the office of the Express.Hitt was not there--but this was his assistant.And:

"You didn't want to see Mr.Ames nearly dropped the receiver in his astonishment.In the first
place, the girl had read his thought; and in the second, he was not
accustomed to being told that he might go to see people--they came
cringing to him."You may come at twelve-fifteen," continued the clear, firm voice."And remain a half hour; I'm very busy."Ames put down the instrument and looked about, thankful that no one
was there to comment on his embarrassment.Then he leaned back in his
chair and went slowly over in thought the experiences of that eventful
night in his house.Why, this slip of a girl--a half-breed Indian at
best--this mere baby--!But he glanced up at the great electric wall
clock, and wished it were then twelve-fifteen.*       *       *       *       *

At noon Ames, jauntily swinging his light walking stick, strolled
casually into the office of the Express.His air was one of supreme
confidence in his own powers.And
the knowledge rendered him unafraid of God, man, or beast.He had met
and conquered everything mundane, excepting this young girl.But that
thought was now delightful to him.In her he had unearthed a real
novelty, a ceaseless interest.She scratched and nettled him; but she was as nothing in his grasp.The first thing that impressed him on entering the office was the air
of prosperity which hung over the place.The environment, he mentally
commented, was somewhat unusual for a newspaper plant.Order, quiet,
and cleanliness were dominant notes in the prevailing harmony.He
first walked back into the pressroom to see if the same conditions
prevailed there.Then he retraced his steps, and at length came to a
halt before a door bearing the inscription, "Miss Ariza," on the
glass.Turning the knob, he peered curiously in.The room was small, but light and airy.Its furnishings were new, and
its walls had been freshly tinted.A few pictures of good quality hung
about them.At the desk, bending
over a new typewriter, sat Carmen."I beg pardon," said Ames, hesitating in the doorway."You don't mind if I finish
this article, do you?""It's got
to go to the compositors right away.""Certainly--don't stop," replied Ames easily."When we talk I want
your undivided attention.""Oh, you're sure to get it," she returned, laughing.He sat back in his chair and watched her closely.Yet, there was just a slight tint in her skin, he thought.Perhaps the report that she was a mulatto was not wholly unfounded,
although the strain must have been greatly mixed.He wanted to bend over and take it in his own.Then he suddenly remembered what the Beaubien had once told him--that
she always seemed to be a better woman in this girl's presence.Could he go on persecuting the
harassed woman?But he wouldn't, if--

"There!"said the girl, with what seemed to be a little sigh of
relief.She pressed a button, and handed the typewritten sheets to the
boy who responded.Then, turning to Ames:

"You've come to apologize, haven't you?Well, he certainly had not had any such intention when he
came in.In fact, he knew not just why he was there."You see, Congressman Wales didn't vote for the unaltered schedule.And so everything's all right, isn't it?""No vote has been taken," he said, a dull anger
rising within him."Oh, you are mistaken," replied the girl."The bill was voted out of
committee an hour ago.Here's the wire,
showing the alterations made.Ames read the message, and handed it back.Beyond the clouding of his
features he gave no indication of his feelings."So, you see," continued the girl, "that incident is closed--for all
time, isn't it?"Then:

"Rather odd, isn't it?"he commented, turning quite away from that
subject, and glancing about, "that one with the high ideals you
profess should be doing newspaper work.""There is nothing so
practical as the ideal, for the ideal is the only reality.""Well, just what, may I ask, are you trying to do here?""Run a newspaper on a basis of _practical_ Christianity," she
answered, her eyes dancing."Just as all business will have to be
conducted some day."she said, "to the carnal mind."The laughter abruptly ceased, and he looked keenly at her.But there
was no trace of malice in her fair face as she steadily returned the
look.Well, I'll wager you won't get a dollar back on your investment
for years."We are not measuring our profits
in money!""And your investment--let's see," he mused, trying to draw her out."You've put into this thing a couple of hundred thousand, eh?""I'll tell you," she said, "because money is the only
measure you have for estimating the worth of our project.Hitt has
put more than that amount already into the Express."Quite a little for you people to lose, eh?""You will have to change your tone if you remain here, Mr.You who owe your fellow-men what you can
never, never repay?Ames, there is no man in this whole wide
world, I think, who is so terribly, hopelessly in debt as you!"Why, I don't owe a dollar to any man!"she queried, bending a little closer to him."You do not owe
Madam Beaubien the money you are daily filching from her?Gannette the money and freedom of which you robbed him?You do not owe anything to the thousands of miners and mill hands who
have given, and still give, their lives for you?You do not owe for
the life which you took from Mrs.You do not owe for
the souls which you have debauched in your black career?For the human
wreckage which lies strewn in your wake?Haynerd
for the Social Era which you stole from him?"Ames remained rigid and quiet while the girl spoke.And when she had
finished, and they sat looking squarely into each other's eyes, the
silence was like that which comes between the sharp click of lightning
and the crash of thunder which follows.If it had been a man who thus
addressed him, Ames would have hurled him to the floor and trampled
him.As it was, he rose slowly, like a black storm-cloud mounting
above the horizon, and stood over the girl.She looked up into his face dauntlessly and smiled."Sit down," she
quietly said.Don't threaten, please," she
continued."It wouldn't do any good, for I am not a bit afraid of you.A faint smile began to play about Ames's mouth.Then he twitched his
shoulders slightly."I--I got up," he said, with an assumption of
nonchalance, "to--to read that--ah, that motto over there on the
wall."He went slowly to it and, stooping, read aloud:

               "Lift up the weak, and cheer the strong,
               Defend the truth, combat the wrong!You'll find no scepter like the pen
               To hold and sway the hearts of men.""That was written by your Eugene Field," offered the girl."Now read
the one on the opposite side.It is your _Tekel Upharsin_."He went to the one she indicated, and read the spiritual admonition
from Bryant:

          "Leave the vain, low strife
          That makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power--
          The passions and the cares that wither life,
          And waste its little hour.""Now," continued the girl, "that is only a suggestion to you of the
real handwriting on the wall.I put it there purposely, knowing that
some day you would come in here and read it."Ames turned and looked at her in dumb wonder, as if she were some
uncanny creature, possessed of occult powers.Then the significance of
her words trickled through the portals of his thought."You mean, I suppose," he said, "that if I am not persuaded by the
second motto I shall feel the force of the first, as it sways you,
eh?"Ames," she replied steadily, "that the world is entering
upon a new era of thought, and that your carnal views and methods
belong to a day that is past.This century has no place for them; it
wearies of the things you represent; you are the epitome of that evil
which must have its little hour of night before the reality dawns.""Am I to understand," he
asked, "that the Express, under its new management, is about to turn
muck-raker, and shovel mud at us men of wealth?""We are not considering the Express now, Mr."It
is I alone who am warning you.""Do Hitt and Haynerd bring against me the charges which you voiced a
moment ago?And do you intend to make the columns of your paper spicy
with your comments on my character and methods?I verily believe you
are declaring war!""We are in the business of declaring truth, Mr.It will not shield you when
you are the willing tool of evil, nor will it condone your methods at
any price."Very well," he replied with a bantering smile."I came over
here this noon to get the policy of your paper.Ames," she returned, "is the challenge which evil
always finds in good."I like a good enemy, and an honest one.Who's your general, Hitt or Haynerd?"Then he recovered himself, and
laughed."Do you know," he said, bending close to her, "I admire you _very_
much.Now let's see if we can't get
together on terms of peace.The world hasn't used you right, and I
don't blame you for being at odds with it.I've wanted to talk with
you about this for some time.The pin-headed society hens got jealous
and tried to kill you.But, if you'll just say the word, I'll set you
right up on the very pinnacle of social prestige here.I'll take you
by the hand and lead you down through the whole crowd of 'em, and
knock 'em over right and left!I'll make you the leading woman of the
city; I'll back the Express; we'll make it the biggest newspaper in
the country; I'll make you and your friends rich and powerful; I'll
put you in the place that is rightfully yours, eh?He was bending ever nearer, and his hand closed over hers when he
concluded.His eyes were looking eagerly into her face, and a smile,
winning, enticing, full of meaning, played about his lips.Carmen returned his smile, but withdrew her hand."I'll join you," she
said, "on one condition.""Go; sell that thou hast; and give to the poor.Then come, take up the
cross, and follow--my leader."He straightened up, and a sneer curled his lips."I suppose," he
coarsely insinuated, "that you think you now have material for an
illuminating essay on my conversation."The man's facial muscles twitched slightly under the sting, but he
retained his outward composure."My dear girl," he said, "it probably
has not occurred to you that the world regards the Express as utterly
without excuse for existence.It says, and truly, that a wishy-washy
sheet such as it, with its devitalized, strained, and bolted reports
of the world's vivid happenings, deserves to go under from sheer lack
of interest.The experiment has been tried before, and has signally
failed.But, say the word,
and--"

"And your money, as well as your business ideals, will be ours?"Ames," she said, "you have no ideals.No man who amasses millions
by taking advantage of the world's inhuman and pernicious social
system can have ideals worthy of the name.To apply your methods, your
thought, to the Express would result in sinking its moral tone into
the dust.As for your money--"

"Commit suicide, then!"cried the man, yielding to his rising anger."Let the Express go down, carrying you and your spineless associates
with it!But, remember, you will be the sole cause of its ruin, and
theirs!"Carmen rose quietly and opened the office door."Your half hour is up,
Mr.Ames," she said, glancing at the little clock on her desk; "and I
must return to my work."For a moment the huge man stood looking down darkling upon the girl.He would have given his soul if he could have clasped that slender
form in his arms!A sudden impulse assailed him, and bade him fall
upon his knees before her, and ask her forgiveness and guidance.She
stood waiting--perhaps just for that, and always with that same smile
into which no one had ever yet read aught but limitless love.Carmen hastened to answer the call.Yes--yes--the cotton schedule was reported out
quite changed--yes, an hour ago!"*       *       *       *       *

"Dearie," said the Beaubien at evening, as Carmen seated herself in
that woman's lap and wound her arms about her neck, "I am afraid for
you.""Well, mother dearest," replied the girl, giving her a tighter
squeeze, "that is a sheer waste of time.If you haven't anything more
to occupy you than fear, you'd better come down to the office, and
I'll set you to work.""But--you have defied him--as he says, declared war--"

"No, dearest, not that.It is the carnal mind, using him as a channel,
that has declared war against good.But evil is not power; nor has it
been given power by God.My one thought is this: Am I doing that which
will result in the greatest good to the greatest number?Not as evil would
want to be served, but as good.If my mental attitude is right, then
God's law becomes operative in all that I do, and I am protected."I know, dearie, but--there's the telephone!Oh, I do hope they don't
want you!"Carmen answered the call, and returned with the announcement that
Haynerd was in distress."Sidney Ames is--not there," she said.Now don't worry,
dearest; I--I won't go alone."A moment later she gave the
Beaubien a kiss, and hurried out into the night.In half an hour she
stood at Haynerd's desk."Here I
am, tied down, depending on Sid, and he's drunk!"Haynerd looked up at her, and hesitated."Mass meeting, over on the
East Side.Here's the address," taking up a slip of paper."Open
meeting, I'm told; but I suspect it's an I. W. W. affair.he
said, replying to a telephone call.The Ames mills at
Avon closed down this afternoon?He hung up the receiver and turned to Carmen."That's what this
meeting is about," he said significantly."Four thousand hands
suddenly thrown out at the Avon mills.Sidney Ames slouched into the editor's office and sank heavily into a
chair."Look here," he said, in
sudden desperation, "that fellow's got to be sobered up, now!Or
else--"

Another call came, this time from the Beaubien.Haynerd eagerly gave the
address over the 'phone, and bade him start at once."Now," he said, nodding at Carmen, and jerking his thumb over his
shoulder toward the intoxicated reporter, "it's up to you."Carmen rose at once and went to the lad."Come, Sidney," she said,
taking his hand.The boy roused dully, and shuffled stupidly after the girl into her
own little office.Carmen switched on the lights and closed the door.Then she went to
the limp, emaciated form crumpled up in a chair, and sat down beside
it."Sidney," she said, taking his hand, "there is but one habit--the
habit of righteousness.That is the habit that you are going to wear
now."Outside, the typewriters clicked, the telephones tinkled, and the
linotypes snapped.There were quick orders; men came and went
hurriedly; but there was no noise, no confusion.Haynerd toiled like a
beaver; but his whole heart was in his work.Carmen's little room voiced the sole discordant note that night.And
as the girl sat there, holding the damp hand of the poor victim, she
thanked her God that the lad's true individuality was His pure
thought of him.*       *       *       *       *

At dawn Sidney Ames awoke.A rosy-tinted glow lay over the little
room, and the quiet form at his side seemed an ethereal presence.A
gentle pressure from the hand that still clasped his brought a return
of his earthly sense, and he roused up.The gentle voice sounded to him like distant music."I--you--you brought me in here last night--but--" His hands closed
about the little one that lay in his grasp."You--haven't sat
here--with me--all night?"With a low moan the boy buried his face in her arms, and burst into a
flood of bitter tears."It isn't real, Sidney," she whispered, twining an arm about his neck.For some moments the lad sobbed out his shame and misery.Carmen
stroked his fair hair, and drew him closer to her, while tears of love
and pity coursed down her own cheeks.he cried,
struggling to his feet, while his eyes shone with a wild light.He started for the door, but Carmen darted past him and stood with her
back against it, facing him.she cried, holding her
hands against him._God reigns
here!_"

She turned the lock as he hesitated; then took his arm and led him,
trembling and shivering, back to his chair."We are going to meet this, Sidney, you and I," she whispered, bending
over the shaking form.The suffering lad shook his head and buried his face in his hands."You can't," he moaned; "you can't--I'm _gone!_" His voice died into a
tremble of hopeless despair, of utter surrender.She had faced many trying situations in her brief
life-experience; but, though she met it with dauntless courage and
knew its source, the insidious suggestion now persisted that the eyes
of her people were upon her, and that by this would stand or fall
their faith.Aye, the world was watching her now, keen-eyed and
critical.Would she give it cause to say she could not prove her faith
by her works?And then came the divine message that bade her "Know that I am
God!"--that bade her know that responsibility lay not upon her
shoulders, but upon the Christ for whom she was now called to
witness.To see, or permit the world to see, this mountainous error,
this heaped-up evil, as real and having power, meant a denial of the
Christ and utter defeat.It meant a weary retracing of her own steps,
and a long night of spiritual darkness to those whose eyes had been
upon her."Sidney," she said, turning to the sunken boy at her side, "you are
right, the old man _is_ gone.And now we are going to create 'new
heavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered nor
come into mind'--as thought.Underneath are the everlasting arms, and
you have sunk down, down, down, until at last you rest upon them, and
you find that you haven't sunk at all, and that you couldn't possibly
get away from that infinite Love that is always drawing you to
itself!"She put her arm again about the lad, and drew him toward her."Listen,
Sidney dear, I am standing with you--and with me is omnipotent God!His arm is not shortened, that it can not save you from the pit of
spiritual oblivion into which human thought would seem to make you
think you had fallen, engulfed by the senses."The boy raised his head and looked at her through his bloodshot eyes.he whispered hoarsely; "you don't understand--"

"It is just because I _do_ understand, Sidney, that I am able to help
you," she interrupted quickly."It--it isn't only whiskey--it's--" his head sank again--"it's--morphine!"It's got the false thought that seems to call itself 'you,'" she
said.We'll
cling to them no longer, but shake them off for good.For good, I
said, Sidney--and that means, for _God_!"If there were a God, I shouldn't be
where I am now.""Then I will know it for you," she softly answered."And you are now
right where you belong, in Him.My
parents didn't teach it to their children.And when I tried to learn,
my father kicked me into the street!""Then, Sidney, I'll teach you.For I am in the world just to show what
love will do.""My father--it's his fault--all his fault!"cried the boy, flaring up
and struggling to rise.It's his fault
that I'm a sot and a drug fiend!""It is hate, Sidney, that manifests in slavery, in sodden brains, and
shaking nerves.You don't hate your father; the hate is against your
thought of him; and that thought is all wrong."I used to drink--some, when I lived at home," the boy went on, still
dwelling on the thoughts that held him chained."But he could have
saved me.And then I fell in love--I thought it was love, but it
wasn't.The woman was--she was years older than I. When she left the
city, I followed her.And when I found out what she was, and came back
home, my father threw me out--cut me off--God!""Never mind, Sidney," the girl whispered.But
she realized that the boy must voice the thoughts that were tearing
his very soul, and she suffered him, for it uncovered to her the
hidden sources of his awful malady."And then I drank, drank, drank!""And I lay in the
gutters, and in brothels, and--then, one day, Carlson told me to come
and work for him.And so I went to a
doctor, and he--God curse him!--he injected morphine into my arm to
sober me.And that taught me that I could drink all I wanted to, and
sober up on morphine.But then I learned--I found--"

He stopped, and began to fumble in his pockets.His eyes became wilder
as he searched.He caught her wrist and twisted
it painfully."I am not
afraid to see evil seem to have power!"Then aloud: "I know what you
are searching for, Sidney.Listen, and I will give it
to you.It is in love--right here--the Christ-principle, that is bigger far
than the demons that seem to tear you!I have _all_ power from God,
and you, evil, _can not touch me_!"The boy started at the ringing voice, and loosened his grasp.Then he
sank back into his chair, shaking as with palsy.We
don't have to struggle--we don't have to fight--we only have to
_know_.All that you are wrestling with is the world-wide belief that
there is a power apart from God!_There is none!_ Any claim that there
is such a power is a lie!There is no power or intelligence in whiskey or morphine!The Christ-principle will save you!There
is nothing beyond its reach, not even your problem!"It is a problem, that's all, Sidney," she went on, as he became
calmer.Will you put yourself in my charge,
in my care, and let me meet it for you?"She bent over him and looked
eagerly into his drawn face."We are not going to fight," she continued."We are not going to
resist evil as the world does, and so make it real.I know, dear, just
how pressing your need is.I know how
awfully real it seems to you.But trust me, as I trust the Christ.For a few moments they sat together, hand in hand."I am going to
take you home with me.I am going to keep you right with me, right
under my thought.I'm going to be the mirror, constantly with you,
that reflects infinite love to you every moment.Don't think of anything
else now, excepting that God has your hand and is leading you."She took his arm and drew him, unresisting, yet uncomprehending, to
the door.As she opened it, she looked up into his face and smiled.she cried, shifting her grasp to his hand.And I shall not turn you over to yourself again until the problem
is solved!"Hitt met them as they came out of the room."Well," he said, "I've
kept Madam Beaubien informed as well as I could."We'll be back at three--perhaps."*       *       *       *       *

But at three that afternoon the Beaubien telephoned to Hitt that
Carmen would not be down."She will not leave the boy," the woman said."She holds him--I don't
know how.And I know he is trying desperately to help her.But--I
never saw any one stand as she does!Lewis is here, but he doesn't
interfere.We're going to put a bed in his room, and Sidney will sleep
there.Haynerd stormed; but the tempest was all on the surface."I know, I
know," he said, in reply to Hitt's explanation."That boy's life is
more to her than a million newspapers, or anything else in the
universe just at present.The devil can't look her in the
face!I--I wish I were--What are you standing there for?In the little Beaubien cottage that afternoon the angry waves of human
fear, of human craving, of hatred, wrath, and utter misery mounted
heaven-high, and fell again.As the
night-shadows gathered, Sidney Ames, racked and exhausted, fell into a
deep sleep.Then Carmen left his bedside and went into the little
parlor, where sat the Beaubien and Father Waite."Here," she said, handing a hypodermic needle and a vial of tablets to
the latter.And now," she continued, "you must
work with me, and stand--firm!Sidney's enemies are those of his own
mental household.We have got to
uproot from his consciousness the thought that alcohol and drugs are a
power.Hatred and self-condemnation, as well as self-love, voiced in a
sense of injury, are other mental enemies that have got to be driven
out, too.It is all mental, every
bit of it!You have got to know that, and stand with me.We are going
to prove the Christ-principle omnipotent with respect to these seeming
things."But," she added, after a moment's pause, "you must not watch this
error so closely that it can't get away.For if
you do, you make a reality of it--and then, well--"

"The case is in your hands, Carmen," said Father Waite gently."We
know that Jesus would cure this boy instantly, if he were here--"

"Well--the Christ _is_ here!""Put
away your 'ifs' and 'buts.'"And these," he said, holding out the
needle and vial, "shall we have further use for them?""It will be given us what we are to do and say," she returned.CHAPTER 9


Four weeks from that crisp morning when Carmen led the bewildered,
stupified lad to her home, she and Sidney sat out upon the little
porch of the cottage, drinking in the glories of the winter sun.January was but half spent, and the lad and girl were making the most
of the sudden thaw before the colder weather which had been predicted
might be upon them.What these intervening weeks had been to Carmen, none might have
guessed as she sat there with the sunlight filtering in streamlets of
gold through her brown hair.But their meaning to the boy might have
been read with ease in the thin, white face, turned so constantly
toward his fair companion.They were deeply, legibly written there,
those black nights, when he would dash out into the hall, determined
to break through the windows of the nearest dram shop and drink,
drink, drink, until the red liquor burst from his eyes, his mouth, his
nostrils!Those ghastly nights, when Carmen would stand before him,
her arms outspread across the door, and beat back the roaring devils
within him!Those long days of agonized desire for the vicious drug
which had sapped his manhood!Those fell hours, when low curses poured
from his burning lips upon her and upon all mankind!Those cold,
freezing sweats, and the dry, cracking fever!Those hours when, with
Carmen always by his side, he tramped mile after mile through drifts
and ice, until he dropped at length from sheer exhaustion, only to
awake, hours later, to find that the girl had brought him home, safe,
unharmed!--

And then, oh, the "Peace, be still!"which he began to hear, faint at
first, but growing in volume, until, at last, it became a mighty,
thunderous command, before which the demons paled and slunk away,
never to return!Oh, the tears of agony that had given way to tears of
joy, of thanksgiving!Oh, the weakness that had been his strength!And, oh, the devotion of this fair girl--aye, and of her associates,
too--but all through her!Had she proved her God before the eyes of
the world?Day after day, clad in the impenetrable armor
of her love, she had stood at this struggling lad's side, meeting the
arrows of death with her shield of truth!Night after night she had
sat by his couch, her hand crushed in his desperate grasp, flouting
the terror that stalked before his delirious gaze!What work she had
done in those long weeks, none would ever know; but the boy himself
knew that he had emerged from the valley of the shadow of death with a
new mind, and that she had walked with him all the dark, cloud-hung
way.As they sat there in the bright sunlight that morning, their thought
was busy with the boy's future.Old plans, old ambitions, had seemed
to lift with the lifting of the mortal curse which had rested upon
him, and upward through the ashes of the past a tender flower of hope
was pushing its way.The last tie which
bound him to his family had been severed by his own father two weeks
before, when the shadow of death fell athwart his mother's brilliant
path.J. Wilton Ames, delicate in health when recalled from
abroad, and still suffering from the fatigue of the deadly social
warfare which had preceded her sudden flight from her husband's
consuming wrath, had failed to rally from the indisposition which
seized her on the night of the grand Ames reception.For days she
slowly faded, and then went quickly down under a sharp, withering
attack of pneumonia.A few brief weeks after the formal opening of the
Ames palace its mistress had sighed away her blasted hopes, her vain
desires, her petty schemes of human conquest and revenge, and had gone
to face anew her problems on another plane of mortal thought.It was
rumored by the servants that, in her last hours, when she heard the
rustle of the death angel's wings beside her, a great terror had
stricken her, and she had called wildly for that son whom she had
never cared to know.It was whispered that she had begged of her
husband to seek the lad and lead him home; that she had pleaded with
him to strive, with the boy, to find the better things of life; that
she had begged him to warn and be warned of her present sufferings, as
she lay there, stripped of every earthly aid, impoverished in heart,
in soul, in mind, with her hands dusty and begrimed with the ashes of
this life's mocking spoils.What truth lay hidden in her mad ravings about the parentage of
Carmen, and her confused, muttered references to Monsignor Lafelle, no
one knew.But of those who stood about her bedside there was none who
could gainsay the awed whisperings of the servants that this haughty
leader of the great city's aristocracy had passed from this life into
the darkness beyond in pitiable misery and terror.The news of his mother's death had come at a time when the boy was
wild with delirium, at an hour when Waite, and Hitt, and Carmen stood
with him in his room and strove to close their ears against the
shrieking of the demon that was tearing him.Hitt at once called up
Willett, and asked for instructions.A few minutes later came the
message that the Ames house was forever barred against the wayward
son.And it was not until this bright winter morning, when the lad
again sat clothed and in his right mind, that Carmen had gently broken
the news to him."I never knew her," the boy had said at length, rousing from his
meditations."Few of the rich people's children know their parents.I
was brought up by nurses and tutors.I never knew what it was to put
my arms around my mother, and kiss her.And often I would plan to surprise her by suddenly running into her
arms and embracing her.But then, when I would see her, she was always
so far away, so cold, so beautifully dressed.And she seldom spoke to
me, or to Kathleen, until we were grown up.And by that time I was
running wild.And then--then--"

"There!"admonished Carmen, reaching over and taking his hand."That's
in our little private cemetery, you know.The old error is dead, and
we are not going to dig it up and rehearse it, are we?""I'm like a little baby," he said sadly."I'm just
beginning to live.And you are my mother, the only one I've ever
known.""Let me be your sister," she said."We are so
near of an age, you know.""You are my angel," he murmured."What have I told you
so often that Jesus said?'Of mine own self I can do nothing.'It was--" her voice sank to a whisper--"it was the
Christ-principle.It worked through him as a channel; and it worked
through me.""You're going to teach me all about that," he said, again pressing her
hand to his lips."You won't cast me adrift yet, will you, little
sister?"Why, you're still mine, you
know!I haven't given you back to yourself yet, have I?But now let's
talk about your work.If you want to write, you are going to, and you
are going to write _right_.""Back to the Express," she said lightly."I haven't written a word for
it now for a month.And how dear, funny old Ned has scolded!""You--you dropped everything--your work--all--for a poor, worthless
hulk like me," he sighed."Sidney dear," the girl replied.Everything I do is '_as unto Him_.'I would have done the same for
anybody, whether I knew the person or not.I saw, not you, but the
human need--oh, such a need!And the Christ-principle made me a human
channel for meeting it, that is all.Drop my work, and my own
interests!Why, Sidney, what is anything compared with meeting human
needs?Didn't Jesus drop everything and hurry out to meet the sick and
the suffering?Was money-making, or society, or personal desire, or
worldly pleasure anything to him when he saw a need?You don't seem to
understand that this is what I am here for--to show what love will
do.""I--I guess I know only the world's idea of love.""And that is love's counterfeit, self-love, sentimentalism,
sex-mesmerism, and all that," she added."But now, back to your work
again.You're going to write, write, write!My, but the world is
hungry for _real_ literature!Your yearning to meet that need is a
sign of your ability to do it.But, remember, everything that comes to
you comes from within.You are, in fact, a miner; and your mine is
your mind; and that is unlimited, for God is the only mind, infinite
and omnipresent.We
never fear a real thing; we fear only our false thoughts of things.Always those thoughts are absolutely wrong, and we wake up and find
that we were fearing only fear-thoughts themselves.Now destroy the chains of fear which limit your thought,
and God will issue!"Well," without waiting for his reply, "now you have reached that
plane of thought where you don't really care for what the world has to
offer you.You have ceased to want to be rich, or famous.You are not
afraid to be obscure and poor.You have learned, at least in part,
that the real business of this life lies in seeking good, in
manifesting and expressing it in every walk, and in reflecting it
constantly to your fellow-men.Having learned that, you are ready to
live.Remember, there is no luck, no such thing as chance.The cause
of everything that can possibly come to you lies within yourself.The thought that you allow to enter
your mentality and become active there, later becomes externalized.Be, oh, so careful, then, about your thought, and the basis upon which
it rests!For, in your writing, you have no right to inflict false
thought upon your credulous fellow-mortals.""But," he replied, "we are told that in literature we must deal with
human realities, and with things as they are.The human mind exists,
and has to be dealt with.""The human mind does not exist, Sidney, except as supposition.The world still awaits the one who will show
it things as they _really_ are.Human realities, so-called, are the
horrible, ghastly unrealities of carnal thought, without any basis of
the divine Christ-principle.I know, we are told that the great books
of the world are those which preserve and interpret its life.is
it true greatness to detail, over and over again in endless recital,
the carnal motives of the human mind, its passions and errors, its
awful mesmerism, its final doom?Yes, perhaps, on one condition: that,
like a true critic, you picture human concepts only to show their
unreality, their nothingness, and to show how they may be overcome.""But most books--"

"Ah, yes, most books are written only to amuse the dispirited human
mind for a brief hour, to make it forget for a moment its troubles.They are literary narcotics; they are sops to jaded appetites, that's
all.A book, for example, that pictures an injured man discovering a
great treasure, and then using it to carry out his schemes of
revenge--well, what influence for good has such a work?It is only a
stimulus to evil, Sidney.But had it shown him using that great wealth
to bless his persecutors and turn them from their mesmerism to real
life and good--"

"Such things don't happen in this world, Carmen.""But they could, and should, Sidney dear.Then will come the new literature, the literature of _good_!And it
will make people think, rather than relieve them from the ennui of
solid thought, as our present novels do.The intellectual palate then
will find only insipidity in such books as pour from our presses now.The ability to converse glibly about authors who wallow in human
unrealities will then no longer be considered the hall-mark of
culture.Culture in that day will be conformity to truth.""Little sister," he said,
"you are a beautiful idealist.""But," came her quick reply, "are you not a living illustration of the
practicability of my idealism, Sidney?"The boy choked, and tears filled his eyes.Carmen stole an arm about
him."The most practical man who ever lived, Sidney dear, was Jesus.He had ideas that differed very
radically from other people's, but he did not hide them for fear of
giving offense.He was not afraid to shock people with the truth about
themselves.He tore down, yes; but he then reconstructed, and on a
foundation of demonstrable truth.He was not afraid to defy the
Rabbis, the learned, and the puffed-up.He did not bow abjectly before
the mandarins and pedagogues.Had he done so, and given the people
what they wanted and were accustomed to, they would have made him a
king--and his mission would have been a dead failure!""And for that they slew him," returned the boy."It is the cowardly fear of slaughter, Sidney, that keeps people from
coming out and standing for what they know to be right to-day.You are
not one of those cravens.""But the people who do that, Carmen, are called demagogues and
muck-rakers!""And the muck-rakers, Sidney, have made a sorry mess,
haven't they?They destroy without ruth, but seldom, if ever, put
forth a sane suggestion for the betterment of conditions.They traffic
in sensationalism, carping criticism, and abuse.'To find fault,' said
Demosthenes, 'is easy, and in every man's power; but to point out the
proper remedy is the proof of a wise counselor.'The remedy which I
point out, Sidney, is the Christ-principle; and all I ask is that
mankind seek to demonstrate it, even as Jesus bade us do.He was a
success, Sidney, the greatest success the world has ever known.Because he followed ideals with utter loyalty--because he voiced
truth without fear--because he made his business the service of
humanity.He took his work seriously, not for money, not for human
preferment, but for mankind.And his work bears the stamp of
eternity.""You're _not_ afraid, Sidney!""Oh, why
does the human mind always look for and expect that which it does not
want to see come or happen!"The boy laughed heartily at the quick sally of her delightfully
quotidian thought."You didn't let me finish," he said."I was going
to say that I'm afraid if I write and speak only of spiritual things I
shall not be understood by the world, nor even given a hearing.""Well, don't use that word 'afraid.'how the human mind clings to
everything, even words, that express its chief bogy, fear."And yet, has anything, written or
spoken, ever endured as his spiritual teachings?The present-day novel
or work of fiction is as fleeting as the human thought it attempts to
crystallize.Of the millions of books published, a handful endure.Those are they which illustrate the triumph of good over evil in human
thought.And the greatest of such books is the Bible.""Well, I'm hunting for a subject now."It will drive you to the task of transcribing it.Sidney--perhaps I can give you the subject!Perhaps I am the channel for this, too!""Well," bending over closer to her,
"what is it, little sister?"The girl looked out over the dripping shrubs and the soft snow.She saw a man, a priest, she knew not
where, but delving, plodding, digging for the truth which the human
mind has buried under centuries and centuries of material _debris_.She saw him, patiently bearing his man-made burden, striving to shield
a tender, abandoned girl, and to transfer to her his own great worldly
knowledge, but without its dross.She saw the mighty sacrifice, when
the man tore her from himself, and thrust her out beyond the awful
danger in which he dwelt.It was love--aye, the love that alone makes men great, the love
that lays down human life in self-immolating service.I will tell
you the whole beautiful story.It is an illustration of the way love
works through human channels.And perhaps--perhaps, some day, the book
may reach him--yes, some day.And it will tell him--oh, Sidney, it
will tell him that I know, and that I love him, love him, love him!"*       *       *       *       *

In the office of the manager of the Express three heads were close
together that morning, and three faces bore outward evidence of the
serious thought within."Miss Wall tells me, Ned," Hitt was saying, "that her father used to
be associated with Ames, and that, at his demise, he left his estate,
badly entangled, for Ames to settle.Now it transpires that Ames has
been cunning enough to permit Miss Wall to draw upon his bank almost
without limit, he making up any deficit with his own personal notes.""I think I see the shadow of his fine hand!""And now," resumed Hitt, "she is given to understand that Ames has
been obliged by the bank examiner to withdraw his personal notes as
security for her deficits, and that the revenue from her estate must
be allowed to accrue to the benefit of the Ames bank until such time
as all obligations are met.""In other words, Elizabeth is simply
cut off!"And now, another thing: Madam Beaubien's lawyer called on
her to-day, and informed her that Hood had gone into court and secured
an injunction, tying up all revenue from her estate until it can be
unraveled."Ames is out to do up
the Express, eh?""There is no doubt of it, Ned," returned Hitt seriously."And to
utterly ruin all connected with it.""Then, by God, we'll fight him to the last ditch!""I think you forget, Ned, that we have a lady with us," nodding toward
Miss Wall, "and that you are seriously trying to reform, for Carmen's
sake.""I beg your pardon, Elizabeth," said Haynerd meekly."I really am
trying to be decent, you know.But when I think of Ames it's like a
red rag to a bull!""Of course," Hitt continued, "oil still flows from our paternal wells.But in order to raise money at once I shall be obliged either to sell
my oil holdings or mortgage them.They have got to take care of us all
now, including Madam Beaubien."There's another anomaly: while Ames is trying to
ruin us, that girl is saving his son."I--I beg your pardon,
Elizabeth.The fact is, either you or I will have to retire from this
meeting, for I'm getting mad.I like to hear your sulphurous
language to-day.It helps to express my own feelings," replied the
woman."The circulation of the Express," Hitt went on, "is entirely
artificial.Our expense is tremendous, and our revenue slight.And
still Carmen insists on branching out and putting into practical form
her big ideas.Limitation is a word that is not in her vocabulary!""Hitt, can't we fight Ames with his own fire?"Ames is very cunning," answered Hitt."When he learned that the
cotton schedule had been altered in the Ways and Means Committee, he
promptly closed down his Avon mills.Then
he resumed, but on half time.I presume
he will later return to full time, but with a reduced scale of wages.This
way: he will force a strike at Avon--a February strike--four thousand
hands out in the cold.Meantime, he'll influence every other spinner
in the country to do likewise.Now, can
Congress stand up against that sort of argument?And, besides, he will
grease the palms of a large number of our dignified statesmen, you may
be sure!"Hitt," said Miss Wall, "I suggest that you send Carmen to Avon at
once.I know of no one who can get to the bottom of things as she can.Let her collect the facts regarding the situation down there, and
then--"

"Send her first to Washington!""Have her hang
around the lobbies of the Capitol for a while, and meet a lot of those
old sap-heads.What information she won't succeed in worming out of
them isn't in 'em, that's all!""But," objected Hitt, "if she knew that we would use her information
for a personal attack upon Ames, she'd leave us.""There's no objection to her getting the facts, anyway, is there?"demanded Haynerd, waxing hot again.I'll put a mortgage on my Ohio holdings at once.""I don't think I would be afraid," suggested Miss Wall."We might not
use the information Carmen may collect in Avon or Washington, but
something, I am sure, is bound to come out of it.Something always
comes out of what she does."All well and good," put in Haynerd."And yet, if she finds anybody
down there who needs help, even the President himself, she'll throw
the Express to the winds, just as she did in Sidney's case."No, that's true, Ned, for while we preach she's off somewhere
practicing.We evolve great truths, and she applies and demonstrates
them.But she has saved Sidney--her Christ did it through her.And she
has given the lad to us, a future valuable man.""Sure--if we are to _have_ any future," growled Ned."See here," retorted Hitt, brindling, "have we in our numerous
gatherings at Madam Beaubien's spoken truth or nonsense?If you
believe our report, then accept and apply it.Now who's to go to Avon
with Carmen?"Why, if those Magyars down there
discovered he was Ames's son, they'd eat him alive!"Then, turning to his
companions:

"Waite says he wants a meeting to-night.He'd like to report on his
research work.No
telling when we may get together again, if the girl--" He became
suddenly silent, and sat some time looking vacantly out through the
window."She goes to Avon to-morrow," he abruptly announced, "alone."His
thought had been dwelling on that'something not ourselves' which he
knew was shielding and sustaining the girl.CHAPTER 10


"We have now arrived at a subject whose interest and significance for
us are incalculable," said Father Waite, standing before the little
group which had assembled in their usual meeting place in the first
hours of the morning, for only at that time could Hitt and Haynerd
leave the Express."We have met to discuss briefly the meaning of that
marvelous record of a whole nation's search for God, the Bible.As
have been men's changing concepts of that'something not ourselves
that makes for righteousness,' so have been individuals, tribes, and
nations.The Bible records the development of these concepts in
Israel's thought; it records the unquenchable longings of that people
for truth; it records their prophetic vision, their sacred songs,
their philosophy, their dreams, and their aspirations.To most of us
the Bible has long been a work of profound mystery, cryptical,
undecipherable.And largely, I now believe, because we were wont to
approach it with the bias of preconceived theories of literal, even
verbal, inspiration, and because we could not read into it the record
of Israel's changing idea of God, from a wrathful, consuming Lord of
human caprice and passions, to the infinite Father of love, whom Jesus
revealed as the Christ-principle, which worked through him and through
all who are gaining the true spiritual concept, as is this girl who
sits here on my right with the lad whom you have seen rescued by the
Christ from the pit of hell."His voice choked when he referred to Carmen and Sidney.But he quickly
stifled his emotion, and went on:

"In our last meeting Mr.Hitt clearly showed us how the so-called
human mind has seemed to develop as the suppositional opposite of the
mind that is God; and how through countless ages of human reckoning
that pseudo-mind has been revealing its various types, until at
length, rising ever higher in the scale of being, it revealed its
human man as a mentality whose consciousness is the suppositional
activity of false thought, and which builds, incessantly, mental
concepts out of this kind of thought and posits them within itself as
material objects, as its own body, its universe, its all.And he
showed us how, little by little, that human mind's interpretations of
the infinite mind's true ideas became better, under the divine
infiltration of truth, until at last there developed a type, now known
to us as the Jewish nation, which caught a clearer glimpse of truth,
and became conscious of that'something not ourselves' which makes
for right-thinking, and consequent correct mental concepts and
externalizations.This, then, was the starting point of our religion.These first glimpses of truth, and their interpretations, as set forth
in the writings of the early Jewish nation, constitute the nucleus of
our Bible."But were these records exact statements of truth?The
primitive human mind could only lisp its wonderful glimpses of truth
in legend and myth.And so in fable and allegory the early Israelites
sought to show the power of good over evil, and thereby stimulate a
desire for right conduct, based, of course, on right-thinking.And
thus it is that the most significant thing in their sacred records is
their many, many stories of the triumph of the spiritual over the
material.Their right-thinking
became externalized outwardly in material abundance and physical
comfort.But the people's understanding was not sufficiently great to
shield them from the temptation which material wealth and power always
constitute.The mist of
materialism spread over it.Those wonderful flashes of truth ceased to
dart across their mental horizon.Their god became a magnified concept
of the human man, who dickered with them over the construction of his
temples, and who, by covenants, bribes, and promises, induced them to
behave themselves.And at length the beautiful vision
faded quite away."Then followed four hundred human years, during which the vicissitudes
of the Hebrew nation were many and dark.But during those long
centuries there developed that world wonder, a whole nation's united
longing for a deliverer!The prophets promised a great change in their
fallen fortunes.Though
their concept of Him had grossly degenerated, yet the deliverer would
come, he _must_!In the depths of their night--in the midst of the
heaviest darkness that ever lay over the world--there arose a great
light.Through the densest ignorance of the human mind filtered the
Christ-principle, and was set forth by the channel through which it
came, the man Jesus.Had there been a conference among God, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, to debate the sending of salvation to mankind, as
recorded by the poet Milton?what a crude, materialistic
conception.Had God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son?But God _is_ Love, infinite, unchanging.And His unique Son, the
Christ-principle, available to all mankind, was 'before Abraham.'Had
a great, dimly perceived principle been demonstrated, namely, that,
if we yearn long and earnestly for the right, it comes?Had the Jewish
nation 'demonstrated' the Christ?Had their centuries of looking and
expecting resulted in a saviour being manifested to them?It was a
period in the unfolding of human thought when civilization had reached
its lowest depths.Morality had evaporated to the dregs.Rome was
become the world's harlot.A few years more, and Nero would drag his
vulpine immorality across the stage.Paganism was virtue in comparison
with the lust of men in that dark hour.And yet, in the very midst of
it, appeared the most venerated, the most beloved man in all history,
bearing the Christ-message like a flaming torch!"'Always our being is descending into us,' said Emerson.But our true
being can be none other than infinite mind's idea of itself.Our true
individuality must be the way that mind regards us.And thus it was
that Israel's true being descended, filtering in through the thick
mists of error.That true being was the deliverer, _par excellence_,
for it was the message of truth that bade men deny themselves, their
carnal selves, and know but the one God, infinite mind.That was the
grace sufficient for them, that would have solved their problems, that
would have enabled them to lay off the 'old man' and his woes and
afflictions, and put on the 'new man,' divine mind's image.But the
carnal mind sought a material kingdom.It wanted, not spirit, but
matter.It cruelly rejected the message-bearer, and sought to kill his
message by slaying him on the cross.And thereby the Jewish nation
rent itself asunder, and sank into carnal oblivion.Ah, how they have
been cursed by the crucifixion of Jesus!"Men ask to-day: Did Jesus really live?Or is he a mythical character,
like the gods of pagan Rome?Let us ask, in making our reply, how
truth comes to mankind?Then the great sayings attributed to Jesus at least came from a human
being.Let us go further: it is the common history of mankind that
truth comes to the human mind only after a period of preparation.Not
conscious preparation, necessarily, but, rather, a preparation forced
by events.The truth of a mathematical principle can not come to me
unless I am prepared to receive it.And the greatest good comes to men
only after they have learned the nothingness of the material ambitions
and aims which they have been pursuing.By its own rottenness the
world had been made fallow for truth.The awfulness of its own
exposure in its rampant, unlicensed revels, had shown as never before
the human mind's absolute nothingness--its nothingness as regards real
value, permanence, and genuine good--in that first century of our
so-called Christian era.And when the nothingness of the carnal mind
was made plain, men saw the reality of the truth, as revealed in the
Christ, back of it all.The divine message was whispered to a human
mentality.And that mentality expanded under the God-influence, until
at last it gave to the sin-weary world the Christ-principle of
salvation.Let us call that human mentality, for convenience, the man
Jesus."And now, was he born of a virgin?It
was common enough in his day for virgins to pretend to be with child
by the Holy Ghost; and so we do not criticise those who refuse to
accept the dogma of the virgin birth.But a little reflection in the
light of what we have been discussing throws a wonderful illumination
upon the question.If matter and material modes are real, then we must
at once relegate the stories of the virgin birth, the miracles, the
resurrection, and the ascension to the realm of myth.If the so-called
laws of matter are real, irrefragable laws, then we indulgently, pass
by these stories as figments of heated imaginations.But, regarding
matter as a human, mortal concept, entirely mental, and wholly subject
to the impress and influence of mind, and knowing, as we do now, that
_mental concepts change with changed thought_, we are forced to look
with more favor upon these questions which for centuries caused men to
shed their fellows' blood.Hitt pointed out in our last meeting that mortal beings are
interpretations in mortal or human mind of the infinite mind, God, and
its ideas.The most perfect human interpretation of God's greatest
idea, Man, was Christ Jesus.The _real_ selfhood of every one of us is
God's idea of us.The world calls it the
'soul,' the 'divine essence,' and the 'immortal spark.'The Christ was
the real, spiritual selfhood of the man Jesus.So the Christ is the
real selfhood of each of us.It is not
conceived and brought forth in conformity with human modes.Now was
this great fact externalized in the immaculate conception and birth?It does not grow and decay and pass away in death.It is the 'unique'
Son of God which is back of each one of us.But the world has seen it
only once in its fullness, and then through the man Jesus."Something happened in that first century of the so-called Christian
era--something of tremendous significance.It was the
birth of the Christ-idea into the human consciousness.Was the
Christ-idea virgin-born?Aye, that it was, for God, infinite Mind,
alone was its origin and parent.The speculation which has turned
about that wonderful first century event has dealt with the human
channel through which the Christ-idea flowed to mankind.But let us
see what light our deductions throw even upon that."Referring all things to the realm of the mental, where we now
know they belong, we see that man never fell, but that Israel's idea
of God and man did fall, woefully.We see that the Christ-principle
appeared among men; we see that to-day it works marvels; we must
admit that throughout the ages before Jesus it had done so; we
know now that the great things which Israel is recorded to have
done were accomplished by the Christ-principle working through
men, and that when their vision became obscured they lost the
knowledge of that principle and how to use it.History records the
working of great deeds by that same Christ-principle when it was
re-born in our first century; and we also can see how the obscuring
of the spiritual by the material in the Emperor Constantine's time
caused the loss of the Church's power to do great works.We are
forced to admit the omnipotence, immanence, and eternality of the
Christ-principle, for it is divine mind, God himself.Moses, Elisha,
Elijah, the ancient prophets, all had primitive perceptions of truth,
and all became channels for the passing of the Christ-principle to
mankind in some degree.But none of these men ever illustrated that
principle as did the man Jesus.He is the most marvelous manifestation
of God that has ever appeared among mankind; so true and exact was
the manifestation that he could tell the world that in seeing him
they were actually seeing the Father.It is quite true that many
of his great sayings were not original with him.Great truths have
been voiced, even by so-called pagans, from earliest times.But he
demonstrated and made practical the truth in these sayings.And he
exposed the nothingness of the human mental concept of matter by
healing disease, walking the waves, and in other wonderful ways.It
is true that long before his time Greek philosophers had hit upon the
theory of the nothingness of matter.Plato had said that only ideas
were real.But Jesus--or the one who brought the Christ-message--was
the clearest mentality, the cleanest human window-pane, to quote
Carmen, that ever existed.Through him the divine mind showed with
almost unobscured fullness.God's existence had been discerned and
His goodness proved from time to time by prophets and patriarchs, but
by no means to the extent that Jesus proved it.There were those
before him who had asserted that there was but one reality, and that
human consciousness was not the real self.There were even those who
believed matter to be created by the force of thought, even as in
our own day._But it remained for Jesus to make those ideas
intensely practical, even to the overcoming and dissolution of his
whole material concept of the universe and man._ And it remained
for him to show that the origin of evil is in the lie about God.It
was his mission to show that the devil was 'a man-killer from the
beginning,' because it is the supposition that there is power apart
from God.It was his life purpose to show mankind that there is
nothing in this lie to cause fear, and that it can be overcome by
overcoming the false thought which produces it.By overcoming that
thought he showed men the evanescent nature of sickness and death.And sin he showed to be a missing of the mark through lack of
understanding of what constitutes real good."Turn now again to the Bible, that fascinating record of a whole
people's search for God and their changing concept of Him.Note that,
wherever in its records evil seems to be made real, it is for the
purpose of uncovering and destroying it by the vigorous statements of
truth which you will almost invariably find standing near the
exposition of error.So evil seemed very real in the first century of
our era; but it was uncovered by the coming of Jesus.The exposure of
evil revealed the Christ, right at hand.""But," protested Haynerd, "let's get back to the question of the
virgin birth.""But let us first consider what
human birth is.""Now you are touching my lifelong
question.If I am immortal, where was I before I was born?""Of which 'I' are you speaking, Ned?""The real
'I' is God's image and likeness, His reflection.It was never born,
and never dies.And therefore it will
cease to be.The human mind makes its own laws, and calls them laws of
nature, or even God's laws.Because
God is both Father and Mother to His children, His ideas, the human
mind has decreed in its counterfeiting process that it is itself both
male and female, and that the union of these two is necessary in order
to give rise to another human mind.Do you see how it imitates the
divine in an apish sort of way?And so elements of each sex-type of
the human mind are employed in the formation of another, their
offspring.The process is wholly mental, and is one of human belief,
quite apart from the usage of the divine Mind, who'spake and it was
done,' mentally unfolding a spiritual creation.The real 'you,' Ned,
has always existed as God's idea of Himself.It will come to light as the material 'you' is put off.The
material 'you' did not exist before it was humanly born.It was
produced in supposition by the union of the parent human minds, which
themselves were reflections of the male and female characteristics of
the communal mortal mind.It thus had a definite, supposititious
beginning."And so I'm doomed to annihilation, eh?"Your mortal sense of existence, Ned, certainly is doomed to
extinction.Oh, it doubtless
will not all be destroyed when you pass through that change which we
call death.It may linger until you have passed through many such
experiences.And so it behooves you to set about getting rid of it
as soon as possible, and thus avoid the unpleasant experience of
countless death-throes.You see, Ned, an error in the premise will
appear in the conclusion.Now you are starting with the premise that
the human 'you' is real.All that you reflect of divine mind will
endure permanently, but whatever you reflect of the lie regarding
that mind will pass away.Human beings know nothing of their origin,
nor of their existence._Because there is nothing to know
about them; they are entirely supposititious!_ Paul says, in his
letter to the Romans: 'They which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God.'The birth of the children of the
flesh is wholly a human-mind process.The infant mentality thus
produced knows nothing whatsoever of itself.It has no knowledge; is
not founded on truth.It will later manifest hereditary beliefs,
showing the results of prenatal mesmerism.Then it will receive the
general assortment of human thought and opinion--very little of it
based on actual truth--which the world calls education.Then it
learns to regard itself as an individual, a separate being.And soon
it attributes its origin to God.But the prenatal error will appear
in the result.The being manifests every gradation of human thought;
it grows; it suffers and enjoys materially; it bases its very
existence upon matter; it manifests the false activity of human
thought in material consciousness; and then it externalizes its
beliefs, the consentaneous human beliefs, upon its body and in its
environment; and finally, the activity of the false thought which
constitutes its consciousness ceases--and the being dies.Yes, its
death will be due to sin, to '_hamartio_,' missing the mark.And that, Ned, is human life, so-called."Death is not in any sense a cessation of life.The being who dies
never knew what it was to live.Death is the externalization of
human, mortal beliefs, which are not based upon real knowledge, truth.Paul said: 'They that are after
the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the
spirit the things of the spirit.'In other words, mankind are striving
terribly, desperately, to keep alive a sense of material, fleshly
existence.They are foredoomed to failure,
despite the discovery of antitoxins.In the book of Job we read: 'The
spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given
me life.'Where, then, is the reality in prenatal mesmerism and the
drag of heredity?It is all supposition, all a part of the one lie,
the'man-killer.'"The change called death comes to all mortals.It is the culmination
of the human mind's sense of limitation.It does not usher them into
immortal, illimitable bliss.It but leaves them upon another seeming
plane of mortal thought, there to drag out another sense of existence,
unless they have so learned the lesson which Jesus taught as to enable
them to overcome death.Why, then, do we waste our time
in trivial things; in the heaping up of useless money; in the vain
strife for sensual pleasures?The mortal will live and die, and live
and die, until at last he is beaten into line and forced to
demonstrate the Christ-principle.Hadn't we better begin that right
here and now?Wishing to die doesn't solve our problems.Suicide only
makes us start again, worse off than before.We shall overcome death
when we have overcome sin, for the physical manifestation called death
is but the externalization in conscious experience of spiritual
death--lack of a demonstrable understanding of Life, Truth, Spirit,
which is God, unlimited good.""And the Church, Protestant and Catholic, with their ceremonies, their
Masses, and--"

"They have woefully missed the mark, Ned.But I see protest rising in our good friends, Doctor Siler and
Reverend Moore, so I will hasten on, for we have much ground still to
cover."Now, knowing that birth is a humanly mental process, is it possible
that the man Jesus was 'born of a virgin'?Quite so; but, more, _no
man ever conceived and born in the way human beings are generated has
ever begun to approach Jesus in degree of spirituality_.If he had
been born in human ways, is it likely that he would ever have
developed such intense spirituality?Well, not in a brief thirty-three
years or so!And, on the other hand, if he had come into the world in
some way other than by being born of a woman, would he have been
understandable at all to the human mind?He would have
been wholly in the realm of the mental, far above human perception.If
he had been conceived by the union of the two sexes, as is the
mortal-mind mode of generation, would he not have been too material to
have so quickly developed that spirituality which made him the light
of the world at the age of thirty-three?The theory of the virgin birth at least seems to meet the
need of a sort of middle course, whereby the man should not be too
human to be the channel for the great measure of spirituality with
which he was endowed, and yet should be human enough to be appreciable
to other human minds."Remember, the Jesus who has been reported to us must have regarded
matter as unreal, as nothingness.And
they as plainly show that he came from the Father.His whole life was
such as to render the virgin birth almost a necessity, as I see it.And from a study of the Gospels I
simply can not avoid the conclusion that his knowledge of the allness
of God rendered matter such a nonentity to him that he overcame all
material laws, overcame the world of matter, and even at the last
dematerialized his material body.It's an astonishing thought--and
yet, who can show that it is not true?There are some things that
reason insists on our accepting, despite the paucity of human
records."Waite," said Doctor Morton, "that the Gospels
according to Mark and John make no mention of the virgin birth."And I will go further: Biblical
research during the past few years seems to have established the
conclusion that Mark's Gospel antedates the others, but that prior to
it there existed a collection of sayings by Jesus, called the _Logia_.This collection of sayings seems to have been originally written in
Aramaic, the language Jesus spoke.Now Matthew Arnold tells us that
the Gospel narratives passed through at least fifty years of oral
tradition before they became fixed in the form in which we now have
them.Of course it is quite possible that the story of the virgin
birth arose during those fifty years, for we can imagine how the life
of Jesus was then discussed!Matthew and Luke alone speak of the
virgin birth.Mark's Gospel we believe to have been written by Mark
himself.And we believe that Papias, who wrote about the middle of the
second century, spoke truly when he said: 'Mark having become (or
having been) Peter's interpreter, wrote all that he remembered (or all
that Peter related) though he did not (record) in order that which
was said or done by Christ.'In other words, even as Renan admits,
the Gospel of Mark must be taken as authentically his.Now Matthew's
Gospel depends for most of its data upon Mark and the Collection of
sayings.Mark's Gospel does not mention the virgin birth; the
Collection probably did.Also, Matthew probably did not write the
Gospel attributed to him; but he almost certainly did write the
Collection of sayings, from which in part the present Gospel according
to Matthew was compiled.Luke's Gospel was undoubtedly written by the
physician Luke, Paul's companion, and depended largely for its data
upon Mark's Gospel and the Collection of Matthew.Yet we can not say
that the omission of mention in the Gospels according to Mark and John
of the virgin birth renders the story a legend, in view of our own
present great knowledge of the constitution of matter, of material
laws, and of the fact that the virgin birth is at least rendered
credible by the subsequent very extraordinary career of Jesus.Moreover, remember that our New Testament is a small book, and that it
is quite probable that a great mass of literature existed on the
subject of Jesus and his work, and that it is possible that other of
the disciples wrote treatises, perhaps many of them.How many of these
touched on the subject of the virgin birth we may never know.But this conclusion at least we must accept: the
validity of the story of the virgin birth does _not_ rest with the
four Gospels which have come down to us out of the great mass of
literature which probably once existed.Rather is the probability of
the immaculate conception a function of our present knowledge of
matter, its pseudo-laws, and the great fact that the entire life of
Jesus as reported in all the Gospels lends weight to the belief that
his birth was not in the ordinary mortal-mind manner.""And I," said Carmen, "can not see that the origin of the human
channel through which the Christ-principle flowed to mankind is of any
consequence.Jesus said that it
existed before Abraham."It has been said that the
immaculate conception was the result of Mary's realization that real
man is the son of God.Certainly Jesus
did seem to manifest some such metaphysical idea.Perhaps Mary was a
woman of tremendous force of character.Perhaps it did come to her
that her son should be the Messiah of his race.Jesus certainly did
acquire the messianic consciousness--and thereby upheaved the world.But, whatever the human mode of birth, certainly the Christ-principle
was brought into the world because of the world's tremendous need.It is only the confusing of the Christ with the
man Jesus that is so largely responsible for the weakness of orthodox
theology."But now, referring again to the Bible, let me say that the Pentateuch
is composed of a variety of documents written by various authors.We
have no positive proof that Moses had aught to do with its authorship,
although parts of it may be based on data which either he originated
or sanctioned.The books of Samuel exhibit a plurality of sources.The
book of Isaiah was written to record the sayings of at least two
persons, both men of marvelous spiritual vision.The Song of Solomon
was originally probably a Persian love-poem.The book of Job
illustrates the human-mind problem of suffering, and the utter
inadequacy of philosophy to heal it.It is a ringing protest against
conventional theology."But it is with the New Testament that we are particularly concerned,
for we believe it to contain the method of salvation from human ills.None of the original documents are extant, of course.And yet, the
most searching textual criticism goes to show that the New Testament
books as we have them to-day are genuine reproductions of the original
documents, with but very little adulteration of erroneous addition by
later hands.I have already spoken of the first
three Gospels.The book of Acts certainly was written by the author of
the third Gospel, Luke.First Peter was composed by the disciple
Peter, or was written under his sanction.The Gospel of John and the
book of First John were written by one and the same author--but
whether by the disciple John or not, I can not say.If this great
disciple did not write the Fourth Gospel, at least his influence seems
to be felt all through it.The probability is that he knew what was in
it, and approved of it, although the actual composition may have been
by another, possibly a very learned Greek.To me, the Fourth Gospel is
the most masterly work ever composed by man.The criticism that John, being a Jew, could not have composed
it, falls before the greater truth that, having become a Christian, he
was no longer a Jew.For how could he have been
other, seeing that he had lived with Jesus?"And now as to Paul, who contributes about one-third of the New
Testament.I have mentioned the letters to the Thessalonians,
Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans as indisputably his.To these we
can add, with scarcely less weight of authenticity, Colossians,
Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians.As to the Epistles to Timothy
and Titus, there is still doubt.These letters were written to the
various Churches chronologically, as I have mentioned them.It has
been said that Jesus was way over the heads of his reporters.But--and
here is the important fact for us--Paul's letters exhibit a
marvelous spiritual growth in the man, and show him at last to be the
grand master-metaphysician of the Christian era.Has it ever
occurred to you that what the Gospels tell about is almost wholly
spiritual?The material is all but neglected by their composers.Indeed, with the questions of time and place, the Gospel narrators
seemed to have been but slightly concerned.But with the delineation
of the Christ--ah!In the light of
this great truth the apparent lack of harmony in the Gospel
narratives loses significance.And how little there is in the
Gospels of theology, of institution, of organization!How trifling are
creed and doctrine, how little are Catholicism and Protestantism,
compared with the stupendous fact that God is, and that His truth,
the Christ-principle, is still here to-day and available!"And so with Paul, he was expounding the'method and secret' of the
Christ.And he first had to work up to it himself.He may have
thought, when he wrote his first letter to the Thessalonians, that the
man Jesus would come again in the skies, with great pomp and
surrounded by the Saints.But in his second letter he states plainly
that the Christ will come when the 'old man' is laid off.Not much
occasion for misunderstanding there, I think.Indeed, after Jesus so
clearly stated that the kingdom of heaven was within men, the marvel
is that there could have arisen any confusion whatsoever on the
subject of the second coming of the Christ.""I believe," interposed Reverend Moore, "that the Epistle to the
Hebrews contains statements of belief in a judgment after death, in a
heaven, a hell, and everlasting life, not wholly consistent with your
remarks.""The Epistle to the Hebrews," returned Father Waite, "was not written
by Paul, nor is it quite consistent with his letters.But, read Paul's
wonderful eighth chapter of Romans.Read his third chapter of First
Corinthians.Read all his letters in the order in which I have
mentioned them, which was as they were written, and you can not fail
to grasp his marvelous expanding perception of the Christ-principle;
the nothingness of the material concept; the impotence of the lie that
opposes God, and constitutes all evil; and the necessity of
right-thinking if one would work out his salvation from the errors
that assail mankind.Paul shows that he passed through a 'belief
period,' and that he emerged into the light of demonstrable
understanding at last.If men had followed him they never could have
fallen into the absurd theological beliefs of foreordination, infant
damnation, the resurrection of the flesh, and all the other
theological horrors and atrocities of the centuries."Yes, the Bible is, as Arnold said, based on propositions which all
can verify.The trouble is, _mankind have not tried to verify them_!They have relegated all that to the life beyond the grave.I fear a
sorry disappointment awaits them, for, even as Paul says, they will be
after the change called death only what they were before.It is like
recovering from a case of sickness, for sickness and death are alike
manifestations of mortal thought.We awake from each still human,
still with our problems before us.We must break the mesmerism of the
belief that the practical application of Jesus' teachings must be
relegated to the realm of death, or to the unattainable.We must apply
the Christ-principle, and learn to hit the mark, for sin is always
weakness, never strength."And remember this: having acquired a knowledge of the Christ, we are
bidden to acknowledge him--that is, to _act-our-knowledge_.Many of
the world's philosophers have worked out great truths.But they have
rested content with that.Many scientists, knowing that matter is
unreal, nevertheless conduct themselves _as if it constituted the one
and only real fact of existence_!Then its
opposite _can not_ be real.The human mentality holds the belief that
there is something apart from God, spirit.That belief becomes
objectified in the human mentality as matter.And within matter is
contained all evil of every sort and name.Evil is not, as the
philosophers would have us believe, a lower form of good.It is not
'good in the making.'It is always error, the direct opposite of
truth.And if truth is real and eternal, error can not be.See the
grave mistake in which Emerson became enmeshed.He said: 'There seems
to be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms.'Now
follow that out to its logical conclusion.If spirit is synonymous
with God, then God manifests Himself in both good and evil, fair and
foul, life and death--and which is good, and which bad?No, my friends, rather accept Jesus' statement
that evil is the lie, of which no man need be afraid, and which all
must and shall overcome.And the 'old man,' with all his material
concepts of nature and the universe, must and will be laid off, thus
revealing the spiritual man, the image and likeness of the one divine
Mind."Now, just a few words about miracles, the great stumbling block to
the acceptance of the Gospels.Are they, together with the entire
Gospel narrative, legendary?If so, they must have arisen during
those fifty years between Jesus and the recording of the narratives.But this very period is covered by Paul's letters, which record his
thought.And even the most relentless of Bible critics admit the
genuineness of Paul's authorship of the Epistles to the Romans,
the Corinthians, the Thessalonians, and the Galatians.If the
Gospel narratives are legends, they grew up and found acceptance in
fifty years.A pretty fair miracle in itself, when we take into
consideration the inherent incredulity of the human mind!As Dean
Farrar says: 'Who would have _invented_, who would have merely
_imagined_, things so unlike the thoughts of man as these?'"Now Paul must have been acquainted with men who had seen and known
Jesus.And we are forced to admit that Paul was a very strong, sane
man.These legends could not have grown up in his day and been
accepted by him.And as long as there were men living who had known
Jesus--and that must have been as late as the last quarter of the
first century--the true events of Jesus' life could hardly have given
way to a set of childish legends.As a matter of recorded fact, the
various Christian Churches had accepted Jesus within thirty years of
the crucifixion.And, too, the words of Paul and the Synoptists were
written at a time when the sick were still being healed and even the
dead raised by the practical application of Jesus' teachings.Hence,
miracles did not astonish them."Our own inability to perform the works attributed to Jesus is hardly
sufficient ground for denying the belief that he really did them.Certainly that the greater portion of the New
Testament was written by a few fishermen, a publican, and a tentmaker
is one of the most stupendous miracles on record!And the miracle of
miracles is Jesus Christ himself!Because Jesus is reported to have
healed the sick, raised the dead, and walked the waves, all in
opposition to material laws--the so-called laws of nature--the world
says the reports are fantastic, that they are fables, and that his
reporters were hypnotized, deluded!And yet I tell you that he did not
break a single law!He did act in defiance of the so-called testimony
of the physical senses, which has always been accepted by mankind as
law.We now know what that sense-testimony is--human, mortal thought.And because he did so,
he instantaneously healed the sick.A miracle expresses, not the
beliefs of the human mind, but the law of God, infinite mind, and
makes that law conceivable to the human mentality.God's laws are
_never_ set aside, for by very definition a law is immutable, else it
ceases to be law.But when the human mind grows out of itself
sufficiently to perceive those laws and to express them to its
fellow-minds, the result is called a miracle.Moreover, the ability to
perform miracles is but a function of spirituality.A miracle is a
sign of one's having advanced to such a degree of spirituality as to
enable him to rise above material consciousness and its limitations,
which are called laws.The consciousness that knows no evil will
perform miracles.These works
were the'signs following,' and attested their knowledge of the
allness of God.Carmen--"

"Lewis!"Carmen _knew_ that no power opposed to God
could hold Sidney.She broke a human-mind, so-called law, a limitation.She
proved God's law of harmony and holiness--wholeness--to be omnipresent
and omnipotent.And, mark me, friends, _every one of us must learn to
do likewise_!Not only must the Church obey Jesus and do the works
which he did, but every individual will have to do them himself.""His works were done for a special reason, Mr.Waite," interposed
Reverend Moore."They were to testify to his messiahship.Father Waite silently regarded the minister for some moments.Then he
went on gently:

"It seems incredible that the plain teachings of Jesus could have
been so warped and twisted as they have been by orthodox theology.Why should even the preachers themselves
condemn the one who seeks to obey Christ?Moore, the real man
is God's highest idea of Himself.The human mind makes mental concepts
of God's man.And Jesus was the grandest concept of God's idea of
Himself that the human mind has ever constructed by means of its
interpretations.One of his grandest
characteristics was his implicit obedience to his vision of the
Father.And he demanded just as implicit obedience from us.But he
bade us, again and again, _heal the sick and raise the dead_!"And Asa had his physicians to whom he turned--with the result
that he'slept with his fathers.'There is no more ironical statement
in the whole Bible than that.We turn to our physicians because we
have no faith in God._Materia medica_ physicians do _not_ heal the
sick.They sometimes succeed in causing the human mind temporarily to
substitute a belief of health for a belief of disease that is all.But Jesus and the early Christians healed by true prayer--the prayer
of affirmation, the prayer that denied reality to evil, and affirmed
the omnipotence of God.And that was done through an understanding of
God as immutable law, or principle."demanded Reverend Moore, with a note
of contempt in his voice."I prefer my own concept of God, as one who
hears our petitions, and pities us, and not as a lifeless principle!"Moore," replied Father Waite, "in that He is
'_that by which all is_.'And in order to be such He must be, as the
Bible says, 'the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.'He must be
immovable, regardless of human pleading and petition.And so true
prayer, the prayer that draws an answer, is not an objective appeal to
Him, but is an intelligent application of the Christ-principle to all
our problems and needs.Such prayer will remove mountains in
proportion to the understanding and motive back of it.And such prayer
does not seek to inform the Almighty of the state of affairs here
among men, informing Him that evil is real and rampant, and begging
that He will stoop down and remove it.It is the prayer that manifests
man's oneness with the infinite mind as its image, reflecting a
knowledge of the allness of good and the consequent unreality and
powerlessness of evil, the lie about it.It was healing by such
prayer, Mr.Moore, that the Episcopal Synod rejected only recently.Instead of doing the healing themselves by means of the principle
given them, they still plead with God, the immovable and immutable, to
do it for them, provided the very uncertain science of _materia
medica_ fails."The true method of prayer was employed by the early Christians, until
the splendid vision of the Christ became obscured and finally lost to
the Church by its bargaining with Constantine for a mess of pottage,
namely, temporal power.Then began to rise that great worldly
institution, the so-called Holy Church.In the first half of the sixth
century Justinian closed the schools of philosophy at Athens.For a
while Judaizing Christianity continued its conflict with Gnosticism.And then both merged themselves into the Catholic form of faith, which
issued forth from Rome, with Christian tradition grafted upon
paganism.Theology and ritualism divided the gospel of healing the
sick and saving the sinner into two radically different systems,
neither of which is Christian, and neither of which can either heal or
save.Since then, lip-service and ceremonial have taken the place of
healing the sick and raising the dead.The world again slipped back
steadily from the spiritual to the material, and to-day ethics
constitutes our religion, and stupid drugs hold sway where once sat
enthroned the healing Christ-principle."Waite, that I have Catholic leanings myself,"
said Doctor Siler."I don't like to hear either my religion or my
profession abused.""My criticism, Doctor," replied Father Waite, "is but an exposure of
the entrenched beliefs and modes of the human mind.""But, sir, the Church is a great social force, and a present
necessity.""The worth of a belief as a social force, Doctor, must be ascertained
from its fruits.The Roman Church has been an age-long instigator of
wars, disorders, and atrocious persecutions throughout the world.Its
assumption that its creed is the only religious truth is an insult to
the world's expanding intelligence.Its arrogant claim to speak with
the authority of God is one of the anomalies of this century of
enlightenment.Its mesmeric influence upon the poor and ignorant is a
continuous tragedy."Are you unmindful of the Church's schools and
hospitals?"Nor am I ignorant of the fact that the success of
Christianity is _not_ measured by hospitals.Rather, their continuance
attests the lamentable failure of its orthodox misinterpretation.I do not want to see this splendid country
forced into the iron shackles of priestcraft."cried Haynerd, pounding the table with his
fist."The time has passed when a man can say, 'My church, be she
right or wrong, but my church!'and insist that it shall be forced
upon us, whether we like it or not!""Doctor," continued Father Waite, "the Romanist has always missed the
mark.He prayed to a God of love to give him power to exterminate
heretics--those who differed with him in belief.But he prayed with
iniquity, hatred, murder in his heart; and God, who is too pure to
know evil, heard him not.Prayer is the affirmation of omnipotent
_good_.Is it good to murder one's fellow-men?The Psalmist wrote: 'If
I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.'That is why
the Church's prayers and curses have failed, and why she herself is a
failing institution to-day.I say this in pity, not in malice.""I, sir, believe in a religion that can hate," returned the doctor."Christianity is as much a religion of hate as of love--hatred of all
that is evil and opposed to the revealed Word of God.""And thereby your religion will fail, and has failed, for God is love.You, by your hatred of what you consider evil, make evil real.Indeed,
the Church has always emphasized evil as a great and living reality.How could it ever hope to overcome it then?Your Church, Doctor, has
little of the meekness of the Christ, and so, little of his strength.Its numbers and great material
wealth do not constitute power.Its assumptions remind me of the
ancient Jews, who declared that God spent much of His time reading
their Talmud.You will have to lay aside, Doctor, all of it, and turn
to the simple, demonstrable teachings of Jesus.When you have learned
to do the works he did, then will you have justified yourself and your
faith."While Father Waite was speaking, Carmen had quietly risen and taken
her place at the piano.When he concluded, she began to play and sing
softly.As the sweet melody flowed out through the room the little
group became silent and thoughtful.Again it was that same weird
lament which the girl had sung long before in the Elwin school to
voice the emotions which surged up in her during her loneliness in the
great city.In it her auditors heard again that night the echoing
sighs of the passive Indians, enslaved by the Christian Spaniards.Hitt's head sank upon his breast as he listened.Haynerd tried to
speak, but choked.The Beaubien buried her face in her hands and wept
softly.The lines about Doctor Siler's mouth relaxed, and his lips
trembled.He rose quietly and went around to where Father Waite sat."My friend--" He bent and took Father Waite's hand.Father Waite sprang to his feet and threw an arm about the doctor."We
are more than that, Doctor," he whispered.And in
reality we are both, here and now, beloved children of God."Then he nodded to the others, and took his
departure.As he passed the piano Carmen rose and seized his hand."You know, Doctor, that we love you, don't you?""Your love," he murmured, as he bent over her hand, "is from the
Christ.Nay, it _is_ the Christ himself among us!"He would have said more, but his voice broke.When Hitt, Reverend Moore, and Doctor Morton had left, Haynerd, who
had remained for a moment to speak to Father Waite, turned to the
Beaubien."Madam," he said, "Mr.But--" He stopped and looked at Carmen."Well,
if I mistake not, his quietness this evening indicated his belief that
this might be our last meeting for some time."Then, abruptly:

"Telephone me, Carmen, if anything of interest comes up to-morrow in
Avon."The Beaubien turned quickly to the girl."You are going to Avon
to-morrow?There was a look of fear in her
eyes.Carmen drew the woman to her, then stooped and kissed her cheek."Mother dearest, I go to Avon with my God."CHAPTER 11


The town of Avon, two hours from New York, lay along Avon creek, from
which its first manufacturing industries derived their motive power.Years before, when it was little more than a barren stretch of sand,
some enterprising soul had built a cotton mill there, with only a few
primitive looms.As the years passed, and kindly Congresses reared
about the industry a high protective wall, the business prospered
marvelously.But shortly after the death of the senior Ames the
company became involved, through mismanagement, with the result that,
to protect itself, the house of Ames and Company, the largest
creditor, was obliged to take over its mills.At first, J. Wilton Ames was disposed to sell the assets of the
defunct company, despite the loss to his bank.But then, after a visit
of inspection, and hours of meditation on certain ideas which had
occurred to him, he decided to keep the property.The banging of the
looms, the whirr of the pickers, the sharp little shrieks of the
spinning machines, fascinated him, as he stood before them.They
seemed to typify the ceaseless throbbing of his own great brain.They
seemed, too, to afford another outlet for that mighty flood of
materialistic thought and energy which flowed incessantly through it.And so he set about reorganizing the business.He
familiarized himself with every detail of the cotton market.He was
already well versed in the intricacies of the tariff.And soon the
idle machinery was roaring again.Soon the capacity of the mills was
doubled.And soon, very soon, the great Ames mills at Avon had become
a corporate part of our stupendous mechanical development of the
century just closed.When Carmen stepped from the train that morning she stood for a moment
looking uncertainly about her.Everywhere on one side as far as she
could see were low, ramshackle frame houses; a few brick store
buildings stood far up the main street; and over at her right the
enormous brick mills loomed high above the frozen stream.The dull
roar of the machinery drifted through the cold air to her ears.Up the
track, along which she had just come, some ragged, illy clad children
were picking up bits of coal.She went directly to them, and asked their names."Anton Spivak," answered one of the children dully, when she laid a
hand on his shoulder."Over dere," pointing off to the jungle of decrepit sheds."Me an'
him, we worked in de mills; but dere ain't no work fer us now."Take me to your home," she said firmly."Dere ain't nobody to home," he
replied."De ol' man an' woman works in de mills daytimes.""Come-a home wi' me," spoke up the boy's companion, a bright-faced
little urchin of some ten years who had given his name as Tony Tolesi.Carmen looked at him for a moment.Up the main street of the town they went for a short distance, then
turned and wended their course, through narrow streets and byways,
down toward the mills.In a few minutes they were in the district
where stood the great frame structures built by the Ames company to
house its hands.Block after block of these they passed, massive,
horrible, decrepit things, and at last stopped at a grease-stained,
broken door, which the little fellow pushed open.Carmen followed shivering, close after the boy, while
he trotted along, proud of the responsibility of conducting a visitor
to his home.At the far end of the hall the lad plunged into a narrow
staircase, so narrow that a stout man could not have mounted it.Up
four of these broken flights Carmen toiled after him, and then down a
long, desolate corridor, which sent a chill into the very marrow of
her bones."Dis is where we lives, Missy," announced the little fellow."Miss-a
Marcus, she live in dere," pointing to the door directly opposite.He pushed open the door before which they had halted.A rush of foul
air and odors of cooking swept out.They enveloped the girl and seemed
to hurl her back.A black-haired woman, holding a crying baby in her
arms, rose hastily from an unmade bed at one side of the room.Two
little girls, six or eight years of age, and a boy still younger,
ranged about their mother and stared in wide-eyed wonder."Dis-a lady, she come to visit," announced Carmen's guide abruptly,
pointing a dirty finger at her.The woman's face darkened, and she spoke harshly in a foreign tongue
to the little fellow."She say," the boy interpreted, as a crestfallen look spread over his
face, "she say she don't spik _Inglese_.""But I speak your language," said the girl, going quickly to her and
extending a hand.Then, in that soft tongue which is music celestial
to these Neapolitan strangers upon our inhospitable shores, she added,
"I want to know you; I want to talk to you."A littered, greasy cook stove
stood in one corner.Close to it at either end were wooden couches,
upon which were strewn a few tattered spreads and blankets, stained
and grimy.A broken table, a decrepit chest of drawers, and a few
rickety chairs completed the complement of furniture.The walls were
unadorned, except for a stained chromo of the Virgin, and the plaster
had fallen away in many places.Several of its panes were broken and stuffed with rags and papers.At the sound of her own language the woman's expression changed.A
light came into her dull eyes, and she awkwardly took the proffered
hand.Then, sweeping
the girl's warm attire with a quick glance, "You are rich!I am rich, yes, but not in money."The woman turned to her children and sent the little brood scattering.At another sharp command little Tony set out a soiled, broken chair
for Carmen.But before the girl could take it the woman's voice again
rose sharply."You are--what do
you say?You come with your gay party to look us over and go
away laughing!But reaching out, she gently lifted the heavy
baby from the woman's arms and sat down with it.For a moment she
patted its cheeks and bent tenderly over it.Then she looked up at the
bewildered mother."I have come here," she said softly, "because I love you."She turned dully and sat down
on one of the begrimed beds.Her little ones gathered about her, their
soiled fingers in their mouths, or clutching their tattered gowns, as
they gazed at the beautiful creature who had suddenly come into their
midst."I am not from the mission," replied the girl gently."I have come to
talk, not of heaven, but of earth, and of you, and of Tony," smiling
down into the eager face of the little boy as he stood before her."You can't take
any of my children!The judge took Pietro Corrello's boy last
week--but you can't have mine!"I don't want your children," said Carmen, smiling up at the
frightened, suspicious mother.I want you to help me to
help all of these people here who need us.The mills are running only
half time, aren't they?But we,
you and I, are going to make things better for them, for everybody
here, aren't we?"But first," she went on hastily, to further allay the poor woman's
fears and to check additional protest, "suppose we plan our dinner.Let's see, Tony, what would you like?"He glanced
inquiringly at his mother; but no sign came from her.Then he could no
longer contain himself:

"Spaghetti!"Carmen drew out her purse and turned to the woman."While we are gone, Tony and the children will wash the dishes
and set the table.For a moment the woman looked uncomprehendingly at the girl, then at
her children, and then about the miserable room in which they were
huddled.Amazement and confusion sat upon her heavy features.Then
these gave way to another dark look of suspicion.She opened her
mouth--

But before she could voice her resentment, Carmen rose and threw an
arm about her.Then the girl quickly drew the startled woman to her
and kissed her on the cheek."Come," she whispered, "get your shawl.God's universal language is the language of love.All nations, all
tribes understand it.The flood-gates, long barred, swiftly opened,
and the tired, miserable woman sank sobbing upon the bed.She could
not comprehend what it was that had come so unannounced into her
dreary existence that cold winter morning.People were not wont to
treat her so.Her life had been an endless, meaningless struggle
against misery, want, grinding oppression.People did not put their
arms around her and kiss her thus.They scoffed at her, they abused
her, they fought with her!She hated them, and the world in which she
lived!"I know, I know," whispered Carmen, as she drew the sobbing woman's
head upon her shoulder.She drew back, and a frightened, superstitious look came into her
face."Yes," said Carmen softly, taking the cue, "I am an angel, right from
heaven.Now you are no longer afraid of me, are you?The woman rose mechanically and took up her thin shawl.Carmen gave a
few directions to the gaping children.And as she went out into the
bleak hall with the woman she heard one of them whisper in tones of
awe:

"Tony, she said she--she was--an angel!Get down on your knees
and cross yourself!"*       *       *       *       *

Upward to the blue vault of heaven, like the streaming mists that
rise through the tropic moonlight from the hot _llanos_, goes the
ceaseless cry of humanity.Oh, if the god of the preachers were real,
his heart must have long since broken!Upward it streams, this
soul-piercing cry; up from the sodden, dull-brained toiler at the
crashing loom; up from the wretched outcast woman, selling herself
to low passions to escape the slavery of human exploitation; up from
the muttering, ill-fed wreck, whose life has been cashed into
dividends, whose dry, worthless hulk now totters to the scrap heap;
up from the white-haired, flat-chested mother, whose stunted babes
lie under little mounds with rude, wooden crosses in the dreary
textile burial grounds; up from the weak, the wicked, the ignorant,
the hopeless martyrs of the satanic social system that makes
possible the activities of such human vultures as the colossus
whose great mills now hurled their defiant roar at this girl, this
girl whose life-motif was love.Close about her, at the wretched little table, sat the wondering group
of children, greedily gorging themselves on the only full meal that
they could remember.And with them sat the still bewildered mother,
straining her dark eyes at the girl, and striving to see in her a
human being, a woman like herself.At her right sat the widow Marcus,
who lived just across the hall.Her husband had been crushed to death
in one of the pickers two years before.The company had paid her a
hundred dollars, but had kept back five for alleged legal fees.She
herself had lost an arm in one of these same pickers, long ago,
because the great owner of the mills would not equip his plant with
safety devices.said the mother at length, as a sense of the reality of
life suddenly returned to her.Tony hurriedly swept the contents of his plate into his mouth, and
went for the battered dinner pail."My man goes to work at six-thirty in the morning," she explained to
Carmen, when the little fellow had started to the mills with the pail
unwontedly full."And he does not leave until five-thirty.He was a
weaver, and he earned sometimes ten dollars a week.And so he had to take a job as carder.He earns
about eight dollars a week now."But you can't live on that, with your children!""Yes, we could," replied the woman, "if the work was steady.You see, if I could work steady, and the children too, we could
live.And I am not nearly so worn out as he is.I
have several years left in me yet."The widow Marcus, who spoke the language from an association with
Italian immigrants since childhood, added her comments from time to
time.She was a gray-haired, kindly soul, bearing no enmity toward the
man to whom she had yielded her husband's life and her own."A man's no good in the mills after he's fifty," she said."You see,
Miss, it's all piece-work, and a man has to be most terribly spry and
active.The strain is something awful, day after day, in the noise and
bad air, and having to keep your eyes fixed on your work for ten hours
at a stretch; and he wears out fast.Then he has to take a job where
he can't make so much.And when he's about fifty he's no good for the
mills any more.""Well, if he hasn't any children, he goes to the poor-house.But, if
he has, then they take care of him.""Yes, they've got to, Miss.The little ones must work in the mills,
too.These mills here take them on when they are only twelve, or even
younger.Tony has worked there, and he is only ten.It's against the
law; but Mr.The company paid me some money two years ago, and I
haven't spent all of it yet.I'm pretty
spry with one arm.""But--you do not pay rent for your home?"Ames--the man whose machines killed your
husband and took off your arm--you still pay rent to him, for one
little room?"Why, his company gave me almost a
hundred dollars, you know!I was lucky, for when Lizzie Sidel's man
lost his hand in the cog wheels he went to law to sue the company, and
three years afterward the case was thrown out of court and he had to
pay the costs himself.But he was a picker-boss, and got nine dollars
a week."A little hand stole up along Carmen's arm.She looked down into the
wondering face of the child."I--I just wanted to see, _Signorina_, if
you were real.""I have been wondering that myself, dear," replied the girl, as her
thought dwelt upon what she had been hearing."I must go now, Miss," said the widow Marcus, rising."I promised to
drop in and look after Katie Hoolan's children this afternoon."Then I will go with you," Carmen announced."But I will come back
here," she added, as some little hands seized hers."If not to-day,
then soon--perhaps to-morrow."Marcus, and entered the doorway
which led to the little inner room where dwelt the widow.There were a
dozen such rooms in the building, the latter informed her.This one in
particular had been shunned for many years, for it had a bad
reputation as a breeder of tuberculosis.But the rent was low, and so
the widow had taken it after her man was killed.It contained a broken
stove, a dirty bed, and a couple of unsteady chairs.The walls were damp, and the paper which had once covered them
was molding and rotting off."It won't stay on," the widow explained, as she saw the girl looking
at it.The
creek overflows and runs into the basement.They call this the
'death-room.'"Carmen shuddered when she looked about this fearful human
habitation.Yet, "The only death to be feared," said Paracelsus, "is
unconsciousness of God."Was this impoverished woman, then, any less
truly alive than the rich owner of the mills which had robbed her of
the means of existence?And can a civilization be alive to the Christ
when it breeds these antipodal types?"Ames's
methods are the epitome of hell!But he is ours, and the worthy
offspring of our ghastly, inhuman social system.We alone are to
blame that he debauches courts, that he blinds executives, and that he
buys legislatures!We let him make the laws, and fatten upon the
prey he takes within their limits.Aye, he is the crafty, vicious,
gold-imbruted manifestation of a whole nation's greed!"Nay, more, he
is the externalization of a people's ignorance of God.Carmen's throat filled as she watched the old woman bustling about the
wretched room and making a feeble attempt at order."You see," the widow went on, happy in the possession of an auditor,
"there is no use making apologies for the looks of my room; I couldn't
make it look much better if I tried.We have
to get water from the hydrant down back of the house.It is pumped
there from the creek, and it's a long climb up these stairs when
you've got only one arm to hold the bucket.And I have to bring my
coal up, too.The coal dealer charges extra for bringing it up so
far."Carmen sat down on an empty box and watched her.The woman's lot
seemed to have touched the depths of human wretchedness, and yet there
burned within her soul a something that the oppression of human
avarice could not extinguish."It's the children, Miss, that I think about," she continued."It's
not so bad as when I was a little one and worked in the cloth mills in
England.I was only six when I went into the mills there.I worked
from seven in the morning until after six at night.And the air was so
bad and we got so tired that we children used to fall asleep, and the
boss used to carry a stick to whip us to keep us awake.My parents
died when I was only eight.They worked in the Hollow-ware works, and
died of lead poisoning.People only last four or five years at that
work.""How many children are employed in these mills here?""I want to see them," said the girl, and there was a hitch in her
voice as she spoke."You can go down and watch them come out about six this evening.But now I must hurry to look after the Hoolan
babes."When she again reached the street Carmen turned and looked up at the
hideous structure from which she had emerged; then she drew a long
breath.The foul air of the "death-room" seemed to fill her lungs as
with leaden weights.The dim light that lay over the wretched hovel
hung like a veil before her eyes."Katie lives a block down the street," said the widow, pointing in the
direction.These tenements don't have
fire-escapes, and the one she lived in burned to the ground in an
hour.She lived on the second floor, and got out.It seemed to Carmen as she listened to the woman that the carnal
mind's chamber of horrors was externalized there in the little town of
Avon, existing with the dull consent of a people too ignorant, too
imbruted, too mesmerized by the false values of life to rise and
destroy it.All that cold winter afternoon the girl went from door to door.There
was no thought of fear when she met dull welcomes, scowls, and
menacing glances.In humble homes and wretched hovels; to Magyar,
Pole, Italian alike; to French Canadian, Irish and Portuguese; and to
the angry, the defiant, the sodden, the crushed, she unfolded her
simple banner of love, the boundless love that discriminates not, the
love that sees not things, but the thoughts and intents of the heart
that lie behind them.And dark looks faded, and tears came; withered
hearts opened, and lifeless souls stirred anew.She knew their
languages; and that knowledge unlocked their mental portals to her.She knew their thoughts, and the blight under which they molded; and
that knowledge fell like the sun's bright rays upon them.She knew
God, their God and hers; and that knowledge began, even on that dull,
gray afternoon, to cut into the chains of human rapacity which
enslaved them.At six that evening she stood at the tall iron gate of the mill yard.Little Tony was at her side, clutching her hand.A single electric
lamp across the street threw a flickering, yellow light upon the snow.The great, roaring mills were ablaze with thousands of glittering
eyes.Suddenly their monster sirens shrieked, a blood-curdling yell.Then their huge mouths opened, and a human flood belched forth.They were not the image and likeness
of God, these creatures, despite the doctrinal platitudes of the
Reverend Darius Borwell and the placid Doctor Jurges.They were not
alive, these stooping, shuffling things, despite the fact that the
religiously contented Patterson Moore would argue that God had
breathed the spirit of life into the thing of dust which He created.And these children, drifting past in a great, surging throng!Fathers
and mothers of a generation to come!Carmen knew that many of them,
despite their worn looks, were scarcely more than ten years old.These
were the flesh and blood upon which Ames, the jungle-beast, waxed
gross!Upon their thin life-currents floated the magnificent
_Cossack_!Yes, she was right, evil can _not_ be
really known.There is no principle by which to explain the hideous
things of the human mind.And then she wondered what the Reverend
Darius Borwell did to earn that comfortable salary of ten thousand a
year in his rich New York church."It's quite a sight, ain't it, Miss?"He was a man of medium height,
young, and of Irish descent."It's a great sight," he continued, with a touch of brogue in his
tones.he cried, catching a passing workman's arm."He ain't worked to-day, Father," replied the man, stopping and
touching his cap.The young priest uttered an exclamation of displeasure.Then, as the
workman started away:

"You'll be at the Hall to-night, Fagin?The man addressed nodded and gave an affirmative grunt, then passed on
into the darkness."It's trying to reach a few of 'em I am," remarked the priest.When a man's stomach's empty he hasn't much respect
for morality.And I can't feed the lot of 'em!"Carmen gazed into the kindly blue eyes of the priest and wondered."No--but I am interested in my fellow-beings."I've some rooms, some on Main street,
which I call the Hall, and some down in the--well, the bad district,
which I call the Mission.They're reading rooms, places for men to meet,
and get acquainted, and rest, and talk.The Hall's for the fellows
who work, like this Fagin.The Mission's for the down-and-outs.""But--are your rooms only for--for men of your faith?""Race or
religion don't figure.It's to give help to every man that needs it.""And you are giving your life to help these people?""I want to see your Hall and Mission.Take me to them," she abruptly
demanded.He looked down at little Tony,
and then up at Carmen again."We will leave the boy at his door, and then go to
your Mission and Hall.Now tell me, you are a Roman Catholic priest?""Yes," he said mechanically, following her as she started away."How did you happen to get into this sort of work?""Oh, I've been at it these ten years!"he returned, now recovered from
his surprise, and pleased to talk about his work."I'd had some
experience in New York in the Bowery district.I came to the
conclusion that there were mighty few down-and-outs who couldn't be
set upon their pins again, given half a chance by any one sufficiently
interested.You see, Miss, I believe in my
fellow-men.Oh, it's only
temporary, I know.It ain't going to change the whole social system.But it helps a bit--and I like it."But," he continued more seriously, "there's going to be trouble here.And it's going to be a bad one."I've written him several times of late.But it's not
much I see he's doing, except to go on sucking the blood from these
poor devils down here!"They soon reached the tenement where Tony lived, and Carmen asked the
priest to go up with her."No," he said, "the good woman doesn't like priests.And my labors
don't reach the women anyway, except through the men.It was only by making many promises that Carmen could at last get away
from the little group on the fourth floor.But she slipped a bill into
Tony's hands as she went out, and then hurriedly crossed the hall and
opened the unlocked door of the widow Marcus's room.Carmen pinned a five-dollar bill upon the pillow and hastened
out."Now," said the priest, when the girl had joined him in the street
below, "it ain't right to take you to the Mission--"

"We'll go there first," the girl calmly announced.By the way, there's a telephone in your place?I want to call up
the health officer.I want to report the condition of these
tenements.""It won't do any good, Miss.I've camped on his
heels for months.If he
gets too troublesome to those higher up, why, he gets fired.He isn't here to report on conditions, but to
overlook 'em."You mean to say that nothing can be done in regard to those awful
buildings which Mr.Ames owns and rents to his mill hands?""It's criminal to let such buildings stand.Meanwhile, the priest was
studying his fair companion, and wondering who she might be.At length
he inquired if she had ever been in Avon before."Haven't seen Pillette's house then?He's resident manager of the Ames
mills.We can go a little out of our way and have a look at it."A few minutes later they stood at the iron gate of the manager's
residence, a massive, brown stone dwelling, set in among ancient trees
in an estate of several acres, and surrounded by shrubs and bushes."Does he know all about those tenements
down there?""Ah, that he does; and cares less.And he knows all about the terrible
hot air in his mills, and the flying lint that clogs the lungs of the
babies working there.He sees them leave the place, dripping with
perspiration, and go out into the zero temperature half naked.And
when they go off with pneumonia, well he knows why; and cares less.He
knows that the poor, tired workers in that great prison lose their
senses in the awful noise and roar, and sometimes get bewildered and
fall afoul of belts and cogs, and lose their limbs or lives.And he wouldn't put safety devices
over his machines, because he doesn't care.I've written to him a
dozen times about it.But--

"And then Pillette," he continued; "I've asked him to furnish his
hands with decent drinking water.They work ten and twelve hours in
that inferno, and when they want to drink, why, all they have is a
barrel of warm water, so covered with lint that it has to be pushed
aside in order to get at the water.Why, Pillette don't even give 'em
change rooms!He won't give 'em decent toilet rooms!Seems to me that when a man can give a ball and send
out invitations on cards of solid gold, he can afford to give a
thought to the thousands who have toiled and suffered in order to
enable him to give such a ball, don't you?"The memory came back now
in hot, searing thoughts."Oh, he catches 'em coming and going!""You see,
he manipulates Congress so that a high tariff law is passed,
protecting him from imported goods.Then he runs up the prices of his
output.That hits his mill hands, for they have to pay the higher
prices that the tariff causes.Oh, no, it doesn't result in increased
wages to them.He is
the only one who profits by high tariff on cotton goods.She might not know that Ames periodically appeared
before Congress and begged its protection--nay, threatened, and then
demanded.She might not know that Senator Gossitch ate meekly from the
great man's hand, and speciously represented to his dignified
colleagues that the benefits of high protective duties were for "the
people" of the United States.She might not know how Hood, employed to
evade the laws enacted to hedge and restrain his master, bribed and
bought, schemed and contrived, lobbied, traded, and manipulated, that
his owner might batten on his blood-stained profits, while he kept his
face turned away from the scenes of carnage, and his ears stopped
against the piteous cries of his driven slaves.But she did know how
needless it all was, and how easy, oh!how pitiably easy, it would be
to remedy every such condition, would the master but yield but a
modicum of his colossal, mesmeric selfishness.She did not know, she
could not, that the master, Ames, made a yearly profit from his mills
of more than two hundred per cent.But she did know that, were he less
stupidly greedy, even to the extent of taking but a hundred per cent
profit, he would turn a flood of sunshine into hundreds of sick,
despairing, dying souls."This is the place," she heard the priest say, his voice seeming to
come from a long distance.They were in front of an old,
two-story building, decrepit and forbidding, but well lighted.While
she gazed, the priest opened the door and bade her enter."This down here is the reading room," he explained.Upstairs is my office, and sleeping rooms for men.Also a
stock of old clothes I keep on hand for 'em when I send 'em out to
look for work.I've clothed an average of four men a day during the
past year, and sent 'em out to look for jobs.I board 'em, and keep
'em going until they land something.Sometimes I have to lend 'em
money.No, I never bother about a
man's religion.Carmen climbed the rough steps to the floor above and entered the
small but well-kept office of the priest."Now here," he said, with a touch of pride, "is my card-index.I keep
tab on all who come here.When they get straightened up and go out to
hunt work, I give 'em identification cards.Just as soon as I can get
funds I'm going to put a billiard table back there and fit up a little
chapel, so's the Catholic men who drift in here can attend service.You know, a lot of 'em don't have the nerve to go to a church.Carmen looked at the man in admiration."We haven't either of us asked the other's name," she said."I've been dying to know yours," he
replied."I'm Father Magee, Daniel Magee.Oh, give any name; it doesn't matter,
just so's I'll know how to address you."And I am from South America," said the girl
simply.*       *       *       *       *

An hour later the girl rose from her chair."I shall have to wait and
visit the Hall another time," she said."I must catch the eight-thirty
back to the city.But--"

"I'll never see you go down this tough street to the depot alone!"averred the priest, reaching for his hat.But she gratefully accepted the proffered escort.Two
of Father Magee's assistants had come in meanwhile, and were caring
for the few applicants below."You're right, Miss Carmen," the priest said, as they started for the
train.It eats my heart out to
see the suffering of these poor people!"At eleven o'clock that night Carmen entered the office of the city
editor of the Express."Ned," she said, "I've been with Dante--no,
Danny--in Inferno.I want expense
money--a good lot--so that I can leave to-morrow night."Haynerd's eyes dilated as he stared at the girl.But what did you find down in Avon?""I'll write you a detailed report of my trip to-morrow.I'm going home
now," she replied.CHAPTER 12


It is sometimes said of the man who toils at forge or loom in this
great commonwealth that he is fast forgetting that Washington is
something more significant to him than what is embraced in the
definition of the gazetteers.Not so, however, of that class of the
genus _homo_ individualized in J. Wilton Ames.He leaned not upon such
frail dependence as the _Congressional Record_ for tempered reports of
what goes on behind closed legislative doors; he went behind those
doors himself.He needed not to yield his meekly couched desires to
the law-builders whom his ballot helped select; he himself launched
those legislators, and gave them their steering charts.But, since the
interpretation of laws was to him vastly more important than their
framing, he first applied himself to the selection of judges, and
especially those of the federal courts.With these safely seated and
instructed at home, he gave himself comfortably to the task of holding
his legislators in Washington to the course he chose.Carmen had not spent a day at the Capital before the significance of
this fact to the common citizen swept over her like a tidal wave.If
the people, those upon whom the stability of the nation rests, looked
as carefully after appointments and elections as did Ames, would their
present wrongs continue long to endure?And after she
had spent the day with the Washington correspondent of the Express, a
Mr.Sands, who, with his young wife, had just removed to the Capital,
she knew more with respect to the mesmerism of human inertia and its
baneful effects upon mankind than she had known before.And yet, after that first day of wandering through the hallowed
precincts of a nation's legislative halls, she sat down upon a bench
in the shadow of the Capitol's great dome and asked herself the
questions: "What am I here for, anyway?And
instinct with her, as we have said, was unrestrained dependence upon
her own thought, the thought which entered her mentality only after
she had first prepared the way by the removal of every obstruction,
including self.At the breakfast table the second morning after her arrival in the
city, Mr.Sands handed her a copy of the Express.Among the editorials
was her full report upon conditions as she had found them in Avon,
published without her signature.Following it was the editor's
comment, merciless in its exposition of fact, and ruthless in its
exposure of the cruel greed externalized in the great cotton industry
in that little town.Carmen rose from the table indignant and protesting.Hitt had said he
would be wise in whatever use he made of her findings.But, though
quite devoid of malignity, this account and its added comment were
nothing less than a personal attack upon the master spinner, Ames.And
she had sent another report from Washington last night, one comprising
all she had learned from Mr.She
must get in touch with him at once.So she set out to find a telegraph
office, that she might check the impulsive publisher who was openly
hurling his challenge at the giant Philistine.When the message had gone, the girl dismissed the subject from her
thought, and gave herself up completely to the charm of the glorious
morning and her beautiful environment.For some time she wandered
aimlessly about the city; then bent her steps again toward the
Capitol.At the window of a florist she stopped and looked long and lovingly at
the gorgeous display within.In the midst of the beautiful profusion a
single flower held her attention.It was a great, brilliant red rose,
a kind that she had never seen before."We call it the 'President' rose, Miss," said the salesman in response
to her query.And when she went out with the splendid flower burning on her bosom
like living fire, she was glad that Hitt had not been there to see her
pay two dollars for it.The great Capitol seemed to fascinate her, as she stood before it a
few moments later.The mighty
sentiments and motives which had actuated the framers of the
Constitution seemed to loom before her like monuments of eternal
stone.Had statesmanship degenerated from that day of pure patriotism
into mere corruption?"Why, my dear girl,
the people of your great State are represented in the national Senate
by--whom?By the flies on the panes; by the mice in
the corners; by the god, perhaps, to whom the chaplain offers his
ineffectual prayers; but not by men.No; one of your Senators
represents a great railroad; the other an express company!Those Senators know no such ridiculous creature as 'the people'!"She turned from the Capitol, and for an hour or more strolled in the
brilliant sunlight."An economic disease," she murmured at length.And, like all disease, it is mental.It is a
disease of the human conscience.It comes from the fear of separation
from good.It all reduces to the belief of separation from God--the
belief that upon men's own human efforts depend all the happiness and
satisfaction they can have.Why, I have never known anything but
happiness and abundance!And yet, _I have never made a single effort
to acquire them_!"For the girl saw not the past vicissitudes of her
life except as shadowy mists, which dimmed not the sun of her joy.There was a tramping of horses' feet.It struck her, and brushed her to one side.She strove to hold
herself, but fell.The man and his companion were off their horses instantly, and
assisted the girl to her feet.asked the one who had been riding ahead."I called to
you, but you didn't seem to hear."laughed the girl, recovering her breath, and stooping to
brush the dust from her dress."Well, I'm glad to hear that!Perhaps you had better come in with
us."The girl raised her head and looked into his face with a bright smile.The man's anxious expression slowly changed into one of wonder, and
then of something quite different.The girl's long, thick hair had
been loosened by the fall, and was hanging about her shoulders.Framed
in the deep brown profusion was the fairest face he had ever looked
upon; the most winning smile; the most loving, compassionate glance."You'll have to come in now, and let the maid help you," he said
firmly."And I'll send you home in an auto."New York," replied Carmen, a little confused as she struggled vainly
with her hair."Oh, I'm not going to fuss with it any more!""Yes, I'll go with you, and let the maid do it up.She glanced about her, and then up the avenue toward which the men had
been riding.A flush suddenly spread over her face, and she turned and
looked searchingly at the man."You--you--live--in--there?"she stammered, pointing toward the
distant house."And you are--"

"Yes," he replied, coming to her assistance, but evidently greatly
enjoying her embarrassment, "I am the President."Then her hand stole mechanically to the rose flaming upon her bosom."I--I guess I know why I bought this now," she said softly.Quickly
unpinning it, she extended it to the man."I was bringing it to you,
wasn't I?"The picture was one that would have rejoiced an artist: the simple
girl, with her tumbled hair and wonderful face, standing there in the
glorious sunlight, holding out a single rose to the chief executive of
a great nation.The President bowed low and took the proffered flower.But the one who gives it is far more so."Then he bade his companion take the two horses to the stable, and
motioned to Carmen to accompany him."I was just returning from my morning ride," he began again, "when you
happened--"

"Things _never_ happen," interrupted the girl gently.He looked at her with a little quizzical side glance."Then you didn't
happen to be in the way?""I was obeying the law of cause and
effect.""A desire to see you, I guess.Or, perhaps, the _necessity_ of seeing
you.And because I wanted to see you in the interests of good, why,
evil seemed to try to run over me.""But why should you wish to see me?""Because you are the head of a wonderful nation.Then:

"You came down from New York to talk with me?""I think I came all the way from South America to see you," she said.There is a revolution in progress down there now.Did you
come to see me about that?I can do nothing--"

The girl shook her head."No," she said, "it's to prevent a revolution
here in your own country that I think I have come to see you."They had by now reached the door of the Executive Mansion.Entering,
the President summoned a maid, and turned the big-eyed girl over to
her."Bring her to my office," he directed, "when she is ready."A little later the nameless girl from Simiti again stood before the
President of the United States."I have an important conference at ten," he said, glancing at a clock."But we have a few minutes before that time.Will you--may I ask you
to tell me something about yourself?"he added, looking
apprehensively at her while he set out a chair.The girl drew the chair close to his desk and sat down."I know
nothing about accidents," she said quietly.Then, turning quite from
that topic, she drew the President quickly into her thought and
carried him off with her as on a magic carpet.From time to time he turned and
stared at his strange visitor.At other times he made notes of points
which impressed him.Once he interrupted, when she made reference to
her past life."This priest, Jose de Rincon, might he not have been
imprisoned as a political offender?""I do not know," the girl replied tenderly."My foster-father,
Rosendo, did not mention him in the two letters which I have
received."The President nodded; and the girl went rapidly on.Soon she was deep
in the problem presented by Avon.But at the mention of that town, and of its dominating genius, the
President seemed to become nervous.At length he raised a hand, as if
to end the interview."I fear I can do nothing at present," he said with an air of
helplessness."But," she protested, "you have the public welfare at heart.And can
you not see that public welfare is the welfare of each individual?"Ames well," the President replied, somewhat irrelevantly."He, like all men of great wealth, presents a serious problem,
doubtless.But he himself, likewise, is confronted by problems of very
trying natures.We must give him time to work them out.""It's like getting at the essence of Christianity,"
she said."The world has had nearly two thousand years in which to do
that, but it hasn't made much of a start as yet."But," the President resumed reflectively, "after all, it is the
people who are wholly responsible for the conditions which exist among
them.They have the means of remedying every economic situation, the
ballot.It is really all in their hands, is it not?They elect their
public officers, their judges, and their lawmakers.""You too," she said, "take refuge in the cant
of the age.Yes, the people do try to elect public servants; but by
some strange anomaly the servant becomes master the moment he enters
the door of office.And then
they, and you, sit helplessly back and cry, No use!And if the people
rise, their servants meet them with a hail of lead.It's really
childishly ridiculous, isn't it?when you stop to consider it
seriously."She leaned her elbows upon the desk, and sat with chin in her hands,
looking squarely into the eyes of the President."So you, the head of this great nation, confess to utter helplessness,"
she slowly said.A servant entered at that moment with a card.The President glanced at
it, and bade him request the caller to wait a few moments.Then, after
some reflection:

"The people will always--"

The door through which the servant had passed was abruptly thrown
open, and a harsh voice preceded the entrance of a huge bulk."I am not accustomed to being told to wait, Mr.President," said the
ungracious voice."My appointment was for ten o'clock, and I am here
to keep it."Then the newcomer stopped abruptly, and stared in amazement at the
young girl, sitting with her elbows propped upon the desk, and her
face close to that of the President.His
attention was centered upon the girl who sat looking calmly up at him.A dark, menacing scowl drew his bushy eyebrows together, and made the
sinister look which mantled his face one of ominous import to the
person upon whom it fell.Carmen was the first to break the tense silence.With a bright smile
illuming her face she rose and held out a hand to the giant before
her."We meet pretty often, don't
we?"Ames ignored both the greeting and the extended hand.Turning upon the
President, he said sharply: "So, the Express seeks aid in the White
House, eh?"Ames," said Carmen quickly, answering for the President."It
seeks to aid the White House.""Might I ask," he said in a tone of mordant
sarcasm, "how you learned that I was to be here this morning?I would
like to employ your methods of espionage in my own business.""I would give anything if you _would_ employ my methods in your
business," returned the girl gently.The President looked in embarrassment from one to the other."I think,
Miss Carmen," he said, "that we must consider our interview ended.A peculiar expression had come into Ames's features.President," he said in a tone pregnant with
meaning."I am glad to have a representative of the New York press
with us to hear you express your attitude toward the cotton
schedule."His
indignation mounted, but he checked it."The schedule has been reported out of committee," he replied briefly."I am aware of that," said Ames."And your influence with Congress in
regard to it?""Shall the Avon mills be closed pending a decision?Or, on the
assumption that Congress will uphold the altered schedule, must the
Spinners' Association begin immediate retrenchment?As president of
that Association, I ask for instructions.""My influence with Congress, as you well know, Mr.Ames, is quite
limited," replied the hectored executive."It is not a question of the _amount_ of your influence with that
body, Mr.President," returned Ames coldly, "but of how you will
employ that which you have."Silence lay upon them all for some moments.Then Ames resumed:

"I would remind you," he remarked with cruel insinuation, "that--or,"
glancing at the girl, "perhaps I should not make this public."He
paused and awaited the effect of his significant words upon the
President.Then, as the latter remained silent, he went on evenly:

"Second-term prospects, you are aware, are often very greatly
influenced by public facts regarding the first election.Of course we
are saying nothing that the press might use, but--well, you must
realize that there is some suspicion current as to the exact manner in
which your election was--"

"I think you wish to insinuate that my election was due to the
Catholic vote, which you controlled in New York, and to your very
generous campaign contributions, do you not?I see no reason for
withholding from the press your views on the subject.""But, my friend, this is an age of investigation, and of suspicion
toward all public officials.And such rumors wouldn't look well on the
front pages of the press throughout the country.Of course, our young
friend here isn't going to mention them to her superiors; but,
nevertheless, they ought to be suppressed at once.Their effect upon
your second-term prospects would be simply annihilating.Now I am in a
position to greatly assist in the matter of--well, in fact, I have
already once offered my aid to the Express.And I stand ready now to
join with it in giving the lie to those who are seeking to embarrass
the present administration.Miss Carmen is with us--"

"Mr.Ames," the girl quietly interrupted, "I wish _you_ were with
_us_.""But, my dear girl, have I--"

"For then there would be no more suffering in Avon," she added.Then it was you who wrote that misleading stuff in the Express,
eh?May I ask," he added with a contemptuous
sneer, "by whose authority you have visited the houses occupied by my
tenants, without my permission or knowledge?I take it you were down
there, although the cloudy weather must have quite dimmed your
perception.""Yes," she answered in a low voice, "I have been there.Yes, I visited your charnel houses and your cemeteries.I held their trembling hands, and stroked their
hot brows.I fed them, and gave them the promise that I would plead
their cause with you."But you first come here to--"

"It was with no thought of seeing you that I came to Washington, Mr.If I cross your path often, it must be for a purpose not yet
revealed to either of us.Perhaps it is to warn you, to awaken you, if
not too late, to a sense of your desperate state."You are drunk, you know, drunk with greed.And such continuous
drunkenness has made you sick unto death.It is the same dread disease
of the soul that the wicked Cortez told the bewildered Mexicans he
had, and that could be cured only with gold.Ames, that you are mesmerized by the evil which is always using you."She stood close to the huge man, and looked straight up into his face.He remained for a moment motionless, yielding again to that
fascination which always held him when in her presence, and of which
he could give no account to himself.That slight, girlish figure--how
easily he could crush her!"But you couldn't, you know," she said cryptically, as she shook her
head.He recoiled a step, struck by the sudden revelation that the girl had
read his thought.Ames," she continued, "what a craven error is before
truth.It makes a coward of you, doesn't it?Your boasted power is
only a mesmerism, which you throw like a huge net over your victims.You and they can break it, if you will.""We really must consider our
interview ended."I guess the appointment was made for to-day," the girl said softly."And by a higher power than any of us.Ames is the type of man who
is slowly turning our Republican form of government into a despotism
of wealth.He boasts that his power is already greater than a czar's.You bow before it; and so the awful monster of privilege goes on
unhampered, coiling its slimy tentacles about our national resources,
our public utilities, and natural wealth.I--I can't see how you, the
head of this great nation, can stand trembling by and see him do it.He made as if to reply, but restrained himself.A stern look then came into the
President's face.Then he
turned again to his desk and sat down."Please be seated," he said, "both of you.I don't know what quarrel
there is between you two, and I am not interested in it.But you, Miss
Carmen, represent the press; Mr.The things which have
been voiced here this morning must remain with us alone.Now let us
see if we can not meet on common ground.Is the attitude of your
newspaper, Miss Carmen, one of hostility toward great wealth?""The Express raises its voice only against the folly and wickedness of
the human mind, not against personality," replied the girl.We attack only the human thought which manifests in him.We
oppose the carnal thought which expresses itself in the folly, the
madness of strife for excessive wealth.It is that strife that makes
our hospitals and asylums a disgraceful necessity.It makes the
immigrant hordes of Europe flock here because they are attracted by
the horrible social system which fosters the growth of great fortunes
and makes their acquisition possible.Our alms-houses and prisons
increase in number every year.It is because rich men misuse their
wealth, trample justice under foot, and prostitute a whole nation's
conscience."They do not all--"

"It is a law of human thought," said Carmen in reply, "that mankind in
time become like that which has absorbed their attention.Rich men
obey this law with utmost precision.They acquire the nature and
character of their god, gold.They rapidly grow to be like that which
they blindly worship.They grow
metallic, yellow, calloused, unchanging, and soulless, like the coins
they heap up.There is the great danger to our country, Mr.And it is against the human thought that produces such beings--thought
stamped with the dollar mark--that the Express opposes itself."She hesitated, and looked in the direction of Ames.Then she added:

"Their features in time reveal to the world their metallic thought.Their veins shrivel with the fiery lust of gold.And then, at last, they crumble and sink into the dust of
which their god is made.And still their memories continue to poison
the very sources of our national existence.You see," she concluded,
"there is no fool so mired in his folly as the man who gives his soul
for great wealth.""A very enjoyable little sermon, preached for my benefit, Miss
Carmen," interposed Ames, bowing to her."And now if you have finished
excoriating my poor character," he continued dryly, "will you kindly
state by whose authority you publish to the world my affairs?"The maudlin sentimentalism of such as you make us all suffer!""Hadn't we better sing a hymn
now?You'll be wiser in a few years, I hope."Ames, by what right you own
mines, and forests, and lands?"By the divine right of law, most assuredly," he retorted.I have learned," she
continued, turning to the President, "that a bare handful of men own
or control all the public utilities of this great country.But," abruptly, "you believe in God, don't you?"He nodded his head, although with some embarrassment.His religion
labored heavily under political bias.She looked down at the floor, and sat silent for a while."Divine
right," she began to murmur, "the fetish of the creatures made rich by
our man-made social system!'The heavens are thine, the earth also is
thine: as for the world and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded
them.'But, oh, what must be the concept of God held by the rich, a
God who bestows these gifts upon a few, and with them the privilege
and divine consent to oppress and crush their fellow-men!What a low
order of intelligence the rich possess!An intelligence wherein the
sentiments of love and justice have melted into money!"President," put in Ames at this juncture, "I think we have spent
quite enough time moralizing.Suppose you now indicate your attitude
on the cotton tariff.Her sparkling eyes looked right into the
President's."I admire the man," she said,
"who dares to stand for the right in the face of the great taboo!There are few men nowadays who stand for anything in particular."exclaimed Ames, aware now that he had made a mistake in
permitting the girl to remain, "I wish my interview to be with you
alone, Mr."I have embarrassed you both, haven't I?"But first--"

She went to Ames and laid a hand on his arm."I wish--I wish I might
awaken you," she said gently."There is no victim at Avon in so
desperate a state as you.More gold will not cure you, any more than
more liquor can cure a slave to strong drink.You do not know that you
are hourly practicing the most despicable form of robbery, the
wringing of profits which you do not need out of the dire necessities
of your fellow-beings."She stopped and smiled down into the face of the man.This girl always dissected his soul with a smile on
her face."I wish I might awaken you and your poor victims by showing you and
them that righteousness makes not for a home in the skies, but for
greater happiness and prosperity for everybody right here in this
world.Don't you really want the little babies to have enough to eat
down there at Avon?Do you really want the President to support you in
the matter of the cotton schedule, and so increase the misery and
sorrow at your mills?that one's greatest
happiness is found only in that of others."She stood looking at him
for a few moments, then turned away.The President rose and held out his hand to her.She almost laughed as
she took it, and her eyes shone with the light of her eager, unselfish
desire."I--I guess I'm like Paul," she said, "consumed with zeal.Anyway,
you'll wear my rose, won't you?""And--you are not a bit afraid about a second term, are you?As for
party principle, why, you know, there is only _one_ principle, God.He
is the Christ-principle, you know, and that is way above party
principle."Under the spell of the girl's strange words every emotion fled from
the men but that of amazement."Righteousness, you know, is right-thinking.And that touches just
that about which men are most chary, their pocketbooks."Then she arched her brows and said naively:
"You will find in yesterday's Express something about Avon.You will
not use your influence with Congress until you have read it, will
you?"A deep quiet fell upon the men, upon the great executive and the great
apostle of privilege.It seemed to the one that as the door closed
against that bright presence the spirit of night descended; the other
sat wrapped in the chaos of conflicting emotions in which she always
left him."She's the bastard daughter of a <DW64> priest," replied Ames in an
ugly tone.cried the thoroughly angered Ames, bringing a huge
fist down hard upon the desk.And, what's
more, she's head over heels in love with another renegade priest!"But that's neither here nor there," he continued savagely."I want to
know what you are going to do for us?""I--I do not see, Mr.Ames, that I can do anything," replied the
President meditatively."Well--will you leave the details to us, and do as we tell you then?"the financier pursued, taking another tack."Yes--about the girl, you--"

"Damn the girl!""I've got proofs that will ruin
her, and you too--and, by God, I'll use 'em, if you drive me to it!You seem to forget that you were elected to do our bidding, my
friend!"For a long time he sat
staring at the floor."It was wonderful," he said,
"wonderful the way she faced you, like David before Goliath!There
isn't a vestige of fear in her make-up.I--we'll talk this matter over
some other time, Mr.roared Ames, his self-control flying to the
winds."I can ruin you--make your administration a laughing-stock--and
plunge this country into financial panic!Do you do as I say, or
not?"The President looked the angry man squarely in the eyes."I do not,"
he answered quietly.CHAPTER 13


"It's corking!cried Haynerd, when he and Hitt had
finished reading Carmen's report on her first few days in Washington."Makes a fellow feel as if the best thing Congress could do would be
to adjourn for about fifty years, eh?But
she's a wonder, Hitt!And she's booming the Express to the skies!That's why she is so--as the
Mexicans say--_simpatico_.""Well, not with you, I hope!""No, unfortunately," replied Haynerd, assuming a dejected mien, "but
with that Rincon fellow--and he a priest!He's got a son down in
Cartagena somewhere, and he doesn't write to her either.She's told
Sid the whole story, and he's working it up into a book during his odd
moments.But, say," turning the conversation again into its original
channel, "how much of her report are we going to run?You know, she
tried to head us off.As if she
hadn't already attacked him and strewn him all over the field!""We'll have to be careful in our allusions to the President," replied
Hitt."I'll rewrite it myself, so as not to offend her or him.her reports are the truth, and they rightfully
belong to the people!The Express is the avowed servant of the
public!I see no reason for
concealing a thing.Did I tell you that I had two inquiries from
Italian and German papers, asking permission to translate her reports
into their own columns?"Did you wire her to see
Gossitch and Mall?""Yes, and Logue, as well as others.And I've put dozens of senators
and congressmen on our mailing list, including the President himself.I've prepared letters for each one of them, calling attention to the
girl and her unique reports.She certainly writes in a fascinating
vein, doesn't she?Meanwhile, she's circulating around down there and
advertising us in the best possible manner.he finished, slapping the city editor roundly upon the back."Confine your enthusiasm to words, my
friend.Say, what did you do about that liquid food advertisement?""Discovered that it was beer," replied Hitt, "and turned it firmly
down."Not that we care to advertise it, but--"

Hitt laughed."When that fellow Claus smoothly tried to convince me
that beer was a food, I sent a sample of his stuff to the Iles
chemical laboratory for analysis.They reported ninety-four per cent
water, four per cent alcohol--defined now as a poisonous drug--and
about two per cent of possible food substance.If the beer had been of
the first grade there wouldn't have been even the two per cent of
solids.You know, I couldn't help thinking of what Carmen said about
the beer that is advertised in brown bottles to preserve it from the
deleterious effects of light.Light, you know, starts decay in beer.Well, light, according to Fuller, is 'God's eldest daughter.'Emerson
says it is the first of painters, and that there is nothing so foul
that intense light will not make it beautiful.Thus the light of truth destroys the fermentation which
is supposed to constitute the human mind and body.So light tries to
purify beer by breaking it up.The brewers have to put it into brown
bottles to preserve its poisonous qualities.As Carmen says, beer
simply can't stand the light.It's astonishing that so many so-called reputable papers will
take their advertising stuff.It's just as bad as patent medicine
ads."And I note that the American public still spend their annual
hundred million dollars for patent medicine dope.Most of this is
spent by women, who are largely caught by the mail-order trade.I
learned of one exposure recently made where it was found that a widely
advertised eye wash was composed of borax and water.The cost was
somewhere about five cents a gallon, and it sold for a dollar an
ounce.Nice little profit of some two hundred and fifty thousand per
cent, and all done by the mesmerism of suggestive advertising.Speaking of parasites on
society, Ames is not the only one!""And yet those fellows howl and threaten us with the boycott because
we won't advertise their lies and delusions.It's as bad as
ecclesiastical intolerance!"Then she returned to New York and
went directly to Avon.What she did there can only be surmised by a
study of her reports to Hitt, who carefully edited them and ran them
in the Express.Again, after several days, she journeyed back to
Washington.Her enthusiasm was boundless; her energy exhaustless; her
industry ceaseless; and her persistency doggedly unshakable.In
Washington she made her way unhindered among those whom she deemed
essential to the work which she was doing.Doubtless her ability to do
this and to gain an audience with whomsoever she might choose was in
great part due to her beauty and charming simplicity, her grace of
manner, and her wonderful and fearless innocence, combined with a
mentality remarkable for its matured powers.Hitt and Haynerd groaned
over her expenses, but promptly met them."She's worth it," growled the latter one day."She's had four
different talks with the President!How on earth do you suppose she
does it?And how did she get Mall and Logue to take her to dinner and
to the theater again and again?And what did she do to induce that
doddering old blunderbuss, Gossitch, to tell her what Ames was up to?How do you suppose she found out that
Ames was hand in glove with the medical profession, and working tooth
and nail to help them secure a National Bureau of Health?Say, do you
know what that would do?It would foist allopathy upon every chick and
child of us!Have
we come to that in this supposedly free country?By the way, Hitt,
Doctor Morton has been let out of the University.He says Ames
did it because of his association with us."I think, my friend," replied Hitt, "that it is a very serious matter,
and one that impinges heavily upon the rights of every one of us, when
a roaring lion like Ames is permitted to run loose through our
streets."I've centered my hopes in Carmen," sighed Haynerd.If she can't stop him, then God himself can't!"A few moments later he came out
again and handed an opened letter to Haynerd."Some notes she's sent
from Washington.Mentions the National Bureau of Health project.It
hasn't escaped her, you see.Say, will you tell me where she picks up
her information?""The Lord gives it to her, I guess," said Haynerd, glancing over the
letter."'Reverend Borwell and Doctor Siler are down here lobbying for the
  National Bureau of Health bill.Also, Senator Gossitch dropped a
  remark to me yesterday which makes me believe that he and other
  Senators have been approached by Tetham with reference to sending
  an American ambassador to the Vatican.Haynerd handed the letter back to Hitt and plunged into the papers on
his desk."This
country's going stark, staring mad!We're crazy, every mother's son of
us!""It's the human mind that is crazy, Ned, because it is wholly without
any basis of principle," returned Hitt with a sigh.*       *       *       *       *

"Doctor Siler!exclaimed that worthy person, looking up from
the gutter, whither he had hastened after his silk hat which had been
knocked off by the encounter with the young girl who had rounded the
corner of Ninth street into Pennsylvania avenue and plunged full into
him."Oh, I'm so sorry, Doctor!I was coming from the Smithsonian
Institution, and I guess--"

"Don't mention it, Miss Carmen.It's a privilege to have my hat
knocked off by such a radiant creature as you."And I want to offer
my--"

"Look here, Miss Carmen, just offer yourself as my guest at luncheon,
will you?That will not only make amends, but place me hopelessly in
your debt.""I was on my way to a
restaurant."I've got a little place around the corner here
that would have made Epicurus sit up nights inditing odes to it."The girl laughed merrily, and slipped her arm through his.A few
minutes later they were seated at a little table in a secluded corner
of the doctor's favorite chophouse."By the way, I met a friend of yours a few minutes ago," announced the
doctor, after they had given their orders."He was coming out of the
White House, and--were you ever in a miniature cyclone?That's twice to-day I've been sent to the gutter!"He laughed heartily
over his experiences, then added significantly: "You and he are both
mental cyclones, but producing diametrically opposite effects."The doctor went on chatting
volubly."Ames and the President don't seem to be pulling together
as well as usual.The President has come out squarely against him
now in the matter of the cotton schedule.Ames declares that the
result will be a general financial panic this fall.Sands, the Express correspondent, seems to be getting mighty close
to administration affairs these days.Where did he get that data
regarding a prospective National Bureau of Health, do you suppose?""I gave it to him," was the simple reply.The doctor dropped his fork, and stared at the girl."Well--of course you naturally would be opposed to it.But--"

"Tell me," she interrupted, "tell me candidly just what you doctors
are striving for, anyway.Are your activities
all quite utilitarian, or--is it money and monopoly that you are
after?It makes a lot of difference, you know, in one's attitude
toward you.If you really seek the betterment of health, then you are
only honestly mistaken in your zeal.But if you are doing this to make
money--and I think you are--then you are a lot of rascals, deserving
defeat.""Miss Carmen, do you impugn my motives?"He began to color slightly under her keen
scrutiny."Well," she finally continued, "let's see.If you doctors
have made the curative arts effective, and if you really do heal
disease, then I must support you, of course.But, while there is
nothing quite so important to the average mortal as his health, yet I
know that there is hardly anything that has been dealt with in such a
bungling way.The art of healing as employed by our various schools of
medicine to-day is the result of ages and ages of experimentation and
bitter experience, isn't it?And its cost in human lives is simply
incalculable.No science is so speculative, none so hypothetical, as
the so-called science of medicine.""But we have had to learn," protested the doctor."Do you realize, Doctor," she resumed, "that the teaching and
preaching of disease for money is one of the greatest curses resting
upon the world to-day?I never saw a doctor until I was on the boat
coming to New York.And then I thought he was one of the greatest
curiosities I had ever seen.I followed him about and listened to him
talk to the passengers.And I learned that, like most of our young
men, he had entered the practice of medicine under the pressure of
dollars rather than altruism.Money is still the determining factor in
the choice of a profession by our young men.And success and fortune
in the medical profession, more than in any other, depend upon the
credulity of the ignorant and helpless human mind.""Do you deny that great progress has been made in the curative arts?""See what we have done with diphtheria, with typhoid,
with smallpox, and malaria!""Surely, Doctor, you can not believe that the mere temporary removing
of a disease is _real_ healing!You render one lot of microbes
innocuous, after thousands of years of experimentation, and leave
mankind subject to the rest.Do
you expect to go on that way, making set after set of microbes
harmless to the human body, and thus in time, after millions of years,
eradicate disease entirely?Do you think that people will then cease
to die?All the time you are working only in matter and through
material modes.Do you expect thereby to render the human sense of
life immortal?Your patients
get well, only to fall sick again.And death to you is still as
inevitable as ever, despite your boasted successes, is it not so?"He broke into a bantering laugh, but did not reply."Doctor, the human mind is self-inoculated.It will keep on
making them, until it is educated out of itself, and taught to do
better.Then it will give place to the real reflection of divine mind;
and human beings will be no more.Why don't you realize this, you
doctors, and get started on the right track?Your real work is in the
_mental_ realm."Well, I for one have little respect for faith cure--"

"Nor I," she interposed."Dependence upon material drugs, Doctor, is
reliance upon the _phenomena_ of the human mind.Faith cure is
dependence upon the human mind itself, upon the _noumenon_, instead of
the _phenomenon_.Hypnotism is mental
suggestion, the suggestions being human and material, not divine
truth.The drugging system is an outgrowth of the belief of life in
matter.Faith cure is the belief of life and power inherent in the
human mind.The origin of healing is
shrouded in mythology, and every step of its so-called progress has
been marked by superstition, dense ignorance, and fear.The first
doctor that history records was the Shaman, or medicine-man, whose
remedies reflected his mental status, and later found apt illustration
in the brew concocted by Macbeth's witches.And think you he has
disappeared?Unbelievable as it may seem, it was only a short time ago
that a case was reported from New York where the skin of a freshly
killed black cat was applied as a remedy for an ailment that had
refused to yield to the prescribed drugging!And only a few years ago
some one applied to the Liverpool museum for permission to touch a
sick child's head with one of the prehistoric stone axes there
exhibited.""That was mere superstition," retorted the doctor."But _materia medica_ is superstition incarnate.And because of the superstition that life and virtue and power are
resident in matter, mankind have swallowed nearly everything known to
material sense, in the hope that it would cure them of their own
auto-infection.You remember what awful recipes Luther gave for
disease, and his exclamation of gratitude: 'How great is the mercy of
God who has put such healing virtue in all manner of muck!'""Miss Carmen," resumed the doctor, "we physicians are workers, not
theorists.We handle conditions as we find them, not as they ought to
be.""You handle conditions as the
human, mortal mind believes them to be, that's all.You accept its
ugly pictures as real, and then you try desperately through
legislation to make us all accept them.Yet you would bitterly resent
it if some religious body should try to legislate its beliefs upon
you."Now listen, you doctors are rank materialists.Perhaps it is because,
as Hawthorne puts it, in your researches into the human frame your
higher and more subtle faculties are materialized, and you lose the
spiritual view of existence.Your only remedy for diseased matter is
more matter.Why, ignorance and
superstition have given rise to by far the larger number of remedies
in use by you to-day!And all of your attempts to rationalize medicine
and place it upon a systematic basis have signally failed, because the
only curative property a drug has is the credulity of the person who
swallows it.And that is a factor which varies with the individual.""The most advanced physicians give little medicine nowadays, Miss
Carmen.""They are beginning to get away from it, little by little," she
replied."In recent years it has begun to dawn upon doctors and
patients alike that the sick who recover do so, not because of the
drugs which they have taken, but _in spite of them_!One of the most
prominent of our contemporary physicians who are getting away from the
use of drugs has said that eighty-five per cent of all illnesses get
well of their own accord, no matter what may or may not be done for
them.In a very remarkable article from this same doctor's pen, in
which he speaks of the huge undertaking which physicians must assume
in order to clear away the _materia medica_ rubbish of the ages, he
states that the greatest struggle which the coming doctor has on his
hands is with drugs, and the deadly grip which they have on the
confidence and affections both of the profession and of the public.Among his illuminating remarks about the drug system, I found two
drastic statements, which should serve to lift the veil from the eyes
of the chronic drug taker.These are, first, 'Take away opium and
alcohol, and the backbone of the patent medicine business would be
broken inside of forty-eight hours,' and, second, 'No drug, save
quinine and mercury in special cases, will cure a disease.'In words
which he quotes from another prominent physician, 'He is the best
doctor who knows the worthlessness of most drugs.'"The hundreds of drugs listed in books on _materia medica_ I find are
gradually being reduced in number to a possible forty or fifty, and
one doctor makes the radical statement that they can be cut down to
the'six or seven real drugs.'Still further light has been thrown
upon the debasing nature of the drugging system by a member of the
Philadelphia Drug Exchange, in a recent hearing before the House
Committee on municipal affairs right here.He is reported as saying
that it makes little difference what a manufacturer puts into a patent
medicine, for, after all, the effect of the medicine depends upon the
faith of the user.The sick man who turns to patent medicines for
relief becomes the victim of 'bottled faith.'If his faith is
sufficiently great, a cure may be effected--and the treatment has been
_wholly mental_!The question of ethics does not concern either the
patent medicine manufacturer or the druggist, for they argue that if
the sick man's faith has been aroused to the point of producing a
cure, the formula of the medicine itself is of no consequence, and,
therefore, if a solution of sugar and water sold as a cure for colds
can stimulate the sufferer's faith to the point of meeting his need,
the business is quite legitimate.'A bunch of bottles and sentiment,'
adds this member of the Drug Exchange, 'are the real essentials for
working healing miracles.'"exclaimed the doctor, again sitting back and regarding her with
amazement."But, Doctor, I am intensely interested in my fellow-men.I want to
help them, and show them how to learn to live.""And I am doing all I can, the very best I
know how to do.""I guess you mean you are doing what you are prompted to do by every
vagrant impulse that happens to stray into your mentality, aren't
you?""You haven't really seriously thought out your
way, else you would not be here now urging Congress to spread a
blanket of ignorance over the human mind.If you will reflect
seriously, if you will lay aside monetary considerations, and a little
of the hoary prejudice of the ages, and will carefully investigate our
present medical systems, you will find a large number of schools of
medicine, bitterly antagonistic to one another, and each accusing the
other of inferiority as an exact science, and as grossly ignorant and
reprehensibly careless of life.But which of these warring schools can
show the greatest number of cures is a bit of data that has never been
ascertained.A recent writer says: 'As important as we all realize
health to be, the public is receiving treatment that is anything but
scientific, and the amount of unnecessary suffering that is going on
in the world is certainly enough to make a rock shed tears.'He
further says that, 'at least seventy-five per cent of the people we
meet who are apparently well, are suffering from some chronic ailment
that regular medical systems can not cure,' and that many of these
would try further experimentation were it not for the criticism that
is going on in the medical world regarding various curative systems.The only hope under the drugging system is that the patient's life and
purse may hold out under the strain of trying everything until he can
light upon the right thing before he reaches the end of the list.""And do you include surgery in your general criticism?""Surgery is no less an outgrowth of the belief of sentient matter than
is the drugging system," she replied."It is admittedly necessary in
the present stage of the world's thought; but it is likewise admitted
to be 'the very uncertain art of performing operations,' at least
ninety per cent of which are wholly unnecessary."You see," she went on, "the effect upon the _moral_ nature of the
sick man is never considered as rightfully having any influence upon
the choice of the system to be employed.If Beelzebub can cast out
demons, why not employ him?For, after all, the end to be attained is
the ejection of the demon.And if God had not intended minerals and
plants to be used as both food and medicine, why did He make them?Besides, man must earn his bread in some way under our present crude
and inhuman social system, and if the demand for drugs exists we may
be very sure it will be supplied by others, if not by ourselves.Again, the influence of commercialism as a determining factor in the
choice of a profession, is an influence that works to keep many in the
practice of a profession that they know to be both unscientific and
harmful.The result is an inevitable lowering of ideals to the lust of
material accumulation.""You certainly are hard on us poor doctors!And
we have done so much for you, too, despite your accusations.Think of
the babies that are now saved from diphtheria alone!""And think of the children who are the victims of the medical mania!""Think how they are brought up under the tyranny of
fear!Fear of this and of that; fear that if they scratch a finger
blood poisoning will deprive them of life; fear that eating a bit of
this will cause death; or sitting in a breeze will result in wasting
sickness!As for diphtheria antitoxin, it is in the
same class as the white of an egg.It is the
result of human belief, the belief that a horse that has recovered
from diphtheria can never again be poisoned by the microbe of that
disease.The microbe, Doctor, is the externalization in the human
mentality of the mortal beliefs of fear, of life and power in matter,
and of disease and death.The microbe will be subject, therefore, to
the human mind's changing thought regarding it, always.""Well then," said the doctor, "if people are spiritual, and if they
really are a consciousness, as you say, why do we seem to be carrying
about a body with us all the time--a body from which we are utterly
unable to get away?""It is because the mortal mind and body are one, Doctor.The body is
a lower stratum of the human mind.Hence, the so-called mind is
never distinct from its body to the extent of complete separation,
but always has its substratum with it.And, Doctor, the mind can not
hold a single thought without that thought tending to become
externalized--as Professor James tells us--and the externalization
generally has to do with the body, for the mind has come to center
all its hopes of happiness and pleasure in the body, and to base its
sense of life upon it.The body, being a mental concept formed of
false thought, passes away, from sheer lack of a definite principle
upon which to rest.Therefore the sense of life embodied in it passes
away with it.You know, the ancients had some idea of the cause of
disease when they attributed it to demons, for demons at least are
mental influences.But then, after that, men began to believe that
disease was sent by God, either to punish them for their evil deeds,
or to discipline and train them for paradise.Think
of regarding pain and suffering as divine agents!I don't wonder
people die, do you?Humboldt, you know, said: 'The time will come
when it will be considered a disgrace for a man to be sick, when the
world will look upon it as a misdemeanor, the result of some
vicious thinking.'Many people seem to think that thought affects
only the brain; but the fact is that _we think all over_!""But look here," put in the doctor."Here's a question I intended to
ask Hitt the other night.He said the five physical senses did not
testify truly.Well now, if, as you say, the eyes do not testify to
disease, then they can't testify to cures either, eh?"He sat back
with an air of triumph."The physical senses testify only to
belief.In the case of sickness, they testify to false belief.In the
case of a cure, they testify to a changed belief, to a belief of
recovered health, that is all.It is all on the basis of human belief,
you see."But--nerves feel--"

"Nerves, Doctor, like all matter, are externalizations of human
thought.Can the externalization of thought talk back to thought?You are still on the basis of mere human belief."At that moment the doctor leaned over and tapped upon the window to
attract the attention of some one in the street.Carmen looked out and
caught sight of a tall, angular man dressed in clerical garb.The man
bowed pleasantly to the doctor, and cast an inquiring glance at the
girl, then passed on."Yes, Tetham," said the doctor."Oh, is that the man who maintains the lobby here at the Capital for
his Church?He--well, it is his business to see
that members of his Church are promoted to political office, isn't it?He trades votes of whole districts to various congressmen in return
for offices for strong church members.He also got the parochial
schools of New York exempt from compulsory vaccination.The
Express--"

"Eh?Wales in his work on the cotton schedule.And so
we heard from Father Tetham.He is supporting the National Bureau of
Health bill.He is working for the Laetare medal.He--"

"Say, Miss Carmen, will you tell me where you pick up your news?Do you know something about everybody here in
Washington?""I have learned much here," she said, "about popular
government as exemplified by these United States.But it is especially saddening to see our
constitutional liberties threatened by this Bureau of Health bill, and
by the Government's constant truckling to the Church of Rome.Doctor,
can it be that you want to commit this nation to the business of
practicing medicine, and to its practice according to the allopathic,
or'regular' school?The American Medical Association, with its
reactionary policies and repressive tendencies, is making strenuous
endeavors to influence Congress to enact certain measures which would
result in the creation of such a Department of Health, the effect of
which would be to monopolize the art of healing and to create a
'healing trust.'If this calamity should be permitted to come upon the
American people, it would fall as a curtain of ignorance and
superstition over our fair land, and shut out the light of the dawning
Sun of Truth.It would mean a reversion to the blight and mold of the
Middle Ages, in many respects a return in a degree to the ignorance
and tyranny that stood for so many centuries like an impassable rock
in the pathway of human progress.The attempt to foist upon a
progressive people a system of medicine and healing which is wholly
unscientific and uncertain in its effects, but which is admittedly
known to be responsible for the death of millions and for untold
suffering and misery, and then to say, '_Thou shalt be cured thereby,
or not be cured at all_,' is an insult to the intelligence of the
Fathers of our liberties, and a crime upon a people striving for the
light.It smacks of the Holy Inquisition: You accept our creed, or you
shall go to hell--after we have broken you on the rack!Why, the
thought of subjecting this people to years of further dosing and
experimentation along the materialistic lines of the'regular' school,
of curtailing their liberties, and forcing their necks under the yoke
of medical tyranny, should come to them with the insistence of a
clarion call, and startle them into such action that the subtle evil
which lurks behind this proposed legislative action would be dragged
out into the light and exterminated!To permit commercialism and
greed, the lust of mammon, and the pride of the flesh that expresses
itself in the demand, 'Who shall be greatest?'to dictate the course
of conduct that shall shape the destinies of a great people, is to
admit the failure of free government, and to revert to a condition of
mind that we had thought long since outgrown.To yield our dear-bought
liberties to Italian ecclesiastics, on the other hand--well, Doctor,
_it is just unthinkable_!"Well, at least you are delightfully frank with me.Yet you have
the effect of making me feel as if--as if I were in some way behind a
veil.That--"

"Well, the human mind is very decidedly behind a veil--indeed, behind
many of them.Mankind just grope
about all their lives back of these veils, not knowing that God is
right before them all the time.God has got to be everything, or else
He will be nothing.With or without drugs, it is God 'who healeth all
thy diseases.'The difficulty with physicians is that they are densely
ignorant of what healing means, and so they always start with a
dreadful handicap.They believe that there is something real to be
overcome--and of course fail to permanently overcome it.Many of them
are not only pitiably ignorant, but are in the profession simply to
make money out of the fears and credulity of the people.Doctor, the
physician of to-day is in no way qualified to handle the question of
public health--especially those doctors who say: 'If you won't take
our medicines we'll get a law passed that will make you take them.'To
place the health of the people in their hands would be a terrible
mistake.The agitation for a federal Department of Health is based
upon motives of ignorance and intentional wrong.If the people
generally knew this, they would rise in a body against it.Make what
laws you wish for yourself, Doctor.The human mind is constantly
occupied in the making of ridiculous laws and limitations.But do not
attempt to foist your laws upon the people.Tell me, why all this
agitation about teaching sex-hygiene in the public schools?Why not,
for a change, teach Christianity?But even
the Bible has been put out of the schools.By your
Church, that its interpretation may continue to be falsely made by
those utterly and woefully ignorant of its true meaning!"For some moments they continued their meal in silence.Then the girl
took up the conversation again."Doctor," she said, "will you come out
from among them and be separate?""Ah, that is the rub, then!Yes, oppose ignorance and falsity, even
though incarnate in Mr."He ruins everybody who
stands in his way!The cotton schedule has gone against him, and the
whole country will have to suffer for it!""But how can he make the country suffer because he has been blocked in
his colossal selfishness?""That I can not answer," said the doctor."But I do know that he has
intimated that there will be no cotton crop in this country next
year."Ames stands as the claim of omnipotent
evil," was his laconic reply.And when the meal was ended, the girl went her way, pondering deeply.But that was something too
dark to be reported to the Express.*       *       *       *       *

Three weeks from the day he had his brush with Carmen in the presence
of the President, Ames, the great corruptionist, the master
manipulator, again returned from a visit to Washington, and in a
dangerous frame of mind.What might have been his mental state had he
known that the train which drew his private car also brought Carmen
back to New York, can only be conjectured.It was fortunate, no doubt,
that both were kept in ignorance of that fact, and that, while the
great externalization of the human mind's "claim" of business sulked
alone in his luxurious apartments, the little follower after
righteousness sat in one of the stuffy day coaches up ahead, holding
tired, fretful babies, amusing restless children, and soothing away
the long hours to weary, care-worn mothers.When the financier's car drew into the station his valets breathed
great sighs of relief, and his French chef and <DW64> porter mopped the
perspiration from their troubled brows, while silently offering peans
of gratitude for safe delivery.When the surly giant descended the car
steps his waiting footman drew back in alarm, as he caught his
master's black looks.When he threw himself into the limousine, his
chauffeur drew a low whistle and sent a timidly significant glance in
the direction of the lackey.And when at last he flung open the doors
of his private office and loudly summoned Hood, that capable and
generally fearless individual quaked with dire foreboding."The Express--I want a libel suit brought against it at once!"Yes, sir," responded the lawyer meekly.Then, in a voice trembling with
anger: "Have you read the last week's issues?"She has no financial interest in the paper, sir.And, as for the
reports which they have published--I hardly think we can establish a
case from them--"

"What?If you and he can't make out a case
against them, then I'll get a judge and a lawyer who can!I want that
bill filed to-morrow!""Very well, sir," assented Hood, stepping back."Another thing," continued Ames, "see Judge Hanson and have the
calling of the Ketchim case held in abeyance until I am ready for it.I've got a scheme to involve that <DW64> wench in the trial, and drag
her through the gutters!So, she's still in love with Rincon, eh?Well, we'll put a crimp in that little affair, I guess!Has Willett
heard from Wenceslas?""I'll lift the scalp from that blackguard Colombian prelate if he
tries to trick me!But the detectives report that he has been in Spain
recently."he exclaimed in a voice that began
high and ended in a whisper.He lapsed into a reflective mood, and for some moments his thoughts
seemed to wander far.Then he pulled himself together and roused out
of his meditations."You told Jayne that I would back the Budget to any extent, provided
it would publish the stuff I sent it?"You and Willett set about at once getting up daily
articles attacking the Express.I want you to dig up every move ever
made by Hitt, Haynerd, that girl, Waite, Morton, and the whole
miserable, sneaking outfit!Rake up every scandal, every fact, or
rumor, that is in any way associated with any of them.I want them
literally cannonaded by the Budget!Haynerd was a bum before he got the Social Era!Waite is an unfrocked
priest!That girl--that girl is
a--Did you know that she used to be in a brothel down in the red-light
district?Great record the publishers of the Express
have, eh?I want you and Jayne to bury that whole outfit
under a mountain of mud!I'm ready to spend ten millions to do it!"I think we can do it, Mr.Now, another matter: I'm out to get the President's
scalp!Begin with those New York papers which we
can influence.I'll get Fallom and Adams over here for a conference.Meanwhile, think over what we'd better say to them.Our attacks upon
the President must begin at once!I've already bought up a Washington
daily for that purpose.They have a few facts now that will discredit
his administration!"Ah--a--there is a matter that I must mention as
soon as you are ready to hear it, Mr.It seems
that the reports which that girl has made have been translated into
several languages, and are being used by labor agitators down there to
stir up trouble.The mill hands, you know, never really understood
what your profits were, and--well, they have always been quite
ignorant, you know, regarding any details of the business.But now
they think they have been enlightened--they think they see how the
tariff has benefited you at their expense--and they are extremely
bitter against you.That priest, Father Danny, has been doing a lot of
talking since the girl was down there."cried Ames, rising from his chair, then sinking back again.Ames," the lawyer continued, "the situation is fast
becoming acute.The mill hands don't believe now that you were ever
justified in shutting down, or putting them on half time.And, whether
you reduce wages or not, they are going to make very radical demands
upon you in the near future, unless I am misinformed.These demands
include better working conditions, better tenements, shorter hours,
and very much higher wages.Also the enforcement of the child labor
law, I am sorry to say."Ames, you know you have said that it would
strengthen your case with Congress if there should be a strike at
Avon."I am
distinctly out of favor with the President--owing to that little <DW64>
wench!And Congress is going against me if I lose Gossitch, Logue, and
Mall!That girl has put me in bad down there!By G--"

"But, Mr.Ames, she can be removed, can she not?"But--if we can drive the
Express upon the shoals, and then utterly discredit that girl, either
in the libel suit or the Ketchim trial, why, then, with a little show
of bettering things at Avon, we'll get what we want.Say, is--is Sidney with the Express?"Hood started, and shot a look of mingled surprise and curiosity at his
master.Was it possible that Ames--

"You heard my question, Mr.Yes, sir--Sidney is still with them.He--a--they say
he has quite conquered his--his--"

"You mean, he's no longer a sot?"Don't sit there like a smirking Chinese god!"Ames, I learn that Sidney has been cured of his habits, and
that the--that girl--did it," stammered the nervous lawyer.Ames's mouth jerked open--and then snapped shut.His
head slowly sank until his chin touched his breast.And as he sat thus
enwrapped, Hood rose and noiselessly left the room.Alone sat the man of gold--ah, more alone than even he knew.Alone
with his bruised ambitions, his hectored egoism, his watery aims.Alone and plotting the ruin of those who had dared bid him halt in his
mad, destroying career.Alone, this high priest of the caste of
absolutism, of the old individualism which is fast hurrying into the
realm of the forgotten.Alone, and facing a new century, with whose
ideals his own were utterly, stubbornly, hopelessly discrepant.Alone he sat, looking out, unmoved, upon the want and pain of
countless multitudes gone down beneath the yoke of conditions which he
had made too hard for them.Looking, unmoved, unhearing, upon the
bitter struggles of the weak, the ignorant, the unskilled, the gross
hewers of wood and drawers of water.Looking, and knowing not that in
their piteous cry for help and light was sounded his own dire peril.The door opened, and the office boy announced the chief stenographer
of the great bank below.Ames looked up and silently nodded permission
for the man to enter.Ames," the clerk began, "I--I have come to ask a favor--a
great favor.I am having difficulty--considerable difficulty in
securing stenographers, but--I may say--my greatest struggle is
with myself.Ames, I can not--I simply can not continue to
hire stenographers at the old wage, nine dollars a week!I know how
these girls are forced to live.Ames, with prices where they
are now, they can not live on that!Say,
ten or twelve dollars to start with?""Why do you come to me with your request?""Yes, sir, I know," replied the young man with hesitation."But--I--did
speak to him about it, and--he refused.""I can do nothing, sir," returned Ames in a voice that chilled the
man's life-current.I refuse to remain here and hire
stenographers at that criminal wage!""Very well, sir," replied Ames in the same low, freezing tone.Again the guardian of the sanctity of private property was left alone.Again, as he lapsed into dark revery, his thought turned back upon
itself, and began the reconstruction of scenes and events long since
shadowy dreams.And always as they built, the fair face of that young
girl appeared in the fabric.And always as he retraced his course, her
path crossed and crossed again his own.Always as he moved, her
reflection fell upon him--not in shadow, but in a flood of light,
exposing the secret recesses of his sordid soul.He dwelt again upon the smoothness of his way in those days, before
her advent, when that group of canny pirates sat about the Beaubien's
table and laid their devious snares.It was only the summer before she
came that this same jolly company had merged their sacred trust assets
to draw the clouds which that autumn burst upon the country as the
worst financial panic it had known in years.And so shrewdly had they
planned, that the storm came unheralded from a clear sky, and at a
time when the nation was never more prosperous.They had wagered that he could not put it
through.How neatly he had turned the trick, filled his pockets, and
transformed their doubts into wondering admiration!Oh, yes, there had been some suffering, he had been told.How surprised the people of these United
States would be some day to learn that this tropic struggle was in
essence an American war!The smug and unthinkingly contented in this
great country of ours regarded the frenzied combat in the far South as
but a sort of _opera bouffe_.And he,
when that war should end, would control navigation on the great
Magdalena and Cauca rivers, and acquire a long-term lease on the
emerald mines near Bogota.Untold suffering--countless
broken hearts--indescribable, maddening torture--he had not given that
a thought.His trip to Washington had been
exhausting.His eyes had been bloodshot,
and there had been several slight hemorrhages from the nose.His
physician had shaken his head gravely, and had admonished him to be
careful--

But why did that girl continue to fascinate him?Why now,
in all his scheming and plotting, did he always see her before him?Was it only because of her rare physical beauty?If he wrote or read,
her portrait lay upon the page; if he glanced up, she stood there
facing him.There was never accusation in her look, never malice, nor
trace of hate.No; but always she
smiled--always she looked right into his eyes--always she seemed to
say, "You would destroy me, but yet I love you."Aye, much more so than he did her.She would scorn the use of his
methods.He had to admit _that_, though he hated her, detested her,
would have torn her into shreds--even while he acknowledged that he
admired her, yes, beyond all others, for her wonderful bravery and her
loyal stand for what she considered the right.He must have dozed while he sat there in the warm office alone.Surely, that hideous object now floating before his straining gaze,
that thing resembling the poor, shattered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, was not
real!It was but a shadow, a flimsy thing of thought!And that
woestricken thing there, with its tenuous arms extended toward
him--was that Gannette?But, that other shade--so like his wife, a few months dead, yet alive
again!Whence came that look of horror in a face once so haughty!It
was unreal, ghastly unreal, as it drifted past!Ah, now he knew that
he was dreaming, for there, there in the light stood Carmen!Oh, what
a blessed relief to see that fair image there among those other
ghastly sights!He would speak to her--

But--_God above_!_What was that?_ A woman--no, not Carmen--fair
and--

Her white lips moved--they were transparent--he could see right
through them--and great tears dropped from her bloodless cheeks when
her accusing look fell upon him!Slowly she floated nearer--she stopped before him, and laid a hand
upon his shoulder--it was cold, cold as ice!He tried to call out--to
rise--to break away--

And then, groaning aloud, and with his brow dripping perspiration, he
awoke.Hood entered, but stopped short when he saw his master's white face.Ames passed a hand across his wet forehead."A--a little tired, that's
all, I guess.The lawyer laid a large envelope upon the desk."There's a delegation of Avon mill hands in the outer office.Again he
seemed to see that smiling girl before him.His jaw set, and his face
drew slowly down into an expression of malignity.Then, without
examining its contents, he tore the envelope into shreds, and cast the
pieces into the waste basket."Wire Pillette at
once to discharge these fellows, and every one else concerned in the
agitation!If those rats down there want to fight, they'll find me
ready!"CHAPTER 14


The immense frame of J. Wilton Ames bent slightly, and the great legs
might have been seen to drag a bit, as the man entered his private
elevator the morning after his rejection of the mill hands' demands,
and turned the lever that caused the lift to soar lightly to his
office above.And a mouse--had the immaculate condition of his
luxurious _sanctum_ permitted such an alien dweller--could have seen
him sink heavily into his great desk chair, and lapse into deep
thought.Hood, Willett, and Hodson entered in turn; but the magnate
gave them scant consideration, and at length waved them all away, and
bent anew to his meditations.Truth to tell--though he would not have owned it--the man was now
dimly conscious of a new force at work upon him; of a change, slowly,
subtly taking place somewhere deep within.He was feebly cognizant of
emotions quite unknown; of unfamiliar sentiments, whose outlines were
but just crystallizing out from the thick magma of his materialistic
soul.And he fought them; he hated them; they made him appear unto himself
weak, even effeminate!His abhorrence of sentimentalism had been among
the strongest of his life-characteristics; and yet, though he could
not define it, a mellowing something seemed to be acting upon him that
dull, bitterly cold winter morning, that shed a soft glow throughout
his mental chambers, that seemed to touch gently the hard, rugged
things of thought that lay within, and soften away their sharp
outlines.He might not know what lay so heavily upon his thought, as
he sat there alone, with his head sunk upon his breast.And yet the
girl who haunted his dreams would have told him that it was an
interrogation, even the eternal question, "What shall it profit a
man--?"Had ever such heavenly music touched his ears before!He would have held out his arms to her if he could.And yet, how dared she come to him?How dared she, after what she had
done?To
stand within the protection which her sex afforded and vivisect anew
his tired soul?But, whatever her motives, this girl did the most
daring things he had ever seen a woman do."Isn't it funny," she said, as she stood before him with a whimsical
little smile, "that wherever I go people so seldom ask me to sit
down!"Ames sank back into his seat without speaking.Carmen stood for a
moment looking about her rich environment; then drew up a chair close
to him."You haven't the slightest idea why I have come here, have you?"she
said sweetly, looking up into his face."I must confess myself quite ignorant of the cause of this unexpected
pleasure," he returned guardedly, bending his head in mock deference,
while the great wonder retained possession of him."Well," she went on lightly, "will you believe me when I tell you that
I have come here because I love you?"So this was an attack from
a different quarter!Hitt and Haynerd had invoked her feminine wiles,
eh?With one blow the unfamiliar sentiment which had been
shedding its influence upon him that morning laid the ugly suspicion
dead at his feet.A single glance into that sweet face turned so
lovingly up to his brought his own deep curse upon himself for his
hellish thought."You know," she bubbled, with a return of her wonted airy gaiety, "I
just had to run the gauntlet through guards and clerks and office boys
to get here.Aren't you glad I didn't send in my card?For then you
would have refused to see me, wouldn't you?""If I
had known you were out there," he said more gently, "I'd have sent out
and had you dragged in.I--I have wanted something this morning; and
now I am sure it was--"

"Yes," she interrupted, taking the words out of his mouth, "you wanted
_me_.You see, it's just absolutely impossible to
oppose anybody who loves you.You know, that's the very method Jesus
gave for overcoming our enemies--to love them, just love them to
pieces, until we find that we haven't any enemies at all any more.Well, that's the way I've been doing with
you--just loving you."The man's brows knotted, and his lips tightened.Or was there aught but the deepest sincerity expressed
in the face from which he could not take his eyes?And
yet, did ever human being talk so strangely, so weirdly, as she?"I thought you looked upon me as a human monster."After all,
there was a note of pathos in the question.Carmen laid her hand upon
his."It's the _real_ you that I love," she answered gently."The monster
is only human thought--the thought that has seemed to mesmerize you.But you are going to throw off the mesmerism, aren't you?I'll help
you," she added brightly."You're going to put off the 'old man'
completely--and you're going to begin by opening yourself and letting
in a little love for those poor people down at Avon, aren't you?At the mention of the people of Avon his face became stern and dark.She had not mentioned the Beaubien,
Miss Wall, the Express, nor herself."You see, you don't understand, Mr.You'll be, oh, so surprised
some day when you learn a little about the laws of thought--even the
way human thought operates!For you can't possibly do another person
an injury without that injury flying back and striking you.You may not feel the effects of its return right
away--but it does return, and the effects accumulate.And then, some
day, when you least expect it, comes the crash!But, when you love a
person, why, that comes back to you too; and it never comes alone.It
just brings loads of good with it.Ames," she cried, suddenly rising and seizing both his hands,
"you've just _got_ to love those people down there!You can't help it,
even if you think you can, for hate is not real--it's an awful
delusion!"It was not so much an appeal which the girl made as an affirmation of
things true and yet to come.The mighty _Thou shalt not!_ which Moses
laid upon his people, when transfused by the omnipotent love of the
Christ was transformed from a clanking chain into a silken cord.The
restriction became a prophecy; for when thou hast yielded self to the
benign influence of the Christ-principle, then, indeed, thou shalt not
desire to break the law of God.Carmen returned to her chair, and sat eagerly expectant.Ames groped
within his thought for a reply.And then his mental grasp closed upon
the words of Hood."They are very bitter against me--they hate me!""They reflect in kind your thought of
them.Your boomerangs of greed, of exploitation, of utter indifference
which you have hurled at them, have returned upon you in hatred.Do
you know that hatred is a fearful poison?And do you know that
another's hatred resting upon you is deadly, unless you know how to
meet and neutralize it with love?For love is the neutralizing
alkaloid.""Love is--weakness," he said in a low tone.Why, there is no such mighty power in the whole
universe as love!"We argue from different
standpoints," he said."I am a plain, matter-of-fact, cold-blooded
business man."And that," she replied in a voice tinged with sadness, "is why
business is such chaos; why there is so much failure, so much anxiety,
fear, loss, and unhappiness in the business world.Ames, you
haven't the slightest conception of real business, have you?"Then, brightly, "I am in business,
Mr.The business of
attempting to annihilate me!""I am in the business of reflecting good to you, and to all mankind,"
she gently corrected."Then suppose you manifest your love for me by refraining from
meddling further in my affairs.Suppose from now on you let me
alone.""Why--I am not meddling with you, Mr.He opened a drawer of the desk and took out several copies of
the Express."I am to consider that this is not strictly meddling,
eh?"he continued, as he laid the papers before her."No, not at all," she promptly replied."That's uncovering evil, so's
it can be destroyed.All that evil, calling itself you and your
business, has got to come to the surface--has got to come up to the
light, so that it can be--"

"Ah!Then I, the monster, must be exposed, eh?And the mines and mills which I
own--"

"You own nothing, Mr.Ames, except by consent of the people whom you
oppress.They will wake up some day; and then state and national
ownership of public utilities will come, forced by such as you.""And that desideratum will result in making everybody honest, I
suppose?"All our
present troubles, whether domestic, business, civic, or social, come
from a total misapprehension of the nature of God--a misunderstanding
of what is really _good_.We have _all_ got to prove Him.And we are
very foolish to lose any more time setting about it, don't you think
so?"You see," she went on, while he sat studying her, "those poor people
down at Avon don't know any more about what is the real good than you
do.And that's why their thoughts and yours center upon the false
pleasures of this ephemeral existence called life--this existence of
the so-called physical senses--and why you both become the tools of
vice, disease, and misfortune.They build up such men as you, and then
you turn about and crush them.And in the end you are both what the
Bible says--poor, deluded fools.""Well, I'll be--"

"Oh, don't swear!"she pleaded, again seizing his hand and laughing up
into his face."It's time you started to prove God," she said earnestly."Won't you
begin now--to-day?Haven't you yet learned that evil is the very
stupidest, dullest, most uninteresting thing in the world?Won't you turn from your material endeavors now, and take time
to learn to really live?You've got plenty of time, you know, for you
aren't obliged to work for a living."She was leaning close to him, and her breath touched his cheek.Her
soft little hand lay upon his own.And her great, dark eyes looked
into his with a light which he knew, despite his perverted thought,
came from the unquenchable flame of her selfless love.Again that unfamiliar sentiment--nay, rather, that sentiment long
dormant--stirred within him.Again his worldly concepts, long
entrenched, instantly rose to meet and overthrow it.He had not yet
learned to analyze the thoughts which crept so silently into his
ever-open mentality.And to those
which savored of things earthy he still gave the power to build, with
himself as a willing tool."You will--help me--to live?"He thought her the most
gloriously beautiful object he had ever known, as she sat there before
him, so simply gowned, and yet clothed with that which all the gold of
Ophir could not have bought."Yes, gladly--oh, so gladly!"Her eyes sparkled with a rush of tears."Don't you think," he said gently, drawing his chair a little closer
to her, "that we have quite misunderstood each other?"But," with a happy smile
again lighting her features, "we can understand each other now, can't
we?"And hasn't the time come for us to work together,
instead of continuing to oppose each other?""I--I have been thinking so ever since I returned yesterday from
Washington.I am--I--"

"We need each other, don't we?"the artless girl exclaimed, as she
beamed upon him."I can help
you--more than you realize--and I want to.I--I've been sorry for you,
little girl, mighty sorry, ever since that story got abroad about--"

"Oh, never mind that!""We are living in the
present, you know."And I
want to see them straightened out.And you and I can do it, little
one.Madam Beaubien hasn't been treated right, either."We're going to
forget that in the good we're going to do, aren't we?"And you are going to get a square deal.Now, I've got
a plan to make everything right.I want to see you in the place that
belongs to you.I want to see you happy, and surrounded by all that is
rightfully yours.And if you will join me, we will bring that all
about.I told you this once before, you may remember."He stopped and awaited the effect of his words upon the girl.Ames," she replied, her eyes shining with a great hope,
"don't think about me!It's the people at Avon that I want to help.""We'll help them, you and I. We'll make things right all round.And
Madam Beaubien shall have no further trouble."Sidney shall come home--"

With a rush the impulsive girl, forgetting all but the apparent
success of her mission, threw herself upon him and clasped her arms
about his neck."Oh," she cried, "it is love that has done all this!The startled man strained the girl tightly in his arms.He could feel
the quick throbbing in her throat.Her warm breath played upon his
cheek like fitful tropic breezes.For a brief moment the supreme gift
of the universe seemed to be laid at his feet.For a fleeting interval
the man of dust faded, and a new being, pure and white, seemed to rise
within him."Yes," he murmured gently, "we'll take him to our home with us."Slowly, very slowly, the girl released herself from his embrace and
stepped back.she murmured, searching his face for the
meaning which she had dimly discerned in his words.He reached forward and with a quick movement seized her
hand.Not now--no, you
needn't come to me until you are ready.Why, I didn't know until to-day what it was that was making
me over!Don't--"

Carmen had struggled away from him, and, with a look of bewilderment
upon her face, was moving toward the door."Oh, I didn't know," she
murmured, "that you were--were--proposing _marriage_ to me!"We'll begin all over again, you and I!Why, I'll do anything--anything
in the world you say, Carmen, if you will come to me--if you will be
my little wife!"I know--I know," he hastily resumed, as she halted and stood
seemingly rooted to the floor, "there is a great difference in our
ages.But that is nothing--many happy marriages are made between ages
just as far apart as ours.I'll make Madam Beaubien rich!I'll support the
Express, and make it what you want it to be!I'll do whatever you say
for the people of Avon!Think, little girl, what depends now upon
you!"Carmen turned and came slowly back to him."And--you will not do these
things--unless I marry you?"she said in a voice scarcely above a
whisper."I will do them all, Carmen, if you will come to me!""But--oh, you were only deceiving me all the time!And now--if I
refuse--then what?""It depends upon you, entirely--and you will come?Not now--but within
the next few months--within the year--tell me that you will!""But--you will do these things whether I come to you or not?""I've put it all into your hands," he answered shortly.Then
she glanced about in helpless bewilderment."I--I--love--you," she murmured, as she looked off toward the window,
but with unseeing eyes."I would do anything for you that was right.I--love--everybody--everybody; but there are no conditions to _my_
love.she suddenly cried, burying her face in her hands and
bursting into tears."You have tried to _buy_ me!"Taking her by the hand he led her,
unresisting, back to her chair."Listen," he said, bending toward her."Go home now and think it
all over.It was sudden, I admit; I
took you by surprise.But--well, you are not going to prevent the
accomplishment of all that good, are you?She had been crushed; and
another lesson in the cruelty of the human mind--that human mind which
has changed not in a thousand years--had been read to her.But again
she smiled bravely, as she wiped her eyes."It's all right now," she murmured."It was all right all the
time--and I was protected.""Some day," she said gently, and in a voice
that trembled just a little, "you will help the people of Avon, but
not because I shall marry you."Then you refuse my offer, do you?""Remember, all the blame will be upon you.She saw now with a clairvoyance which separated
him from the mask which he had worn.Her glance penetrated until it
found his soul."You have shown me the depths of the carnal mind," she slowly replied."The responsibility is not with me, but with--God.I--I came to-day
to--to help you.But now I must leave you--with Him."He stooped and took up her muff which lay upon the floor.As he did so,
a letter fell out.He seized it and glanced at the superscription.Another little _billet-doux_ to your
priestly lover, eh?"She looked down at the letter which he held."It is money," she said,
though her thought seemed far away."Money that I am sending to a
little newsboy who bears his name."He rose and opened a drawer in his desk.Taking out a paper-bound
book, he held it out to the girl."Here's a
little piece of work which your brilliant lover did some time ago.Do you know the penalty your
clerical paramour paid for that, eh?Then I'll tell you," bending over
close to her ear, "his _life_!"She staggered
a few steps toward the door, then stopped."God--is--is--_everywhere_!"Then she reeled, and fell heavily to the floor.CHAPTER 15


If additional proof of the awful cost of hating one's fellow-men were
required, the strike which burst upon the industrial world that winter
must furnish it in sickening excess.But other facts, too, were
rendered glaringly patent by that same desperate clash which made Avon
a shambles and transformed its fair name into a by-word, to be spoken
only in hushed whispers when one's thought dwells for a moment upon
the madness of the carnal mind that has once tasted blood.The
man-cleft chasm between labor and capital, that still unbridged void
which separates master and servant, and which a money-drunk class
insolently calls God-made, grows wider with each roar of musketry
aimed by a frenzied militia at helpless men and women; grows deeper
with each splitting crack of the dynamite that is laid to tear asunder
the conscienceless wielder of the goad; and must one day fall gaping
in a cavernous embouchure that will engulf a nation.Hitt saw it, and shuddered; Haynerd, too.Ames may have dimly marked
the typhoon on the horizon, but, like everything that manifested
opposition to this superhuman will, it only set his teeth the firmer
and thickened the callous about his cold heart.And she knew--and the world must some day know--that but one tie has
ever been designed adequate to bridge this yawning canon of human
hatred.Aye, well she knew that the world laughed,
and called it chimera; called it idealism, and emotional weakness.And well she knew that the most pitiable weakness the world has ever
seen was the class privilege which nailed the bearer of the creed of
love upon the cross, and to-day manifests in the frantic grasping of a
nation's resources, and the ruthless murder of those who ask that
they, too, may have a share in that abundance which is the common
birthright of all.Do the political bully, the grafter, the tout, know
the meaning of love?Oh, not by the
hypocritical millionaire pietists who prate their glib platitudes to
their Sunday Bible classes, and return to their luxurious homes to
order the slaughter of starving women and babes!They, like their poor
victims, are deep under the spell of that mesmerism which tells them
that evil is good.Nor by the Church, with its lamentable weakness of
knowledge and works.Only by those who have learned something of the
Christ-principle, and are striving daily to demonstrate its
omnipotence in part, can the world be taught a saving knowledge of the
love that solves every problem and creates a new heaven and a newer,
better concept of the earth and its fullness.That morning when Carmen went to see Ames the Express received word of
the walk-out of the Avon mill employes.Almost coincident with the
arrival of the news, Carmen herself came unsteadily into Hitt's
office.The editor glanced up at her, then looked a second time.He
had never before seen her face colorless."What work have you--for me--to-day?"Then, so low that he scarcely caught the
words, "I--I have been with--a friend."Sidney Ames came puffing into the office at that moment."How does it happen you're out riding with
Willett?Saw him help you out of an auto just now.""He brought me here," she answered softly.Hitt and the lad stared at her with open mouths.She turned, and
started for her own room, moving as if in a haze.As she neared the
door she stumbled.Sidney sprang after her and caught her in his arms.When she turned her face, they saw that her eyes were swimming in
tears.Hitt closed the door after him, then took
the girl's hand and led her back to his own chair."Now, little one,"
he said gently, "tell me all about it."Then the tears began to flow; and then she
leaned her head against him and sobbed--sobbed as does the stricken
mother who hangs over the lifeless form of her babe--sobbed as does
the strong man bereft of the friend of his bosom--sobbed as did the
Man of Sorrow, when he held out his arms over the worldly city that
cruelly rejected him.He was the channel for the divine; yet the
wickedness of the human mind broke his great heart.Carmen was not far
from him at that moment.Hitt held her hand, and choked back the lump that filled his throat.Then the weeping slowly ceased, and the girl looked up into his
anxious face."It's all past now," she said brokenly."Jesus forgave them that
killed him.And--"

"You have been with--Ames?"said Hitt in a low, quiet tone."And he
tried to kill you?""He--he knew not what he was doing.Evil used him, because as
yet he has no spiritual understanding."Well, little girl, I am waiting for the whole story.It
didn't happen--it wasn't real.I--I seemed to manifest weakness--and I
fell--to the floor--but I didn't lose consciousness."But what had Ames said to you, Carmen?"persisted Hitt, his face dark
with anger.Ames only as--as God's child," she
murmured."Evil is not real, and it doesn't happen.Now I want to
work--work as I never did before!_I must!_"

"Will you not tell me more about it?"he asked, for he knew now that a
deadly thrust had been made at the girl's life."It didn't happen," was her
reply.A suspicion flashed into Hitt's mind, kindled by the girl's insistence
upon the nothingness of death."Carmen," he asked, "did he tell you
that--some one had died?"She came to him and laid her head against him.I shall overcome it, for God is with me.Promise that no
one but us shall know!The man's eyes grew moist, and his throat filled.He drew the girl to
him and kissed her forehead."It shall be as you wish, little one," he
said in a choking voice.This is another
opportunity to--to prove God!He turned to his desk with a heavy heart."There is work to be done
now," he said."I wonder--"

She took the telegram from his hands and scanned it.At once she
became calm, her own sorrow swallowed up in selfless love."Oh, they
have gone out at Avon!Hitt, I must go there at once!""I thought so," he replied, swallowing hard.But you are in higher hands than mine, Carmen.And we, Sidney and I, will
say nothing of--of your visit to his father."*       *       *       *       *

That night Hitt called up the Beaubien and asked if he and Haynerd
might come and talk with her after the paper had gone to press, and
requesting that she notify Carmen and Father Waite.A few hours later
the little group met quietly in the humble cottage.Miss Wall and
Sidney were with them.And to them all those first dark hours of
morning, when as yet the symbol of God's omnipresence hung far below
the horizon, seemed prescient with a knowledge of evil's further
claims to the lives and fortunes of men."I have asked you here," Hitt gravely announced when they were
assembled, "to consider a matter which touches us all--how deeply, God
alone knows.At ten o'clock to-night I received this message."He
opened the paper which he held in his hand and read:

  "'Property of Hitt oil company, including derricks, pump houses,
  storage tanks, destroyed by fire.Dynamite in pump houses
  exploded, causing wells to cave and choke.The news burst over them like the cracking of a bomb.Haynerd, who,
like the others, had been kept in ignorance of the message until now,
started from his chair with a loud exclamation, then sank back limp.Evil seemed to have chosen that day with
canny shrewdness to overwhelm her with its quick sallies from out the
darkness of the carnal mind."I see in this," he said slowly, "the
culmination of a long series of efforts to ruin the Express.That my
oil property was deliberately wrecked, I have not the slightest doubt.demanded Haynerd, having again found his voice."The Express has stood before the world as a
paper unique and apart.And because of its high ideals, the forces of
evil singled it out at the beginning for their murderous assaults.That the press of this country is very generally muzzled, stifled,
bought and paid for, I have good reason now to know.My constant
brushes with the liquor interests, with low politicians, judges,
senators, and dive-keepers, have not been revealed even to you.Could
you know the pressure which the Church, both Catholic and Protestant,
has tried to exert upon us, you would scarce credit me with veracity.But the Express has stood out firm against feudalism, mediaevalism,
and entrenched ecclesiasticism.It has fearlessly opposed the
legalizing of drugging.It has fought the debauching of a nation's
manhood by the legalized sale of a deadly poison, alcohol.And it has
fought without quarter the pernicious activity of morally stunted
brewers and distillers, whose hellish motto is, 'Make the boys drink!'It has fought the money octopus, and again and again has sounded to
the world the peril which money-drunken criminals like Ames and his
clique constitute.And for that we must now wear the crown of
martyrdom!"Silence, dismal and empty, lay over the little room for a long time."The Express has not been self-supporting.Its
growth has been steady, but it has depended for its deficit upon the
revenue from my oil property.Ames ruined Madam
Beaubien financially, as well as Miss Wall.And now, knowing that we all depended upon my oil wells, he has, I
doubt not, completely removed that source of income.""But," exclaimed Haynerd, "your property was insured, wasn't it?""Yes," replied Hitt, with a feeble attempt at a smile."But with the
proviso that dynamite should not be kept on the premises.You will
note that dynamite wrecked the wells.That doubtless renders my
policies void.But, even in case I should have a fighting chance with
the insurance companies, don't you think that they will be advised
that I purposely set fire to the wells, in order to collect the
insurance?And I shall find myself with a big
lawsuit on my hands, and with no funds to conduct the fight.Ames's
work, you know, is always thorough, and the Express is already facing
his suit for libel.""But you told us you were going to mortgage your property," said Miss
Wall."I stood ready to, should the Express require it.But, with its recent
little boom, our paper did not seem to need that as yet," he
returned."Yes, Ned, God _is_ good!""Can you say that, after all you have
endured, Carmen?"He looked at her for a moment, lost in wonder."An outcast babe," he
murmured, "left on the banks of a great river far, far away; reared
without knowledge of father or mother, and amid perils that hourly
threatened to crush her; torn from her beloved ones and thrust out
into an unknown and unsympathetic world; used as a stepping-stone to
advance the low social ambitions of worldly women; blackened by the
foulest slander, and ejected as an outcast by those who had fawned at
her feet; still going about with her beautiful message of love, even
though knowing that her childhood home is enveloped in the flames of
war, and her dear ones scattered, perhaps lost; spurned from the door
of the rich man whom she sought to save; carrying with her always the
knowledge that the one upon whom her affections had centered had a son
in distant Cartagena, and yet herself contributing to the support of
the little lad; and now, this morning--" He stopped, for he remembered
his promise."This morning," she finished, "shielded by the One who is both Father
and Mother to me.""That One surely ought to love you, Carmen--"

"He does," she answered softly.put in Haynerd, torn with anger and fear."What are we going
to do now?""Everything, Ned, that error seems to tell us not to do," replied the
girl.She reached over to the little table that stood near, and took from it
a Bible.Opening it, she read aloud, very slowly, the entire
fourteenth chapter of Exodus.Then she concluded by reading the last
two verses of the eighth chapter of Romans."Now," she said, looking up, "we know what we are going to do, don't
we?We are going right on, as'seeing Him who is invisible' to men
like Mr."There is no curse, whether of the Church, or of business, or of any
department of human thought, that can overthrow legitimate business;
and we are in the legitimate business of reflecting God to the world.If the physical sense of supply is now lost, we are fortunate, for now
we are obliged to acquire a higher sense.And we become aware of it in our own consciousness.It is there
that we interpret His supply.Ames interprets it one way; we, in a
very different way.God has always been able to prepare a table in the
wilderness of human thought.If we look for supply from without, we
shall not find it, for everything is within.And the very fact that
there is a legitimate demand shows that there is the supply to meet
it, for--though the world hasn't learned this yet--_it is the supply
itself that really creates the demand_!""Money, Ned, is the counterfeit of God.He is
our Principle--infinite, inexhaustible.We are facing a crisis, but, like every seeming disturbance of
the infinite harmony, it will vanish in a little while if we but cling
to the divine Mind that is God for guidance."Hitt folded the telegram and returned it to his pocket."Are you going
to Avon to-morrow?""And when we have in our midst this girl, who has borne,
without one word of complaint or reviling, the world's most poignant
sorrows!I--I really regret that I told you of--of this telegram.I
seemed for a moment to be overwhelmed.But I am on my feet again
now!"He reached into a pocket and took out some bills, which he handed to
Carmen."That will see you through for a day or so down there.Come," he added,
beckoning to Haynerd, "the Express will be issued to-morrow as usual,
and we must get to bed.I've really had quite a strenuous day!"He
turned, then paused and looked at Carmen.The girl caught the meaning in his glance, and went directly to the
piano."Don't," he said, "if you do not feel like it.This day has been a
hard one for you, I know.And--"

"But I do feel like it," she answered, smiling up at him.And," her voice dropped low, "I want to sing to--Him."Hitt gulped down something in his throat."The bravest little girl in
the whole wide world!"*       *       *       *       *

The carnage at Avon was not incidental; it was the logical effect of
definite mental causes.It was the orderly sequence of an endless
train of hatred of man for man, bred of greed and the fear of
starvation.And starvation is the externalized human belief that life
is at the caprice of intelligent matter.But that is an infraction of
the first Commandment, given when the human race was a babe.When the mill hands left their looms at evening of the day following
Ames's rejection of their demands, the master closed the doors behind
them and locked them out.The parrot-cry of the maudlin sentimental!But, four thousand men, women, and little children, with never a
dollar beyond their earnings of the day, thrust out into the blasts of
the bitterest winter the New England states had known in years!True; but why, then, did they strike?For, you see, that of itself
proved the soundness of Ames's single reply to all further appeal:
"There is nothing whatever to arbitrate."In the garden of the human mind waves many a flower, both black and
red, fanned by the foul winds of carnal thought.There grow the
brothel, the dive, the gin-shop, the jail.About these hardier stems
twine the hospital, the cemetery, the madhouse, the morgue.And Satan,
"the man-killer from the beginning," waters their roots and makes
fallow the soil with the blood of fools.But of those for whom the
gardener waits, there is none whose blood is so life-giving to these
noxious plants as that type of the materially rich who, like Ames,
have waxed gross upon the flesh of their own brothers.Ames was a gambler in human lives.They were his chips, by which he
gained or lost, and of themselves were void of intrinsic value.The
world was the table whereon he played; the game _rouge et noir_, with
the whirl of predatory commercialism as the wheel, and the ball
weighted to drop where he might direct.He carried millions on margin,
and with them carried the destinies, for weal or for woe, of millions
of his fellow-men, with not one thought that he did so at the cost of
their honor and morality, not less than their life-blood.It had been his custom to close his mills for several months each
year, in order to save expense when times were dull.And he did this
as casually as he closed the doors of his stables, and with much less
thought for the welfare of those concerned.It is doubtful if he had
ever really considered the fact that these four thousand human beings
were wholly dependent upon him for their very existence.For he was a
business man, and gold was far weightier in the scale of values than
human flesh, and much less easily obtained.Cain's comforting
philosophy was quite correct, else would the business world not have
been so firmly established upon it.Besides, he was terribly busy; and
his life was lived upon a plane high, high above that upon which these
swarming toilers groveled with their snouts in the dust.And now, with the doors of his mills barred against the hungry hordes,
he would frame the terms upon which they should be reopened.The
eight-hour law must not be enforced.Perhaps he could influence the
Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, as depriving the mill
hands of the right to labor as long as they pleased.And the right to organize and band together for their
common good would be contemptuously denied the ignorant rats who
should be permitted to toil for him once more.If they offered
violence, there was the state militia, armed and impatient to slay.Also, this was an excellent opportunity to stamp out trade-unionism
within the confines of his activities.He would win the plaudits of
the whole industrial world by so doing.He therefore immediately got
in touch with the Governor, a Tammany puppet, and received that loyal
henchman's warm assurances of hearty support for any measures which
the great magnate might wish to enforce.He then approached the
officers of the state guard, and secured them to a man.Times were
hard, and they welcomed his favor.He finally posted armed guards in
all his buildings at Avon, and bade them remember that property rights
were of divine institution.Then he sat down and dictated the general
policy to be followed by the Amalgamated Spinners' Association
throughout the country in support of his own selfish ends.His activity in these preparations, as in everything, was tremendous.His agents swarmed over the state like ants.The Catholic Archbishop
was instructed that he must remove Father Danny from Avon, as his
influence was pernicious.But the objection was made that the priest
was engaged only in humanitarian labors.It availed not; Ames desired
the man's removal.The widow Marcus likewise had
been doing much talking.Ames's lawyer, Collins, had her haled into
court and thoroughly reprimanded.And then, that matters might be
precipitated, and Congress duly impressed with the necessity of
altering the cotton schedule in favor of the Spinners' Association,
Ames ordered his agents to raise the rents of his miserable Avon
tenements.There were few, he knew, who dared even attempt to meet the
raise; and those who could not, he ordered set into the streets.It was a wild winter's day that the magnate chose for the enforcement
of this cruel order.A driving blizzard had raged throughout the
night, and the snow had banked up in drifts in places many feet deep.The temperature was freezing, and the strong east wind cut like a
knife.It was Ames's desire to teach these scum a needed lesson, and
he had chosen to enlist the elements to aid him in the righteous
task.For a week, ever since the strike was declared, Carmen had lived among
these hectored people.Daily her reports of the unbearable situation
had gone to Hitt.And through them the editor had daily striven to
awaken a nation's conscience.Ames read the articles, and through the
columns of the Budget sought to modify them to the extent of shifting
the responsibility to the shoulders of the mill hands themselves, and
to a dilatory Congress that was criminally negligent in so framing a
cotton tariff as to make such industrial suffering possible.Nor did
he omit to foully vilify the Express and calumniate its personnel.Amid curses, screams, and despairing wails, the satanic work of
ejecting the tenement dwellers went on that day.Ames's hirelings,
with loaded rifles, assisted the constables and city police in the
miserable work, themselves cursing often because of the keen blasts
that nipped their ears and numbed their well-cased limbs.More than
one tiny, wailing babe was frozen at the breast that dull, drab
afternoon, when the sun hung like a ghastly clot of human blood just
above the horizon, and its weird, yellow light flitted through the
snow-laden streets like gaunt spectres of death.More than one aged,
toil-spent laborer, broken at the loom in the service of his
insatiable master, fell prone in the drifts and lay there till his
thin life-current froze and his tired heart stopped.More than one
frenzied, despairing father, forgetful for the moment of the divine
right of property, rushed at a guard and madly strove with him, only
to be clubbed into complaisance, or, perchance, be left in a welter of
crimson on the drifting snow.She had been to see
Pillette that same morning, and had been laughed from his presence.She did not understand, she was told, what miserable creatures these
were that dared ask for bread and human rights.Wait; they themselves
would show their true colors.And it spurted like fountains
from their veins.And they saw it with dimming eyes, and were glad,
for it brought sweet oblivion.That night there were great fires
built along the frozen creek.Shacks and tents were hastily reared;
and the shivering, trembling women and babes given a desperate
shelter.Then the men, sullen and grim, drew off into little groups,
and into the saloons and gambling halls of the town.And when the
blizzard was spent, and the cold stars were dropping their frozen
light, these dull-witted things began to move, slowly at first,
circling about like a great forming nebula, but gaining momentum and
power with each revolution.More than a thousand strong, they circled
out into the frozen streets of the little town, and up along the main
thoroughfare.Their low
curses welled into a roar.And then, like the sudden bursting of
pent-up lava, they swept madly through the town, carrying everything
to destruction before them.Stores, shops, the bank itself, burst open before this wave of
maddened humanity.Guns and pistols were thrown from laden shelves to
the cursing, sweating mob below.Axes and knives were gathered by
armfuls, and borne out into the streets to the whirling mass.Great
barrels of liquor were rolled into the gutters and burst asunder.Bread and meat were dragged from the shops and savagely devoured.The
police gathered and planted themselves with spitting pistols before
the human surge.They went down like grass under stampeded cattle.Frightened clerks and operators rushed to the wires and sent wild,
incoherent appeals for help to New York.Pandemonium had the reins,
the carnal mind was unleashed.On rolled the mob, straight on to the massive stone house of Pillette,
the resident manager of the great Ames mills.On over the high iron
fence, like hungry dock rats.On up the
broad drive, shouting, shooting, moaning, raving.On over the veranda,
and in through broken windows and shattered doors, swarming like flies
over reeking carrion, until the flames which burst through the peaked
roof of the mansion drove them forth, and made them draw sullenly,
protestingly away, leaving the tattered bodies of Pillette and his
wife and daughters to be consumed in the roaring furnace.Oh, ye workers, ye toilers at loom and forge, it is indeed you who
bear the world's burdens!It is you who create the rich man's wealth,
and fight his battles.So ye fought in the great war between North and
South, and protected the rich man at home, hovering in fright over his
money bags.It is you who put into his hands the bayonet which he
turns against you to guard his wealth and maintain his iniquitous
privilege.It is indeed in your hands that the destinies of this great
nation lie; but what will ye do with your marvelous opportunity?What, with your stupendous, untried strength?Will ye once more set up
the golden calf, and prostrate yourselves before it?Will ye again
enthrone ecclesiastical despotism, and grovel before image of Virgin
and Saint?Will ye raise high the powers of mediaeval darkness, and
bend your necks anew to the yoke of ignorance and stagnation?But
think you now that flames and dynamite will break your present bonds?Aye, America may be made a land without a pauper, without a
millionaire, without industrial strife.But fire and sword will not
effect the transformation.Yes, perhaps, as has been said, our
"comfortable social system and its authority will some day be blown to
atoms."But shall we then be better off than we are to-day?For shall
we know then how to use our precious liberty?Blood-drunk and reeling, the mob turned from the flaming wreckage and
flowed down toward the mills.There were some among them, saner, and
prescient of the dire consequences of their awful work, who counseled
restraint.Down into the creek
bottom rolled the seething tide, with a momentum that carried it up
the far side and crashing into the heavily barred oak doors of the
great mills.A crushing hail of bullets fell upon them, and their
leaders went down; but the mass wavered not.Those within the
buildings knew that they would become carrion in the maws of the
ravening wolves outside, and fought with a courage fed with
desperation.In the solemn hush of death Socrates said, "The hour of departure has
arrived, and we go our ways, I to die and you to live.And mankind through the ages in their last
hours have echoed this sentiment of the gentle philosopher.For all
human philosophy leads to a single end--resignation.The frenzied hordes swarming about the Ames mills knew in their heart
of hearts that death was preferable to life in death under the goad of
human exploitation.In the distance, across the swale, the sky glowed red where the souls
of the agent of predatory wealth and his family had gone out in
withering heat.In the stricken town, men huddled their trembling
loved ones about them and stood with loaded muskets.Somewhere on the
steel bands that linked this scene of carnage with the great
metropolis beyond, a train plunged and roared, leaping over the
quivering rails at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, bringing eager
militiamen and their deadly instruments of civilization.For the Ames
mills were private property.*       *       *       *       *

In his luxurious office in the tower of the Ames building the master
sat that black night, surrounded by his laboring cohorts.Though they
strained under the excitement of the hour, Ames himself remained calm
and determined.He was in constant communication with the Governor at
Albany, and with the municipal officers of both New York and Avon.He
had received the tidings of the destruction of the Pillette family
with a grim smile.But the smile had crystallized into an expression
of black, malignant hatred when he demanded of the Governor that the
New York contingent of the state guard be sent at once to protect his
property, and specified that the bullets used should be of the
"dum-dum" variety.Such
bullets had been prohibited by the rules of modern warfare, it was
true.And Ames, foreseeing it all, had
purchased a hundred thousand rounds of these hellish things for the
militia to exchange for those which the Government furnished.And
then, as an additional measure of precaution, he had sent Hood and
Collins into the United States District Court and persuaded the
sitting judge to issue an injunction, enjoining any possible relief
committees from furnishing food and shelter to such as might enter the
industrial conflict being waged against him.And in the blood-red haze that hung
before his glittering eyes was framed the face of the girl who had
spurned him but a few days before.She was the embodiment of love that
had crossed his path and stirred up the very quintessence of evil
within him.From the first she had
aroused within his soul a conflict of emotions such as he had never
known before.And from the night when, in the Hawley-Crowles box at
the opera he had held her hand and looked down into her fathomless
eyes, he had been tortured with the conflicting desires to possess
that fair creature, or to utterly destroy her.Always she hovered just within his
grasp; and then drew back as his itching fingers closed.Always she
told him she loved him--and he knew she lied not.And such love had
its price--but not hers.And so hope strove with wrath, and chagrin
with despair.And
with it she had laid the giant low and bound him with chains.Though he knew now that she was lost to him forever; though
with foul curses he had seen hope flee; yet with it he had also bidden
every tender sentiment, every last vestige of good depart from his
thought forever more.And:

              "----with hope, farewell fear,
              Farewell remorse: all good to me is lost;
              Evil, be thou my good!"And that night the master slept
not, but sat alone at his desk in the great Fifth Avenue mansion, and
plotted the annihilation of every human being who had dared oppose his
worldly ambitions.Plotted, too, the further degradation and final
ruin of the girl who had dared to say she loved him, and yet would not
become his toy.*       *       *       *       *

There is no need to curse the iniquitous industrial and social system
upon which the unstable fabric of our civilization rests, for that
system is its own fell curse in the rotting fruit it bears.A bit of
that poisonous fruit had now dropped from the slimy branch at Avon.Up
from the yards came the militiamen at double-quick, with rifles
unslung and loaded with the satanic Ames bullets.Behind them they
dragged two machine guns, capable of discharging three hundred times a
minute.The mob had concentrated upon the central building of the mill
group, and had just gained entrance through its shattered doors.Before them the guards were falling slowly back, fighting every inch
of the way.The air was thick with powder
smoke.The roar of battle was
deafening.Quickly swinging into action, the militia opened upon the mill hands.Hemmed in between two fires, the mob broke and fled down the frozen
stream.The officers of the guard then ordered their men to join in
the work of extinguishing the flames, which were beginning to make
headway, fanned by the strong draft which swept through the long
building.Then, the building
saved, they pitched their tents and sought a brief rest.At noon the soldiers were again assembled, for there remained the task
of arresting the leaders of the mob and bringing them to justice.The
town had been placed under martial law with the arrival of the
militia.Its streets were patrolled by armed guards, and a strong
cordon had been thrown around the shacks which the mill hands had
hastily erected the afternoon before.And now, under the protection of
a detachment of soldiers, the demand was made for the unconditional
surrender of the striking laborers.Dull terror lay like a pall over the miserable shacks huddled along
the dead stream.It was the dull, hopeless, numbing terror of the
victim who awaits the blow from the lion's paw in the arena.Weeping
wives and mothers, clasping their little ones to them, knelt upon the
frozen ground and crossed themselves.Young men drew their newly-wed
mates to their breasts and kissed them with trembling lips.Stern,
hard-faced men, with great, knotted hands, grouped together and looked
out in deadly hatred at the heartless force surrounding them.Then out from among them and across the ice went Carmen, up the
slippery hillside, and straight to the multi-mouthed machine gun, at
the side of which stood Major Camp.She had been all night with these
bewildered, maddened people.She had warmed shivering babes at her own
breast.She had comforted widows of a night, and newly-bereaved
mothers.She had bound up gaping wounds, and had whispered tender
words of counsel and advice.And they had clung to her weeping; they
had called upon Virgin and Saint to bless her; and they named her the
Angel of Avon--and the name would leave her no more."Take me," she said, "take me into court, and let me tell all."This beautiful, well-clad girl among
such miserable vermin!"You have demanded their leaders," she continued."I have been trying
to lead them.The major's eyes roved over her face and figure.He could make nothing
out of her words, but he motioned to an aid, and bade him place the
girl under arrest.A wild shout then rose from the shacks, as Carmen moved quietly away
under guard.A dozen men sprang out and rushed, muskets in
hand, up toward the soldiers to liberate her.Their narrow vision could
comprehend but one thing at a time; and they saw in the arrest of the
girl only an additional insult piled upon their already mountainous
injuries.It was answered by a shriek of rage from the hovels, and a murderous
return fire.Then the major gave another loud command, and the machine
guns began to vomit forth their clattering message of death.At the sound of shooting, Carmen's guard halted.Then one of them
fell, pierced by a bullet from the strikers.The others released the
girl, and hurried back to the battle line.Carmen stood alone for a
moment.One sang its death-song almost in her ear.Then she turned and made her way slowly up the hill to the
paralyzed town.Down in the vale beneath, Death swung his scythe with long, sweeping
strokes.The two machine guns poured a flaming sheet of lead into the
little camp below.The tents
caught fire, and were whirled blazing aloft by the brisk wind.Men
dropped like chaff from a mill.Hysterical, screaming women rushed
hither and yon to save their young, and were torn to shreds by the
merciless fusillade from above.Babes stood for a moment bewildered,
and then sank with great, gaping wounds in their little, quivering
bodies.And over all brooded the spirit of the great manipulator,
Ames, for the protection of whose sacred rights such ghastly work is
done among civilized men to-day.*       *       *       *       *

That night, while the stars above Avon drew a veil of gray between
them and the earth below, that they might not see the red embers and
stark bodies, Carmen came slowly, and with bent head, into the office
of the Express.As she approached Hitt's door she heard him in earnest
conversation with Haynerd."Yes," the editor was saying, "I had a mortgage placed on the Express
to-day, but I couldn't get much.And it's a short-term one, at that.Stolz refused point blank to help us, unless we would let him dictate
the policy of the paper.He's still
fighting Ames for control of C. and R. And I learn, too, that the
Ketchim case is called for next week.That probably means an attempt
by Ames to smoke Stolz out through Ketchim.It also means that
Carmen--"

"Yes; what about her?""That she will be forced to go upon the stand as a witness.""And that, as I read it, means a further effort on Ames's part to
utterly discredit her in the eyes of the world, and us through her
association with the Express.""But--where is she, Hitt?No word from her since we got the news of
the massacre at Avon this afternoon!Nothing happened to her, do you
think?"Hitt's face was serious, and he did not answer.Then Carmen herself
came through the open door.Both men rose with exclamations of
gladness to welcome her.The girl's eyes were wet, and her wonted
smile had gone.Hitt," she said, "I want a thousand dollars to-night."Hitt and Haynerd both sat down hard."I must go back to Avon to-morrow," she announced."And the money is
for the--the people down there."Her voice caught, and her words
stumbled.The two men looked at each other blankly.Then Hitt reached out and
took her hand."Tell us," he said, "about the trouble there to-day.""No," she said, "we will not talk about evil.A thousand--"

"I have that much on deposit in the bank now, Carmen," he replied
gravely.His thought was on the mortgage which he had signed that
morning."Then write me a check at once, and I will deposit it in the Avon bank
when I get there to-morrow.I must go home now--to see mother.""But--let me think about it, Carmen.Money is--well, won't less than
that amount do you?"Hitt sighed, but made no further protest.If the Express must founder,
then this money were well spent on the stricken people of Avon.He
took out his book, and immediately wrote the check and handed it to
the girl."Hitt," said Haynerd, after Carmen had left them and he had exhausted
his protests over the size of the check, "something's killing that
girl!And it isn't only the trouble at Avon, either!"She's no longer in this world, Ned.But Hitt would say nothing to further illuminate his cryptic remark,
and Haynerd soon switched to the grim topic of the industrial war in
progress at Avon.A
social and industrial system such as ours, which leaves the masses to
starve and consume with disease under intolerable burdens, that a
handful may rot in idleness and luxury, marks us in this latest
century as hopelessly insane!""Well, Ned, whence came the idea, think you, that it is divine justice
for a majority of the people on earth to be poor in order that a few
may be rich?And how are we going to get that perverted idea out of
the minds of men?"Legislation arouses no faith in me!We are
suffering here because, in our immensely selfish thought of ourselves
only, we have permitted the growth of such men as Ames, and allowed
them to monopolize the country's resources.Future
generations will laugh themselves sick over us!Why, what sane excuse
is there for permitting the commonest necessities of life to be
juggled with by gamblers and unmoral men of wealth?How can we ask to
be considered rational when we, with open eyes, allow 'corners' on
foodstuffs, and permit 'wheat kings' to amass millions by corralling
the supply of grain and then raising the price to the point where the
poor washerwoman starves?The
existence of poverty in a country like America is not only proof
positive that our social system is rotten to the core, but that our
religion is equally so!As a people we deserve to be incarcerated in
asylums!""A considerable peroration, Ned," smiled Hitt."And yet, one that I
can not refute.The only hope I see is in a radical change in the
mental attitude of the so-called enlightened class--and yet they are
the very worst offenders!"Doesn't the militia exist for men like Ames?To-day's work at
Avon proves it, I think!""Apparently so, Ned," returned Hitt sadly."And the only possibility
of a change in enlightened people is through a better understanding of
what is really good and worth while."Seems to me, Hitt, that it ought to stagger our preachers to realize
that nineteen centuries of their brand of Christianity have scarcely
even begun to cleanse society.What do you suppose Borwell thinks,
anyway?""Ned, they still cling to human law as necessarily a compelling
influence in the shaping of mankind's moral nature.""And go right on accepting the blood-stained money of criminal
business men who have had the misfortune to amass a million dollars!And, more, they actually hold such men up as patterns for the youth to
emulate!As if the chief end of endeavor were to achieve the glorious
manhood of an Ames!And he a man who is deader than the corpses he
made at Avon to-day!""The world's ideal, my friend, has long been the man who succeeds in
everything except that which is worth while," replied Hitt."But we
have been bidden to come out from the world, and be separate."Y--e--s, of course.But I can't take my thought from Avon--"

"And thereby you emphasize your belief in the reality of evil.""Then, if that is so, why not resign your position, Ned?Not while the Express has a leg to stand on!Your words are
an offense to me, sir!"Hitt rose and clapped his friend heartily on the back.Things do look very dark for us, if we look only with
the human sense of vision.But we are trying to look at the invisible
things within."Ned, Carmen is not in our hands.*       *       *       *       *

On the following afternoon at three a little group of Avon mill hands
crept past the guards and met in Father Danny's Mission, down in the
segregated vice district.They met there because they dared not go
through the town to the Hall.He had
slipped into town the preceding night, and remained in hiding through
the day.She had gone first to the
Hall, and then to the Mission, when she arrived again in the little
town.And after she had deposited Hitt's check in the bank she had
asked Father Danny to call together some of the older and more
intelligent of the mill hands, to discuss methods of disbursing the
money.Almost coincident with her arrival had come an order from Ames to
apprehend the girl as a disturber of the peace.The hush of death lay
over Avon, and even the soldiers now stood aghast at their own bloody
work of the day before.Carmen had avoided the main thoroughfares, and
had made her way unrecognized.At a distance she saw the town jail,
heavily guarded.Its capacity had been sorely taxed, and many of the
prisoners had been crowded into cold, cheerless store rooms, and
placed under guards who stood ready to mow them down at the slightest
threatening gesture.whispered Father Danny, after he had quietly
greeted the girl.It may be the beginning of the great
revolution we've all known wasn't far off!I just _had_ to get back
here!He sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.But soon he
sprang to his feet."No time for mollycoddling!""Come,
men, we'll give you checks, and do you get food for the babies.Only,
don't buy of the company stores!""We'll have to, Father," said one of them."But they've never taken cash from you there, ye know."Aye, Father, and they've discounted that ten per cent each time.But
if we bought at other stores we were discharged."But now then, Miss
Carmen, we'll begin."For an hour the girl wrote small checks, and the priest handed them
out to the eager laborers.They worked feverishly, for they knew that
at any moment they might be apprehended.cried Father Danny, at last unable to restrain himself."Did ye but know that this grand nation is wholly dependent on such as
you, its common people!Not on the rich, I say, the handful that own
its mills and mines, but on you who work them for your rich masters!"Ah, lass, it's but love that I'm dealin' out to 'em, God knows!And
yet, it's they that are masters of the situation, only they don't know
it!They've no leaders, except such as waste their
money and leave 'em in the ditch!The world's social schemes, Miss
Carmen, don't reach such as these.And they've got
the contempt of the wage-earners.""The Church, Father, could do much for these people, if--"

"Don't hesitate, Miss Carmen.You mean, if we didn't give all our
thought to the rich, eh?But still, it's wholly up to the people
themselves, after all.And, mark me, when they do rise, why, such men
as Ames won't know what's hit 'em!"The door was thrown violently open at that moment, and a squad of
soldiers under the command of a lieutenant entered.Carmen and Father Danny rose and faced them.The mill hands stood like
stone images, their faces black with suppressed rage.The lieutenant
halted his men, and then advanced to the girl."Is a woman named Carmen Ariza here?""I am she," replied the fearless girl."Come with us," he said in a rough voice.cried Father Danny, suddenly pulling the girl
back and thrusting himself before her.The mill hands
quickly formed about the girl.And then, with a yell of rage, they
threw themselves upon the soldiers.For a few minutes the little room was a bedlam.The crazed strikers
fought without weapons, except such as they could wrest from the
soldiers.One of them seized Carmen and
threw her beneath the table at which she had been working.The shouting and cursing might have been
heard for blocks around.Father Danny stood in front of the table,
beneath which lay the girl.He strove desperately to maintain his
position, that he might protect her, meantime frantically calling to
the mill hands to drag her out to the rear, and escape by the back
door.In the midst of the _melee_ a soldier mounted a chair near the door
and raised his rifle.The shot roared out, and Father Danny pitched
forward to the floor.Another shot, and still another followed in
quick succession.Then
they turned and fled precipitately through the rear exit.The lieutenant dragged Carmen from beneath the table and out through
the door.Then, assembling his men, he gave an order, and they marched
away with her up the icy street to the town jail.CHAPTER 16


With the wreckage which he had wrought strewn about him, J. Wilton
Ames sat at his rich desk far above the scampering human ants in the
streets below and contemplated the fell work of his own hands.And
often and anon as he looked, great beads of perspiration welled out
upon his forehead, and his breath came hot and dry.In the waste
basket at his feet lay crumpled the newspapers with their shrieking,
red-lettered versions of the slaughter at Avon.He was not a coward,
this man!But he had pushed that basket around the desk out of his
sight, for when he looked at it something rose before him that sent a
chill to his very soul.At times his vision blurred; and then he
passed his hands heavily across his eyes.He had chanced to read in
the grewsome accounts of the Avon massacre that little children had
been found among those fallen shacks, writhing in their last agonies.And the reports had said that great, red-dripping holes had been
ripped in their thin little bodies by those awful "dum-dum" bullets.And why had the demoniac soldiers down
there blown the brains from harmless women and helpless babes?He
really had not intended to go so far!The brats would have grown up to oppose
the vested privileges of the rich!They, too, would have become
anarchists and rioters, bent on leveling the huge industrial fabric
which such as he had so laboriously erected under the legal protection
afforded their sacred rights!And
the great captains of industry would thank him for the example he had
thus fearlessly set!To think of Avon was for him now to think in terms of blood.And yet
his carnal soul hourly wrestled sore with thoughts of a wholly
different stamp; with those strange emotions which he had felt when in
Carmen's presence; with those unfamiliar sentiments which, had he not
fought them back so bitterly, might have made him anew, and--

But the remembrance maddened him.His face grew black, and his mouth
poured forth a torrent of foul imprecations and threats upon her and
upon those who stood with her.He smote the
desk with his great fist.He fumed, he frothed, he hurled reason from
its throne, and bade the Furies again become his counselors.Upon the desk before him lay the mortgage papers which Hitt had
signed.He had bought the mortgage from the bank which had loaned the
Express the money.He would crush that sheet now, crush it until the
ink dripped black from its emasculated pages!And when it fell into
his hands, he would turn it into the yellowest of sensational
journals, and hoot the memory of its present staff from ocean to
ocean!Then, his head sunk upon his breast, he fell to wondering if he might
not secure a mortgage upon the Beaubien cottage, and turn its
occupants into the street.It was the
lever by which he moved the world, and clubbed its dull-witted
inhabitants into servile obeisance!Who could stand against him--

That girl!That obedient lackey hastened
into his master's presence."Called for this week, sir," replied Hood, glad that the announcement
could not possibly offend his superior."Brought up from Avon, and lodged in the Tombs, sir.""You tell Judge Spencer that if he allows her bail I'll see that his
federal appointment is killed, understand?"Ames regarded the man with a mixture of admiration and utter contempt.For Hood stood before him a resplendent example of the influence of
the most subtle of all poisons, the insidious lure of money.Soul and
body he had prostituted himself and his undoubted talents to it.And
now, were he to be turned adrift by Ames, the man must inevitably sink
into oblivion, squeezed dry of every element of genuine manhood, and
weighted with the unclean lucre for which his bony fingers had always
itched.He knows most about the formation of the defunct
Simiti company.""Well, see him and--you say he's young, and got a wife and baby?Offer
him twenty-five thousand to quit the case.""I'm afraid it wouldn't do, sir," returned Hood, shaking his head
dubiously."I've had men talking with him regarding the trial, and
he--"

"Then get him over here.I'll see if I can't persuade him," growled
Ames in an ugly tone.A few minutes later Reverend Darius Borwell
was ushered into the financier's private office.Ames," cried that gentleman of the cloth, "it's shocking,
terribly so, what those unbridled, unprincipled mill hands have drawn
upon themselves down in Avon!And four members of the Church
of the Social Revolution came to my study last evening and demanded
that I let them speak to my congregation on the coming Sabbath!"And I shall
have policemen stationed at the doors next Sunday to maintain order!To think that it has come to this in America!I would advise--"

"Nobody can get within a block of my house, sir, without ringing a
series of electric bells," replied Ames evenly."I have fifty guards
and private detectives in attendance in and about my premises all the
time.My limousine has been lined with sheet steel.I simply want to keep going
until I can carry out a few plans I have in hand."His thought had
reverted again to the fair girl in the Tombs."But now, Borwell," he continued, "I want to talk with you about
another matter.I am drawing up my will, and--"

"Why, my dear Mr.Ames thought of his physician's constantly iterated warning; but shook
his head."I may get caught in this Avon affair," he said evasively.The President has sent his message to
Congress, as you may be aware.There are unpleasant suggestions in it
regarding dispossession in cases like my own.I'm coming back by
magnanimously willing to Congress a hundred millions, to stand as a
fund for social uplift.""But the little matter I wish to discuss with you is the sum that I am
setting aside for the erection of a new church edifice," continued
Ames, eying the minister narrowly.cried that worthy gentleman, springing up and
clasping the financier's hand.One should not be too precipitate in
accepting tentative benefactions."Ah--we really should have--ah--a
trifle more, Mr.There's the settlement home, and the commons,
you know, and--"

"Humph!Well, we'll start with half a million," replied Ames dryly."By the way, you know Jurges, eh?Er--have
you any particular influence with him, if I may ask?"His sharp eyes
bored straight through the wondering divine."Why--yes--yes, I know the gentleman.And, as for influence--well, I
may--"

"Yes, just so," put in Ames."Now there is a trial coming up this
week, and Jurges will be called to the stand.I want you to give him
the true facts in regard to it.I'll call Hood, and we'll go over them
in detail now.Then you see Jurges this afternoon, and--say, he's
raising a building fund too, isn't he?"The magnate summoned Hood again; and for an hour the trio discussed
the forthcoming trial of the unfortunate Philip O. Ketchim.Then Ames
dismissed the clergyman, and bade his office boy admit the young
lawyer, Cass, who had come in response to Hood's request.For some moments after Cass entered the office Ames stood regarding
him, studying what manner of man he was, and how best to approach him.Then he opened the conversation by a casual reference to the
unsatisfactory business situation which obtained throughout the
country, and expressed wonder that young men just starting in their
professions managed to make ends meet."But," he concluded with deep significance, "better go hungry than
take on any class of business which, though promising good money
returns, nevertheless might eventually prove suicidal."He looked hard
at the young lawyer when he paused."But as I am
particularly busy this morning, may I ask why you have sent for me?Have you anything that I can--"

"I have," abruptly interrupted the financier."We need additions to
our legal staff.I thought perhaps you might like to talk over the
matter with me, with a view to entering our employ."Ames, I--I have never thought of--" The young man's eyes
glistened."Well, suppose you think of it now," said Ames, smiling graciously."I
have heard considerable about you of late, and I must say I rather
like the way you have been handling your work."The work which he had been
doing of late was most ordinary and routine, and called for no display
of legal skill whatever."I'd hate to see you tackle anything at this stage of your career, Mr.And I am afraid your
association with Ketchim is going to do just that.But possibly you do
not intend to handle further business for him?"Ketchim, though long confined in the Tombs, had at length secured
bail, through the not wholly disinterested efforts of his uncle,
Stolz, the sworn enemy of Ames.And, because of his loyal efforts in
behalf of Ketchim, Stolz had insisted that Cass be retained as counsel
for the latter when his trial should come up."I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr.Hood
will take you on at a salary of, say, five thousand to start with.We'll try you out for a few weeks.Then, if we don't mutually fit,
why, we'll quietly separate and say nothing.Half of that salary would have looked large to him
then.But--

"May I ask," he slowly said in reply, "what class of work Mr.Hood
would give me to start with?""Why, nothing of great importance, perhaps, while you are getting into
the harness.You've had experience
in that, eh?"That little house
which he had passed and stopped to look at so wistfully every night on
his way home was now within his grasp.He glanced up at the great man, sitting so calmly before him.Ames," he said, "if I enter your employ, it must be with the
stipulation that I shall have nothing to do with the Ketchim trial.""If you enter my employ, sir, it will
be with the stipulation that you do as I say," he returned coldly.And then the young lawyer saw through the mask.And his anger flamed
high at what he discerned behind it.Ames," said he, "you have made a mistake.I am poor, and I need
business.But I have not as yet fallen so completely under the spell
of fortune-hunting as to sell my honor to a man like you!To enter
your employ, I now see, would mean the total loss of character and
self respect.It would mean a lowering of my ideals, whatever they may
be, to your own vulgar standard.I may have done wrong in becoming
associated with Mr.But I
pledged myself to assist him.And yet, in doing so, I scarcely can
blacken my reputation to the extent that I should were I to become
your legal henchman.But there are some terms upon
which even I can not accept it.Ames gave a snort of anger when Cass went out.Summoning Hood, he
vented his great wrath upon that individual's bald pate."And now," he
concluded, "I want that fellow Cass so wound up that he will sneak off
to a lonely spot and commit suicide!And if you can't do it, then I'll
accept your resignation!"Ames, I have
just learned that Judge Harris, father of the young man who came up
with that girl, is in Colombia.Seems that he's taken some wealthy man
down there to look at La Libertad mine.""They believe you put one over on Ketchim, with the help of Monsignor
Lafelle, and so they've gone down to get titles to that mine.""By G--"

"And they say that--"

"Never mind what they say!""Cable Wenceslas at once to
see that those fellows remain permanently in Colombia.He has ways of
accomplishing that.I guess
Wenceslas can block his little game!"His great frame shook slightly as he stood consuming with rage, and a
slight hemorrhage started from his nostrils.And as he walked, Hood thought his left foot dragged
slightly.*       *       *       *       *

And then, with the way well cleared, came the Ketchim trial, which has
gone down in history as containing the most spectacular _denouement_
in the record of legal procedure in the New World.Had it been
concerned, as was anticipated, only with routine legal procedure
against the man Ketchim, a weak-souled compound of feeble sycophancy
and low morals, it would have attracted slight attention, and would
have been spread upon the court records by uninterested clerks with
never a second thought.But there were elements entering into it of
whose existence the outside world could not have even dreamed.Into it
converged threads which now may be traced back to scenes and events in
three continents; threads whose intricate windings led through
trackless forest and dim-lit church; through court of fashion and hut
of poverty; back through the dark mazes of mortal thought, where no
light shines upon the carnal aims and aspirations of the human mind;
back even to the doors of a palace itself, even to the proudest throne
of the Old World.But none of these elements found expression in the indictment against
the frightened defendant, the small-visioned man who had sought to
imitate the mighty Ames, and yet who lacked sufficient intelligence of
that sort which manifests in such a perversion of skill and power.Ames was a tremendous corruptionist, who stood beyond the laws simply
because of the elemental fact that he himself made those laws.Ketchim
was a plain deceiver.Mingling
his theology with fraud, he employed the unholy alliance for the
purpose of exploiting the credulous who attended his prayer meetings
and commented with bated breath upon his beautiful showing of
religious zeal.He was but one of a multitude afflicted with the
"dollar mania."His misfortune was that his methods were so antique
that they could not long fail of detection.And it was because of his
use of the mails for the purpose of deceit that the indictment had
been drawn against Philip O. Ketchim _et al._ by the long-suffering,
tolerant complainant, called the people.Nominally the people's interests were in the hands of the Public
Prosecutor, a certain smug young worldling named Ellis.But, as that
gentleman owed his appointment to Ames, it is not surprising that at
his right hand sat Hood and his well trained staff.Nominally, too,
Judge Spencer conducted the trial strictly upon its merits, not all of
which lay with the people.But the judge might have been still
prosecuting petty cases back in the unknown little district from
which he came, had it not been for the great influence of Ames, long
since, who had found him on a certain occasion useful.And so the jury
panel contained none but those who, we may be very sure, were amenable
to the tender pressure of a soft hand lined with yellow gold.And only
those points of evidence were sustained which conduced to the
incrimination of the miserable defendant.Ketchim was doomed before
the trial began.And yet, to subserve the dark schemes of Ames, and to lengthen the
period of torture to which his victims should be subjected, the trial
was dragged through many days.Besides, even he and his hirelings were
bound to observe the formalities.It was at the suggestion of Cass that no effort had been made to
procure bail for Carmen after her arrest.The dramatic may always be
relied upon to carry a point which even plain evidence negatives.And
she, acquiescing in the suggestion, remained a full two weeks in the
Tombs before Ames's eager counsel found their opportunity to confront
her on the witness stand and besmirch her with their black charges.The Beaubien was prostrated.But, knowing that for her another hour of
humiliation and sorrow had come, she strove mightily to summon her
strength for its advent.Father Waite toiled with Cass day and night.Hitt and Haynerd, without financial resources, pursued their way, grim
and silent.And
they stood at the helm, stanch to their principles, not yielding an
iota to offers of assistance in exchange for a reversal of the policy
upon which the paper had been launched."We're going down, Hitt," said Haynerd grimly."But we go with the
flag flying at the mast!"He was learning to know as did Carmen, and to
see with eyes which were invisible.It was just when the jury had been impaneled, after long days of petty
wrangling and childish recrimination among the opposing lawyers, that
Stolz came to Ames and laid down his sword.The control of C. and R.
should pass unequivocally to the latter if he would but save Ketchim
from prison.Then Ames lay back and roared with laughter over his great triumph.He would send Stolz' nephew to prison, and then roll a
bomb along Wall Street whose detonation would startle the financial
world clean out of its orbit!Stolz had failed to notice that Ames's
schemes had so signally worked out that C. and R. was practically in
his hands now!The defeated railroad magnate at length backed out of
the Ames office purple with rage.And then he pledged himself to
hypothecate his entire fortune to the rescue of his worthless nephew.Thus, in deep iniquity, was launched the famous trial, a process of
justice in name only, serving as an outlet for a single man's long
nurtured personal animosities.The adulterous union of religion and
business was only nominally before the bar.The victims, not the
defendant only, not the preachers, the washerwomen, the factory girls,
the widows, and the orphans, whose life savings Ketchim had drawn into
his net by the lure of pious benedictions, but rather those
unfortunates who had chanced to incur the malicious hatred of the
great, legalized malefactor, Ames, by opposition to his selfish
caprice, and whose utter defeat and discrediting before the public
would now place the crown of righteous expediency upon his own
chicanery and extortion and his wantonly murderous deeds.Doctor Jurges, utterly
confused by the keen lawyers, and vainly endeavoring to follow the
dictates of his conscience, while attempting to reconcile them with
his many talks with Darius Borwell, gave testimony which fell little
short of incriminating himself.For there were produced letters which
he had written to members of his congregation, and which for subtlety
and deception, though doubtless innocently done, would have made a
seasoned promoter look sharp to his own laurels.He had been summoned from Denver for the
trial.But his stuttering evidence gave no advantage to either side.And then--crowning blunder!--Cass permitted Ketchim himself to take
the stand.And the frightened, trembling broker gave his own cause
such a blow that the prosecution might well have asked the judge to
take the case from the jury then and there.It was a legal _faux pas_;
and Cass walked the floor and moaned the whole night through.Then, as per program, the prosecution called Madam Beaubien.Could not
that sorrowing woman have given testimony which would have aided the
tottering defense, and unmasked the evil genius which presided over
this mock trial?But not one point would the
judge sustain when it bordered upon forbidden territory.It was made
plain to her that she was there to testify against Ketchim, and to
permit the Ames lawyers to bandy her own name about the court room
upon the sharp points of their cruel cross-questions and low
insinuations.But, she protested, her knowledge of the Simiti company's affairs had
come through another person.Ames should give his own testimony--for was it not he who
had, not long since, legally punished the witness on a charge of
defamation of character?And the spectators
knew that it was because the righteous prosecution could no longer
stain its hands with one who bore such a tarnished name as she.And then, taunted and goaded to exasperation, the wronged woman burst
into tears and flayed the bigamist Ames there before the court room
crowded with eager society ladies and curious, non-toiling men.Flayed
him as men are seldom flayed and excoriated by the women they trample.The bailiffs seized her, and dragged her into an ante-room; the judge
broke his gavel rapping for order, and threatened to clear the court;
and then Cass, too young and inexperienced to avoid battle with
seasoned warriors, rose and demanded that Madam Beaubien be returned
to the stand.He turned to
the people, as if seeking their support.A great murmur arose through
the court room.That man, sitting calm
and unimpassioned, nodded his head slightly.And the woman was led
back to the chair."It may have an important bearing upon the case, Your Honor!"cried
the young lawyer for the defense.Ames is to take the stand as an
important witness in this case.If Madam Beaubien brings such a charge
against him, it gives us reason to believe his honor peccable, and his
testimony open to suspicion!"It was a daring statement, and the whole room gasped, and held its
breath."The
lawyer for the defense is in contempt of court!Madam Beaubien has
been shown to be a--"

"The objection is sustained!"_"His first wife's portrait--is in a glass window--in his yacht!"_
cried the hysterical Beaubien.Then she crumpled up in a limp mass,
and was led from the chair half fainting.At the woman's shrill words a white-haired man, dressed in black,
clerical garb, who had been sitting in the rear of the room close to
the door, rose hastily, then slowly sat down again.At his feet
reposed a satchel, bearing several foreign labels.Evidently he had
but just arrived from distant lands.Consternation reigned throughout the room for a few minutes.Then
Cass, believing that the psychological moment had arrived, loudly
called Carmen Ariza to the stand.The dramatic play must be continued,
now that it had begun.The battle which had raged back and forth for
long, weary days, could be won, if at all, only by playing upon the
emotions of the jury, for the evidence thus far given had resulted in
showing not only the defense, but likewise the Beaubien, and all who
had been associated with the Simiti company, including Cass himself,
to be participators in gross, intentional fraud.The remaining witness, the girl herself, had been purposely neglected
by the prosecution, for the great Ames had planned that she must be
called by the defense.Then would he bring up the prostitute, Jude,
and from her wring testimony which must blast forever the girl's
already soiled name.Following her, he would himself take the stand,
and tell of the girl's visits to his office; of her protestations of
love for him; of her embracing him; and of a thousand indiscretions
which he had carefully garnered and stored for this triumphant
occasion.But the judge, visibly perturbed by the dramatic turn which the case
seemed to be taking, studied his watch for a moment, then Ames's face,
and then abruptly adjourned court until the following day.Yet not
until Cass had been recognized, and the hounded girl summoned from her
cell in the Tombs, to take the stand in the morning for--her life!CHAPTER 17


In the days to come, when the divine leaven which is in the world
to-day shall have brought more of the carnal mind's iniquity to the
surface, that the Sun of Truth may destroy the foul germs, there shall
be old men and women, and they which, looking up from their work, peep
and mutter of strange things long gone, who shall fall wonderingly
silent when they have told again of the fair young girl who walked
alone into the crowded court room that cold winter's morning.And
their stories will vary with the telling, for no two might agree what
manner of being it was that came into their midst that day.Even the bailiffs, as if moved by some strange prescience, had fallen
back and allowed her to enter alone.The buzz of subdued chatter
ceased, and a great silence came over all as they looked.Some swore,
in awed whispers, when the dramatic day had ended, and judge and jury
and wrangling lawyer had silently, and with bowed heads, gone quiet
and thoughtful each to his home, that a nimbus encircled her beautiful
head when she came through the door and faced the gaping multitude.Some said that her eyes were raised; that she saw not earthly things;
and that a heavenly presence moved beside her.Nor may we lightly set
aside these tales; for, after the curtain had fallen upon the
wonderful scene about to be enacted, there was not one present who
would deny that, as the girl came into the great room and went
directly to the witness chair, God himself walked at her side and held
her hand."Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou
dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou
goest."Through the mind of that same white-haired man in the clerical garb
ran these words as he watched the girl move silently across the room.She seemed to have taken on a new meaning to him since the previous
day.And as he looked, his eyes grew moist, and he drew out his
handkerchief.But his were not the only eyes that had filled then.Hitt and Haynerd
bent their heads, that the people might not see; Miss Wall and the
Beaubien wept silently, and with no attempt to stay their grief; Jude
buried her head in her hands, and rocked back and forth, moaning
softly.A welter of conflicting emotions
surged through their harassed souls.They seemed to have come now to
the great crisis.And which way the tide would turn rested with this
lone girl.For some moments after she was seated the silence remained unbroken.And as she sat there, waiting, she looked down at the man who sought
to destroy what he might not possess.Some said afterward that as she
looked at him she smiled.Who knows but that the Christ himself smiled
down from the cross at those who had riven his great heart?He was far
from well that morning, and an ugly, murderous mood possessed him.And
yet, judged by the world's standards, he had tipped the crest of
success.He was swollen
with wealth, with material power, with abnormal pride.His tender
sensibilities and sympathies were happily completely ossified, and he
was stone deaf and blind to the agonies of a suffering world.Not a
single aim but had been realized; not a lone ambition but had been
met.Even the armed camp at Avon, and the little wooden crosses over
the fresh mounds there, all testified to his omnipotence; and in them,
despite their horrors, he felt a satisfying sense of his own great
might.The clerk held up the Bible for the girl to give her oath.She looked
at him for a moment, and then smiled."I will tell the truth," she
said simply.The officer hesitated, and looked up at the judge.But the latter sat
with his eyes fixed upon the girl.The clerk did not press the point;
and Carmen was delivered into the hands of the lawyers.Then, yielding to a sudden
impulse, he asked the girl to mention briefly the place of her birth,
her parentage, and other statistical data, leading up to her
association with the defendant.It was but the one she had
told again and again.And when
she had concluded, Cass turned her back again to Simiti, and to
Rosendo's share in the mining project which had ultimated in this
suit.A far-away look came into the girl's eyes as she spoke of that great,
black man who had taken her from desolate Badillo into his own warm
heart.There were few dry eyes among the spectators when she told of
his selfless love.And when she drew the portrait of him, standing
alone in the cold mountain water, far up in the jungle of Guamoco,
bending over the laden _batea_, and toiling day by day in those
ghastly solitudes, that she might be protected and educated and raised
above her primitive environment in Simiti, there were sobs heard
throughout the room; and even the judge, hardened though he was by
conflict with the human mind, removed his glasses and loudly cleared
his throat as he wiped them.Ames first grew weary as he listened, and then exasperated.His lawyer
at length rose to object to the recital on the ground that it was
largely irrelevant to the case.And the judge, pulling himself
together, sustained the objection.Then the prosecution
eagerly took up the cross-examination."Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
bring forth," murmured the white-haired man in the clerical garb far
back in the crowded room.Had he learned the law of Truth to error,
"Thou shall surely die"?Did he discern the vultures gnawing at the
rich man's vitals?Did he, too, know that this giant of privilege, so
insolently flaunting his fleeting power, his blood-stained wealth and
his mortal pride, might as well seek to dim the sun in heaven as to
escape the working of those infinite divine laws which shall effect
the destruction of evil and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven
even here upon earth?The latter drew Ellis down and
transmitted his master's instructions.The atmosphere grew tense, and
the hush of expectancy lay over all."Miss Carmen," began Ellis easily, "your parentage has been a matter
of some dispute, if I mistake not, and--"

Cass was on his feet to object.What had this question to do with the
issue?Cass should have divined it by this time.Ellis cleared his throat and adjusted his glasses."And your
father, it is said, was a <DW64> priest.I believe that has been
accepted for some time."I never knew my earthly father," replied Carmen in a low voice."But you have admitted that it might have been this Diego, have you
not?""It might have been," returned the girl, looking off absently toward
the high windows."Did he not claim you as his daughter?""Now," continued Ellis, "that being reasonably settled, is it not also
true that you used the claim of possessing this mine, La Libertad, as
a pretext for admission to society here in New York?"The girl did not answer, but only smiled pityingly at him.He, too,
had bartered his soul; and in her heart there rose a great sympathy
for him in his awful mesmerism."And that you claimed to be an Inca princess?"admonished the judge, looking severely down upon the silent
girl.Carmen sighed, and drew her gaze away from the windows.She was weary,
oh, so weary of this unspeakable mockery.And yet she was there to
prove her God."I would like to ask this further question," Ellis resumed, without
waiting for her reply."Were you not at one time in a resort conducted
by Madam Cazeau, down on--"

He stopped short.The girl's eyes were looking straight into his, and
they seemed to have pierced his soul."I am sorry for you," she said
gently, "oh, so sorry!The man knew not whether to smile in triumph or hide his head in
shame.Ames alone
met his embarrassed glance, and sent back a command to continue the
attack.What possible relation to the
issue involved could such testimony have?But the judge bade him sit
down, as the counsel for the prosecution doubtless was bringing out
facts of greatest importance.Ellis again cleared his throat and bent to his loathsome task."Now,
Miss Ariza, in reference to your labors to incite the mill hands at
Avon to deeds of violence, the public considers that as part of a
consistent line of attack upon Mr.Ames, in which you were aiding
others from whom you took your orders.May I ask you to cite the
motives upon which you acted?"Ames," she slowly replied, "but only the
things he stands for."A militant brand of social uplift, I
suppose?"And that is the sort of remedy that anarchists apply to
industrial troubles, is it not?""There is no remedy for industrial troubles but Christianity," she
said gently."Not the burlesque Christianity of our countless sects
and churches; not Roman Catholicism; not Protestantism; nor any of the
fads and fancies of the human mind; but just the Christianity of Jesus
of Nazareth, who knew that the human man was not God's image, but only
stood for it in the mortal consciousness.And he always saw behind
this counterfeit the real man, the true likeness of God.And--"

"You are diverging from the subject proper and consuming time, Miss
Ariza!"Carmen did not heed him, but continued quietly:

"And it was just such a man that Jesus portrayed in his daily walk and
words.""No," the girl went calmly on, "Jesus did not stand for the
intolerance, the ignorance, the bigotry, the hatred, and the human
hypothesis, the fraud, and chicanery, and the 'Who shall be greatest?'Nor did he make evil a reality, as mortals do.He knew it seemed awfully real to the deceived human consciousness;
but he told that consciousness to be not afraid.And then he went to
work and drove out the belief of evil on the basis of its nothingness
and its total lack of principle.The orthodox churches and sects of
to-day do not do that.Their
kingdom is wholly temporal, and is upheld by heartless millionaires,
and by warlike kings and emperors.Their tenets shame the intelligence
of thinking men!Yet they have slain tens of millions to establish
them!"To remove the girl meant depriving Ames of
his prey.But if she remained upon the stand, she would put them all
to confusion, for they had no means of silencing her.The judge looked
blankly at Ames; his hands were tied.Ellis hurried to change the current of her talk by interposing another
question."Will you tell us, Miss Carmen, why you have been working--"

"I have been working for God," she interrupted.Her voice was low and
steady, and her eyes shone with a light that men are not wont to see
in those of their neighbors.And for Him I am here to-day."Consternation was plainly discernible in the camp of the prosecution.Cass knew now that he need make no more objections.The defense had
passed from his hands.At this juncture James Ketchim, brother of the defendant, thinking to
relieve the strain and embarrassment, gave audible voice to one of his
wonted witticisms.But the effect was not
what he had anticipated.roared the exasperated judge, bending
far over his desk.And the elder
Ketchim retired in chagrin and confusion."Miss Carmen," pursued Ellis, eager to recover his advantage, for he
saw significant movements among the jury, "do you not think the
unfortunate results at Avon quite prove that you have allied yourself
with those who oppose the nation's industrial progress?"Order had now been restored in the court room, and
Ellis was feeling sure of himself again."You have opposed the constructive development of our country's
resources by your assaults upon men of wealth, like Mr.Ames, for
example, have you not?"Then the girl opened her mouth, and from it came words that fell upon
the room like masses of lead."I stand opposed to any man, Mr.Ellis,
who, to enrich himself, and for the purpose of revenge, spreads the
boll weevil in the cotton fields of the South."And yet it was a silence that
fell crashing upon Ames's straining ears.He sat for a moment stunned;
then sprang to his feet.He held out a
hand, and made as if to speak; then sank again into his chair.Ellis collected himself, and turned to the judge."Your Honor, we regret to state that, from the replies which Miss
Ariza has given, we do not consider her mentally competent as a
witness."I should
like to examine the witness further!"returned the judge, glowering over his spectacles
at the young lawyer."I stand on--"

"Sit down!"called Cass through the rising tumult, "the lawyer for
the prosecution has heaped insults upon you in his low references to
your parentage.Will you--"

The judge pounded upon his desk with the remnant of his broken gavel.he called in a loud, threatening
voice.The judge sat down and mopped his steaming face.Ames was a study of
wild, infuriated passion.Carmen
sat quietly facing the crowded room.She had reached up and was
fondling the little locket which hung at her throat.It was the first
time she had ever worn it.It was not a pretty piece of jewelry; and
it had never occurred to her to wear it until that day.Nor would she
have thought of it then, had not the Beaubien brought it to the Tombs
the night before in a little box with some papers which the girl had
called for.Why she had put it on, she could not say.Slowly, while the silence continued unbroken, the girl drew the
slender chain around in front of her and unclasped it."I--I never--knew my parents," she murmured musingly, looking down
lovingly at the little locket.Then she opened it and sat gazing, rapt
and absorbed, at the two little portraits within."But there are their
pictures," she suddenly announced, holding the locket out to Cass.It was said afterward that never in the history of legal procedure in
New York had that court room held such dead silence as when Cass stood
bending over the faces of the girl's earthly parents, portrayed in the
strange little locket which Rosendo had taken from Badillo years
before.Never had it known such a tense moment; never had the very air
itself seemed so filled with a mighty, unseen presence, as on that day
and in that crisal hour.Without speaking, Hood rose and looked over Cass's shoulder at the
locket.A muffled cry escaped him, and he turned and stared at Ames."Yes, sir," replied Hood in a voice that was scarcely heard.Hood seemed to have frozen to the spot.His hands shook, and his words
gibbered from his trembling lips."The--the woman's portrait, sir--is--is--the one in--in Mr."_

The piercing cry rang through the still room like a lost soul's
despairing wail.Ames had rushed from his seat, overturning his chair,
thrusting the lawyers aside, and seized the locket.For a moment he
peered wildly into it.It seemed as if his eyes would devour it,
absorb it, push themselves clean through it, in their eagerness to
grasp its meaning.His eyes were red; his face ashen; his lips white.His unsteady glance met the girl's.His mouth opened, and flapped like
a broken shutter in the wind.His arms swung wildly upward; then
dropped heavily.Suddenly he bent to one side; caught himself;
straightened up; and then, with a horrifying, gurgling moan, crashed
to the floor.The noise of the tremendous fall reverberated through
the great room like an echo of Satan's plunge into the pit of hell.They rushed forward in a mass, over railings, over chairs
and tables, heedless of all but the great mystery that was slowly
clearing away in the dim light that winter's morning.Through them the
white-haired man, clad in clerical vestments, elbowed his way to the
bar.He tore it from Hood's hand and scanned it eagerly.he murmured, trembling with
excitement.Then, shouting to the judge above the hubbub:

"Your Honor!called the judge in a loud, quavering voice.The woman's
portrait in this little locket is that of Dona Dolores, Infanta,
daughter of Queen Isabella the Second, of Spain!And this girl,"
pointing to the bewildered Carmen, who sat clinging to the arms of her
chair, "is her child, and is a princess of the royal blood!Her father
is the man who lies there--J. Wilton Ames!"CHAPTER 18


Borne on pulsing electric waves, the news of the great _denouement_
flashed over the city, and across a startled continent.Beneath the
seas it sped, and into court and hovel.Madrid gasped; Seville panted;
and old Padre Rafael de Rincon raised his hoary head and cackled
shrilly.To the seething court room came flying reporters and news gatherers,
who threw themselves despairingly against the closed portals.Within,
the bailiffs fought with the excited crowd, and held the doors against
the panic without.Over the prostrate form of Ames the physicians worked with feverish
energy, but shook their heads.In the adjoining ante-room, whither she had been half carried, half
dragged by Hitt when Ames fell, sat Carmen, clasped in the Beaubien's
arms, stunned, bewildered, and speechless.Hitt stood guard at the
door; and Miss Wall and Jude tiptoed about with bated breath, unable
to take their eyes from the girl.In the court room without, Haynerd held the little locket, and plied
Monsignor Lafelle with his incoherent questions.The excited editor's
brain was afire; but of one thing he was well assured, the Express
would bring out an extra that night that would scoop its rivals clean
to the bone!In a few minutes the bailiffs fought the mob back from the doors and
admitted a man, a photographer, who had been sent out to procure
chemicals in the hope that the portrait of the man in the locket might
be cleaned.Ten minutes later the features of J. Wilton Ames stood
forth clearly beside those of the wife of his youth.The picture
showed him younger in appearance, to be sure, but the likeness was
unmistakable.Monsignor, but you are slow!wailed Haynerd, shaking the
churchman's arm in his excitement."I saw the portrait in the Royal
Gallery, years ago, in Madrid.I could not forget the
sad, sweet face.I saw it again in the stained-glass window in the
Ames yacht.There was much whispering, much shaking of heads, but little
information.But this I know: the queen, the great Isabella, had a
lover, a wonderful tenor, Marfori, Marquis de Loja.And one day a babe
was taken quietly to a little cottage in the Granada hills.Rumor said
that it was an Infanta, and that the tenor was its father.One man, perhaps: old Rafael de Rincon.But Rome suddenly recalled
him from Isabella's court, and after that he was very quiet."Ames," he said, "traveled much in
Europe.He bought a vineyard in Granada--the
one from which he still procures his wine.And there--who knows?--he
met the Infanta.But probably neither he nor she guessed her royal
birth.""Well, they eloped--who knows?Whether married or not, I can not say.But it is evident she went with him to Colombia, where, perhaps, he
was seeking a concession from Congress in Bogota.Then came the news of his father's sudden death.Possibly he bade her wait for his return.But a
prospective mother is often excitable.She waited a day, a week--who
knows how long?she was wild
to do such a thing.She died at the little
riverine town of Badillo, after her babe, Carmen, was born."A heritage from her grandfather, the tenor, Marfori," Lafelle
suggested."But--the portraits--what is the name under that of Ames?"Yes, for Guillermo in Spanish is William.Doubtless Ames told her his
name was Will, contracted from Wilton, the name he went by in his
youth.And the nearest the Spanish could come to it was Guillermo.Diego's name was Guillermo Diego Polo.And after he had seen that name
in the locket he used it as a further means of strengthening his claim
upon the girl.""Then--she is--a--princess!""Yes, doubtless, if my reasoning is correct.Not an Inca princess, but
a princess of the reigning house of Spain."Haynerd could hold himself no longer, but rushed madly from the room
and tore across town to the office of the Express.Then came the white-enameled ambulance, dashing and careening to the
doors of the building where Ames lay so quiet.Gently, silently, the
great body was lifted and borne below.And then the chattering,
gesticulating mob poured from the court room, from the halls and
corridors, and out into the chill sunlight of the streets, where they
formed anew into little groups, and went over again the dramatic
events but a few minutes past.Then, too, emerged Carmen, heavily veiled from the curious, vulgar
gaze of the rabble, and entered the waiting limousine, with the
Beaubien and Hitt.Miss Wall and the gasping Jude followed in another.The judge had bidden the girl go on her own recognizance.The arrest
at Avon; the matter of bail; all had merged into the excitement of the
hour and been forgotten.Ketchim went out on Cass's arm.The judge had
ordered the clerk to enter an adjournment.*       *       *       *       *

All that afternoon and far into the night a gaping, wondering
concourse braved the cold and stood about the walk that led up to the
little Beaubien cottage.Within, the curtains were drawn, and Sidney,
Jude, and Miss Wall answered the calls that came incessantly over the
telephone and to the doors.Sidney had not been in the court room, for
Haynerd had left him at the editor's desk in his own absence.But with
the return of Haynerd the lad had hurried into a taxicab and commanded
the chauffeur to drive madly to the Beaubien home.And once through
the door, he clasped the beautiful girl in his arms and strained her
to his breast."My own, my very own little sister!We only
pretended before, didn't we?But now--now, oh, God above!The scarce comprehending girl drew his head down and kissed him."Sidney," she murmured, "the ways of God are past finding out!"Aye, for again, as of old, He had chosen the foolish things of the
world to confound the wise; He had chosen the weak to confound the
mighty; and the base things, and the things despised, had He used to
bring to naught the things that are.That no flesh might
glory in His terrible presence!The girl smiled up at him; then turned away.she kept repeating, groping her way about
the room as if in a haze.The still dazed Beaubien drew the girl into her arms.Yet I
called you that from the very first.And he--that
man--your father!"It--"

Then the Beaubien's heart almost stopped.What,
then, would this sudden turn in the girl's life mean to the lone woman
who clung to her so?"No, mother dearest," whispered Carmen, looking up through her tears."For even if it should be true, I will not leave you.He--he--"

She stopped; and would speak of him no more.But neither of them knew as yet that in that marvelous Fifth Avenue
palace, behind those drawn curtains and guarded bronze doors, at which
an eager crowd stood staring, Ames, the superman, lay dying, his left
side, from the shoulder down, paralyzed.*       *       *       *       *

In the holy quiet of the first hours of morning, the mist rose, and
the fallen man roused slowly out of his deep stupor.And then through
the dim-lit halls of the great mansion rang a piercing cry.For when
he awoke, the curtain stood raised upon his life; and the sight of its
ghastly content struck wild terror to his naked soul.He had dreamed as he lay there, dreamed while the mist was rising.He
thought he had been toiling with feverish energy through those black
hours, building a wall about the things that were his.And into the
design of the huge structure he had fitted the trophies of his
conquest.Gannette toiled with him, straining, sweating, groaning.Together they reared that monstrous wall; and as they labored, the man
plotted the death of his companion when the work should be done, lest
he ask for pay.And into the corners of the wall they fitted little
skulls.These were the children of Avon who had never played.And over
the great stones which they heaved into place they sketched red
dollar-marks; and their paint was human blood.A soft wind swept over
the rising structure, and it bore a gentle voice: "I am Love."But the
toilers looked up and cursed.And over the rim of the wall looked fair faces."We are
Truth, we are Life!"But the men frothed with fury, and hurled skulls
at the faces, and bade them begone!A youth and a tender girl looked
down at the sweating toilers."We ask help; we are young, and times
are so hard!"And then the darkness settled down,
for the wall was now so high that it shut out the sun.And the great
man howled with laughter; the wall was done.So he turned and smote
his companion unto death, and dipped his hands in the warm blood of
the quivering corpse.And then he sought to
mount the wall.But his hands slipped on the human blood of the red,
slimy dollar-marks, and he fell crashing back among his tinkling
treasures.The naked, splitting skulls
leered at him.The toothless jaws clattered, and the eyeless sockets
glowed eerily.He begged that a rope be
lowered.He would go out once more into the sunlit world.But the
chill wind brought him only despairing moans.Then he rushed madly to the wall, and smote it with his bare hands.It
mocked him with the strength which he had given it.He turned and tore
his hair and flesh.He gnashed his teeth until they broke into bits.He cursed; he raved; he pleaded; he offered all his great treasure for
freedom.But the skulls grinned their horrid mockery at him; and the
blood on the stones dripped upon his burning head.And above it all he
heard the low plotting of those without who were awaiting his death,
that they might throw down the wall and take away his treasure.And then his fear became frenzy; his love of gold turned to horror;
his reason fled; and he dashed himself wildly against the prison which
he had reared, until he fell, bleeding and broken.And as he fell, he
heard the shrill cackle of demons that danced their hellish steps on
the top of the wall.Then the Furies flew down and bound him tight."Ah, my God, What might I not have made of Thy fair world Had I
  but loved Thy highest creature here?It was my duty to have loved
  the highest; It surely was my profit had I known."Then he
sought to raise his arms, to move.And then the scream
tore from his dry throat.The physicians bent over him and
sought to soothe his mental agony.The man's torture was fearful to
behold; his weakness, pitiable.But the
sleep was one of unbroken horror; and those in the room stopped in the
course of their duties; and their faces blanched; and they held their
hands to their ears, when his awful moans echoed through the curtained
room.Through his dreams raced the endless panorama of his crowded life.Now
he was wading through muddy slums where stood the wretched houses
which he rented for immoral purposes.And then he hurried to Avon; and there he dug into those fresh
graves--dug, dug, dug, throwing the dirt up in great heaps behind him.And into the face of each corpse as he dragged it out of its damp bed
he peered eagerly.But with awful moans he threw them from him in
turn, for she was not there.Then he fled down, down, far into the burning South; and there he
roamed the trackless wastes, calling her name.And the wild beasts and
the hissing serpents looked out at him from the thick bush, looked
with great, red eyes, and then fled from him with loathing.And,
suddenly, he came upon another mound near the banks of a great river.And over it stood a rude cross; and on the cross he read the dim,
penciled word, _Dolores_.how he cried out for the oblivion
that was not his.But the ghastly mound froze his blood, and he rushed
from it in terror, and fell, whirling over and over, down, down into
eternal blackness filled with dying men's groans!The exhausted attendants stood about
the bed with bated breath.The physicians had called Doctor Morton in
consultation, for the latter was a brain specialist.And while they
sat gazing at the crazed, stricken giant, hopelessly struggling to
lift the inert mass of his dead body, Reverend Darius Borwell entered.He bowed silently to them all; then went to the bedside and took the
patient's hand.A moment later he turned to the physicians and
nurses."Let us ask God's help for Mr.They bowed, and he knelt beside the bed and prayed long and earnestly;
prayed that the loving Father who had made man in His image would take
pity on the suffering one who lay there, and, if it be His will, spare
him for Jesus' sake.He arose from his knees, and they all sat quiet for some moments.Then
Doctor Morton's heavy voice broke the silence of death.Borwell,"
he said in awful earnestness, extending his hand toward the bed, "cure
that man, if your religion is anything more than a name!"A hot flush of indignation spread over the minister's face; but he did
not reply."Gentlemen," he said solemnly, "Mr.Ames, I think, is past our aid.There is nothing on earth that can save him.If he lives, he will be
hopelessly insane.""Upstairs, sir, in her apartments," answered the maid, wiping her red
eyes."See that she remains there," said the doctor gruffly."Gentlemen,"
turning again to the physicians, "I have but one suggestion.Send
for--for--that little girl, Carmen.""It is ill-advised, Doctor," interrupted one of the men."It would
only further excite him."I do not agree with you," returned Doctor Morton."As it is, he is
doomed.With her here--there may be a chance."The others shook their heads; but Doctor Morton persisted stubbornly."If she is sent for, I shall
retire from the case.""Very well," announced Doctor Morton evenly, "then I will take it
myself."He rose and went out into the vestibule where there was a
telephone.Calling for the Beaubien cottage, he gave a peremptory
order that Carmen come at once in the automobile which he was sending
for her.The Beaubien turned from the telephone to the girl."Why--is it--is he--"

"They say he is--dying," the woman whispered.Carmen stood for a minute as if stunned."Why--I--didn't know--that
there was--anything wrong.The Beaubien threw her arms around the girl.Father Waite rose from
the table where he had been writing, and came to them.A few minutes later the great bronze doors of the Ames mansion swung
wide to admit the daughter of the house.Doctor Morton met the wondering girl, and led her directly into the
sick-room."Miss Carmen," he said gravely, "Mr.The girl turned upon him like a flash from a clear sky."You mean, he
_shall_ not live!"Then a sense of her
magnificent environment, of her strange position, and of the vivid
events of the past few hours swept over her, and she became
embarrassed.The nurses and attendants, too, who stood about and
stared so hard at her, added to her confusion."Listen," he said, "I am leaving now,
but you will remain.If I am needed, one of the maids will summon
me."Carmen stood for a moment without speaking.Then she walked slowly to
the bed and looked down at the man.Doctor Morton motioned to the
attendants to withdraw.Then he himself stepped softly out and closed
the door.When the girl turned around, she was alone--with death.CHAPTER 19


A curious, gossiping world, dwelling only in the froth of the human
mind, will not comprehend for many a year to come what took place in
that dim, tapestried chamber of the rich man in those next hours.When
twilight began to steal through the marble halls of the great,
shrouded mansion, the nurse in charge, becoming apprehensive, softly
opened the door of the sick-room and peeped in.Through the darkness
she saw the girl, sitting beside the bed, with the man's right hand
clasped in both of hers, and her head resting upon his shoulder.And
the nurse quickly closed the door again in awe, and stole away.The girl sat there all that day and all that night, nor would leave
but for brief moments to eat, or to reassure the Beaubien over the
telephone that all was well.Doctor Morton came, and went, and came
again.Carmen smiled, and held his hand for a moment each time, but
said little.And, more, his cheeks were stained where
the scalding tears had coursed down them.But the doctor would ask no
questions.And three days and nights passed thus, while Carmen dwelt with the man
who, as the incarnation of error, seeking the destruction of others,
had destroyed himself.Then Doctor Morton announced to a waiting world that his patient would
live--but he would say no more.And the world heard, too, that
Kathleen Ames had left her father's roof--left in humiliation and
chagrin when she learned that Carmen had come there to live--and had
gone to England for a prolonged visit with the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her now thoroughly dismayed son.But Sidney came; and with
him the black-veiled Beaubien.And they both knelt beside the bed of
suffering; and the hand of the now quiet man slowly went out and lay
for a moment upon their bowed heads, while Carmen stood near.Then
Willett was sent for; and he came often after that, and took his
master's scarce audible instructions, and went away again to touch the
wires and keys that ended the war of hatred at Avon; that brought
Father Danny in the master's private car to the great metropolitan
hospital; that sent to the startled Hitt the canceled mortgage papers
on the Express; and that inaugurated that great work of restitution
which held the dwellers in the Ames mansion toiling over musty books
and forgotten records for months to come.What had passed between the man and the sweet-faced girl who hovered
over him like a ray of light, no one may know.That he had trod the
glowing embers of hell, his cavernous, deep-lined face and whitening
hair well testified.It was said afterward that on that third day he
had opened his eyes and looked straight into those of the girl.It was
said that she then whispered but one word, "Father."And that, when
the sound of her low voice fell upon his straining ears, he had
reached out the arm that still held life, and had drawn her head down
upon his breast, and wept like a motherless babe.But what he had
said, if aught, about the abandoned mother who, on the banks of the
distant river, years gone, had yielded her life to him and his child,
no one knew.Of but one thing was there any certainty: the name of
Padre Jose de Rincon had not crossed their lips during those dark
days.Then strong men lifted the giant from his bed
and placed him in a wheel chair; and Carmen drew the chair out into
the conservatory, among the ferns and flowers, and sat beside him, his
hand still clasped in both of hers.That he had found life, no one who
marked his tense, eager look, which in every waking moment lay upon
the girl, could deny.His body was dead; his soul was fluttering
feebly into a new sense of being.But with the awakening of conscience, in the birth-throes of a new
life, came the horrors, the tortures, the wild frenzy of self-loathing;
and, but for the girl who clung so desperately to him, he would have
quickly ended his useless existence.The stage upon which the curtain had risen,
whereon he saw the hourly portrayal of his own fiendish deeds, stood
always before him like a haunting spectre; and as he gazed with
horrified eyes, his hair grew hourly white.And the torture was rendered more poignant by the demands of his
erstwhile associates and henchmen.They had taken fright at the first
orders which had issued from the sick-bed, but now they swooped down
upon the harassed man to learn what might be expected from him in the
future.What were to be his policies now in regard to those manifold
interests which he was pursuing with such vigor a few weeks ago?Was
he still bent upon depriving Senator Gossitch of the seat which the
Ames money had purchased?The
Amalgamated Spinners' Association must know at once his further plans.His great railroad projects, his
mining ventures, his cotton deals, his speculations and gambling
schemes--whither should they tend now?Ward bosses, dive keepers,
bank presidents, lawyers, magnates, and preachers clamored for
admission at his doors when they learned that he would live, but that
a marvelous, incomprehensible change had swept over him.The tired, hectored man turned to Carmen.And she called Hitt and
Waite and the keen-minded Beaubien.The latter's wide business
experience and worldly knowledge now stood them all in good stead, and
she threw herself like a bulwark between the stricken man and the
hounds that roared at his gates.There were those among them who, like
Ames, had bitterly fought all efforts at industrial and social reform,
and yet who saw the dawning of a new era in the realms of finance, of
politics, of religion.There were those who sensed the slow awakening
of the world-conscience, and who resisted it desperately, and who now
sat frightened and angered at the thought of losing their great
leader.Their attitude toward life, like his, had been wrong from the
beginning; they, like him, were striking examples of the dire effects
of a false viewpoint in the impoverishing of human life.But, with
him, they had built up a tremendous material fabric.And now they
shook with fear as they saw its chief support removed.For they must
know that his was a type that was fast passing, and after it must come
the complete breakdown of the old financial order.His world-embracing
gambling--which touched all men in some way, for it had to do with the
very necessities of life, with crops, with railroads, with industries,
and out of which he had coined untold millions--had ceased forever.And to him also came Reverend Darius Borwell, in whose congregation
sat sanctimonious malefactors of vast wealth, whose pockets bulged
with disease-laden profits from the sales of women's bodies and souls.Reverend Borwell came to offer the sufferer the dubious consolations
of religion--and inquire if his beautiful change of heart would affect
the benefaction which he had designed for the new church.Ah, this was the hour when the fallen giant faced the Apostle's awful
question: What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed?_For the end of those things is death!_

And then came Monsignor Lafelle, asking not to see the sick man, but
the girl.And, alone with her in the great library that day, he bent
low over her hand and begged that she would forgive and forget.Ames that flagrantly false tale of the girl's
parentage.He had received it from Wenceslas, in Cartagena.It was he
who, surmising the dark secret of Ames, had concluded that the
supposed Infanta had been his wife.And he had returned to New York
to confront him with the charge, and to make great capital out of it.But he had never suspected for a moment Carmen's connection with the
mystery.And now--

But the girl saw only the image of God in the humiliated man.And when
he kissed her hand and departed, she bade him know, always, that she
loved him as a brother.And he knew it, knew that her love was of the
spirit--it left all for the Christ.A few days later there was delivered at the Ames mansion a cable
message from Cartagena, in reply to one which the master had sent to
the lawyer, Estrella.Ames shook with suppressed excitement when he
read it.Then he bade Carmen send at once for Hitt, Willett, and
Captain McCall, and leave them with him for a private conference.Ames repeated, as the three
men sat leaning eagerly forward an hour later, drinking in every word
he spoke."If the mission is successful, well and good.If it fails,
then our silence now will be justified, for as yet I have said nothing
to her regarding him.Wenceslas has
won--but with--but of that later.When can you get under way,
McCall?"The sudden flash of his old-time energy nearly startled them
from their chairs."And," he added, "you, Mr.Now, Willett, have the door of my limousine widened to accommodate
this wheel chair.I want a dozen men to insure our privacy, and to
keep the way clear.No one not in our confidence must see us depart.""But--Carmen--"

"Goes with us," returned Ames."I can not spare her for a moment.Madam Beaubien will have charge of the house during our absence.We
will be back here, weather favorable, in three weeks--or not at all!""Yet, she will know--"

"Nothing.I take the trip, ostensibly, for the change; to get away
from those who are hounding me here; for recuperation--anything!The man's eyes glistened like live coals, and
his sunken cheeks took on a feverish glow.That night the _Cossack_, enveloped in gloom, steamed noiselessly out
of New York harbor, and turned her prow to the South.And when she
had entered the high sea, Captain McCall from his bridge aloft sent a
message down to the waiting engineer:

"Full speed ahead!"CHAPTER 20


Cartagena's slumber of centuries had been broken by nearly four years
of civil warfare.But on the day that the lookout in the abandoned
convent of Santa Candelaria, on the summit of La Popa, flashed the
message down into the old city that a steam yacht had appeared on the
northern horizon, she was preparing to sink back again into quiet
dreams.For peace was being concluded among the warring political
factions.The country lay devastated and blood-soaked; but the cause
of Christ had triumphed, and the Church still sat supreme in the
councils of Bogota.Cartagena was _en fete_; the last of the political
agitators would be executed on the morrow.And so the lookout's
message was received with indifference, even though he embellished it
with the comment that the boat must be privately owned, as no ships of
the regular lines were due to arrive that day.Quietly the graceful craft swept down past Tierra Bomba and into the
Boca Chica, between the ancient forts of San Fernando and San Jose,
and came to anchor out in the beautiful harbor, a half mile from the
ancient gate of the clock.A few curious idlers along the shore
watched it and commented on its perfect lines.And the numerous
officials of the port lazily craned their necks at it, and yawningly
awaited the arrival of the skiff that was immediately lowered and
headed for the pier.The tall American who stepped from the little boat and came at once to
them to show his papers, easily satisfied their curiosity, for many
tourists of the millionaire class dropped anchor in Cartagena's
wonderful harbor, and came ashore to wander among the decaying
mementos of her glorious past.And this boat was not a stranger to
these waters.On the yacht itself, as they glanced again toward it,
there was no sign of life.Even the diminishing volume of smoke that
rose from its funnels evidenced the owner's intention of spending some
time in that romantic spot.From the dock, Hitt passed through the old gateway in the massive
wall, quickly crossed the _Plaza de Coches_, and lost himself in the
gay throngs that were entering upon the day's festivities.Occasionally he dropped into wine shops and little stores, and
lingered about to catch stray bits of gossip.Then he slowly made his
way up past the Cathedral and into the _Plaza de Simon Bolivar_.For a while, sitting on a bench in front of the equestrian statue of
the famous _Libertador_, he watched the passing crowds.From time to
time his glance strayed over toward the Cathedral.Once he rose, and
started in that direction; then came back and resumed his seat.It was
evident that he was driven hard, and yet knew not just what course to
pursue.Finally he jumped to his feet and went over to a little cigar store
which had caught his eye.He bent over the soiled glass case and
selected several cigars from the shabby stock.Putting one of them
into his mouth, he lighted it, and then casually nodded to a
powerfully built man standing near.The latter turned to the proprietor and made some comment in Spanish.Hitt immediately replied to it in the same tongue.The man flushed
with embarrassment; then doffed his hat and offered an apology."I
forget, senor," he said, "that so many Americans speak our language."Hitt held out his hand and laughed heartily at the incident.Then his
eye was attracted by a chain which the man wore."_Cierto_, _senor_," returned the man cordially."It came from an
Indian grave up in Guamoco.I am a _guaquero_--grave digger--by
profession; Jorge Costal, by name."Somehow he seemed to be familiar with that
name.Somewhere he seemed to have heard it."Suppose," he said, in his excellent Spanish, "that we cross
the _Plaza_ to yonder wine shop.You may be able to tell me some of
the history of this interesting old town.And--it would be a great
favor, senor."The man bowed courteously and accepted the invitation.A few moments
later they sat at a little table, with a bottle between them,
commenting on the animated scene in the street without."Peace will be concluded to-day, they say," reflected Hitt, by way of
introduction."Yes," returned the man grimly, "there is but little more blood to
let."The other is--"

He stopped and eyed Hitt furtively.But the American manifested only a
casual interest."They were posted this morning," said the man."Amado Jesus Fanor and
Jose de Rincon.""A liberal general and an ex-priest."It is the custom to--to shoot ex-priests down
here, eh?"But this man--senor, why do you ask?""Well--it struck me as curious--that's all," returned Hitt, at a loss
for a suitable answer."You didn't happen to know these men, I
presume?""_Na_, _senor_, you seek to involve me.Who are you, that you ask such
questions of a stranger?"The man reflected the suspicious caution of
these troublous times."Why, _amigo_, it is of no concern to me," replied Hitt easily,
flicking the ashes from his cigar."I once knew a fellow by that name.Learned that he afterward went to Simiti.But
I--"

"Senor!""Are you the _Americano_, the man
who explored?""I am," said Hitt, bending closer to him."And we are well met, for
you are Don Jorge, who knew Padre Jose de Rincon in Simiti, no?"The man cast a timid glance around the room."Senor," he whispered,
"we must not say these things here!I leave you now--"

"Not yet!"He was first three years in the prison in Cartagena.But the Bish--"

"Eh?Don Wenceslas had him removed to San Fernando?""And--"

"He will be shot to-morrow, senor.""Why do you
say he is an ex-priest?""He has just been excommunicated," replied the man."Cursed, they say,
by bell, book, and candle."Of course Don Wenceslas would not dare to execute a priest in
good standing.And so he had him excommunicated, eh?""_Quien sabe?_" he muttered.Hitt sat for a while in a deep study.And yet it
was flying like the winds."You knew a little girl--in Simiti--in whom this Rincon was
interested?"She went to the great States
from which you come.And I think little was heard from her after
that."She lived with--"

"Don Rosendo Ariza.""Dead--he and his good wife, Dona Maria.""Come," he said, "we will stroll down by the walls.I would
like a look at San Fernando."Senor, you--you--"

Hitt threw him a look of caution, and shook his head.Then, motioning
him to follow, he led him out and down through the winding, tortuous
thoroughfares.On the summit of the walls were sentinels, posted at
frequent intervals; and no civilian might walk upon the great
enclosure until peace had been formally declared.Hailing a passing carriage, Hitt urged the wondering Don Jorge into
it, and bade the driver convey them to the old ruin of San Felipe, and
leave them.There they climbed the broken incline into the battered
fortress, and seated themselves in the shadow of a crumbling parapet.They were alone on the enormous, grass-grown pile.From their position
they commanded a wonderful view across the town and harbor, and far
out over the green waters of the Caribbean.The _Cossack_ lay asleep
in the quiet harbor.Don Jorge saw it, and wondered whence it came."Listen, _amigo_," began Hitt, pointing to the yacht."In that boat is
a girl, whose dearest earthly treasure is the condemned prisoner out
there in San Fernando.That girl is the little Carmen, foster-daughter
of old Rosendo.""_Hombre!_" cried Don Jorge, staring at Hitt as if he suspected his
sanity."It is true, friend, for I myself came with her in that boat.""_Caramba!_"

"And," continued Hitt, glancing again about the ruined fortress and
lowering his voice, "we have come for Jose de Rincon.""_Santa Virgen!_ Are you _loco_?""And now," he went on eagerly, "how are we to get him?"And he--_por
supuesto_, he will be in the dungeons!""No doubt," returned Hitt dryly, "if your excellent friend Wenceslas
has had anything to do with it."_Caramba_, yes; and San Fernando's are just above the water's edge.And when the waves are high the sea pours into them!""And--could we learn which window is his, do you think?""Senor, I know," replied the man.And--"

"I learned from one of the soldiers, Fernando, who once lived in
Simiti.I had thought, senor, that--that perhaps I--"

"That perhaps you might make the attempt yourself, eh?"Hitt sprang to his feet and looked out toward the
silent fortress."Don Jorge, it is dark out over the harbor at night, eh?Suddenly he stopped, and stood
looking down through a hole in the broken pavement.Then he knelt and
peered long and eagerly into it."It is one of the rooms
of the fortress," he said.I know not how it may be
reached.""But--you are a mighty husky fellow; and I am not weak.Suppose we try
lifting one of these flags.""_Na_, _senor_, as well try the tunnels!But, bidding Don Jorge follow, he sought the
fallen entrance to the old fortress, and plunged into the dark passage
that led off from it into the thick gloom.Groping his way down a
long, damp corridor, he came to a point where three narrower,
brick-lined tunnels branched off, one of them dipping into the earth
at a sharp angle.He struck a match, and then started down this,
followed by the wondering Don Jorge.A thousand bats, hideous denizens of these black tunnels, flouted
their faces and disputed their progress.Don Jorge slapped wildly at
them, and cursed low.Hitt took up a long club and struck savagely
about him.On they stumbled, until the match flickered out, and they
were left in Stygian blackness, with the imps of darkness whirring
madly about them.Hitt struck another match, and plunged ahead.At length they found the way blocked by a mass of rubbish which had
fallen from the roof.Hitt studied it for a moment, then climbed upon
it and, by the aid of the feeble light from his matches, peered into
the foul blackness beyond."Come," he said, preparing to proceed."_Na, amigo!_ Not I!""Then wait for me here," said Hitt, pushing himself through the narrow
aperture at the top of the rubbish, and fighting the horde of
terrified bats.A few minutes later he returned, covered with slime, and scratched and
bleeding."Now let's get out of this
miserable hole!"Out in the sunlight once more, Hitt sought to remove the stains from
his clothes, meanwhile bidding Don Jorge attend well to his words."Then do you come to the beach to-night to bathe, down across from the
yacht.And, listen well: you would do much for the little Carmen, no?You will swim out to the yacht at
seven to-night, with your clothes in a bundle on your head, eh?And,
Don Jorge--but we will discuss that later.Now you go back to the city
alone.And, note this, you have not seen me."Meantime, to the group of politicians, soldiers, and clergy assembled
in the long audience room of the departmental offices to debate the
terms of the peace protocol, news of the arrival of the _Cossack_ was
brought by a slow-moving messenger from the dock.At the abrupt
announcement the acting-Bishop was seen to start from his chair._Quien sabe?_ And, if so--but,
impossible!He would have advised his faithful co-laborer of his
coming.And yet, what were those strange rumors which had trickled
over the wires, and which, in his absorption in the local issues, and
in the excitement attendant upon the restoration of peace and the
settlement of the multifold claims of innumerable greedy politicians,
he had all but forgotten?A thousand suggestions flashed through his
mind, any one of which might account for the presence of the _Cossack_
in Cartagena's harbor that day.But extreme caution must be observed
until he might ascertain its errand.He therefore despatched a message
to the yacht, expressing his great surprise and pleasure, and bidding
its master meet him at a convenient hour in his study in the
Cathedral.This done, he bent anew to the work before him, yet with
his thought harried by doubt, suspicion, and torturing curiosity.Wenceslas soon received a reply to his message.The master was aboard,
but unable to go ashore.The acting-Bishop would therefore come to him
at once.Wenceslas hesitated, and his brow furrowed.He knew he was called upon
to render his reckoning to the great financier who had furnished the
sinews of war.But he must have time to consider thoroughly his own
advantage, for well he understood that he was summoned to match his
own keen wits with those of a master mind.And then there flashed through his thought the reports which had
circled the world but three short weeks before.The man of wealth had
found his daughter; and she was the girl for whom the two Americans
had outwitted him four years ago!And the girl--Simiti--and--ah,
Rincon!He would meet the financier--but
not until the morrow, at noon, for, he would allege, the unanticipated
arrival of Ames had found this day completely occupied.So he again
despatched his wondering messenger to the _Cossack_.And that
messenger was rowed out to the quiet yacht in the same boat with the
tall American, whose clothes were torn and caked with mud, and in
whose eyes there glowed a fierce determination.The harbingers of the wet season had
already arrived.At two in the morning the rain came, descending in a
torrent.In the midst of it a light skiff, rocking dangerously on the
swelling sea, rounded a corner of San Fernando and crept like a shadow
along the dull gray wall.The sentry above had taken shelter from the
driving rain.At one of the narrow, grated windows which were set just above the
water's surface the skiff hung, and a long form arose from its depths
and grasped the iron bars.A moment later the gleam of an electric
lantern flashed into the blackness within.It fell upon a rough bench,
standing in foul, slime-covered water.Upon the bench sat the huddled
form of a man.Then another dark shape rose in the skiff.Another pair of hands laid
hold on the iron bars.And behind those great, calloused hands
stretched thick arms, with the strength of an ox.An iron lever was
inserted between the bars.The heavy breathing and the low sounds of
the straining were drowned by the tropic storm.The prisoner leaped
from the bench and stood ankle-deep in the water, straining his eyes
upward.His
throbbing ears caught the splash of a knotted rope falling into the
water at his feet.Above the noise of the rain he thought he heard a
groaning, creaking sound.Those rusted, storm-eaten bars in the
blackness above must be slowly yielding to an awful pressure.He
turned and dragged the slime-covered bench to the window, and stood
upon it.Then he grasped the rope with a strength born anew of hope
and excitement, and pulled himself upward.The hands from without
seized him; and slowly, painfully, his emaciated body was crushed
through the narrow space between the bent bars.*       *       *       *       *

Cartagena awoke to experience another thrill.And then the ripple of
excitement gave place to anger.The rabble had lost one of its
victims, and that one the chief.Moreover, the presence of that
graceful yacht, sleeping so quietly out there in the sunlit harbor,
could not but be associated with that most daring deed of the
preceding night, which had given liberty to the excommunicated priest
and political malefactor, Jose de Rincon.Crowds of chattering,
gesticulating citizens gathered along the harbor shores, and loudly
voiced their disappointment and threats.But the boat lay like a thing
asleep.Not even a wisp of smoke rose from its yellow funnels.Then came the Alcalde, and the Departmental Governor, grave and
sedate, with their aids and secretaries, their books and documents,
their mandates and red-sealed processes, and were rowed out to
confront the master whom they believed to have dared to thwart the
hand of justice and remain to taunt them with his egregious presence.This should be made an international episode, whose ramifications
would wind down through years to come, and embrace long, stupid
congressional debates, apologies demanded, huge sums to salve a
wounded nation, and the making and breaking of politicians too
numerous to mention!But the giant who received them, bound to his chair, in the splendid
library of the palatial yacht, and with no attendant, save a single
valet, flared out in a towering rage at the gross insult offered him
and his great country in these black charges.He had come on a
peaceful errand; partly, too, for reasons of health.And he was at
that moment awaiting a visit from His Grace.What manner of reception
was this, that Cartagena extended to an influential representative of
the powerful States of the North!"But," the discomfited Indignation Committee gasped, "what of the tall
American who was seen to land the day before?"Why, but a poor, obsessed
archaeologist, now prowling around the ruins of San Felipe, doubtless
mumbling childishly as he <DW8>s the dust and mold of centuries!Go,
visit him, if they would be convinced!And when these had gone, chagrined and mortified--though filled
with wonder, for they had roamed the _Cossack_, and peered into
its every nook and cranny, and stopped to look a second time at the
fair-haired young boy who looked like a girl, and hovered close to
the master--came His Grace, Wenceslas.He came alone, and with a sneer
curling his imperious lips.And his calm, arrogant eyes held a
meaning that boded no good to the man who sat in his wheel chair,
alone, and could not rise to welcome him."A very pretty trick, my powerful friend," said the angered churchman
in his perfect English."And one that will cause your Government at
Washington some--"

"Enough!""I sent for you
yesterday, intending to ask you to release the man.I had terms then
which would have advantaged you greatly.You were afraid to see me
until you had evolved your plans of opposition.Only a fixed and
devilish hatred, nourished by you against a harmless priest who
possessed your secrets, doomed him to die to-day.But we will pass
that for the present.I have here my demands for the aid I have
furnished you.He held out some typewritten
sheets to Wenceslas.The churchman glanced hastily over them; then handed them back with a
smile."The terms on which
peace is concluded will scarcely admit of--"

"Very well," returned Ames quietly."_En manos muertas_, my friend," he replied.A government monopoly, you know," said His Grace easily."You see, my friend, it is a costly matter to effect the escape of
state prisoners.As things stand now, your little trick of last night
quite protects me.For, first you instruct me, long ago, to place the
weak little Jose in San Fernando; and I obey.Then you suffer a change
of heart, and slip down here to release the man, who has become a
state prisoner.That quite removes you from any claims upon us for a
share of the spoils of war.I take it, you do not wish to risk
exposure of your part in this four years' carnage?""Wenceslas," he
said, "I am not the man with whom you dealt in these matters.I have but one thing more to say, and that is that I renounce
all claims upon you and your Government, excepting one.La Libertad
mine was owned by the Rincon family.It was rediscovered by old
Rosendo, and the title transferred to his foster-daughter.Its
possession must remain with her and her associates.There is no
record, so you have informed me, to the effect that the Church
possesses this mine.""But, my friend, there shall be such a record to-day," laughed
Wenceslas."And, in your present situation, you will hardly care to
contest it."He now had the information which he had been seeking.The
title to the famous mine lay still with the Simiti company.He pressed
the call-button attached to his chair.The door opened, and Don Jorge
entered, leading the erstwhile little newsboy, Jose de Rincon, by the
hand.He knew not the man; but the boy
was a familiar figure."Your Grace, were you married to the woman by whom you had this son?"Don Jorge's steady words fell upon the churchman's ears like a
sentence of death."I ask," continued the dark-faced man, "because I learned last night
that the lad's mother was my daughter, the little Maria.""_Santa Virgen!_"

"Yes, Your Grace, a sainted virgin, despoiled by a devil!And the man
who gave me this information--would you like to know?_Bien_, it was
Padre Jose de Rincon, in whose arms she died, you lecherous dog!"Wenceslas paled, and his brow grew moist.He stared at the boy, and
then at the strong man whom he had so foully wronged."If you have concluded your talk with Senor Ames," continued Don
Jorge, "we will go ashore--you and the lad and I."Gaining the deck, Wenceslas
found a skiff awaiting them, and two strong sailors at the oars.Don
Jorge urged him on, and together they descended the ladder and entered
the boat.A few moments later they landed at the pier, and the skiff
turned back to the yacht.There were some who
remembered seeing His Grace pass through the narrow streets with a
dark-skinned, powerful man, whose hand grasped that of the young
newsboy.There were others who said that they saw the boy leave them
at the Cathedral, and the two men turn and enter.Still others said
they saw the heavy-set man come out alone.But there was only one who
discovered the body of Wenceslas, crumpled up in a hideous heap upon
the floor of his study, with a poignard driven clean through his
heart.That man was the old sexton, who fled screaming from the awful
sight late that afternoon.Again Cartagena shook with excitement, and seethed with mystery.Had
the escaped prisoner, Rincon, returned to commit this awful deed?For the dark-skinned man who had
entered the Cathedral with His Grace was seen again on the streets and
in the wine shops that afternoon, and had been marked by some mounting
the broken incline of San Felipe.Again the Governor and Alcalde and their numerous suite paid a visit
to the master on board the _Cossack_.But they learned only that His
Grace had gone ashore long before he met his fearful death.And so the
Governor returned to the city, and was driven to San Felipe.But his
only reward was the sight of the obsessed archaeologist, mud-stained
and absorbed, prying about the old ruins, and uttering little cries of
delight at new discoveries of crumbling passageways and caving rooms.And so there was nothing for the disturbed town to do but settle down
and ponder the strange case.A week later smoke was seen again pouring out of the _Cossack's_
funnels.That same day the Governor and Alcalde and their suites were
bidden to a farewell banquet on board the luxurious yacht.Far into
the night they sat over their rare wines and rich food, drinking deep
healths to the _entente cordial_ which existed between the little
republic of the South and the great one of the North.And while they
drank and sang and listened enraptured to the wonderful pipe-organ, a
little boat put out from the dark, tangled shrubbery along the shore.And when it rubbed against the yacht, a muffled figure mounted the
ladder which hung in the shadows, and hastened through the rear
hatchway and down into the depths of the boat.Then, long after
midnight, the last farewell being said by the dizzy officials, and the
echoes of _Adios_, _adios_, _amigos_!lingering among its tall spars,
the _Cossack_ slipped noiselessly out of the Boca Chica, and set its
course for New York.A few hours later, while the boat sped swiftly through the phosphorescent
waves, the escaped prisoner, Jose de Rincon, who had lain for a week
hidden in the bowels of old fort San Felipe, stood alone in the wonderful
smoking room of the _Cossack_, and looked up at the sweet face pictured
in the stained-glass window above.And then he turned quickly, for the
door opened and a girl entered.A rush, a cry of joy, and his arms
closed about the fair vision that had sat by his side constantly during
the four long years of his imprisonment."I knew you would, for he was with you always!""But--oh, you beautiful, beautiful girl!"Then in a little while she gently released herself and went to the
door through which she had entered.She paused for a moment to smile
back at the enraptured man, then turned and flung the door wide.The man uttered a loud
exclamation and started toward her.He stopped short and stared down at the boy.Then he looked
wonderingly at Carmen."Yes," she said, stooping and lifting the boy up before Jose, "it is
Anita's babe--_and he sees_!"The man clasped the child in his arms and buried his face in its
hair.Verily, upon them that sat in darkness had the Light shined.CHAPTER 21


Another summer had come and gone.Through the trees in Central Park
the afternoon sunlight, sifted and softened by the tinted autumn
leaves, spread over the brown turf like a gossamer web.And it fell
like a gentle benediction upon the massive figure of a man, walking
unsteadily beneath the trees, holding the hand of a young girl whose
beauty made every passer turn and look again."Now, father," laughed the girl, "once more!Why, you step off
like a major!"They were familiar figures, out there in the park, for almost daily
during the past few weeks they might have been seen, as the girl
laughingly said, "practicing their steps."And daily the man's control
became firmer; daily that limp left arm and leg seemed increasingly to
manifest life.On a bench near by sat a dark-featured woman.About her played her
boy, filling the air with his merry shouts and his imperfect English."There, father, comes Jose after us," announced the girl, looking off
with love-lit eyes at an approaching automobile.Now, mind, you are going to get into the car without any help!"The man laughed, and declared vehemently that if he could not get in
alone he would walk home.The profound depth of those changes which had come into the rich
man's life, he himself might not fathom.But those who toiled
daily with him over his great ledgers and files knew that the
transformation went far.There were flashes at times of his former
vigor and spirit of domination, but there were also periods of
grief that were heart-rending to behold, as when, poring over his
records for the name of one whom in years past he had ruthlessly
wrecked, he would find that the victim had gone in poverty beyond
his power to reimburse him.And again, when his thought dwelt on
Avon, and the carnal madness which had filled those new graves there,
he would sink moaning into his chair and bury his drawn face in his
hands and sob.And yet he strove madly, feverishly, to restore again to those from
whom he had taken.The Simiti company was revived, through his labors,
and the great La Libertad restored to its reanimated stockholders.Work of development had begun on the property, and Harris was again in
Colombia in charge of operations.The Express was booming, and the
rich man had consecrated himself to the carrying out of its clean
policies.The mills at Avon were running day and night; and in a new
location, far from the old-time "lungers' alley," long rows of little
cottages were going up for their employes.The lawyer Collins had been
removed, and Lewis Waite was to take his place within a week.Father
Danny, now recovered, rejoiced in resources such as he had never dared
hope to command.And so the rich man toiled--ah, God!if he had only known before that
in the happiness of others lay his own.If only he could have known
that but a moiety of his vast, unused income would have let floods of
sunshine into the lives of those dwarfed, stunted children who toiled
for him, and never played!Oh, if when he closed his mills in the dull
months he had but sent them and their tired mothers to the country
fields, how they would have risen up and called him blessed!If he
could have but known that he was his brother's keeper, and in a sense
that the world as yet knows not!For he is indeed wise who loves his
fellow-men; and he is a fool who hates them!The great Fifth Avenue mansion was dark, except where hung a cluster
of glowing bulbs over the rich mahogany table in the library.There
about that table sat the little group of searchers after God, with
their number augmented now in ways of which they could not have
dreamed.And Hitt, great-souled friend of the world, was speaking
again as had been his wont in the days now gone.Ah, yes, there is a
cure-all; there is a final answer to every ethical question, every
social, industrial, economic problem, the problems of liquor, poverty,
disease, war.And the remedy is so universal that it dissolves even
the tangles of tariff and theology.Ah, my friends, the
girl who came among us to'show the world what love will do' has
taught us by her own rich life--it is love.But not the sex-mesmerism,
the covetousness, the self-love, which mask behind that heavenly name.And to know Him is to receive that marvelous
Christ-principle which unlocks for mankind the door of harmony."No, the world's troubles are not the fault of one man, nor of many,
but of all who seek happiness in things material, and forget that the
real man is the likeness of spirit, and that joy is spiritual.The
trusts, and the men of wealth, are not all malefactors; the churches
are not wholly filled with evil men.But all, yes all, have'missed
the mark' through the belief that matter and evil are real, and must
grope amid sickness, poverty, crime, and death, until they are willing
to turn from such false beliefs, and from self, and seek their own in
the reflection of Him, who is Love, to their fellow-men.It is only as
men join to search for and apply the Christ-principle that they truly
unite to solve the world's sore problems and reveal the waiting
kingdom of harmony, which is always just at hand."In that day all shall know that cause and effect are mental.The man
who hears the tempter, the carnal mind's suggestion to enrich himself
materially at the cost of his brother, will know that it is but the
voice of mesmerism, that'man-killer from the beginning', which bids
him sever himself from his God, who alone is infinite abundance.The
society woman who flits like a gorgeous butterfly about the courts of
fashion, her precious days wasted in motoring, her nights at cards,
and whose vitality goes into dress, and into the watery schemes for
'who shall be greatest' in the dismal realm of the human mind, must
learn, willingly or through suffering, that her activities are but
mesmeric shams that counterfeit the divine activity which manifests in
joy and fullness for all.What is it but the Christ-knowledge, the knowledge of
good, and its correlated knowledge, that evil is only the mesmeric
lie which has engulfed the world?But, oh, the depths of that divine
knowledge!The knowledge which heals the sick, gives sight to the
blind, and opens the prisons to them that are captive!We who are
gathered here to-night, feeling in our midst that great, unseen
Presence which makes for righteousness, know now that 'in my flesh
shall I see God,' for we have indeed already seen and known Him."With them sat the man who, swept by the storms of error and the carnal
winds of destruction, had solved his problem, even as the girl by his
side told him he should, and had been found, when his foul prison
opened, sitting "clothed and in his right mind" at the feet of the
Christ.Jesus "saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit--God--like a
dove descending upon him--immediately the Spirit--carnal belief,
error, the lie--driveth him into the wilderness."And there he was
made to prove God.So Jose de Rincon, when the light had come, years
gone, in desolate Simiti, had been bidden to know the one God, and
none else.But he wavered when the floods of evil rolled over him; he
had looked longingly back; he had clung too tightly to the human
concept that walked with him like a shining light in those dark days.And so she had been taken from him, and he had been hurled into the
wilderness--alone with Him whom he must learn to know if he would see
Life.Then self-consciousness went out, in those four years of his
captivity, and he passed from thence into consciousness of God.Then his great world-knowledge he saw to have been wholly untrue.His
store of truth he saw to have been but relative at best.His knowledge
had rested, he then knew, upon viewpoints which had been utterly
false.And so, like Paul, he died that he might live.He crucified
Self, that he might resurrect the image of God."The world," resumed Hitt, "still worships false gods, though it
reaches out for Truth.Only a
state of consciousness, a consciousness of good, of joy and harmony.And
we are seeking to rid ourselves of the consciousness of evil, with
its sin, its disease and death.But, knowing now that consciousness
is mental activity, the activity of thought, can we not see that
harmony and immortality are within our grasp?Salvation is not from evil realities, but from the
false sense of evil, even as Jesus taught and proved.The only salvation
possible to mankind is in learning to think as Jesus did--not yielding
our mentalities daily to a hodge-podge of mixed thoughts of good and
evil, and then running to doctors and preachers when such yielding
brings its inevitable result in sickness and death.Jesus insisted that
the kingdom of heaven was within men, a tremendous potentiality
within each one of us.By removing hampering
false belief, by removing the limitations of superstition and human
opinion which hold its portals closed.True progress is the release of
mankind from materialism, with its enslaving drudgery, its woes, and
its inevitable death.Mankind's chief difficulty is ignorance of what
God is.He proved Him to be the
creator of the spiritual universe, but not the originator of the lie
of materiality.He showed matter to be but the manifestation of the
false belief that creation is material.He showed it to be but a
sense-impression, without life, without stability, without existence,
except the pseudo-existence which it has in the false thought of
which the human or carnal consciousness is formed.But the lack of
understanding of the real nature of matter, and the persistent belief in
the stability of its so-called laws, has resulted in centuries of
attempts to discredit the Bible records of his spiritual demonstrations
of God's omnipotence and immanence, and so has prevented the human mind
from accepting the proofs which it so eagerly sought.And now, after
nineteen centuries of so-called Christian teaching, the human mind
remains still deeply embedded in matter, and subject to the
consentaneous human beliefs which it calls material laws.Jesus
showed that it was the communal mortal mind, with its false beliefs
in matter, sin, disease, and death, that constituted 'the flesh'; he
showed that mortals are begotten of such false beliefs; he showed
that the material universe is but manifested human belief.And we
know from our own reasoning that we see not things, but our _thoughts_
of things; that we deal not with matter, but with material mental
concepts only.We know that the preachers have woefully missed the
mark, and that the medicines of the doctors have destroyed more lives
than wars and famine, and yet will we not learn of the Master?To reach
God through material thinking is utterly impossible, for He is spirit,
and He can be cognized only by a spiritual consciousness.Yet such a
consciousness is ours, if we will but have it."Ah, friends, God said: Let US make man in OUR image and likeness--let
Life, Love, Spirit make its spiritual reflection.But where is that
man to-day?Buried deep beneath the dogma and the crystallized human
beliefs of mortals--buried beneath 'the lie' which mankind accept
about truth.Nothing but _scientific_ religion will meet humanity's
dire needs and reveal that man.And scientific religion admits of
actual, practical proof.Christianity is as scientific as mathematics,
and quite as capable of demonstration.Its proofs lie in doing the
works of the Master.He is a Christian who does these works; he who
does not is none.Christianity is not a failure, but organized
ecclesiasticism, which always collapses before a world crisis, has
failed utterly.The hideous chicane of imperial government and
imperial religion against mankind has resulted in a Christian veneer,
which cracks at the first test and reveals the unchanged human brute
beneath.The nations which writhe in deadly embrace to-day have never
sought to prove God.They but emphasize the awful fact that the human
mind has no grasp upon the Principle which is God, and at a time of
crisis reverts almost instantly to the primitive, despite so-called
culture and civilization.Yes, religion as a perpetuation of ancient
human conceptions, of materialistic traditions and opinions of 'the
Fathers,' is a flat failure.By it the people of great nations have
been molded into servile submission to church and ruler--have been
persuaded that wretchedness and poverty are eternal--that heaven is a
realm beyond the grave, to which admission is a function of outward
oblation--and that surcease from ills here, or in the life to come, is
a gift of the Church.Can we wonder that commercialism is mistaken by
nations for progress?That king and emperor still call upon God to
bless their barbaric attempts at conquest?And that human existence
remains, what it has always been, a ghastly mockery of Life?"Healing the sick by applied Christianity is not the attempt to alter
a mental concept; it is the bringing out of harmony where before was
discord.He who indulges evil only
proves his belief in its reality and power.Christian healing is not
'mental suggestion,' wherein all thought is material.When evil
thinking is overcome, then the discords which result from it will
disappear from consciousness.Behind all
that the physical senses seem to see, know, and feel, is the spiritual
fact, perfect and eternal.Jesus healed the sick by establishing this
fact in the human consciousness.They must cease from the dust-man,
whose breath is in his nostrils; they must cease from preaching evil
as an awful reality, permitted by God, or existing despite Him; they
must know it as Jesus bade all men know it, as the lie about Truth.Then, by holding the divine ideal before the human mind, they will
cause that mentality gradually to relinquish its false beliefs and
copy the real.And thus, step by step, changing from better to better
beliefs, at length the human mind will have completely substituted
reality for unreality, and will be no more, even in thought.The 'old
man' will have given place to the 'new.'Yes, for the present we reckon with material
symbols; we have not yet fully learned their unreality.But at length,
if we are faithful, we shall lay them aside, and know only Truth and
its pure manifestations."Ah, my friends, how simple is Christianity!It is summed up in the
Sermon on the Mount.He who thinks
right shall know things as they are.He who thinks wrong shall seem to
know them as they are not, and shall pass his days in sore travail,
even in wars, famine, and utter misery.Then why not take up the
demonstration of Christianity in the spirit of joy and freedom from
prejudice with which we pursue our earthly studies, and as gladly,
thankfully seek to prove it?For it, of all things, is worth while.It
alone is the true business of men.For if what we have developed in
our many talks regarding God, man, and the mental nature of the
universe and all things is true, then are the things with which men
now occupy themselves worth while?But are the
things which we have developed true?Yes, for they can be and have
been demonstrated.Carmen has
shown us the way.No, she is not unnatural; she is only divinely
natural.She has shown us what we all may become, if we but will.She
has shown us what we shall be able to do when we are completely lost
in accord with God, and recognize no other life, substance, nor law
than His.But--

"'I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create
evil,' cried the prophet._Truth always has its suppositional
opposite!_ Choose ye then whom ye will serve.Only that which is demonstrably true, not after the change which we
call death, but here this side of the grave, can stand.The only test
of a Christian is in the'signs following.'Without them his faith is
but sterile human belief, and his god but the distorted human concept
whom kings beseech to bless their slaughter."'Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein
  is he to be accounted of?"'His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very
  day his thoughts perish."'That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
  of the Spirit is spirit."'Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though
  we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we
  him no more.'"The fire crackled briskly on the great hearth.Carmen rose and turned
off the light above them.All drew their chairs about the cheery
blaze.Silence, sacred, holy, lay upon them.The rich man, now possessing
treasures beyond his wildest dreams, sat holding his daughter's hand.Sidney had just entered; and Haynerd had
sent word that he would join them soon.Then the silence was broken by the rich man.His voice was unsteady
and low."My friends, sorrow and joy fill my heart to-night.To the first I am
resigned; it is my due; and yet, were it greater, I know not how I
could live.But the joy--who can understand it until he has passed
through death into life!This little girl's mother knew not, nor did
I, that she was royal born.Sometimes I wonder now if it is really so.And yet the evidence is such that I can scarcely doubt.We met in the
sun-kissed hills of Granada; and we loved.Her old nurse was
Argus-eyed; and our meetings were such as only lovers can effect.I
was young, wild, and my blood coursed like a torrent through my veins!But I loved her, yes, base though I was, I loved her.And in these
years since I left her in that little house in Bogota, I have suffered
the agonies of the lost when her memory and my own iniquity fell upon
me and smote me sore--

"We were married in Spain, and the marriage was performed by Padre
Rafael de Rincon.""I was rich; I was roaming the
world, extending my vast business interests; and I took her to
Colombia, where I labored with the politicians in Bogota to grant me
timber and cattle concessions.We had a cottage on the outskirts of
the city, where we were happy.With us lived her faithful old nurse,
whom she would not leave in Spain--

"Then, one day, came a cable message that my father had died.I knew I must return at once to New York.But--I would
not take a wife back with me!And I kissed
her tear-stained face, and bade her wait, for I would return and make
her happy.And then--

"Months later I wrote to her, and, receiving no reply, I caused
inquiry to be made.But she had gone--whither, no one knew.The old
nurse, too, had disappeared.I never learned that a woman had been
left at Badillo to die.She was
timid, and went out seldom.And then--then I thought that a marriage
here would strengthen my position, for I was powerful and proud."Oh, the years that her sad face haunted me!I know
not why, but when the _Cossack_ was built I had her portrait in glass
set in the smoking room.And night after night I have sat before it
and cursed myself, and implored her to forgive!"I was Guillermo to her, and she Dolores to me.Had Carmen ever worn it in my presence I
must have recognized it at once."But," said Ames, choking down his sorrow, "that man is dead.He, like
Goliath, fought Truth, and the Truth fell upon him, crushing him to
powder.The man who remains with you now lives only in this little
girl.And she has brought me my own son, Sidney, and another, Jose.All that I have is theirs, and they will give it to the world.I would
that she could have brought me that noble black man, Rosendo, who laid
down his beautiful life when he saw that his work was done.I learn
from my inquiries that he and Dona Maria lived with Don Nicolas far up
the Boque river during the troublous times when Simiti was burned and
devastated.And that, when the troops had gone, they returned to their
desolated home, and died, within a month of each other.And can my care of their daughter Ana and her little son
ever cancel the debt?"Father, does Jose know that it was Kathleen
whom he rescued from the Tiber in Rome, years ago, and who caused him
to lose his notebook?""No, Sidney,
we had not told him.And how inextricably
bound together we all are!And, Jose, I have not told you that the
woman who lived and died alone in the limestone caves near Honda, and
whose story you had from Don Jorge in Simiti, was doubtless the
faithful old nurse of Dolores.Padre Rafael de Rincon maintained her there."Haynerd entered the room at that moment, and with him came Miss Wall."Now," said Hitt softly, "the circle is complete.Carmen, may I--"

The girl rose at once and went into the music room.Those who remained
sat in awed, expectant silence.Another presence stole softly in, but
they saw him not.Soon through the great rooms and marble halls
drifted the low, weird melody which the girl had sung, long before, in
the dreary Elwin school.In the flickering light of the fire strange shapes took form; and the
shadows that danced on the walls silhouetted scenes from the dimming
past.From out their weird imagery rose a single form.Slowly it rose before them from out the shadows.It was black of face, but its wondrous heart which had cradled the
nameless babe of Badillo glistened like drifting snow.The last sweet notes of the plaintive Indian lament fluttered from the
girl's lips, echoed among the marble pillars, and died away down the
distant corridors.She returned and bent over her father with a tender
caress.Then the great black man in the shadows extended his arms for a moment
above them, and faded from their sight.There was the sound of low
weeping in the room.For

  "these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
  washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
  Lamb."GLOSSARY

asserted that the family of the tyrant ought not to be better treated than
any sans-culotte family; and he had caused a resolution to be passed by
which the sort of luxury in which the prisoners in the Temple were
maintained was to be suppressed.They were no longer to be allowed either
poultry or pastry; they were reduced to one sort of aliment for breakfast,
and to soup or broth and a single dish for dinner, to two dishes for
supper, and half a bottle of wine apiece.Tallow candles were to be
furnished instead of wag, pewter instead of silver plate, and delft ware
instead of porcelain.The wood and water carriers alone were permitted to
enter their room, and that only accompanied by two commissioners.Their
food was to be introduced to them by means of a turning box.The numerous
establishment was reduced to a cook and an assistant, two men-servants,
and a woman-servant to attend to the linen.As soon as this resolution was passed, Hebert had repaired to the Temple
and inhumanly taken away from the unfortunate prisoners even the most
trifling articles to which they attached a high value.Eighty Louis which
Madame Elisabeth had in reserve, and which she had received from Madame de
Lamballe, were also taken away.No one is more dangerous, more cruel,
than the man without acquirements, without education, clothed with a
recent authority.If, above all, he possess a base nature, if, like
Hebert, who was check-taker at the door of a theatre, and embezzled money
out of the receipts, he be destitute of natural morality, and if he leap
all at once from the mud of his condition into power, he is as mean as he
is atrocious.Such was Hebert in his conduct at the Temple.He did not
confine himself to the annoyances which we have mentioned.He and some
others conceived the idea of separating the young Prince from his aunt and
sister.A shoemaker named Simon and his wife were the instructors to whom
it was deemed right to consign him for the purpose of giving him a
sans-cullotte education.Simon and his wife were shut up in the Temple,
and, becoming prisoners with the unfortunate child, were directed to bring
him up in their own way.Their food was better than that of the
Princesses, and they shared the table of the municipal commissioners who
were on duty.Simon was permitted to go down, accompanied by two
commissioners, to the court of the Temple, for the purpose of giving the
Dauphin a little exercise.Hebert conceived the infamous idea of wringing from this boy revelations
to criminate his unhappy mother.Whether this wretch imputed to the child
false revelations, or abused his, tender age and his condition to extort
from him what admissions soever he pleased, he obtained a revolting
deposition; and as the youth of the Prince did not admit of his being
brought before the tribunal, Hebert appeared and detailed the infamous
particulars which he had himself either dictated or invented.It was on the 14th of October that Marie Antoinette appeared before her
judges.Dragged before the sanguinary tribunal by inexorable
revolutionary vengeance, she appeared there without any chance of
acquittal, for it was not to obtain her acquittal that the Jacobins had
brought her before it.It was necessary, however, to make some charges.Fouquier therefore collected the rumours current among the populace ever
since the arrival of the Princess in France, and, in the act of
accusation, he charged her with having plundered the exchequer, first for
her pleasures, and afterwards in order to transmit money to her brother,
the Emperor.He insisted on the scenes of the 5th and 6th of October, and
on the dinners of the Life Guards, alleging that she had at that period
framed a plot, which obliged the people to go to Versailles to frustrate
it.He afterwards accused her of having governed her husband, interfered
in the choice of ministers, conducted the intrigues with the deputies
gained by the Court, prepared the journey to Varennes, provoked the war,
and transmitted to the enemy's generals all our plans of campaign.He
further accused her of having prepared a new conspiracy on the 10th of
August, of having on that day caused the people to be fired upon, having
induced her husband to defend himself by taxing him with cowardice;
lastly, of having never ceased to plot and correspond with foreigners
since her captivity in the Temple, and of having there treated her young
son as King.We here observe how, on the terrible day of long-deferred
vengeance, when subjects at length break forth and strike such of their
princes as have not deserved the blow, everything is distorted and
converted into crime.We see how the profusion and fondness for pleasure,
so natural to a young princess, how her attachment to her native country,
her influence over her husband, her regrets, always more indiscreet in a
woman than a man, nay, even her bolder courage, appeared to their inflamed
or malignant imaginations.Lecointre, deputy of Versailles,
who had seen what had passed on the 5th and 6th of October, Hebert, who
had frequently visited the Temple, various clerks in the ministerial
offices, and several domestic servants of the old Court were summoned..
Admiral d'Estaing, formerly commandant of the guard of Versailles; Manuel,
the ex-procureur of the Commune; Latour-du-Pin, minister of war in 1789;
the venerable Bailly, who, it was said, had been, with La Fayette, an
accomplice in the journey to Varennes; lastly, Valaze one of the
Girondists destined to the scaffold, were taken from their prisons and
compelled to give evidence.Some had seen the Queen in high spirits
when the Life Guards testified their attachment; others had seen her vexed
and dejected while being conducted to Paris, or brought back from
Varennes; these had been present at splendid festivities which must have
cost enormous sums; those had heard it said in the ministerial offices
that the Queen was adverse to the sanction of the decrees.An ancient
waiting-woman of the Queen had heard the Duc de Coigny say, in 1788, that
the Emperor had already received two hundred millions from France to make
war upon the Turks.The cynical Hebert, being brought before the unfortunate Queen, dared at
length to prefer the charges wrung from the young Prince.He said that
Charles Capet had given Simon an account of the journey to Varennes, and
mentioned La Fayette and Bailly as having cooperated in it.He then added
that this boy was addicted to odious and very premature vices for his age;
that he had been surprised by Simon, who, on questioning him, learned that
he derived from his mother the vices in which he indulged.Hebert said
that it was no doubt the intention of Marie Antoinette, by weakening thus,
early the physical constitution of her son, to secure to herself the means
of ruling him in case he should ever ascend the throne.The rumours which
had been whispered for twenty years by a malicious Court had given the
people a most unfavourable opinion of the morals of the Queen.That
audience, however, though wholly Jacobin, was disgusted at the accusations
of Hebert.[Can there be a more infernal invention than that made against the.Queen
by Hdbert,--namely, that she had had an improper intimacy with her own
son?He made use of this sublime idea of which he boasted in order to
prejudice the women against the Queen, and to prevent her execution from
exciting pity.It had, however, no other effect than that of disgusting
all parties.--PRUDHOMME.][Hebert did not long survive her in whose sufferings he had taken such an
infamous part.He was executed on 26th March, 1794.]Urged a new to explain herself, she
said, with extraordinary emotion, "I thought that human nature would
excuse me from answering such an imputation, but I appeal from it to the
heart of every mother here present."This noble and simple reply affected
all who heard it.In the depositions of the witnesses, however, all was not so bitter for
Marie Antoinette.The brave D'Estaing, whose enemy she had been, would
not say anything to inculpate her, and spoke only of the courage which she
had shown on the 5th and 6th of October, and of the noble resolution which
she had expressed, to die beside her husband rather than fly.Manuel, in
spite of his enmity to the Court during the time of the Legislative
Assembly, declared that he could not say anything against the accused.When the venerable Bailly was brought forward, who formerly so often
predicted to the Court the calamities which its imprudence must produce,
he appeared painfully affected; and when he was asked if he knew the wife
of Capet, "Yes," said he, bowing respectfully, "I have known Madame."He
declared that he knew nothing, and maintained that the declarations
extorted from the young Prince relative to the journey to Varennes were
false.In recompense for his deposition he was assailed with outrageous
reproaches, from which he might judge what fate would soon be awarded to
himself.In all the evidence there appeared but two serious facts, attested by
Latour-du-Pin and Valaze, who deposed to them because they could not help
it.Latour-du-Pin declared that Marie Antoinette had applied to him for
an accurate statement of the armies while he was minister of war.Valaze,
always cold, but respectful towards misfortune, would not say anything to
criminate the accused; yet he could not help declaring that, as a member
of the commission of twenty-four, being charged with his colleagues to
examine the papers found at the house of Septeuil, treasurer of the civil
list, he had seen bonds for various sums signed Antoinette, which was very
natural; but he added that he had also seen a letter in which the minister
requested the King to transmit to the Queen the copy of the plan of
campaign which he had in his hands.The most unfavourable construction
was immediately put upon these two facts, the application for a statement
of the armies, and the communication of the plan of campaign; and it was
concluded that they could not be wanted for any other purpose than to be
sent to the enemy, for it was not supposed that a young princess should
turn her attention, merely for her own satisfaction, to matters of
administration and military, plans.After these depositions, several
others were received respecting the expenses of the Court, the influence
of the Queen in public affairs, the scene of the 10th of August, and what
had passed in the Temple; and the most vague rumours and most trivial
circumstances were eagerly caught at as proofs.Marie Antoinette frequently repeated, with presence of mind and firmness,
that there was no precise fact against her;

[At first the Queen, consulting only her own sense of dignity, had
resolved on her trial to make no other reply to the questions of her
judges than "Assassinate me as you have already assassinated my husband!"Afterwards, however, she determined to follow the example of the King,
exert herself in her defence, and leave her judges without any excuse or
pretest for putting her to death.--WEBER'S "Memoirs of Marie Antoinette."]that, besides, though the wife of Louis XVI., she was not answerable for
any of the acts of his reign.Fouquier nevertheless declared her to be
sufficiently convicted; Chaveau-Lagarde made unavailing efforts to defend
her; and the unfortunate Queen was condemned to suffer the same fate as
her husband.Conveyed back to the Conciergerie, she there passed in tolerable composure
the night preceding her execution, and, on the morning of the following
day, the 16th of October,

[The Queen, after having written and prayed, slept soundly for some hours.On her waking, Bault's daughter dressed her and adjusted her hair with
more neatness than on other days.Marie Antoinette wore a white gown, a
white handkerchief covered her shoulders, a white cap her hair; a black
ribbon bound this cap round her temples....  The cries, the looks, the
laughter, the jests of the people overwhelmed her with humiliation; her
colour, changing continually from purple to paleness, betrayed her
agitation....  On reaching the scaffold she inadvertently trod on the
executioner's foot."Pardon me," she said, courteously.She knelt for an
instant and uttered a half-audible prayer; then rising and glancing
towards the towers of the Temple, "Adieu, once again, my children," she
said; "I go to rejoin your father."--LAMARTINE.]she was conducted, amidst a great concourse of the populace, to the fatal
spot where, ten months before, Louis XVI.She listened
with calmness to the exhortations of the ecclesiastic who accompanied her,
and cast an indifferent look at the people who had so often applauded her
beauty and her grace, and who now as warmly applauded her execution.On
reaching the foot of the scaffold she perceived the Tuileries, and
appeared to be moved; but she hastened to ascend the fatal ladder, and
gave herself up with courage to the executioner.[Sorrow had blanched the Queen's once beautiful hair; but her features and
air still commanded the admiration of all who beheld her; her cheeks, pale
and emaciated, were occasionally tinged with a vivid colour at the mention
of those she had lost.When led out to execution, she was dressed in
white; she had cut off her hair with her own hands.Placed in a tumbrel,
with her arms tied behind her, she was taken by a circuitous route to the
Place de la Revolution, and she ascended the scaffold with a firm and
dignified step, as if she had been about to take her place on a throne by
the side of her husband.-LACRETELLE.]The infamous wretch exhibited her head to the people, as he was accustomed
to do when he had sacrificed an illustrious victim.The Last Separation.--Execution of Madame Elisabeth.The two Princesses left in the Temple were now almost inconsolable; they
spent days and nights in tears, whose only alleviation was that they were
shed together."The company of my aunt, whom I loved so tenderly," said
Madame Royale, "was a great comfort to me.all that I loved
was perishing around me, and I was soon to lose her also.In
the beginning of September I had an illness caused solely by my anxiety
about my mother; I never heard a drum beat that I did not expect another
3d of September."--[when the head of the Princesse de Lamballe was carried
to the Temple.]In the course of the month the rigour of their captivity was much
increased.The Commune ordered that they should only have one room; that
Tison (who had done the heaviest of the household work for them, and since
the kindness they showed to his insane wife had occasionally given them
tidings of the Dauphin) should be imprisoned in the turret; that they
should be supplied with only the barest necessaries; and that no one
should enter their room save to carry water and firewood.Their quantity
of firing was reduced, and they were not allowed candles.They were also
forbidden to go on the leads, and their large sheets were taken away,
"lest--notwithstanding the gratings!--they should escape from the
windows."On 8th October, 1793, Madame Royale was ordered to go downstairs, that she
might be interrogated by some municipal officers."My aunt, who was
greatly affected, would have followed, but they stopped her.She asked
whether I should be permitted to come up again; Chaumette assured her that
I should.'You may trust,' said he, 'the word of an honest republican.I soon found myself in my brother's room, whom I
embraced tenderly; but we were torn asunder, and I was obliged to go into
another room.--[This was the last time the brother and sister met].Chaumette then questioned me about a thousand shocking things of which
they accused my mother and aunt; I was so indignant at hearing such
horrors that, terrified as I was, I could not help exclaiming that they
were infamous falsehoods."But in spite of my tears they still pressed their questions.There were
some things which I did not comprehend, but of which I understood enough
to make me weep with indignation and horror.They then asked me
about Varennes, and other things.I answered as well as I could without
implicating anybody.I had always heard my parents say that it were
better to die than to implicate anybody."When the examination was over
the Princess begged to be allowed to join her mother, but Chaumette said
he could not obtain permission for her to do so.She was then cautioned
to say nothing about her examination to her aunt, who was next to appear
before them.Madame Elisabeth, her niece declares, "replied with still
more contempt to their shocking questions."The only intimation of the Queen's fate which her daughter and her
sister-in-law were allowed to receive was through hearing her sentence
cried by the newsman.But "we could not persuade ourselves that she was
dead," writes Madame Royale."A hope, so natural to the unfortunate,
persuaded us that she must have been saved.For eighteen months I
remained in this cruel suspense.We learnt also by the cries of the
newsman the death of the Duc d'Orleans.[The Duc d'Orleans, the early and interested propagator of the Revolution,
was its next victim.Billaud Varennes said in the Convention: "The time
has come when all the conspirators should be known and struck.I demand
that we no longer pass over in silence a man whom we seem to have
forgotten, despite the numerous facts against him.I demand that
D'ORLEANS be sent to the Revolutionary Tribunal."The Convention, once
his hireling adulators, unanimously supported the proposal.In vain he
alleged his having been accessory to the disorders of 5th October, his
support of the revolt on 10th August, 1792, his vote against the King on
17th January, 1793.He then asked only
for a delay of twenty-four hours, and had a repast carefully prepared, on
which he feasted with avidity.When led out for execution he gazed with a
smile on the Palais Royal, the scene of his former orgies.He was detained
for a quarter of an hour before that palace by the order of Robespierre,
who had asked his daughter's hand, and promised in return to excite a
tumult in which the Duke's life should be saved.Depraved though he was,
he would not consent to such a sacrifice, and he met his fate with stoical
fortitude.--ALLISON, vol.It was the only piece of news that reached us during the whole winter."The severity with which the prisoners were treated was carried into every
detail of their life.The officers who guarded them took away their
chessmen and cards because some of them were named kings and queens, and
all the books with coats of arms on them; they refused to get ointment for
a gathering on Madame Elisabeth's arm; they, would not allow her to make a
herb-tea which she thought would strengthen her niece; they declined to
supply fish or eggs on fast-days or during Lent, bringing only coarse fat
meat, and brutally replying to all remonstances, "None but fools believe
in that stuff nowadays."Madame Elisabeth never made the officials
another request, but reserved some of the bread and cafe-au-lait from her
breakfast for her second meal.The time during which she could be thus
tormented was growing short.On 9th May, 1794, as the Princesses were going to bed, the outside bolts
of the door were unfastened and a loud knocking was heard."When my aunt
was dressed," says Madame Royale, "she opened the door, and they said to
her, 'Citoyenne, come down.'--'We shall take care of her
afterwards.'She embraced me, and to calm my agitation promised to return.'No, citoyenne,' said the men, 'bring your bonnet; you shall not return.'They overwhelmed her with abuse, but she bore it patiently, embracing me,
and exhorting me to trust in Heaven, and never to forget the last commands
of my father and mother."Madame Elisabeth was then taken to the Conciergerie, where she was
interrogated by the vice-president at midnight, and then allowed to take
some hours rest on the bed on which Marie Antoinette had slept for the
last time.In the morning she was brought before the tribunal, with
twenty-four other prisoners, of varying ages and both sexes, some of whom
had once been frequently seen at Court."Of what has Elisabeth to complain?"Fouquier-Tinville satirically asked."At the foot of the guillotine, surrounded by faithful nobility, she may
imagine herself again at Versailles.""You call my brother a tyrant," the Princess replied to her accuser; "if
he had been what you say, you would not be where you are, nor I before
you!"She was sentenced to death, and showed neither surprise nor grief."I am
ready to die," she said, "happy in the prospect of rejoining in a better
world those whom I loved on earth."On being taken to the room where those condemned to suffer at the same
time as herself were assembled, she spoke to them with so much piety and
resignation that they were encouraged by her example to show calmness and
courage like her own.The women, on leaving the cart, begged to embrace
her, and she said some words of comfort to each in turn as they mounted
the scaffold, which she was not allowed to ascend till all her companions
had been executed before her eyes.[Madame Elisabeth was one of those rare personages only seen at distant
intervals during the course of ages; she set an example of steadfast piety
in the palace of kings, she lived amid her family the favourite of all and
the admiration of the world....  When I went to Versailles Madame
Elisabeth was twenty-two years of age.Her plump figure and pretty pink
colour must have attracted notice, and her air of calmness and contentment
even more than her beauty.She was fond of billiards, and her elegance and
courage in riding were remarkable.But she never allowed these amusements
to interfere with her religious observances.At that time her wish to
take the veil at St.Cyr was much talked of, but the King was too fond of
his sister to endure the separation.There were also rumours of a
marriage between Madame Elisabeth and the Emperor Joseph.The Queen was
sincerely attached to her brother, and loved her sister-in-law most
tenderly; she ardently desired this marriage as a means of raising the
Princess to one of the first thrones in Europe, and as a possible means of
turning the Emperor from his innovations.She had been very carefully
educated, had talent in music and painting, spoke Italian and a little
Latin, and understood mathematics....  Her last moments were worthy of her
courage and virtue.--D'HEZECQUES's "Recollections," pp."It is impossible to imagine my distress at finding myself separated from
my aunt," says Madame Royale."Since I had been able to appreciate her
merits, I saw in her nothing but religion, gentleness, meekness, modesty,
and a devoted attachment to her family; she sacrificed her life for them,
since nothing could persuade her to leave the King and Queen.I never can
be sufficiently grateful to her for her goodness to me, which ended only
with her life.She looked on me as her child, and I honoured and loved
her as a second mother.I was thought to be very like her in countenance,
and I feel conscious that I have something of her character.Would to God
I might imitate her virtues, and hope that I may hereafter deserve to meet
her, as well as my dear parents, in the bosom of our Creator, where I
cannot doubt that they enjoy the reward of their virtuous lives and
meritorious deaths."Madame Royale vainly begged to be allowed to rejoin her mother or her
aunt, or at least to know their fate.The municipal officers would tell
her nothing, and rudely refused her request to have a woman placed with
her."I asked nothing but what seemed indispensable, though it was often
harshly refused," she says."But I at least could keep myself clean.I
had soap and water, and carefully swept out my room every day.I had no
light, but in the long days I did not feel this privation much.I had some religious works and travels, which I had read over and over.I
had also some knitting, 'qui m'ennuyait beaucoup'."Once, she believes,
Robespierre visited her prison:

[It has been said that Robespierre vainly tried to obtain the hand of
Mademoiselle d'Orleans.It was also rumoured that Madame Royale herself
owed her life to his matrimonial ambition.]"The officers showed him great respect; the people in the Tower did not
know him, or at least would not tell me who he was.He stared insolently
at me, glanced at my books, and, after joining the municipal officers in a
search, retired."[On another occasion "three men in scarfs," who entered the Princess's
room, told her that they did not see why she should wish to be released,
as she seemed very comfortable!"It is dreadful,' I replied, 'to be
separated for more than a year from one's mother, without even hearing
what has become of her or of my aunt.'--'No, monsieur,
but the cruellest illness is that of the heart'--' We can do nothing for
you.Be patient, and submit to the justice and goodness of the French
people: I had nothing more to say."--DUCHESSE D'ANGOULEME, "Royal
Memoirs," p.When Laurent was appointed by the Convention to the charge of the young
prisoners, Madame Royale was treated with more consideration."He was
always courteous," she says; he restored her tinderbox, gave her fresh
books, and allowed her candles and as much firewood as she wanted, "which
pleased me greatly."This simple expression of relief gives a clearer
idea of what the delicate girl must have suffered than a volume of
complaints.But however hard Madame Royale's lot might be, that of the Dauphin was
infinitely harder.Though only eight years old when he entered the
Temple, he was by nature and education extremely precocious; "his memory
retained everything, and his sensitiveness comprehended everything."His
features "recalled the somewhat effeminate look of Louis XV., and the
Austrian hauteur of Maria Theresa; his blue eyes, aquiline nose, elevated
nostrils, well-defined mouth, pouting lips, chestnut hair parted in the
middle and falling in thick curls on his shoulders, resembled his mother
before her years of tears and torture.All the beauty of his race, by
both descents, seemed to reappear in him."--[Lamartine]--For some time the
care of his parents preserved his health and cheerfulness even in the
Temple; but his constitution was weakened by the fever recorded by his
sister, and his gaolers were determined that he should never regain
strength."What does the Convention intend to do with him?"asked Simon, when the
innocent victim was placed in his clutches.For such a purpose they could not have chosen their instruments better."Simon and his wife, cut off all those fair locks that had been his
youthful glory and his mother's pride.This worthy pair stripped him of
the mourning he wore for his father; and as they did so, they called it
'playing at the game of the spoiled king.'They alternately induced him
to commit excesses, and then half starved him.They beat him mercilessly;
nor was the treatment by night less brutal than that by day.As soon as
the weary boy had sunk into his first profound sleep, they would loudly
call him by name, 'Capet!Startled, nervous, bathed in
perspiration, or sometimes trembling with cold, he would spring up, rush
through the dark, and present himself at Simon's bedside, murmuring,
tremblingly, 'I am here, citizen.'--'Come nearer; let me feel you.'He
would approach the bed as he was ordered, although he knew the treatment
that awaited him.Simon would buffet him on the head, or kick him away,
adding the remark, 'Get to bed again, wolfs cub; I only wanted to know
that you were safe.'On one of these occasions, when the child had fallen
half stunned upon his own miserable couch, and lay there groaning and
faint with pain, Simon roared out with a laugh, 'Suppose you were king,
Capet, what would you do to me?'The child thought of his father's dying
words, and said, 'I would forgive you.'"--[THIERS]

The change in the young Prince's mode of life, and the cruelties and
caprices to which he was subjected, soon made him fall ill, says his
sister."Simon forced him to eat to excess, and to drink large quantities
of wine, which he detested.He grew extremely fat without
increasing in height or strength."His aunt and sister, deprived of the
pleasure of tending him, had the pain of hearing his childish voice raised
in the abominable songs his gaolers taught him.The brutality of Simon
"depraved at once the body and soul of his pupil.He called him the young
wolf of the Temple.He treated him as the young of wild animals are
treated when taken from the mother and reduced to captivity,--at once
intimidated by blows and enervated by taming.He punished for
sensibility; he rewarded meanness; he encouraged vice; he made the child
wait on him at table, sometimes striking him on the face with a knotted
towel, sometimes raising the poker and threatening to strike him with it."[Simon left the Temple to become a municipal officer.He was involved in
the overthrow of Robespierre, and guillotined the day after him, 29th
July, 1794.]Yet when Simon was removed the poor young Prince's condition became even
worse.His horrible loneliness induced an apathetic stupor to which any
suffering would have been preferable."He passed his days without any
kind of occupation; they did not allow him light in the evening.His
keepers never approached him but to give him food;" and on the rare
occasions when they took him to the platform of the Tower, he was unable
or unwilling to move about.When, in November, 1794, a commissary named
Gomin arrived at the Temple, disposed to treat the little prisoner with
kindness, it was too late."He took extreme care of my brother," says
Madame Royale."For a long time the unhappy child had been shut up in
darkness, and he was dying of fright.He was very grateful for the
attentions of Gomin, and became much attached to him."But his physical
condition was alarming, and, owing to Gomin's representations, a
commission was instituted to examine him."The commissioners appointed
were Harmond, Mathieu, and Reverchon, who visited 'Louis Charles,' as he
was now called, in the month of February, 1795.They found the young
Prince seated at a square deal table, at which he was playing with some
dirty cards, making card houses and the like,--the materials having been
furnished him, probably, that they might figure in the report as evidences
of indulgence.He did not look up from the table as the commissioners
entered.He was in a slate-coloured dress, bareheaded; the room was
reported as clean, the bed in good condition, the linen fresh; his clothes
were also reported as new; but, in spite of all these assertions, it is
well known that his bed had not been made for months, that he had not left
his room, nor was permitted to leave it, for any purpose whatever, that it
was consequently uninhabitable, and that he was covered with vermin and
with sores.The swellings at his knees alone were sufficient to disable
him from walking.One of the commissioners approached the young Prince
respectfully.Harmond in a kind voice
begged him to speak to them.The eyes of the boy remained fixed on the
table before him.They told him of the kindly intentions of the
Government, of their hopes that he would yet be happy, and their desire
that he would speak unreservedly to the medical man that was to visit him.He seemed to listen with profound attention, but not a single word passed
his lips.It was an heroic principle that impelled that poor young heart
to maintain the silence of a mute in presence of these men.He remembered
too well the days when three other commissaries waited on him, regaled him
with pastry and wine, and obtained from him that hellish accusation
against the mother that he loved.He had learnt by some means the import
of the act, so far as it was an injury to his mother.He now dreaded
seeing again three commissaries, hearing again kind words, and being
treated again with fine promises.Dumb as death itself he sat before
them, and remained motionless as stone, and as mute."[THIERS]

His disease now made rapid progress, and Gomin and Lasne, superintendents
of the Temple, thinking it necessary to inform the Government of the
melancholy condition of their prisoner, wrote on the register: "Little
Capet is unwell."No notice was taken of this account, which was renewed
next day in more urgent terms: "Little Capet is dangerously ill."Still
there was no word from beyond the walls."We must knock harder," said the
keepers to each other, and they added, "It is feared he will not live," to
the words "dangerously ill."At length, on Wednesday, 6th May, 1795,
three days after the first report, the authorities appointed M. Desault to
give the invalid the assistance of his art.After having written down his
name on the register he was admitted to see the Prince.He made a long and
very attentive examination of the unfortunate child, asked him many
questions without being able to obtain an answer, and contented himself
with prescribing a decoction of hops, to be taken by spoonfuls every
half-hour, from six o'clock in the morning till eight in the evening.On
the first day the Prince steadily refused to take it.In vain Gomin
several times drank off a glass of the potion in his presence; his example
proved as ineffectual as his words.Next day Lasne renewed his
solicitations."Monsieur knows very well that I desire nothing but the
good of his health, and he distresses me deeply by thus refusing to take
what might contribute to it.I entreat him as a favour not to give me
this cause of grief."And as Lasne, while speaking, began to taste the
potion in a glass, the child took what he offered him out of his hands."You have, then, taken an oath that I should drink it," said he, firmly;
"well, give it me, I will drink it."From that moment he conformed with
docility to whatever was required of him, but the policy of the Commune
had attained its object; help had been withheld till it was almost a
mockery to supply it.The Prince's weakness was excessive; his keepers could scarcely drag him
to the, top of the Tower; walking hurt his tender feet, and at every step
he stopped to press the arm of Lasne with both hands upon his breast.At
last he suffered so much that it was no longer possible for him to walk,
and his keeper carried him about, sometimes on the platform, and sometimes
in the little tower, where the royal family had lived at first.But the
slight improvement to his health occasioned by the change of air scarcely
compensated for the pain which his fatigue gave him.On the battlement of
the platform nearest the left turret, the rain had, by perseverance
through ages, hollowed out a kind of basin.The water that fell remained
there for several days; and as, during the spring of 1795, storms were of
frequent occurrence, this little sheet of water was kept constantly
supplied.Whenever the child was brought out upon the platform, he saw a
little troop of sparrows, which used to come to drink and bathe in this
reservoir.At first they flew away at his approach, but from being
accustomed to see him walking quietly there every day, they at last grew
more familiar, and did not spread their wings for flight till he came up
close to them.They were always the same, he knew them by sight, and
perhaps like himself they were inhabitants of that ancient pile.He
called them his birds; and his first action, when the door into the
terrace was opened, was to look towards that side,--and the sparrows were
always there.He delighted in their chirping, and he must have envied
them their wings.Though so little could be done to alleviate his sufferings, a moral
improvement was taking place in him.He was touched by the lively
interest displayed by his physician, who never failed to visit him at nine
o'clock every morning.He seemed pleased with the attention paid him, and
ended by placing entire confidence in M. Desault.Gratitude loosened his
tongue; brutality and insult had failed to extort a murmur, but kind
treatment restored his speech he had no words for anger, but he found them
to express his thanks.M. Desault prolonged his visits as long as the
officers of the municipality would permit.When they announced the close
of the visit, the child, unwilling to beg them to allow a longer time,
held back M. Desault by the skirt of his coat.Suddenly M. Desault's
visits ceased.Several days passed and nothing was heard of him.The
keepers wondered at his absence, and the poor little invalid was much
distressed at it.The commissary on duty (M. Benoist) suggested that it
would be proper to send to the physician's house to make inquiries as to
the cause of so long an absence.Gomin and Larne had not yet ventured to
follow this advice, when next day M. Benoist was relieved by M. Bidault,
who, hearing M. Desault's name mentioned as he came in, immediately said,
"You must not expect to see him any more; he died yesterday."M. Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de l'Humanite, was next
directed to attend the prisoner, and in June he found him in so alarming a
state that he at once asked for a coadjutor, fearing to undertake the
responsibility alone.The physician--sent for form's sake to attend the
dying child, as an advocate is given by law to a criminal condemned
beforehand--blamed the officers of the municipality for not having removed
the blind, which obstructed the light, and the numerous bolts, the noise
of which never failed to remind the victim of his captivity.That sound,
which always caused him an involuntary shudder, disturbed him in the last
mournful scene of his unparalleled tortures.M. Pelletan said
authoritatively to the municipal on duty, "If you will not take these
bolts and casings away at once, at least you can make no objection to our
carrying the child into another room, for I suppose we are sent here to
take charge of him."The Prince, being disturbed by these words, spoken
as they were with great animation, made a sign to the physician to come
nearer."Speak lower, I beg of you," said he; "I am afraid they will hear
you up-stairs, and I should be very sorry for them to know that I am ill,
as it would give them much uneasiness."At first the change to a cheerful and airy room revived the Prince and
gave him evident pleasure, but the improvement did not last.Next day M.
Pelletan learned that the Government had acceded to his request for a
colleague.M. Dumangin, head physician of the Hospice de l'Unite, made
his appearance at his house on the morning of Sunday, 7th June, with the
official despatch sent him by the committee of public safety.They
repaired together immediately to the Tower.On their arrival they heard
that the child, whose weakness was excessive, had had a fainting fit,
which had occasioned fears to be entertained that his end was approaching.He had revived a little, however, when the physicians went up at about
nine o'clock.Unable to contend with increasing exhaustion, they
perceived there was no longer any hope of prolonging an existence worn out
by so much suffering, and that all their art could effect would be to
soften the last stage of this lamentable disease.While standing by the
Prince's bed, Gomin noticed that he was quietly crying, and asked him."My dear
mother remains in the other tower."Night came,--his last night,--which
the regulations of the prison condemned him to pass once more in solitude,
with suffering, his old companion, only at his side.This time, however,
death, too, stood at his pillow.When Gomin went up to the child's room
on the morning of 8th June, he said, seeing him calm, motionless, and
mute:

"I hope you are not in pain just now?""Oh, yes, I am still in pain, but not nearly so much,--the music is so
beautiful!"Now there was no music to be heard, either in the Tower or anywhere near.Gomin, astonished, said to him, "From what direction do you hear this
music?"And the
child, with a nervous motion, raised his faltering hand, as he opened his
large eyes illuminated by delight.His poor keeper, unwilling to destroy
this last sweet illusion, appeared to listen also.After a few minutes of attention the child again started, and cried out,
in intense rapture, "Amongst all the voices I have distinguished that of
my mother!"At a quarter past two he died, Lasne
only being in the room at the time.Lasne acquainted Gomin and Damont,
the commissary on duty, with the event, and they repaired to the chamber
of death.The poor little royal corpse was carried from the room into
that where he had suffered so long,--where for two years he had never
ceased to suffer.From this apartment the father had gone to the
scaffold, and thence the son must pass to the burial-ground.The remains
were laid out on the bed, and the doors of the apartment were set
open,--doors which had remained closed ever since the Revolution had
seized on a child, then full of vigour and grace and life and health!At eight o'clock next morning (9th June) four members of the committee of
general safety came to the Tower to make sure that the Prince was really
dead.When they were admitted to the death-chamber by Lasne and Damont
they affected the greatest indifference."The event is not of the least
importance," they repeated, several times over; "the police commissary of
the section will come and receive the declaration of the decease; he will
acknowledge it, and proceed to the interment without any ceremony; and the
committee will give the necessary directions."As they withdrew, some
officers of the Temple guard asked to see the remains of little Capet.Damont having observed that the guard would not permit the bier to pass
without its being opened, the deputies decided that the officers and
non-commissioned officers of the guard going off duty, together with those
coming on, should be all invited to assure themselves of the child's
death.All having assembled in the room where the body lay, he asked them
if they recognised it as that of the ex-Dauphin, son of the last King of
France.Those who had seen the young Prince at the Tuileries, or at the
Temple (and most of them had), bore witness to its being the body of Louis
XVII.When they were come down into the council-room, Darlot drew up the
minutes of this attestation, which was signed by a score of persons.These minutes were inserted in the journal of the Temple tower, which was
afterwards deposited in the office of the Minister of the Interior.During this visit the surgeons entrusted with the autopsy arrived at the
outer gate of the Temple.These were Dumangin, head physician of the
Hospice de l'Unite; Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de
l'Humanite; Jeanroy, professor in the medical schools of Paris; and
Laasus, professor of legal medicine at the Ecole de Sante of Paris.The
last two were selected by Dumangin and Pelletan because of the former
connection of M. Lassus with Mesdames de France, and of M. Jeanroy with
the House of Lorraine, which gave a peculiar weight to their signatures.Gomin received them in the council-room, and detained them until the
National Guard, descending from the second floor, entered to sign the
minutes prepared by Darlot.This done, Lasne, Darlot, and Bouquet went up
again with the surgeons, and introduced them into the apartment of Louis
XVII., whom they at first examined as he lay on his death-bed; but M.
Jeanroy observing that the dim light of this room was but little
favourable to the accomplishment of their mission, the commissaries
prepared a table in the first room, near the window, on which the corpse
was laid, and the surgeons began their melancholy operation.At seven o'clock the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up,
and that they should proceed to the cemetery.It was the season of the
longest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy
and at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took
place in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before
the gates of the Temple palace.One of the municipals wished to have the
coffin carried out secretly by the door opening into the chapel enclosure;
but M. Duaser, police commiasary, who was specially entrusted with the
arrangement of the ceremony, opposed this indecorous measure, and the
procession passed out through the great gate.The crowd that was pressing
round was kept back, and compelled to keep a line, by a tricoloured
ribbon, held at short distances by gendarmes.Compassion and sorrow were
impressed on every countenance.A small detachment of the troops of the line from the garrison of Paris,
sent by the authorities, was waiting to serve as an escort.The bier,
still covered with the pall, was carried on a litter on the shoulders of
four men, who relieved each other two at a time; it was preceded by six or
eight men, headed by a sergeant.The procession was accompanied a long
way by the crowd, and a great number of persona followed it even to the
cemetery.The name of "Little Capet," and the more popular title of
Dauphin, spread from lip to lip, with exclamations of pity and compassion.Marguerite, not by the church, as
some accounts assert, but by the old gate of the cemetery.The interment
was made in the corner, on the left, at a distance of eight or nine feet
from the enclosure wall, and at an equal distance from a small house,
which subsequently served as a school.The grave was filled up,--no mound
marked its place, and not even a trace remained of the interment!Not
till then did the commissaries of police and the municipality withdraw,
and enter the house opposite the church to draw up the declaration of
interment.It was nearly nine o'clock, and still daylight.Release of Madame Royale.--Her Marriage to the Duc d'Angouleme.The last person to hear of the sad events in the Temple was the one for
whom they had the deepest and most painful interest.After her brother's
death the captivity of Madame Royale was much lightened.She was allowed
to walk in the Temple gardens, and to receive visits from some ladies of
the old Court, and from Madame de Chantereine, who at last, after several
times evading her questions, ventured cautiously to tell her of the deaths
of her mother, aunt, and brother.Madame Royale wept bitterly, but had
much difficulty in expressing her feelings."She spoke so confusedly,"
says Madame de la Ramiere in a letter to Madame de Verneuil, "that it was
difficult to understand her.It took her more than a month's reading
aloud, with careful study of pronunciation, to make herself
intelligible,--so much had she lost the power of expression."She was
dressed with plainness amounting to poverty, and her hands were disfigured
by exposure to cold and by the menial work she had been so long accustomed
to do for herself, and which it was difficult to persuade her to leave
off.When urged to accept the services of an attendant, she replied, with
a sad prevision of the vicissitudes of her future life, that she did not
like to form a habit which she might have again to abandon.She suffered
herself, however, to be persuaded gradually to modify her recluse and
ascetic habits.It was well she did so, as a preparation for the great
changes about to follow.Nine days after the death of her brother, the city of Orleans interceded
for the daughter of Louis XVI., and sent deputies to the Convention to
pray for her deliverance and restoration to her family.Names followed
this example; and Charette, on the part of the Vendeans, demanded, as a
condition of the pacification of La Vendee, that the Princess should be
allowed to join her relations.At length the Convention decreed that
Madame Royale should be exchanged with Austria for the representatives and
ministers whom Dumouriez had given up to the Prince of Cobourg,--Drouet,
Semonville, Maret, and other prisoners of importance.At midnight on 19th
December, 1795, which was her birthday, the Princess was released from
prison, the Minister of the Interior, M. Benezech, to avoid attracting
public attention and possible disturbance, conducting her on foot from the
Temple to a neighbouring street, where his carriage awaited her.She made
it her particular request that Gomin, who had been so devoted to her
brother, should be the commissary appointed to accompany her to the
frontier; Madame de Soucy, formerly under-governess to the children of
France, was also in attendance; and the Princess took with her a dog named
Coco, which had belonged to Louis XVI.[The mention of the little dog taken from the Temple by Madame Royale
reminds me how fond all the family were of these creatures.Mesdames had beautiful spaniels; little grayhounds
were preferred by Madame Elisabeth.was the only one of all his
family who had no dogs in his room.I remember one day waiting in the
great gallery for the King's retiring, when he entered with all his family
and the whole pack, who were escorting him.All at once all the dogs
began to bark, one louder than another, and ran away, passing like ghosts
along those great dark rooms, which rang with their hoarse cries.The
Princesses shouting, calling them, running everywhere after them,
completed a ridiculous spectacle, which made those august persons very
merry.--D'HEZECQUES, p.She was frequently recognised on her way through France, and always with
marks of pleasure and respect.It might have been supposed that the Princess would rejoice to leave
behind her the country which had been the scene of so many horrors and
such bitter suffering.But it was her birthplace, and it held the graves
of all she loved; and as she crossed the frontier she said to those around
her, "I leave France with regret, for I shall never cease to consider it
my country."She arrived in Vienna on 9th January, 1796, and her first
care was to attend a memorial service for her murdered relatives.After
many weeks of close retirement she occasionally began to appear in public,
and people looked with interest at the pale, grave, slender girl of
seventeen, dressed in the deepest mourning, over whose young head such
terrible storms had swept.The Emperor wished her to marry the Archduke
Charles of Austria, but her father and mother had, even in the cradle,
destined her hand for her cousin, the Duc d'Angouleme, son of the Comte
d'Artois, and the memory of their lightest wish was law to her.Her quiet determination entailed anger and opposition amounting to
persecution.Every effort was made to alienate her from her French
relations.She was urged to claim Provence, which had become her own if
Louis XVIII.A pressure of opinion
was brought to bear upon her which might well have overawed so young a
girl."I was sent for to the Emperor's cabinet," she writes, "where I
found the imperial family assembled.The ministers and chief imperial
counsellors were also present.When the Emperor invited me to
express my opinion, I answered that to be able to treat fittingly of such
interests I thought, I ought to be surrounded not only by my mother's
relatives, but also by those of my father.Besides, I said, I
was above all things French, and in entire subjection to the laws of
France, which had rendered me alternately the subject of the King my
father, the King my brother, and the King my uncle, and that I would yield
obedience to the latter, whatever might be his commands.This declaration
appeared very much to dissatisfy all who were present, and when they
observed that I was not to be shaken, they declared that my right being
independent of my will, my resistance would not be the slightest obstacle
to the measures they might deem it necessary to adopt for the preservation
of my interests."In their anxiety to make a German princess of Marie Therese, her imperial
relations suppressed her French title as much as possible.When, with
some difficulty, the Duc de Grammont succeeded in obtaining an audience of
her, and used the familiar form of address, she smiled faintly, and bade
him beware."Call me Madame de Bretagne, or de Bourgogne, or de
Lorraine," she said, "for here I am so identified with these
provinces--[which the Emperor wished her to claim from her uncle Louis
XVIII.]--that I shall end in believing in my own transformation."After
these discussions she was so closely watched, and so many restraints were
imposed upon her, that she was scarcely less a prisoner than in the old
days of the Temple, though her cage was this time gilded.Rescue,
however, was at hand.accepted a refuge offered to him at Mittau by the
Czar Paul, who had promised that he would grant his guest's first request,
whatever it might be.Louis begged the Czar to use his influence with the
Court of Vienna to allow his niece to join him."Monsieur, my brother,"
was Paul's answer, "Madame Royale shall be restored to you, or I shall
cease to be Paul I."Next morning the Czar despatched a courier to Vienna
with a demand for the Princess, so energetically worded that refusal must
have been followed by war.Accordingly, in May, 1799, Madame Royale was
allowed to leave the capital which she had found so uncongenial an asylum.In the old ducal castle of Mittau, the capital of Courland, Louis XVIII.and his wife, with their nephews, the Ducs d'Angouleme

[The Duc d'Angonleme was quiet and reserved.He loved hunting as means of
killing time; was given to early hours and innocent pleasures.He was a
gentleman, and brave as became one.He had not the "gentlemanly vices" of
his brother, and was all the better for it.He was ill educated, but had
natural good sense, and would have passed for having more than that had he
cared to put forth pretensions.Of all his family he was the one most ill
spoken of, and least deserving of it.--DOCTOR DORAN.]and de Berri, were awaiting her, attended by the Abbe Edgeworth, as chief
ecclesiastic, and a little Court of refugee nobles and officers.With
them were two men of humbler position, who must have been even more
welcome to Madame Royale,--De Malden, who had acted as courier to Louis
XVI.during the flight to Varennes, and Turgi, who had waited on the
Princesses in the Temple.It was a sad meeting, though so long anxiously
desired, and it was followed on 10th June, 1799, by an equally sad
wedding,--exiles, pensioners on the bounty of the Russian monarch,
fulfilling an engagement founded, not on personal preference, but on
family policy and reverence for the wishes of the dead, the bride and
bridegroom had small cause for rejoicing.During the eighteen months of
tranquil seclusion which followed her marriage, the favourite occupation
of the Duchess was visiting and relieving the poor.In January, 1801, the
Czar Paul, in compliance with the demand of Napoleon, who was just then
the object of his capricious enthusiasm, ordered the French royal family
to leave Mittau.Their wanderings commenced on the 21st, a day of bitter
memories; and the young Duchess led the King to his carriage through a
crowd of men, women, and children, whose tears and blessings attended them
on their way.The Duc d'Angouleme took another route
to join a body of French gentlemen in arms for the Legitimist cause.]The exiles asked permission from the King of Prussia to settle in his
dominions, and while awaiting his answer at Munich they were painfully
surprised by the entrance of five old soldiers of noble birth, part of the
body-guard they had left behind at Mittau, relying on the protection of
Paul.The "mad Czar" had decreed their immediate expulsion, and,
penniless and almost starving, they made their way to Louis XVIII.All
the money the royal family possessed was bestowed on these faithful
servants, who came to them in detachments for relief, and then the Duchess
offered her diamonds to the Danish consul for an advance of two thousand
ducats, saying she pledged her property "that in our common distress it
may be rendered of real use to my uncle, his faithful servants, and
myself."The Duchess's consistent and unselfish kindness procured her
from the King, and those about him who knew her best, the name of "our
angel."Warsaw was for a brief time the resting-place of the wanderers, but there
they were disturbed in 1803 by Napoleon's attempt to threaten and bribe
Louis XVIII.It was suggested that refusal might bring
upon them expulsion from Prussia."We are accustomed to suffering," was
the King's answer, "and we do not dread poverty.I would, trusting in
God, seek another asylum."In 1808, after many changes of scene, this
asylum was sought in England, Gosfield Hall, Essex, being placed at their
disposal by the Marquis of Buckingham.From Gosfield, the King moved to
Hartwell Hall, a fine old Elizabethan mansion rented from Sir George Lee
for L 500 a year.A yearly grant of L 24,000 was made to the exiled
family by the British Government, out of which a hundred and forty persons
were supported, the royal dinner-party generally numbering two dozen.At Hartwell, as in her other homes, the Duchess was most popular amongst
the poor.In general society she was cold and reserved, and she disliked
the notice of strangers.In March, 1814, the royalist successes at
Bordeaux paved the way for the restoration of royalty in France, and
amidst general sympathy and congratulation, with the Prince Regent himself
to wish them good fortune, the King, the Duchess, and their suite left
Hartwell in April, 1814.The return to France was as triumphant as a
somewhat half-hearted and doubtful enthusiasm could make it, and most of
such cordiality as there was fell to the share of the Duchess.As she
passed to Notre-Dame in May, 1814, on entering Paris, she was vociferously
greeted.The feeling of loyalty, however, was not much longer-lived than
the applause by which it was expressed; the Duchess had scarcely effected
one of the strongest wishes of her heart,--the identification of what
remained of her parents' bodies, and the magnificent ceremony with which
they were removed from the cemetery of the Madeleine to the Abbey of St.Denis,--when the escape of Napoleon from Elba in February,1815, scattered
the royal family and their followers like chaff before the wind.The Duc
d'Angouleme, compelled to capitulate at Toulouse, sailed from Cette in a
Swedish vessel.The Comte d'Artois, the Duc de Berri, and the Prince de
Conde withdrew beyond the frontier.The
Duchesse d'Angouleme, then at Bordeaux celebrating the anniversary of the
Proclamation of Louis XVIII., alone of all her family made any stand
against the general panic.Day after day she mounted her horse and
reviewed the National Guard.She made personal and even passionate
appeals to the officers and men, standing firm, and prevailing on a
handful of soldiers to remain by her, even when the imperialist troops
were on the other side of the river and their cannon were directed against
the square where the Duchess was reviewing her scanty followers.["It was the Duchesse d'Angouleme who saved you," said the gallant General
Clauzel, after these events, to a royalist volunteer; "I could not bring
myself to order such a woman to be fired upon, at the moment when she was
providing material for the noblest page in her history."--"Fillia
Dolorosa," vol.With pain and difficulty she was convinced that resistance was vain;
Napoleon's banner soon floated over Bordeaux; the Duchess issued a
farewell proclamation to her "brave Bordelais," and on the 1st April,
1815, she started for Pouillac, whence she embarked for Spain.During a
brief visit to England she heard that the reign of a hundred days was
over, and the 27th of July, 1815, saw her second triumphal return to the
Tuileries.She did not take up her abode there with any wish for State
ceremonies or Court gaieties.Her life was as secluded as her position
would allow.Her favourite retreat was the Pavilion, which had been
inhabited by her mother, and in her little oratory she collected relics of
her family, over which on the anniversaries of their deaths she wept and
prayed.In her daily drives through Paris she scrupulously avoided the
spot on which they had suffered; and the memory of the past seemed to rule
all her sad and self-denying life, both in what she did and what she
refrained from doing.[She was so methodical and economical, though liberal in her charities,
that one of her regular evening occupations was to tear off the seals from
the letters she had received during the day, in order that the wax might
be melted down and sold; the produce made one poor family "passing rich
with forty pounds a year."--See "Filia Dolorosa," vol.Her somewhat austere goodness was not of a nature to make her popular.The
few who really understood her loved her, but the majority of her
pleasure-seeking subjects regarded her either with ridicule or dread.She
is said to have taken no part in politics, and to have exerted no
influence in public affairs, but her sympathies were well known, and "the
very word liberty made her shudder;" like Madame Roland, she had seen "so
many crimes perpetrated under that name."The claims of three pretended Dauphins--Hervagault, the son of the tailor
of St.Lo; Bruneau, son of the shoemaker of Vergin; and Naundorf or
Norndorff, the watchmaker somewhat troubled her peace, but never for a
moment obtained her sanction.Of the many other pseudo-Dauphins (said to
number a dozen and a half) not even the names remain.In February,1820, a
fresh tragedy befell the royal family in the assassination of the Duc de
Berri, brother-in-law of the Duchesse d'Angouleme, as he was seeing his
wife into her carriage at the door of the Opera-house.He was carried
into the theatre, and there the dying Prince and his wife were joined by
the Duchess, who remained till he breathed his last, and was present when
he, too, was laid in the Abbey of St.She was present also when
his son, the Duc de Bordeaux, was born, and hoped that she saw in him a
guarantee for the stability of royalty in France.In September, 1824, she
stood by the death-bed of Louis XVIII., and thenceforward her chief
occupation was directing the education of the little Duc de Bordeaux, who
generally resided with her at Villeneuve l'Etang, her country house near
St.Thence she went in July, 1830, to the Baths of Vichy,
stopping at Dijon on her way to Paris, and visiting the theatre on the
evening of the 27th.She was received with "a roar of execrations and
seditious cries," and knew only too well what they signified.She
instantly left the theatre and proceeded to Tonnere, where she received
news of the rising in Paris, and, quitting the town by night, was driven
to Joigny with three attendants.Soon after leaving that place it was
thought more prudent that the party should separate and proceed on foot,
and the Duchess and M. de Foucigny, disguised as peasants, entered
Versailles arm-in-arm, to obtain tidings of the King.The Duchess found
him at Rambouillet with her husband, the Dauphin, and the King met her
with a request for "pardon," being fully conscious, too late, that his
unwise decrees and his headlong flight had destroyed the last hopes of his
family.The act of abdication followed, by which the prospect of royalty
passed from the Dauphin and his wife, as well as from Charles X.--Henri V.
being proclaimed King, and the Duc d'Orleans (who refused to take the boy
monarch under his personal protection) lieutenant-general of the kingdom.Then began the Duchess's third expatriation.At Cherbourg the royal
family, accompanied by the little King without a kingdom, embarked in the
'Great Britain', which stood out to sea.The Duchess, remaining on deck
for a last look at the coast of France, noticed a brig which kept, she
thought, suspiciously near them."To fire into and sink the vessels in which we sail, should any attempt be
made to return to France."Such was the farewell of their subjects to the House of Bourbon.The
fugitives landed at Weymouth; the Duchesse d'Angouleme under the title of
Comtesse de Marne, the Duchesse de Berri as Comtesse de Rosny, and her
son, Henri de Bordeaux, as Comte de Chambord, the title he retained till
his death, originally taken from the estate presented to him in infancy by
his enthusiastic people.Holyrood, with its royal and gloomy
associations, was their appointed dwelling.The Duc and Duchesse
d'Angouleme, and the daughter of the Duc de Berri, travelled thither by
land, the King and the young Comte de Chambord by sea."I prefer my route
to that of my sister," observed the latter, "because I shall see the coast
of France again, and she will not."The French Government soon complained that at Holyrood the exiles were
still too near their native land, and accordingly, in 1832, Charles X.,
with his son and grandson, left Scotland for Hamburg, while the Duchesse
d'Angouleme and her niece repaired to Vienna.The family were reunited at
Prague in 1833, where the birthday of the Comte de Chambord was celebrated
with some pomp and rejoicing, many Legitimists flocking thither to
congratulate him on attaining the age of thirteen, which the old law of
monarchical France had fixed as the majority of her princes.Three years
later the wanderings of the unfortunate family recommenced; the Emperor
Francis II.was dead, and his successor, Ferdinand, must visit Prague to
be crowned, and Charles X. feared that the presence of a discrowned
monarch might be embarrassing on such an occasion.Illness and sorrow
attended the exiles on their new journey, and a few months after they were
established in the Chateau of Graffenburg at Goritz, Charles X. died of
cholera, in his eightieth year.At Goritz, also, on the 31st May, 1844,
the Duchesse d'Angouleme, who had sat beside so many death-beds, watched
over that of her husband.Theirs had not been a marriage of affection in
youth, but they respected each other's virtues, and to a great extent
shared each other's tastes; banishment and suffering had united them very
closely, and of late years they had been almost inseparable,--walking,
riding, and reading together.When the Duchesse d'Angouleme had seen her
husband laid by his father's side in the vault of the Franciscan convent,
she, accompanied by her nephew and niece, removed to Frohsdorf, where they
spent seven tranquil years.Here she was addressed as "Queen" by her
household for the first time in her life, but she herself always
recognised Henri, Comte de Chambord, as her sovereign.The Duchess lived
to see the overthrow of Louis Philippe, the usurper of the inheritance of
her family.Her last attempt to exert herself was a characteristic one.She tried to rise from a sick-bed in order to attend the memorial service
held for her mother, Marie Antoinette, on the 16th October, the
anniversary of her execution.But her strength was not equal to the task;
on the 19th she expired, with her hand in that of the Comte de Chambord,
and on 28th October, 1851, Marie Therese Charlotte, Duchesse d'Angouleme,
was buried in the Franciscan convent."In the spring of 1814 a ceremony took place in Paris at which I was
present because there was nothing in it that could be mortifying to a
French heart.had long been admitted to be one of
the most serious misfortunes of the Revolution.The Emperor Napoleon
never spoke of that sovereign but in terms of the highest respect, and
always prefixed the epithet unfortunate to his name.The ceremony to
which I allude was proposed by the Emperor of Russia and the King of
Prussia.It consisted of a kind of expiation and purification of the spot
on which Louis XVI.I went to see the
ceremony, and I had a place at a window in the Hotel of Madame de Remusat,
next to the Hotel de Crillon, and what was termed the Hotel de Courlande."The expiation took place on the 10th of April.The weather was extremely
fine and warm for the season.The Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia,
accompanied by Prince Schwartzenberg, took their station at the entrance
of the Rue Royale; the King of Prussia being on the right of the Emperor
Alexander, and Prince Schwartzenberg on his left.There was a long
parade, during which the Russian, Prussian and Austrian military bands
vied with each other in playing the air, 'Vive Henri IV.!'The cavalry
defiled past, and then withdrew into the Champs Elysees; but the infantry
ranged themselves round an altar which was raised in the middle of the
Place, and which was elevated on a platform having twelve or fifteen
steps.The Emperor of Russia alighted from his horse, and, followed by
the King of Prussia, the Grand Duke Constantine, Lord Cathcart, and Prince
Schwartzenberg, advanced to the altar.When the Emperor had nearly
reached the altar the "Te Deum" commenced.At the moment of the
benediction, the sovereigns and persons who accompanied them, as well as
the twenty-five thousand troops who covered the Place, all knelt down.The Greek priest presented the cross to the Emperor Alexander, who kissed
it; his example was followed by the individuals who accompanied him,
though they were not of the Greek faith.On rising, the Grand Duke
Constantine took off his hat, and immediately salvoes of artillery were
heard."The following titles have the signification given below during the period

be.All the potatoes rotted late this fall, Meneer.Get out of my house, then--sponger![A pause during which Barend walks timidly away.]If I had a son like that----

BOS.Better get a lover first----

JO.I've already got one!--If I had a son like that I'd
bang him right and left!A sailor
never knows that sooner or later--He never thinks of that--If Geert
were that way--there, I know--Aunt, imagine--Geert----

BOS.He'd face the devil--eh, Aunt?Now, I'm going to finish the
potatoes.Say, black eyes--do you laugh all the time?[Calls back from
the opened door.]Geert?--Is that your son, who----

KNEIR.Yes, Meneer--Couldn't keep his hands at
home.I think they must have teased him----

BOS.Discipline would be thrown overboard to the sharks if
sailors could deal out blows every time things didn't go to suit them.That's so, Meneer, but----

BOS.And is she--smitten with that good-for-nothing?She's crazy about him, and well she may be.He's a handsome
lad, takes after his father--and strong--there is his photograph--he
still wore the uniform then--first class--now he is----

BOS.Degraded?----

KNEIR.He's been to India twice--it
is hard--if he comes next week--or in two weeks--or tomorrow, I don't
know when--I'll have him to feed, too--although--I must say it of
him, he won't let the grass grow under his feet--A giant like him
can always find a skipper.A sweet beast--I tell you right now, Kneir, I'd rather not take
him--dissatisfied scoundrels are plenty enough these days--All that
come from the Navy, I'm damned if it isn't so--are unruly and I have
no use for that kind--Am I not right?Certainly, Meneer, but my boy----

BOS.There was Jacob--crooked Jacob, the skipper had to discharge
him.He was, God save him, dissatisfied with everything--claimed
that I cheated at the count--yes--yes--insane.Now he's trying it at
Maassluis.May I send him to the skipper then--or direct to the water
bailiff's office?Yes, but you tell him----

KNEIR.If he comes in time, he can go out on the Good Hope.They are bringing the provisions and casks aboard
now.She'll come back with a full cargo--You know that.Pieterse's steam trawler--The deuce![Both go off--the stage remains empty--a vague murmur of voices
outside.Fishermen, in conversation, pass the window.Geert sneaks inside through the door at
left.Throws down a bundle tied in a red handkerchief.Looks cautiously
into the bedsteads, the cooking shed, peers through the window, then
muttering he plumps down in a chair by the table, rests his head on
his hand, rises again; savagely takes a loaf of bread from the back
cupboard, cuts off a hunk.Walks back to chair, chewing, lets the
bread fall; wrathfully stares before him.Who's there?--Geert!--[Entering.]Yes--it's me--Well, why don't you give me a paw.No, where is she----

BAR.Mother, she--she----

GEERT.You look so--so pale----

GEERT.No, fine!--What a question--They feed you on beefsteaks!Go and get some then--if I don't have a swallow, I'll keel over.[Peers in his pocket, throws a handful of coins on
the table.]Earned that in prison--There!----

BAR.I don't care a damn--so you hurry.Don't stare so, stupid----

BAR.I can't get used to your face--it's so queer.I must grow a beard at once!--Say, did they
make a devil of a row?Jo enters, a dead rabbit in her hand.][Lets the rabbit fall.]--Geert![Rushes to him, throws
her arms about his neck, sobbing hysterically.]I am so happy--so happy, dear Geert----

GEERT.My head can't
stand such a lot of noise----

JO.You don't understand it of course--six months
solitary--in a dirty, stinking cell.[Puts his hand before his eyes
as if blinded by the light.]Drop the curtain a bit--This sunshine
drives me mad!My God--Geert----

GEERT.They didn't like my beard--The government took that--become
ugly, haven't I?--Look as if I'd lost my wits?The
beggars; to shut up a sailor in a cage where you can't walk, where you
can't speak, where you--[Strikes wildly upon the table with his fist.]Don't you meddle with this--Where is a glass?--Never
mind--[Swallows eagerly.][Puts the bottle again to
his lips.]Please, Geert--no more--you can't stand it.That's the best way
to tan your stomach.Don't look so unhappy,
girl--I won't get drunk!Not accustomed to it--Are
there any provisions on board?That will do for tomorrow--Here, you, go and lay in a
supply--some ham and some meat----

BAR.No--that's extravagance--If you want to buy meat, keep your money
till Sunday.Sunday--Sunday--If you hadn't eaten anything for six months but
rye bread, rats, horse beans--I'm too weak to set one foot before the
other.and--and a piece of cheese--I feel
like eating myself into a colic.God!--I'm glad to see you cheerful again.Yes, there's some
tobacco left--in the jar.Who did you flirt with, while I sat----

JO.Haven't
had the taste in my mouth for half a year.This isn't tobacco;
[Exhales.]The gin stinks and the pipe stinks.You'll sleep nice and warm up there, dear.Why is the looking-glass on
the floor?No--it's me--Geert----

KNEIR.You--what have you done to make me happy!Never mind that now----

GEERT.If you intend to reproach
me?--I shall----

KNEIR.Pack my bundle!----

KNEIR.Do you expect me to sit on the sinner's bench?The whole village talked about you--I
couldn't go on an errand but----

GEERT.Let them that talk say it to my face.No, but you raised your hand against your superior.I should have twisted my fingers in his throat.Boy--boy; you make us all unhappy.Treated like a beast, then I get the devil
besides.[At the door,
hesitates, throws down his bundle.]Don't cry,
Mother--I would rather--Damn it!Please--Auntie dear----

KNEIR.Never would he have
looked at you again--And he also had a great deal to put up with.I'm glad I'm different--not so submissive--It's a great honor
to let them walk over you!I have no fish blood in me--Now then,
is it to go on raining?I'd knock the teeth out of his jaw tomorrow.I've sat long enough, hahaha!--Let me walk to get the hang of
it.Now I'll--But for you it would never have happened----

JO.But for me?--that's a good
one!That cad--Don't you remember dancing with him at the tavern
van de Rooie?I?--Danced?----

GEERT.With that cross-eyed quartermaster?--I don't understand a word
of it--was it with him?--And you yourself wanted me to----

GEERT.You can't refuse a superior--On board ship he had stories.I
overheard him tell the skipper that he----

JO.That he--never mind what--He spoke of you as if you were any
sailor's girl.I!--The low down----

GEERT.When he came into the hold after the dog watch, I hammered
him on the jaw with a marlin spike.Five minutes later I sat in
irons.Kept in them six days--[Sarcastically.]the provost was full;
then two weeks provost; six months solitary; and suspended from the
navy for ten years; that, damn me, is the most--I'd chop off my two
hands to get back in; to be <DW65>-driven again; cursed as a beggar
again; ruled as a slave again----

KNEIR.Geert--Geert--Don't speak such words.In the Bible it stands
written----

GEERT.Stands written--If there was only something written
for us----

KNEIR.If he had gone politely to the Commander----

GEERT.You should have been a sailor,
Mother--Hahaha!They were too glad of the chance to clip and
shear me.While I was in the provost they found newspapers in my bag I
was not allowed to read--and pamphlets I was not allowed to read--that
shut the door--otherwise they would have given me only third class----

KNEIR.Newspapers you were not allowed to read?Why--simple soul--Ach!--when I look at your submissive face I
see no way to tell why--Why do men desert?--Why, ten days before this
happened to me, did Peter the stoker cut off his two fingers?--Just
for a joke?I can't blame you people--you knew no
better--and I admired the uniform--But now that I've got some brains
I would like to warn every boy that binds himself for fourteen years
to murder.Boy, don't say such dreadful things--you are
excited----

GEERT.No--not at all--worn out, in fact--in Atjeh I fought
with the rest--stuck my bayonet into the body of a poor devil till the
blood spurted into my eyes--For that they gave me the Atjeh medal.[Jo picks up the bundle;
Barend looks on.][Jerks the medal from his
jacket, throws it out of the window.]you have dangled on my
breast long enough!I no longer know
you----

GEERT.Who--who took an innocent boy, that couldn't count ten, and
kidnaped him for fourteen years?Who drilled and trained him for a
dog's life?Who put him in irons when he defended his girl?Irons--you
should have seen me walking in them, groaning like an animal.Near me
walked another animal with irons on his leg, because of an insolent
word to an officer of the watch.Six days with the damned irons on
your claws and no power to break them.Don't talk about it any more, you are still so tired----

GEERT.[Wrapped in the grimness of his story.]Then the provost,
that stinking, dark cage; your pig stye is a palace to it.A cage
with no windows--no air--a cage where you can't stand or lie down.A
cage where your bread and water is flung to you with a "there, dog,
eat!"There was a big storm in those days,--two sloops were battered to
pieces;--when you expected to go to the bottom any moment.Never again
to see anyone belongin' to me--neither you--nor you--nor you.To go
down in that dark, stinking hole with no one to talk to--no comrade's
hand!--No, no, let me talk--it lightens my chest!A fellow has lots to
bring in there.Gold
epaulettes sitting in judgment on the trash God has kicked into the
world to serve, to salute, to----

KNEIR.Six months--six months in a cell for reformation.To be reformed
by eating food you could not swallow;--rye bread, barley, pea soup,
rats!Three months I pasted paper bags, and when I saw the chance I
ate the sour paste from hunger.Three months I sorted peas; you'll
not believe it, but may I never look on the sea again if I lie.At
night, over my gas light, I would cook the peas I could nip in my
slop pail.When the handle became too hot to hold any longer, I ate
them half boiled--to fill my stomach.That's to reform you--reform
you--for losing your temper and licking a blackguard that called your
girl a vile name, and reading newspapers you were not allowed to read.Fresh from the sea--in a cell--no
wind and no water, and no air--one small high window with grating like
a partridge cage.The foul smell and the nights--the damned nights,
when you couldn't sleep.When you sprang up and walked, like an insane
man, back and forth--back and forth--four measured paces.The nights
when you sat and prayed not to go insane--and cursed everything,
everything, everything![After a long pause goes to him and throws her arms about his
neck.Kneirtje weeps, Barend stands dazed.]Don't let us--[Forcibly controlling his tears.][Goes to the window--says to Barend.]Lay
out the good things--[Draws up the curtain.]if the
rooster isn't sitting on the roof again, ha, ha, ha!I would like to sail at once--two days on the Sea!the
Sea!--and I'm my old self again.What?--Why is Truus crying as she
walks by?Ssst!--Don't call after her.The Anna has just come in without
her husband.[A few sad-looking, low-speaking women walk past the
window.][Drops the window
curtain, stands in somber thought.]That is to say----

MARIETJE.Yes--I won't go far--I must----

MARIETJE.Well, Salamander, am I a child?I must--I must----[Abruptly
off.]You should have seen him day before yesterday--half the
village at his heels.When Mother was living he didn't
dare.She used to slap his face for him when he smelled of gin--just
let me try it.You say that as though--ha ha ha!I never have seen Mees drinking--and father very seldom
formerly.Ah well--I can't put a cork in his mouth, nor lead him
around by a rope.Gone, of course--to
the Rooie.Young for her years, isn't she, eh?Sit down and tell me
[Merrily.]You know we would
like to marry at once [Smiles, hesitates.]because--because----Well,
you understand.But Mees had to send for his papers first--that takes
two weeks--by that time he is far out at sea; now five weeks--five
little weeks will pass quickly enough.That's about the same----Are you two!----Now?----I told
you everything----

[Jo shrugs her shoulders and laughs.]May you live to be a hundred----

KNEIR.You may try one--you, too--gingerbread nuts--no,
not two, you, with the grab-all fingers!For each of the boys a
half pound gingerbread nuts--and a half pound chewing tobacco--and
a package of cigars.Do you know what I'm going to give Barend since
he has become so brave--look----

JO.Now--you should give those to Geert----

KNEIR.No, I'm so pleased with the lad that he has made up his mind
I want to reward him.These are ever so old, they are earrings.My
husband wore them Sundays, when he was at home.There are little ships on them--masts--and sails--I wish
I had them for a brooch.You had a time getting him to sign--Eh!But he was willing to go with his brother--and
now take it home to yourself--a boy that is not strong--not very
strong--rejected for the army, and a boy who heard a lot about his
father and Josef.First you curse and scold at him, and
now nothing is too good.In an hour he will be gone,
and you must never part in anger.We
have fresh wafers and ginger cakes all laid in for my birthday--set it
all ready, Jo.Saart is coming soon, and the boys may take a dram, too.A sweet young Miss
    And a glass of Anis--
    I shall surely come in for this.[Hides it in his red handkerchief.]No--now--you
know what I want to say.I don't need to ask if----[Pours the dram.]No--no--go ahead--just a little more.No matter, I shan't spill a drop.Lips to the glass, sucks up the liquor.]When you have my years!--Hardly slept a wink last night--and
no nap this afternoon.That's what he would like to do----

MARIETJE.Now, if I had my choice----

KNEIR.The Matron at the Home has to
help dress him.the Englishman says: "The old man misses the kisses, and
the young man kisses the misses."Yes, that means, "Woman, take your cat inside, its beginning to
rain."Good day, Daantje; day, Cobus; and day, Marietje; and day,
Jo.No, I'm not going to do it--my door is ajar--and the cat may
tip over the oil stove.No, just give it to me this way--so--so--many
happy returns, and may your boys--Where are the boys?Geert has gone to say good bye, and Barend has gone with Mees
to take the mattresses and chests in the yawl.They'll soon be here,
for they must be on board by three o'clock.There was a lot of everything and more too.The bride was
full,--three glasses "roses without thorns," two of "perfect love,"
and surely four glasses of "love in a mist."Where she stowed
it all I don't know.Give me the old fashioned dram, brandy and syrup--eh!He's come here to sleep--you look as if you hadn't been to
bed at all.In his bed--he, he, he!No, I say, don't take out your chew.No, you'd never guess how I got it.Less than ten
minutes ago I met Bos the ship-owner, and he gave me--he gave me a
little white roll--of--of tissue paper with tobacco inside.Yes, catch me smoking a thing like that in--in paper--that's a
chew with a shirt on.And you're a crosspatch without a shirt.No, I'm not going to
sit down.Day, Simon--shove in, room for you here.Give him just one, for a parting cup.Is there much work in the dry dock, Simon?No, if I sit down I stay too long.Well then, half a
glass--no--no cookies.It looks like all hands on deck
here!Uh--ja----

MARIETJE.The deuce, but you're touchy!We've got a quarter of an hour,
boys!Fallen asleep with a ginger nut in his hand.Sick in the night--afraid to call the matron; walked about
in his bare feet; got chilled.It's easy for you to talk, but if you disturb her, she keeps
you in for two weeks.Poor devils--I don't want to live to be so old.We're not even married
yet--and he's a widower already!I don't need a belaying pin----[Sings.]"Sailing, sailing, don't wait to be called;
    Starboard watch, spring from your bunk;
    Let the man at the wheel go to his rest;
    The rain is good and the wind is down.It's sailing, it's sailing,
    It's sailing for the starboard watch."[The others join him in beating time on the table with their fists.]You'll do the same when you're as old
as I am.You might have said that a while back when you
looked like a wet dish rag.Now we can make up a song about you, pasting paper
bags--just as Domela--he he he!My nevvy Geert pastes paper bags,
    Hi-ha, ho!My nevvy Geert----

SAART.DAAN., JO., MARIETJE AND COBUS.I'm blest if I see----

MARIETJE.They must--they must--not--not--that's fast.You must--you must----

MARIETJE.The ribs--and--and----[Firmly.]That's fast!----

GEERT, JO., COBUS, DAANTJE AND SAART.You went together to take the mattresses and chests----

MEES.Can't repeat a word of it--afraid--afraid--always afraid----[To
Marietje, who has induced her father to rise.]Now--now--Kneir, many happy returns.Perhaps he's saying good-bye to his girl.[Sound of Jelle's
fiddle outside.]Do sit still--one would think you'd eaten horse flesh.Poor old fellow, gets blinder every day.Yes, play that tune of--of--what do you call 'em?You know, Jelle, the one--that one that goes [Sings.]"I know
a song that charms the heart."Give us----[Jelle begins the Marseillaise.]"Alloose--vodela--bedeije--deboe--debie--de boolebie."That's the French of a dead codfish!I've laid in a French port--and say, it
was first rate!When I said pain they gave me bread--and when I said
"open the port," they opened the door.Let's use the
Dutch words we've got for it."Arise men, brothers, all united!Your wrongs, your sorrows be avenged"--

BOS.[Who has stood at the open window listening during the singing,
yells angrily.]It's high time you were all on board!Oh--Oh--how he scared me--he!I couldn't think where the voice came from.How stupid of you to roar like a weaned pig, when you know
Meneer Bos lives only two doors away.You'll never eat a sack of salt with him.What business had you to sing those low songs, anyway?If he
hadn't taken me by surprise!An old frog like that before your eyes
of a sudden.Ach, please don't, Geert.I'm afraid that if Meneer
Bos----[Motions to Jelle to stop.]This one is afraid to sail, this one of the Matron of the Old
Men's Home, this one of a little ship owner!Forbids me in my own
house!Commands me as though I were a servant!Fun is fun, but if you were a ship owner, you wouldn't want
your sailors singing like socialists either.When he knows how dependent I am, too.Is it an
honor to do his cleaning!For mopping the office floor and
licking his muddy boots you get fifty cents twice a week and the
scraps off their plates.Oh, what a row I'll get Saturday!If you hadn't all your
life allowed this braggart who began with nothing to walk over you
and treat you as a slave, while father and my brothers lost their
lives on the sea making money for him, you'd give him a scolding and
damn his hide for his insolence in opening his jaw.Next
year Mother will give you pennies to play."Arise men, brothers,
all unite-e-ed"----

KNEIR.Stop tormenting your old mother on her birthday.[Jelle
holds out his hand.]Here, you can't stand on one leg.I'll wait a few minutes for Barend.The
boys will come by here any way.Don't you catch on that those two are--A good voyage.Have I staid so long--and my door ajar![Brusquely coming through the kitchen door.]Skipper Hengst has my orders.[Cobus
and Daantje slink away, stopping outside to listen at the window.]Yes, Meneer, he is all ready to go.That other boy of yours that Hengst engaged--refuses to go.[They bow in a
scared way and hastily go on.]This looks like a dive--drunkenness
and rioting.Mother's birthday or not, we do as we please here.You change your tone or----

GEERT.Ach--dear Geert--Don't take offense, Meneer--he's
quick tempered, and in anger one says----

BOS.Dirt is all the thanks you get for
being good to you people.If you're not on board in
ten minutes, I'll send the police for you!You send--what do you take me for, any way!What I take him for--he asks that--dares to ask----[To
Kneirtje.]You'll come to me again recommending a trouble-maker kicked
out by the Navy.You
pay wages and I do the work.You're just a big overgrown boy, that's all!If it wasn't for Mother--I'd----

KNEIR.Kneir, Kneir,
consider well what you do--I gave you an advance in good faith----

KNEIR.Ach, yes, Meneer--Ach, yes----

BOS.Yes, Meneer--you and the priest----

BOS.One of your sons refuses to go, the other--you'll come to a bad
end, my little friend.On board I'm a sailor--I'm the skipper
here.A ship owner layin' down the law; don't do
this and don't do that!Boring his nose through the window when you
don't sing to suit him.For my part, sing, but a sensible sailor expecting to marry ought
to appreciate it when his employer is looking out for his good.You
young fellows have no respect for grey hairs.for grey hairs that
have become grey in want and misery----

BOS.Your mother's seen me, as child,
standing before the bait trays.I also have stood in an East wind
that froze your ears, biting off bait heads----

GEERT.We don't care for your stories, Meneer.You have
become a rich man, and a tyrant.Good!--you are perhaps no worse than
the rest, but don't interfere with me in my own house.We may all become different, and perhaps my son may
live to see the day when he will come, as I did, twelve years ago,
crying to the office, to ask if there's any news of his father and
his two brothers!and not find their employer sitting by his warm fire
and his strong box, drinking grog.He may not be damned for coming so
often to ask the same thing, nor be turned from the door with snubs
and the message, "When there's anything to tell you'll hear of it."You lie--I never did anything of the sort.I won't soil any more words over it.My father's hair was grey, my mother's hair is grey, Jelle,
the poor devil who can't find a place in the Old Men's Home because
on one occasion in his life he was light-fingered--Jelle has also
grey hairs.If you hear him or crooked
Jacob, it's the same cuckoo song.But
now I'll give another word of advice, my friend, before you go under
sail.You have an old mother, you expect to marry, good; you've been
in prison six months--I won't talk of that; you have barked out your
insolence to me in your own house, but if you attempt any of this
talk on board the Hope you'll find out there is a muster roll.When you've become older--and wiser--you'll be ashamed of your
insolence--"the ship owner by his warm stove, and his grog"----

GEERT.And his strong box----

BOS.And his cares, you haven't the wits to understand!Who hauls the fish out of the sea?Who
risks his life every hour of the day?Who doesn't take off his
clothes in five or six weeks?Who walks with hands covered with salt
sores,--without water to wash face or hands?Who sleep like beasts
two in a bunk?Who leave wives and mothers behind to beg alms?Twelve
head of us are presently going to sea--we get twenty-five per cent
of the catch, you seventy-five.We do the work, you sit safely at
home.Your ship is insured, and we--we can go to the bottom in case
of accident--we are not worth insuring----

KNEIR.You should be a clown in a
circus!Twenty-seven per cent isn't enough for him----

GEERT.I'll never eat salted codfish from your generosity!Our whole
share is in "profit and loss."When luck is with us we each make eight
guilders a week, one guilder a day when we're lucky.One guilder a
day at sea, to prepare salt fish, cod with livers for the people in
the cities--hahaha!--a guilder a day--when you're lucky and don't go
to the bottom.You fellows know what you're about when you engage us
on shares.[Old and young heads of fishermen appear at the window.]And say to the skipper--no, never mind--I'll
be there myself----[A pause.]Now I'll
take two minutes more, blockhead, to rub under your nose something
I tried three times to say, but you gave me no chance to get in a
word.When you lie in your bunk tonight--as a beast, of course!--try
and think of my risks, by a poor catch--lost nets and cordage--by
damages and lightning in the mast, by running aground, and God knows
what else.The Jacoba's just had her hatches torn off, the Queen
Wilhelmina half her bulwarks washed away.You don't count that,
for you don't have to pay for it!Three months ago the Expectation
collided with a steamer.Without a thought of the catch or the nets,
the men sprang overboard, leaving the ship to drift!You laugh, boy, because you don't realize what cares I
have.On the Mathilde last week the men smuggled gin and tobacco in
their mattresses to sell to the English.If you were talking about conditions in Middelharnis or Pernis,
you'd have reason for it.My men don't pay the harbor costs, don't
pay for bait, towing, provisions, barrels, salt.I don't expect you
to pay the loss of the cordage, if a gaff or a boom breaks.I go into
my own pocket for it.I gave your mother an advance, your brother
Barend deserts.No, Meneer, I can't believe that.Hengst telephoned me from the harbor, else I wouldn't have
been here to be insulted by your oldest son, who's disturbing the
whole neighborhood roaring his scandalous songs!If you're not on board on time I'll apply "Article
Sixteen" and fine you twenty-five guilders.As for you, my wife doesn't need you at
present, you're all a bad lot here.Ach, Meneer, it isn't my fault!After this voyage you can look for
another employer, who enjoys throwing pearls before swine better than
I do!Don't hang your head so soon, Aunt!Geert was in the right----

KNEIR.Great God, if he should desert--if he
deserts--he also goes to prison--two sons who----

GEERT.Aren't you going to wish me a good voyage--or don't you think
that necessary?Yes, I'm coming----

JO.I'm sorry for her, the poor thing.You gave him a
talking to, didn't you?[Picks a geranium from a flower
pot.]And you will
think of me every night, will you?Truus saw him hanging around the house.If that coward refuses to go,
your sitting at home won't help a damn.Don't forget your chewing tobacco
and your cigars----

GEERT.If you're too late--I'll never look at you again!I'll shout the whole village together if you don't
immediately run and follow Geert and Jo.If you can keep Geert from going--call him back!Have you gone crazy with fear, you big coward?The Good Hope is no good, no good--her ribs are
rotten--the planking is rotten!----

KNEIR.Don't stand there telling stories to excuse yourself.Simon, the ship carpenter--that drunken sot who can't speak
two words.First you sign, then you
run away!Me--you may beat me to death!--but I won't go on an unseaworthy
ship!Hasn't the ship been lying in the
dry docks?There was no caulking her any more--Simon----

KNEIR.March, take your package of
chewing tobacco.I'm not going--I'm not going.You don't know--you
didn't see it!The last voyage she had a foot of water in her hold!A ship that has just returned from her fourth
voyage to the herring catch and that has brought fourteen loads!Has
it suddenly become unseaworthy, because you, you miserable coward,
are going along?I looked in the hold--the barrels were
floating.You can see death that is hiding down there.Bilge water, as in every ship!Tell that
to your grandmother, not to an old sailor's wife.Skipper Hengst
is a child, eh!Isn't Hengst going and Mees and Gerrit and Jacob
and Nellis--your own brother and Truus' little Peter?Do you claim
to know more than old seamen?I'm not going to
stand it to see you taken aboard by the police----

BAR.Oh, Mother dear, Mother dear, don't make me go!Oh, God; how you have punished me in my children--my children
are driving me to beggary.I've taken an advance--Bos has refused to
give me any more cleaning to do--and--and----[Firmly.]Well, then,
let them come for you--you'd better be taken than run away.Oh, oh,
that this should happen in my family----

BAR.You'll not get out----

BAR.I don't know what I'm doing--I might hurt----

KNEIR.Now he is brave, against his sixty year old mother----Raise
your hand if you dare![Falls on a chair shaking his head between his hands.]Oh, oh,
oh--If they take me aboard, you'll never see me again--you'll never
see Geert again----

KNEIR.It's tempting God to rave this
way with fear----[Friendlier tone.]Come, a man of your age must
not cry like a child--come!I wanted to surprise you with Father's
earrings--come!Mother dear--I don't dare--I don't dare--I shall drown--hide
me--hide me----

KNEIR.If I believed a word of your talk,
would I let Geert go?There's a
package of tobacco, and one of cigars.Now sit still, and I'll put
in your earrings--look--[Talking as to a child.]--real silver--ships
on them with sails--sit still, now--there's one--there's two--walk
to the looking glass----

BAR.No--no!----

KNEIR.Come now, you're making me weak for nothing--please,
dear boy--I do love you and your brother--you're all I have on
earth.Every night I will pray to the good God to bring you
home safely.You must get used to it, then you will become a brave
seaman--and--and----[Cries.][Holds the
mirror before him.]Look at your earrings--what?----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Coming in through door at left, good-natured
manner.]Skipper Hengst has requested the Police----If you please,
my little man, we have no time to lose.The ship--is rotten----

2ND POLICEMAN.Then you should not have
mustered in.[Taps him kindly
on the shoulder.][Clings desperately to the
bedstead and door jamb.]I shall
drown in the dirty, stinking sea!Oh God, Oh
God, Oh God![Crawls up against the wall, beside himself with terror.]The boy is afraid----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Sobbing as she seizes Barend's hands.]Come now, boy--come
now--God will not forsake you----

BAR.[Moaning as he loosens his hold, sobs despairingly.]You'll
never see me again, never again----

1ST POLICEMAN.[They exeunt, dragging Barend.]Oh, oh----

TRUUS.What was the matter,
Kneir?Barend had to be taken by the police.Oh, and now
I'm ashamed to go walk through the village, to tell them good bye--the
disgrace--the disgrace----

                                CURTAIN.A lighted lamp--the illuminated
chimney gives a red glow.Kneirtje lying on bed, dressed, Jo reading
to her from prayerbook.]in piteousness,
      To your poor children of the sea,
    Reach down your arms in their distress;
      With God their intercessor be.Unto the Heart Divine your prayer
    Will make an end to all their care."[A
knock--she tiptoes to cook-shed door, puts her finger to her lips in
warning to Clementine and Kaps, who enter.]She's not herself yet,
feverish and coughing.I've brought her a plate of soup, and a half dozen
eggs.I've brought you some veal soup, Kneir.I'd like to see you carry a full pan with the sand blowing in
your eyes.There's five--and--[Looking at his hand, which drips with egg
yolk.][Bringing out his handkerchief and purse covered with egg.]He calls that putting them away
carefully.My purse, my handkerchief, my cork screw.I don't know why Father keeps that bookkeeper, deaf,
and cross.They haven't
forgotten the row with your sons yet.Mouth shut, or I'll get a
scolding.May Jo go to the beach with me to look at the sea?Go on the beach in such a
storm!I got a tap aft that struck the spot.The tree beside the pig stye was broken in two like a pipe stem.Did it come down on the pig stye?Uncle Cobus,
how do you come to be out, after eight o'clock, in this beastly
weather?The beans and pork gravy he ate----

CLEMENTINE.Beans and pork gravy for a sick old man?The matron broils him a chicken or a beefsteak--Eh?She's
even cross because she's got to beat an egg for his breakfast.This
afternoon he was delirious, talking of setting out the nets, and paying
out the buoy line.I sez to the matron, "His time's come.""Look out or
yours'll come," sez she.I sez, "The doctor should be sent for.""Mind
your own business," sez she, "am I the Matron or are you?"Then I
sez, "You're the matron."Just now, she sez,
"You'd better go for the doctor."As if it couldn't a been done this
afternoon.I go to the doctor and the doctor's out of town.Now I've
been to Simon to take me to town in his dog car.If drunken Simon drives, you're likely to roll off
the <DW18>.Must the doctor ride in the dog
car?Go on, now, tell us the rest.What I want to say is, that it's a blessing for Daantje he's
out of his head, 'fraid as he's always been of death.That's all in the way you look at it.If my time
should come tomorrow, then, I think, we must all!The waters of the sea
will not wash away that fact.On the fifth
day He created the Sea, great whales and the moving creatures that
abound therein, and said: "Be fruitful," and He blessed them.That
was evening and that was morning, that was the fifth day.And on the
sixth day He created man and said also: "Be fruitful," and blessed
them.That was again evening and again morning, that was the sixth
day.When I was on the herring
catch, or on the salting voyage, there were times when I didn't dare
use the cleaning knife.Because when you shove a herring's head
to the left with your thumb, and you lift out the gullet with the
blade, the creature looks at you with such knowing eyes, and yet
you clean two hundred in an hour.And when you cut throats out of
fourteen hundred cod, that makes twenty-eight hundred eyes that look
at you!I had few
equals in boning and cutting livers.Tja, tja, and how afraid they all
were!They looked up at the clouds as if they were saying:
"How about this now.I say:
we take the fish and God takes us.We must all, the beasts must,
and the men must, and because we all must, none of us should--now,
that's just as if you'd pour a full barrel into an empty one.I'd
be afraid to be left alone in the empty barrel, with every one else
in the other barrel.No, being afraid is no good; being afraid is
standing on your toes and looking over the edge.You act as if you'd had
a dram.Am I right about the pig
stye or not?Hear how the poor animal is going on out there.I'm sure
the wall has fallen in.You pour yourself out a bowl, Uncle Cobus!I'll give her a
helping hand.Cobus, I'll thank God when the Good Hope is safely in.But the Hope is an old ship,
and old ships are the last to go down.No, that's what every old sailor says.All the same, I shall pray
God tonight.But the Jacoba is out and the
Mathilda is out and the Expectation is out.The Good Hope is rotten--so--so----[Stops anxiously.]That's what----Why--that's what----I thought----It just
occurred to me.If the Good Hope was rotten, then your father would----

CLEMENTINE.Oh, shut your fool mouth, you'll make Kneir anxious.Quick,
Kneir, shut the door, for the lamp.How scared Barend will be, and just as
they're homeward bound.The evening is still so long and
so gloomy--Yes?[Enter Simon and Marietje, who is crying.]Stop your damn
howling----

KNEIRTJE.Her lover is also--be a good seaman's
wife.You girls haven't had any trouble
yet!If it wasn't for Daan----

JO.Here, this will warm you up, Simon.It's happened to me before
with the dog car, in a tempest like this.And when the
doctor came, Katrien was dead and the child was dead, but if you ask
me, I'd rather sit in my dog car tonight than to be on the sea.No, don't let us waste our time.Let's talk, then we won't
think of anything.Last night was stormy, too, and I had such a bad dream.I can't rightly say it was a dream.There was a rap on the
window, once.Soon as I lay down there came another rap, so.[Raps on
the table with her knuckles.]And then I saw Mees, his face was pale,
pale as--God!Each time--like that, so----[Raps.]You stupid, you, to scare the old woman into a fit with your
raps.My ears and neck full of sand, and it's
cold.Just throw a couple of blocks on the fire.I couldn't stand it at home either, children asleep, no one
to talk to, and the howling of the wind.Two mooring posts were
washed away.What's that to us----Milk and sugar?Your little son was a brave boy, Truus.I can see him
now as he stood waving good-bye.Yes, that boy's a treasure, barely twelve.You
should have seen him two and a half months ago.The child behaved like an angel, just like a grown
man.He would sit up evenings to chat with me, the child knows more
than I do.The lamb, hope he's not been awfully sea sick.Now, you may not believe it, but red spectacles
keep you from being sea sick.You're like the doctors, they let others swallow their doses.Many's the night I've slept on board; when my husband was
alive I went along on many a voyage.Should like to have seen you in oil skins.Hear, now, the young lady is flattering me.I'm not so bad
looking as that, Miss.Now and then, when things
didn't go to suit him, without speaking ill of the dead, I may say,
he couldn't keep his paws at home; then he'd smash things.I still
have a coffee pot without a handle I keep as a remembrance.--I wouldn't
part with it for a rix dollar.I won't even offer you a guilder!Say, you're such a funny story teller, tell us about the Harlemmer
oil, Saart.Yes, if it hadn't been for Harlemmer oil I might not have been
a widow.Now, then, my man was a comical chap.I'd bought him a knife in a leather sheath, paid a good price
for it too, and when he'd come back in five weeks and I'd ask him:
"Jacob, have you lost your knife?"he'd say, "I don't know about my
knife--you never gave me a knife."But
when he'd undress himself for the first time in five weeks, and pulled
off his rubber boots, bang, the knife would fall on the floor.He
hadn't felt it in all that time.Didn't take off his rubber boots in five weeks?Then I had to scrub 'im with soap and soda; he hadn't seen
water, and covered with vermin.Wish I could get a cent a dozen for all the lice on board;
they get them thrown in with their share of the cargo.Now
then, his last voyage a sheet of water threw him against the bulwarks
just as they pulled the mizzen staysail to larboard, and his leg was
broke.Then they were in a fix--The skipper could poultice and cut a
corn, but he couldn't mend a broken leg.Then they wanted to shove a
plank under it, but Jacob wanted Harlemmer oil rubbed on his leg.Every
day he had them rub it with Harlemmer oil, and again Harlemmer oil,
and some more Harlemmer oil.When they came in
his leg was a sight.You shouldn't have asked me to tell it.Now, yes; you can't bring the dead back to life.And when you
think of it, it's a dirty shame I can't marry again.A year later
the Changeable went down with man and mouse.Then, bless me, you'd
suppose, as your husband was dead, for he'd gone along with his leg
and a half, you could marry another man.First you must
advertise for him in the newspapers three times, and then if in three
times he don't turn up, you may go and get a new license.I don't think I'll ever marry again.That's not surprisin' when you've been married twice already;
if you don't know the men by this time.I wish I could talk about things the way you do.With my first it was a horror; with my second you know
yourselves.I could sit up all night hearing tales of
the sea.Don't tell stories of suffering and death----

SAART.[Quietly knitting and speaking in a toneless voice.]Ach,
it couldn't have happened here, Kneir.We lived in Vlaardingen then,
and I'd been married a year without any children.No, Pietje was Ari's
child--and he went away on the Magnet.And you understand what happened;
else I wouldn't have got acquainted with Ari and be living next door
to you now.The Magnet stayed on the sands or some other place.But
I didn't know that then, and so didn't think of it.Now in Vlaardingen they have a tower and on the tower a lookout.And this lookout hoists a red ball when he sees a lugger or
a trawler or other boat in the distance.And when he sees who it
is, he lets down the ball, runs to the ship owner and the families
to warn them; that's to say: the Albert Koster or the Good Hope is
coming.Now mostly he's no need to warn the family.For, as soon as
the ball is hoisted in the tower, the children run in the streets
shouting, I did it, too, as a child: "The ball is up!Then the women run, and wait below for the lookout to come down,
and when it's their ship they give him pennies.And--and--the Magnet with my first
husband, didn't I say I'd been married a year?The Magnet stayed out
seven weeks--with provisions for six--and each time the children
shouted: "The ball is up, Truus!Then I
ran like mad to the tower.They all knew why
I ran, and when the lookout came down I could have torn the words
out of his mouth.But I would say: "Have you tidings--tidings of
the Magnet?"Then he'd say: "No, it's the Maria," or the Alert,
or the Concordia, and then I'd drag myself away slowly, so slowly,
crying and thinking of my husband.And each day, when
the children shouted, I got a shock through my brain, and each day I
stood by the tower, praying that God--but the Magnet did not come--did
not come.At the last I didn't dare to go to the tower any more when
the ball was hoisted.No longer dared to stand at the door waiting,
if perhaps the lookout himself would bring the message.That lasted
two months--two months--and then--well, then I believed it.Now, that's so short a time since.Ach, child, I'd love to talk about it to every
one, all day long.When you've been left with six children--a good
man--never gave me a harsh word--never.Had it happened six
days later they would have brought him in.They smell when there's
a corpse aboard.Yes, that's true, you never see them otherwise.You'll never marry a fisherman, Miss; but it's sad,
sad; God, so sad!when they lash your dear one to a plank, wrapped in
a piece of sail with a stone in it, three times around the big mast,
and then, one, two, three, in God's name.No, I wasn't thinking of Mees, I was thinking of my little
brother, who was also drowned.Wasn't that on the herring catch?His second voyage, a blow
from the fore sail, and he lay overboard.The
skipper reached him the herring shovel, but it was smooth and it
slipped from his hands.Then Jerusalem, the mate, held out the broom
to him--again he grabbed hold.The three of them pulled him up; then
the broom gave way, he fell back into the waves, and for the third
time the skipper threw him a line.God wanted my little brother, the
line broke, and the end went down with him to the bottom of the sea.frightful!--Grabbed it three times, and lost
it three times.As if the child knew what was coming in the morning, he had
lain crying all night.Crying for Mother, who was
sick.When the skipper tried to console him, he said: "No, skipper,
even if Mother does get well, I eat my last herring today."No, truly, Miss, when he came back from Pieterse's with the
money, Toontje's share of the cargo as rope caster, eighteen guilders
and thirty-five cents for five and a half weeks.Then he simply acted
insane, he threw the money on the ground, then he cursed at--I won't
repeat what--at everything.Mother's sickness and burial
had cost a lot.Eighteen guilders is a heap of money, a big heap.Eighteen guilders for your child, eighteen--[Listening in alarm
to the blasts of the wind.]No, say, Hahaha!----

KNEIRTJE.Yes, yes, if the water could
only speak.Come now, you tell a tale of the sea.Ach, Miss, life on the sea is no tale.Nothing
between yourself and eternity but the thickness of a one-inch
plank.It's hard on the men, and hard on the women.Yesterday I passed
by the garden of the Burgomaster.They sat at table and ate cod from
which the steam was rising, and the children sat with folded hands
saying grace.Then, thought I, in my ignorance--if it was wrong, may
God forgive me--that it wasn't right of the Burgomaster--not right
of him--and not right of the others.For the wind blew so hard out
of the East, and those fish came out of the same water in which our
dead--how shall I say it?--in which our dead--you understand me.It is our living,
and we must not rebel against our living.When the lead was dropped he could tell by the taste of the
sand where they were.Often in the night he'd say we are on the 56th
and on the 56th they'd be.Once
he drifted about two days and nights in a boat with two others.That
was the time they were taking in the net and a fog came up so thick
they couldn't see the buoys, let alone find the lugger.Later when the boat went to pieces--you should
have heard him tell it--how he and old Dirk swam to an overturned
rowboat; he climbed on top."I'll never forget that night," said
he.Dirk was too old or tired to get a hold.Then my husband stuck
his knife into the boat.Dirk tried to grasp it as he was sinking,
and he clutched in such a way that three of his fingers hung
down.Then at the risk of his own life,
my husband pulled Dirk up onto the overturned boat.So the two of
them drifted in the night, and Dirk--old Dirk--from loss of blood
or from fear, went insane.He sat and glared at my husband with the
eyes of a cat.He raved of the devil that was in him.Of Satan, and
the blood, my husband said, ran all over the boat--the waves were
kept busy washing it away.Just at dawn Dirk slipped off, insane
as he was.My man was picked up by a freighter that sailed by.But
it was no use, three years later--that's twelve years ago now--the
Clementine--named after you by your father--stranded on the Doggerbanks
with him and my two oldest.Of what happened to them, I know nothing,
nothing at all.Never a buoy, or a hatch, washed ashore.You can't realize it at first, but after so many years one
can't recall their faces any more, and that's a blessing.For hard it
would be if one remembered.Every sailor's
wife has something like this in her family, it's not new.Truus is
right: "The fish are dearly paid for."We are all in God's hands, and God is great and good.[Beating her
head with her fists.]You're all driving me mad, mad, mad!Her husband and her little brother--and my poor
uncle--those horrible stories--instead of cheering us up!My father was drowned, drowned, drowned,
drowned!There are others--all--drowned, drowned!--and--you are all
miserable wretches--you are![Violently bangs the door shut as she
runs out.]No, child, she will quiet down by herself.Nervous strain
of the last two days.It has grown late, Kneir, and your niece--your niece was a
little unmannerly.Thank you again, Miss, for the soup and eggs.Are you coming to drink a bowl with me tomorrow night?If you see Jo send her in at once.[All go out except
Kneirtje.A fierce wind howls, shrieking
about the house.She listens anxiously at the window, shoves her
chair close to the chimney, stares into the fire.Her lips move in
a muttered prayer while she fingers a rosary.Jo enters, drops into
a chair by the window and nervously unpins her shawl.]And that dear child that came out in the storm to bring me
soup and eggs.Your sons are out in the storm for her and her father.Half the guard
rail is washed away, the pier is under water.You never went on like this
when Geert sailed with the Navy.In a month or two
it will storm again; each time again.And there are many fishermen on
the sea besides our boys.[Her speech sinks into a soft murmur.Her
old fingers handle the rosary.]Barend, we almost drove him away![Seeing that Kneirtje prays, she walks to the window wringing
her hands, pulls up the curtain uncertainly, stares through the window
panes.The wind blows the
curtain on high, the lamp dances, the light puffs out.oh!----

KNEIRTJE.[Jo
lights the lamp, shivering with fear.][To Jo,
who crouches sobbing by the chimney.]If anything happens--then--then----

KNEIRTJE.Now, I ask you, how will it be when you're married?You don't know
what you say, Aunt Kneir!If Geert--[Stops, panting.]That was not
good of you--not good--to have secrets.Your lover--your husband--is
my son.Don't stare that way into the
fire.Even if
it was wrong of you and of him.Come and sit opposite to me, then
together we will--[Lays her prayerbook on the table.]If anything happens----

KNEIRTJE.If anything--anything--anything--then I'll never pray
again, never again.No Mother Mary--then there
is nothing--nothing----

KNEIRTJE.[Opens the prayerbook, touches Jo's arm.Jo looks up, sobbing
passionately, sees the prayerbook, shakes her head fiercely.Again
wailing, drops to the floor, which she beats with her hands.Kneirtje's
trembling voice sounds.][The wind races with wild lashings about the house.]Left, office door, separated from the
main office by a wooden railing.Between this door and railing are
two benches; an old cupboard.In the background; three windows with
view of the sunlit sea.In front of the middle window a standing
desk and high stool.Right, writing table with telephone--a safe,
an inside door.On the walls, notices of wreckage, insurance, maps,
etc.[Kaps, Bos and Mathilde discovered.]Clemens!----

KAPS.: 2,447 ribs, marked Kusta; ten sail sheets, marked 'M."Four deck beams, two spars, five"----

MATHILDE.I have written the circular for the tower
bell.Connect me with the
Burgomaster!Up to my ears
in--[Sweetly.]My little wife asks----

MATHILDE.If Mevrouw will come to the telephone about the circular.If Mevrouw
will come to the telephone a moment?Just so, Burgomaster,--the
ladies--hahaha!Then it can go to the
printers.Do you think I
haven't anything on my mind!That damned----

MATHILDE.No,
she can't come to the telephone herself, she doesn't know
how.My wife has written the circular for
the tower bell."You are no doubt acquainted with the new church."--She
says, "No," the stupid!I am reading, Mevrouw, again."You are no
doubt acquainted with the new church.The church has, as you know,
a high tower; that high tower points upward, and that is good, that is
fortunate, and truly necessary for many children of our generation"----

MATHILDE.Pardon, I was speaking to
my bookkeeper.Yes--yes--ha, ha, ha--[Reads again
from paper.]"But that tower could do something else that also is
good.It can mark the time for us children of the
times.It stands there since 1882 and has never
answered to the question, 'What time is it?'It
was indeed built for it, there are four places visible for faces;
for years in all sorts of ways"--Did you say anything?No?--"for years
the wish has been expressed by the surrounding inhabitants that they
might have a clock--About three hundred guilders are needed.The Committee, Mevrouw"--What did you say?Yes, you know the
names, of course.Yes--Yes--All the ladies of
the Committee naturally sign for the same amount, a hundred guilders
each?Yes--Yes--Very well--My wife will be at home, Mevrouw.Damned nonsense!--a hundred guilders gone to the devil!What
is it to you if there's a clock on the damn thing or not?I'll let you fry in your own fat.She'll be here in her carriage in quarter of an hour.If you drank less grog in the evenings
you wouldn't have such a bad temper in the mornings.You took five guilders out of my purse this morning
while I was asleep.I can keep no----

MATHILDE.Bah, what a man, who counts his money before he goes to bed!Very well, don't give it--Then I can treat the Burgomaster's
wife to a glass of gin presently--three jugs of old gin and not a
single bottle of port or sherry![Bos angrily throws down two rix
dollars.]If it wasn't for me you wouldn't
be throwing rix dollars around!--Bah!IJmuiden, 24 December--Today there were four sloops
in the market with 500 to 800 live and 1,500 to 2,100 dead haddock
and some--live cod--The live cod brought 7 1/4--the dead----

BOS.The dead haddock brought thirteen and a half guilders a basket.Take
your book--turn to the credit page of the Expectation----

KAPS.no--the Good Hope?--We can whistle for her.Fourteen hundred and forty-three guilders and forty-seven cents.How could you be so ungodly stupid, to deduct four
guilders, 88, for the widows and orphans' fund?--1,443--3 per cent off--that's
1,400--that's gross three hundred and 87 guilders--yes, it should be
three guilders, 88, instead of four, 88.If you're going into your dotage, Jackass!There might be something to say against
that, Meneer--you didn't go after me when, when----

BOS.Now, that'll do, that'll do!----

KAPS.And that was an error with a couple of big ciphers after it.[Bos
goes off impatiently at right.]It all depends on what side----

[Looks around, sees Bos is gone, pokes up the fire; fills his pipe from
Bos's tobacco jar, carefully steals a couple of cigars from his box.]Mynheer Bos, eh?--no.Meneer said
that when he got news, he----

SIMON.The Jacoba came in after fifty-nine days' lost time.You are--You know more than you let on.Then it's time--I know more, eh?I'm holding off the ships by
ropes, eh?I warned you folks when that ship lay in the docks.What were
the words I spoke then, eh?All tales on your part for a glass
of gin!You was there, and the Miss was there.I says,
"The ship is rotten, that caulking was damn useless.That a floating
coffin like that"----

KAPS.Are
you so clever that when you're half drunk----

SIMON.Not drunk then, are you such an authority, you a shipmaster's
assistant, that when you say "no," and the owner and the Insurance
Company say "yes," my employer must put his ship in the dry docks?And now, I say--now, I say--that
if Mees, my daughter's betrothed, not to speak of the others, if
Mees--there will be murder.I'll be back in ten
minutes.[Goes back to his desk; the telephone rings.Mynheer
will be back in ten minutes.Mynheer Bos just went round the
corner.How lucky that outside of the children there were three
unmarried men on board.Or you'll break Meneer's
cigars.Kaps, do you want to make a guilder?I'm engaged to Bol, the skipper.He's lying here, with a load of peat for the city.I can't; because they don't know if my husband's dead.The legal limit is----

SAART.You must summons him, 'pro Deo,' three times in the papers and
if he doesn't come then, and that he'll not do, for there aren't any
more ghosts in the world, then you can----

SAART.Now, if you'd attend to this little matter, Bol and I would
always be grateful to you.When your common sense tells you
I haven't seen Jacob in three years and the----

[Cobus enters, trembling with agitation.]There must be tidings of the boys--of--of--the
Hope.Now, there is no use in your coming
to this office day after day.I haven't any good news to give you,
the bad you already know.Sixty-two days----

COB.Ach, ach, ach; Meneer Kaps,
help us out of this uncertainty.My sister--and my niece--are simply
insane with grief.My niece is sitting alone at home--my sister is at the Priest's,
cleaning house.There must be something--there must be something.The water bailiff's clerk said--said--Ach, dear God----[Off.]after that storm--all things
are possible.No, I wouldn't give a cent for it.If they had run into an English harbor, we would have
had tidings.[Laying her sketch book on Kaps's desk.]That's the way he was three months ago,
hale and jolly.No, Miss, I haven't the time.Daantje's death was a blow to him--you always saw them together,
always discussing.Now he hasn't a friend in the "Home"; that makes
a big difference.Well, that's Kneir, that's Barend with the basket on his back,
and that's--[The telephone bell rings.How long
will he be, Kaps?A hatch marked
47--and--[Trembling.][Screams and lets the
receiver fall.]I don't dare listen--Oh, oh!Barend?----Barend?----

CLEMENTINE.A telegram from Nieuwediep.A hatch--and a corpse----

[Enter Bos.]The water bailiff is on the 'phone.The water bailiff?--Step aside--Go along, you!I--I--[Goes timidly off.]A
telegram from Nieuwediep?47?--Well,
that's damned--miserable--that!the corpse--advanced stage of
decomposition!Barend--mustered in as oldest boy!by--oh!--The Expectation has come into Nieuwediep disabled?And
did Skipper Maatsuiker recognize him?So it isn't necessary to send any
one from here for the identification?Yes, damned sad--yes--yes--we
are in God's hand--Yes--yes--I no longer had any doubts--thank
you--yes--I'd like to get the official report as soon as possible.I
will inform the underwriters, bejour!I
never expected to hear of the ship again.Yes--yes--yes--yes--[To Clementine.]What stupidity to repeat what you heard in that woman's
presence.It won't be five minutes now till half the village is
here!You sit there, God save me, and take
on as if your lover was aboard----

CLEMENTINE.When Simon, the shipbuilder's assistant----

BOS.And if he hadn't been, what right have you to stick
your nose into matters you don't understand?Dear God, now I am also guilty----

BOS.Have the novels you read gone to
your head?Are you possessed, to use those words after such
an accident?He said that the ship was a floating coffin.Then I heard
you say that in any case it would be the last voyage for the Hope.That damned boarding school; those damned
boarding school fads!Walk if you like through the village like a fool,
sketching the first rascal or beggar you meet!But don't blab out
things you can be held to account for.Say, rather,
a drunken authority--The North, of Pieterse, and the Surprise and the
Willem III and the Young John.Half of the
fishing fleet and half the merchant fleet are floating coffins.No, Meneer, I don't hear anything.If you had asked me: "Father, how is this?"But you conceited young people meddle with everything and
more, too!What stronger proof is there than the yearly inspection of
the ships by the underwriters?Do you suppose that when I presently
ring up the underwriter and say to him, "Meneer, you can plank down
fourteen hundred guilders"--that he does that on loose grounds?You
ought to have a face as red as a buoy in shame for the way you flapped
out your nonsense!Nonsense; that might take away
my good name, if I wasn't so well known.If I were a ship owner--and I heard----

BOS.God preserve the fishery from an owner who makes drawings and
cries over pretty vases!I stand as a father at the head of a hundred
homes.When you get sensitive you go head over
heels.[Kaps makes a motion that he cannot hear.]The Burgomaster's wife is making a call.Willem Hengst, aged
thirty-seven, married, four children----

BOS.Wait a moment till my daughter----

CLEMENTINE.Jacob Zwart, aged thirty-five years, married,
three children.Gerrit Plas, aged twenty-five years, married, one
child.Geert Vermeer, unmarried, aged twenty-six years.Nellis Boom,
aged thirty-five years, married, seven children.Klaas Steen, aged
twenty-four years, married.Solomon Bergen, aged twenty-five years,
married, one child.Mari Stad, aged forty-five years, married.Barend Vermeer,
aged nineteen years.Pietje Stappers, aged twelve years.Ach, God; don't make me unhappy, Meneer!----

BOS.Stappers----

MARIETJE.You lie!--It isn't
possible!----

BOS.The Burgomaster at Nieuwediep has telegraphed the water
bailiff.Barend Vermeer was washed ashore.You know what that means,
and a hatch of the 47----

TRUUS.Oh, Mother Mary, must I lose that child, too?Oh,
oh, oh, oh!--Pietje--Pietje----

MARIETJE.Then--Then--[Bursts into a hysterical
laugh.]Hahaha!--Hahaha!----

BOS.[Striking the glass from Clementine's hand.][Falling on her knees, her hands catching hold of the railing
gate.]Let me die!--Let me die, please, dear God, dear God!Come Marietje, be calm; get up.And so brave; as he stood there, waving,
when the ship--[Sobs loudly.]There hasn't
been a storm like that in years.Think of Hengst with four children,
and Jacob and Gerrit--And, although it's no consolation, I will hand
you your boy's wages today, if you like.Both of you go home now and
resign yourselves to the inevitable--take her with you--she seems----

MARIETJE.I want to
die, die----

CLEMENTINE.Cry, Marietje, cry, poor lamb----

[They go off.]Are
you too lazy to put pen to paper today?Have you
the Widows' and Orphans' fund at hand?[Bos
throws him the keys.][Opens the safe, shuffles back
to Bos's desk with the book.]Ninety-five widows, fourteen old sailors and fishermen.Yes, the fund fell short some time ago.We will have to put in
another appeal.The Burgomaster's
wife asks if you will come in for a moment.Kaps, here is the copy for the circular.Talk to her about making a public appeal for the unfortunates.Yes, but, Clemens, isn't that overdoing it, two begging
parties?I will do it myself, then--[Both exit.][Goes to his desk
and sits down opposite to him.]I feel so miserable----

KAPS.The statement of
Veritas for October--October alone; lost, 105 sailing vessels and
30 steamships--that's a low estimate; fifteen hundred dead in one
month.Yes, when you see it as it appears
today, so smooth, with the floating gulls, you wouldn't believe that
it murders so many people.[To Jo and Cobus, who sit alone in a dazed way.]We have just run from home--for Saart just as I
said--just as I said----

[Enter Bos.]You stay
where you are, Cobus.You have no doubt heard?----

JO.It happens so often that
they get off in row boats.Not only was there a hatch,
but the corpse was in an extreme state of dissolution.Skipper Maatsuiker of the Expectation identified him, and the
earrings.And if--he should be mistaken----I've
come to ask you for money, Meneer, so I can go to the Helder myself.The Burgomaster of Nieuwediep will take care of that----

[Enter Simon.]I--I--heard----[Makes a strong gesture towards Bos.]I--I--have no evil
intentions----

BOS.Must that drunken
fellow----

SIMON.[Steadying himself by holding to the gate.]No--stay where
you are--I'm going--I--I--only wanted to say how nicely it came
out--with--with--The Good Hope.Don't come so close to me--never come so close to a man with
a knife----No-o-o-o--I have no bad intentions.I only wanted to say,
that I warned you--when--she lay in the docks.Now just for the joke of it--you ask--ask--ask your bookkeeper
and your daughter--who were there----

BOS.You're not worth an answer, you sot!My employer--doesn't do the caulking himself.[To Kaps, who
has advanced to the gate.]Didn't I warn him?--wasn't you there?No, I wasn't there, and even if I
was, I didn't hear anything.Did that drunken sot----

CLEMENTINE.As my daughter do you permit----[Grimly.]I don't remember----

SIMON.That's low--that's low--damned low!I said, the ship was
rotten--rotten----

BOS.You're trying to drag in my bookkeeper
and daughter, and you hear----

COB.Yes, but--yes, but--now I remember also----

BOS.But your daughter--your daughter
says now that she hadn't heard the ship was rotten.And on the second
night of the storm, when she was alone with me at my sister Kneirtje's,
she did say that--that----

CLEMENTINE.Did I--say----

COB.These are my own words
to you: "Now you are fibbing, Miss; for if your father knew the Good
Hope was rotten"----

JO.[Springing up wildly, speaking with piercing distinctness.]I
was there, and Truus was there, and----Oh, you adders!Who
gives you your feed, year in, year out?Haven't you decency enough to
believe us instead of that drunken beggar who reels as he stands there?You had Barend dragged on board by the police; Geert was too
proud to be taken!No,
no, you needn't point to your door!If I staid here
any longer I would spit in your face--spit in your face!For your Aunt's sake I will consider that you
are overwrought; otherwise--otherwise----The Good Hope was seaworthy,
was seaworthy!And even
had the fellow warned me--which is a lie, could I, a business man,
take the word of a drunkard who can no longer get a job because he
is unable to handle tools?I--I told you and him and her--that a floating
coffin like that.Geert and Barend and Mees and the
others![Sinks on the chair
sobbing.]Give me the money to go to Nieuwediep myself, then I won't
speak of it any more.A girl that talks to me as
rudely as you did----

JO.I don't know what I said--and--and--I don't
believe that you--that you--that you would be worse than the devil.The water-bailiff says that it isn't necessary to send any one
to Nieuwediep.What will
become of me now?----

[Cobus and Simon follow her out.]And you--don't you ever dare to set foot again
in my office.Father, I ask myself [Bursts into sobs.]She would be capable of ruining my good name--with
her boarding-school whims.Who ever comes now you send away,
understand?[Sound of Jelle's fiddle
outside.][Falls into his chair, takes
up Clementine's sketch book; spitefully turns the leaves; throws
it on the floor; stoops, jerks out a couple of leaves, tears them
up.Sits in thought a moment, then rings the telephone.]with
Dirksen--Dirksen, I say, the underwriter![Waits, looking
sombre.]It's all up with the
Good Hope.A hatch with my mark washed ashore and the body of a
sailor.I shall wait for you here at my office.[Rings off;
at the last words Kneirtje has entered.]I----[She sinks on the bench, patiently weeping.]Have you mislaid the
policies?You never put a damn thing in its place.The policies are higher, behind
the stocks.[Turning around
with the policies in his hand.]That hussy that
lives with you has been in here kicking up such a scandal that I came
near telephoning for the police.Is it true--is it true
that----The priest said----[Bos nods with a sombre expression.]Oh,
oh----[She stares helplessly, her arms hang limp.]I know you as a respectable woman--and
your husband too.I'm sorry to have to say it to you
now after such a blow, your children and that niece of yours have never
been any good.[Kneirtje's head sinks down.]How many years haven't
we had you around, until your son Geert threatened me with his fists,
mocked my grey hairs, and all but threw me out of your house--and your
other son----[Frightened.]Shall I call Mevrouw or your daughter?with long drawn out sobs,
sits looking before her with a dazed stare.][In an agonized voice, broken with sobs.]And with my own hands I loosened his
fingers from the door post.You have no cause to reproach yourself----

KNEIRTJE.Before he went I hung his
father's rings in his ears.Like--like a lamb to the slaughter----

BOS.Come----

KNEIRTJE.And my oldest boy that I didn't bid good
bye----"If you're too late"--these were his words--"I'll never look
at you again."in God's name, stop!----

KNEIRTJE.Twelve years ago--when the Clementine--I sat here as I am
now.[Sobs with her face between her trembling old hands.]Ach, poor, dear Kneir, I am so sorry for you.My husband and four sons----

MATHILDE.We have written an
appeal, the Burgomaster's wife and I, and it's going to be in all
the papers tomorrow.Here, Kaps----[Hands Kaps a sheet of paper which
he places on desk--Bos motions to her to go.]Let her wait a while,
Clemens.I have a couple of cold chops--that will brace
her up--and--and--let's make up with her.You have no objections
to her coming again to do the cleaning?We won't forget you, do you
hear?Now, my only hope is--my niece's child.She is with child by my
son----[Softly smiling.]No, that isn't a misfortune
now----

BOS.This immorality under your own
roof?Don't you know the rules of the fund, that no aid can be
extended to anyone leading an immoral life, or whose conduct does
not meet with our approval?I leave it to the gentlemen
themselves--to do for me--the gentlemen----

BOS.It will be a tussle with the Committee--the committee of the
fund--your son had been in prison and sang revolutionary songs.And
your niece who----However, I will do my best.I shall recommend
you, but I can't promise anything.There are seven new families,
awaiting aid, sixteen new orphans.My wife wants to give you something to take home
with you.[The bookkeeper rises, disappears
for a moment, and returns with a dish and an enamelled pan.]If you will return the dish when it's convenient,
and if you'll come again Saturday, to do the cleaning.He closes her nerveless hands about the dish and pan;
shuffles back to his stool.Kneirtje sits motionless,
in dazed agony; mumbles--moves her lips--rises with difficulty,
stumbles out of the office.]Appeal, for the
newspapers![Smiling sardonically, he comes to the foreground; leaning
on Bos's desk, he reads.]"Benevolent Fellow Countrymen: Again we
urge upon your generosity an appeal in behalf of a number of destitute
widows and orphans.The lugger Good Hope----[As he continues reading.]End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Good Hope, by Herman Heijermans, Jr.The following sketch concerning one or two of these may tend to show,
that a man does not take leave of all enjoyment, when his ship leaves
the chalky cliffs of old England.Our anchor was dropped outside the bar of Inambane river; the grating
noise of the chain as it rattled through the hawse-hole awoke me, and I
soon after went on deck.It was just six o'clock and a beautiful clear
morning, with the sun rising red and rosy--like a portly gentleman
getting up from his wine--and smiling over the sea in quite a pleasant
sort of way.So, as both Neptune and Sol seemed propitious, the
commander, our second-master, and myself made up our minds to visit the
little town and fort of Inambane, about forty--we thought fifteen--miles
up the river.But breakfast had to be prepared and eaten, the magazine
and arms got into the boat, besides a day's provisions, with rum and
quinine to be stowed away, so that the sun had got a good way up the
sky, and now looked more like a portly gentleman whose dinner had
disagreed, before we had got fairly under way and left the ship's side.Never was forenoon brighter or fairer, only one or two snowy banks of
cloud interrupting the blue of the sky, while the river, miles broad,
stole silently seaward, unruffled by wave or wavelet, so that the hearts
of both men and officers were light as the air they breathed was pure.The men, bending cheerfully on their oars, sang snatches of Dibdin--
Neptune's poet laureate; and we, tired of talking, reclined astern,
gazing with half-shut eyes on the round undulating hills, that, covered
with low mangrove-trees and large exotics, formed the banks of the
river.We passed numerous small wooded islands and elevated sandbanks,
on the edges of which whole regiments of long-legged birds waded about
in search of food, or, starting at our approach, flew over our heads in
Indian file, their bright scarlet-and-white plumage showing prettily
against the blue of the sky.Shoals of turtle floated past, and
hundreds of rainbow- jelly-fishes, while, farther off, many
large black bodies--the backs of hippopotami--moved on the surface of
the water, or anon disappeared with a sullen plash.Saving these sounds
and the dip of our own oars, all was still, the silence of the desert
reigned around us, the quiet of a newly created world.The forenoon wore away, the river got narrower, but, though we could see
a distance of ten miles before us, neither life nor sign of life could
be perceived.At one o'clock we landed among a few cocoa-nut trees to
eat our meagre dinner, a little salt pork, raw, and a bit of biscuit.No sooner had we "shoved off" again than the sky became overcast; we
were caught in, and had to pull against, a blinding white-squall that
would have laid a line-of-battle on her beam ends.The rain poured down
as if from a water-spout, almost filling the boat and drenching us to
the skin, and, not being able to see a yard ahead, our boat ran aground
and stuck fast.It took us a good hour after the squall was over to
drag her into deep water; nor were our misfortunes then at an end, for
squall succeeded squall, and, having a journey of uncertain length still
before us, we began to feel very miserable indeed.It was long after four o'clock when, tired, wet, and hungry, we hailed
with joy a large white house on a wooded promontory; it was the
Governor's castle, and soon after we came in sight of the town itself.Situated so far in the interior of Africa, in a region so wild, few
would have expected to find such a little paradise as we now beheld,--a
colony of industrious Portuguese, a large fort and a company of
soldiers, a governor and consulate, a town of nice little detached
cottages, with rows of cocoa-nut, mango, and orange trees, and in fact
all the necessaries, and luxuries of civilised life.It was, indeed, an
oasis in the desert, and, to us, the most pleasant of pleasant
surprises.Leaving the men for a short time with the boat, we made our way to the
house of the consul, a dapper little gentleman with a pretty wife and
two beautiful daughters--flowers that had hitherto blushed unseen and
wasted their sweetness in the desert air.After making us swallow a glass of brandy
each to keep off fever, he kindly led us to a room, and made us strip
off our wet garments, while a servant brought bundle after bundle of
clothes, and spread them out before us.There were socks and shirts and
slippers galore, with waistcoats, pantaloons, and head-dresses, and
jackets, enough to have dressed an opera troupe.The commander and I
furnished ourselves with a red Turkish fez and dark-grey dressing-gown
each, with cord and tassels to correspond, and, thus, arrayed, we
considered ourselves of no small account.Our kind entertainers were
waiting for us in the next room, where they had, in the mean time, been
preparing for us the most fragrant of brandy punch.By-and-bye two
officers and a tall Parsee dropped in, and for the next hour or so the
conversation was of the most animated and lively description, although a
bystander, had there been one, would not have been much edified, for the
following reason: the younger daughter and myself were flirting in the
ancient Latin language, with an occasional soft word in Spanish; our
commander was talking in bad French to the consul's lady, who was
replying in Portuguese; the second-master was maintaining a smart
discussion in broken Italian with the elder daughter; the Parsee and
officer of the fort chiming in, the former in English, the latter in
Hindostanee; but as no one of the four could have had the slightest idea
of the other's meaning, the amount of information given and received
must have been very small,--in fact, merely nominal.It must not,
however, be supposed that our host or hostesses could speak _no_
English, for the consul himself would frequently, and with a bow that
was inimitable, push the bottle towards the commander, and say, as he
shrugged his shoulders and turned his palms skywards, "Continue you, Sar
Capitan, to wet your whistle;" and, more than once, the fair creature by
my side would raise and did raise the glass to her lips, and say, as her
eyes sought mine, "Good night, Sar Officeer," as if she meant me to be
off to bed without a moment's delay, which I knew she did not.Then,
when I responded to the toast, and complimented her on her knowledge of
the "universal language," she added, with a pretty shake of the head,
"No, Sar Officeer, I no can have speak the mooch Englese."A servant,--
apparently newly out of prison, so closely was his hair cropped,--
interrupted our pleasant confab, and removed the seat of our Babel to
the dining-room, where as nicely-cooked-and-served a dinner as ever
delighted the senses of hungry mortality awaited our attention.No
large clumsy joints, huge misshapen roasts or bulky boils, hampered the
board; but dainty made-dishes, savoury stews, piquant curries, delicate
fricassees whose bouquet tempted even as their taste and flavour
stimulated the appetite, strange little fishes as graceful in shape as
lovely in colour, vegetables that only the rich luxuriance of an African
garden could supply, and numerous other nameless nothings, with
delicious wines and costly liqueurs, neatness, attention, and kindness,
combined to form our repast, and counteract a slight suspicion of
crocodiles' tails and stewed lizard, for where ignorance is bliss a
fellow is surely a fool if he is wise.We spent a most pleasant evening in asking questions, spinning yarns,
singing songs, and making love.The younger daughter--sweet child of
the desert--sang `Amante de alguno;' her sister played a selection from
`La Traviata;' next, the consul's lady favoured us with something
pensive and sad, having reference, I think, to bright eyes, bleeding
hearts, love, and slow death; then, the Parsee chanted a Persian hymn
with an "Allalallala," instead of Fol-di-riddle-ido as a chorus, which
elicited "Fra poco a me" from the Portuguese lieutenant; and this last
caused our commander to seat himself at the piano, turn up the white of
his eyes, and in very lugubrious tones question the probability of
"Gentle Annie's" ever reappearing in any spring-time whatever; then,
amid so much musical sentimentality and woe, it was not likely that I
was to hold my peace, so I lifted up my voice and sang--

  "Cauld kail in Aberdeen,
  An' cas ticks in Strathbogie;
  Ilka chiel maun hae a quean
  Bit leeze me on ma cogie--"

with a pathos that caused the tears to trickle over and adown the nose
of the younger daughter--she was of the gushing temperament--and didn't
leave a dry eye in the room.The song brought down the house--so to
speak--and I was the hero for the rest of the evening.Before parting
for the night we also sang `Auld lang syne,' copies of the words having
been written out and distributed, to prevent mistakes; this was supposed
by our hostess to be the English national anthem.It was with no small amount of regret that we parted from our friends
next day; a fresh breeze carried us down stream, and, except our running
aground once or twice, and being nearly drowned in crossing the bar, we
arrived safely on board our saucy gunboat.------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Afric's sunny fountains" have been engaged for such a length of time in
the poetical employment of "rolling down their golden sands," that a
bank or bar of that same bright material has been formed at the mouth of
every river, which it is very difficult and often dangerous to cross
even in canoes.We had despatched boats before us to take soundings on
the bar of Lamoo, and prepared to follow in the track thus marked out.Now, our little bark, although not warranted, like the Yankee boat, to
float wherever there is a heavy dew, was nevertheless content with a
very modest allowance of the aqueous element; in two and a half fathoms
she was quite at home, and even in two--with the help of a few
breakers--she never failed to bump it over a bar.We approached the bar
of Lamoo, therefore, with a certain degree of confidence till the keel
rasped on the sand; this caused us to turn astern till we rasped again;
then, being neither able to get back nor forward, we stopped ship, put
our fingers in our wise mouths, and tried to consider what next was to
be done.Just then a small canoe was observed coming bobbing over the
big waves that tumbled in on the bar; at one moment it was hidden behind
a breaker, next moment mounting over another, and so, after a little
game at bo-peep, it got alongside, and from it there scrambled on board
a little, little man, answering entirely to Dickens's description of
Quilp.added I, "by all that's small and ugly.""Your sarvant, sar," said Quilp himself.There
certainly was not enough of him to make two.He was rather darker in
skin than the Quilp of Dickens, and his only garment was a coal-sack
without sleeves--no coal-sack _has_ sleeves, however--begirt with a
rope, in which a short knife was stuck; he had, besides, sandals on his
feet, and his temples were begirt with a dirty dishclout by way of
turban, and he repeated, "I am one pilot, sar.""I do it, sar, plenty quick."I do him," cried the little man, as he mounted the
bridge; then cocking his head to one side, and spreading out his arms
like a badly feathered duck, he added, "Suppose I no do him plenty
proper, you catchee me and make shot.""If the vessel strikes, I'll hang you, sir."Quilp grinned--which was his way of smiling."And a half three," sung the man in the chains; then, "And a half four;"
and by-and-bye, "And a half three" again; followed next moment by, "By
the deep three."We were on the dreaded bar; on each
side of us the big waves curled and broke with a sullen boom like
far-off thunder; only, where we were, no waves broke."Mind yourself now," cried the commander to Quilp; to which he in wrath
replied--

"What for you stand there make bobbery?_I_ is de cap'n; suppose you is
fear, go alow, sar."and a large wave broke right aboard of us, almost sweeping us
from the deck, and lifting the ship's head into the sky.Another and
another followed; but amid the wet and the spray, and the roar of the
breakers, firmly stood the little pilot, coolly giving his orders, and
never for an instant taking his eyes from the vessel's jib-boom and the
distant shore, till we were safely through the surf and quietly steaming
up the river.After proceeding some miles, native villages began to appear here and
there on both shores, and the great number of dhows on the river, with
boats and canoes of every description, told us we were nearing a large
town.Two hours afterwards we were anchored under the guns of the
Sultan's palace, which were belching forth fire and smoke in return for
the salute we had fired.We found every creature and thing in Lamoo as
entirely primitive, as absolutely foreign, as if it were a city in some
other planet.The most conspicuous building is the Sultan's lofty fort
and palace, with its spacious steps, its fountains and marble halls.The streets are narrow and confused; the houses built in the Arab
fashion, and in many cases connected by bridges at the top; the
inhabitants about forty thousand, including Arabs, Persians, Hindoos,
Somali Indians, and slaves.The wells, exceedingly deep, are built in
the centre of the street without any protection; and girls, carrying on
their heads calabashes, are continually passing to and from them.Slaves, two and two, bearing their burdens of cowries and ivory on poles
between, and keeping step to an impromptu chant; black girls weaving
mats and grass-cloth; strange-looking tradesmen, with stranger tools, at
every door; rich merchants borne along in gilded palanquins; people
praying on housetops; and the Sultan's ferocious soldiery prowling
about, with swords as tall, and guns nearly twice as tall, as
themselves; a large shark-market; a fine bazaar, with gold-dust, ivory,
and tiger-skins exposed for sale; sprightly horses with gaudy trappings;
solemn-looking camels; dust and stench and a general aroma of savage
life and customs pervading the atmosphere, but law and order
nevertheless.No
spirituous liquor of any sort is sold in the town; the Sultan's soldiers
go about the streets at night, smelling the breath of the suspected, and
the faintest odour of the accursed fire-water dooms the poor mortal to
fifty strokes with a thick bamboo-cane next morning.The sugar-cane
grows wild in the fertile suburbs, amid a perfect forest of fine trees;
farther out in the country the cottager dwells beneath his few cocoa-nut
trees, which supply him with all the necessaries of life.One tree for
each member of his family is enough._He_ builds the house and fences
with its large leaves; his wife prepares meat and drink, cloth and oil,
from the nut; the space between the trees is cultivated for curry, and
the spare nuts are sold to purchase luxuries, and the rent of twelve
trees is only _sixpence_ of our money.no drunkenness,
no debt, no religious strife, but peace and contentment everywhere!Reader, if you are in trouble, or your affairs are going "to pot," or if
you are of opinion that this once favoured land is getting used up, I
sincerely advise you to sell off your goods and be off to Lamoo.Of the "gentlemen of England who live at home at ease," very few can
know how entirely dependent for happiness one is on his neighbours.Man
is out-and-out, or out-and-in, a gregarious animal, else `Robinson
Crusoe' had never been written.Now, I am sure that it is only correct
to state that the majority of combatant [Note 1] officers are, in simple
language, jolly nice fellows, and as a class gentlemen, having, in fact,
that fine sense of honour, that good-heartedness, which loves to do as
it would be done by, which hurteth not the feelings of the humble, which
turneth aside from the worm in its path, and delighteth not in plucking
the wings from the helpless fly.To believe, however, that there are no
exceptions to this rule would be to have faith in the speedy advent of
the millennium, that happy period of lamb-and-lion-ism which we would
all rather see than hear tell of; for human nature is by no means
altered by bathing every morning in salt water, it is the same afloat as
on shore.And there are many officers in the navy, who--"dressed in a
little brief authority," and wearing an additional stripe--love to lord
it over their fellow worms.Nor is this fault altogether absent from
the medical profession itself!It is in small gunboats, commanded perhaps by a lieutenant, and carrying
only an assistant-surgeon, where a young medical officer feels all the
hardships and despotism of the service; for if the lieutenant in command
happens to be at all frog-hearted, he has then a splendid opportunity of
puffing himself up.In a large ship with from twenty to thirty officers in the mess, if you
do not happen to meet with a kindred spirit at one end of the table, you
can shift your chair to the other.But in a gunboat on foreign service,
with merely a clerk, a blatant middy, and a second-master who would fain
be your senior, as your messmates, then, I say, God help you!unless you
have the rare gift of doing anything for a quiet life.It is all
nonsense to say, "Write a letter on service about any grievance;" you
can't write about ten out of a thousand of the petty annoyances which go
to make your life miserable; and if you do, you will be but little
better, if, indeed, your last state be not worse than your first.I have in my mind's eye even now a lieutenant who commanded a gunboat in
which I served as medical officer in charge.This little man was what
is called a sea-lawyer--my naval readers well know what I mean; he knew
all the Admiralty Instructions, was an amateur engineer, only needed the
title of M.D.to make him a doctor, could quibble and quirk, and in fact
could prove by the Queen's Regulations that your soul, to say nothing of
your body, wasn't your own; that _you_ were a slave, and _he_ lord--god
of all he surveyed.he has gone to his account; he
will not require an advocate, he can speak for himself.Not many such
hath the service, I am happy to say.He was continually changing his
poor hard-worked sub-lieutenants, and driving his engineers to drink,
previously to trying them by court-martial.At first he and I got on
very well; apparently he "loved me like a vera brither;" but we did not
continue long "on the same platform," and, from the day we had the first
difference of opinion, he was my foe, and a bitter one too.I assure
you, reader, it gave me a poor idea of the service, for it was my first
year.He was always on the outlook for faults, and his kindest words to
me were "chaffing" me on my accent, or about my country.To be able to
meet him on his own ground I studied the Instructions day and night, and
tried to stick by them.Malingering was common on board; one or two whom I caught I turned to
duty: the men, knowing how matters stood between the commander and me,
refused to work, and so I was had up and bullied on the quarter-deck for
"neglect of duty" in not putting these fellows on the sick-list.After
this I had to put every one that asked on the sick-list."Doctor," he would say to me on reporting the number sick, "this is
_wondrous_ strange--_thirteen_ on the list, out of only ninety men.Why, sir, I've been in line-of-battle ships,--_line-of-battle_ ships,
sir,--where they had not ten sick--_ten sick_, sir."This of course
implied an insult to me, but I was like a sheep before the shearers,
dumb.On Sunday mornings I went with him the round of inspection; the sick who
were able to be out of hammock were drawn up for review: had he been
half as particular with the men under his own charge or with the ship in
general as he was with the few sick, there would have been but little
disease to treat.Instead of questioning _me_ concerning their
treatment, he interrogated the sick themselves, quarrelling with the
medicine given, and pooh-pooh-ing my diagnosis.Those in hammocks, who
most needed gentleness and comfort, he bullied, blamed for being ill,
and rendered generally uneasy.Remonstrance on my part was either taken
no notice of, or instantly checked.If men were reported by me for
being dirty, giving impudence, or disobeying orders, _he_ became their
advocate--an able one too--and _I_ had to retire, sorry I had spoken.But I would not tell the tenth part of what I had to suffer, because
such men as he are the _exception_, and because he is dead.A little
black baboon of a boy who attended on this lieutenant-commanding had one
day incurred his displeasure: "Bo'swain's mate," cried he, "take my boy
forward, hoist him on an ordinary seaman's back, and give him a
rope's-ending; and," turning to me, "Doctor, you'll go and attend my
boy's flogging."With a face like crimson I rushed
below to my cabin, and--how could I help it?--made a baby of myself for
once; all my pent-up feelings found vent in a long fit of crying.True, I might in this case have written a letter to the service about my
treatment; but, as it is not till after twelve months the
assistant-surgeon is confirmed, the commander's word would have been
taken before mine, and I probably dismissed without a court-martial.That probationary year I consider more than a grievance, it is a _cruel
injustice_.There is a regulation--of late more strictly enforced by a
circular--that every medical officer serving on board his own ship shall
have a cabin, and the choice--by rank--of cabin, and he is a fool if he
does not enforce it.But it sometimes happens that a sub-lieutenant
(who has no cabin) is promoted to lieutenant on a foreign station; he
will then rank above the assistant-surgeon, and perhaps, if there is no
spare cabin, the poor doctor will have to give up his, and take to a
sea-chest and hammock, throwing all his curiosities, however valuable,
overboard.It would be the duty of the captain in such a case to build
an additional cabin, and if he did not, or would not, a letter to the
admiral would make him.Does the combatant officer treat the medical officer with respect?Certainly, unless one or other of the two be a snob: in the one case the
respect is not worth having, in the other it can't be expected.In the military branch you shall find many officers belonging to the
best English families: these I need hardly say are for the most part
gentlemen, and gentle men.However, it is allowed in most messes that

  "The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
  A man's man for a' that;"

and I assure the candidate for a commission, that, if he is himself a
gentleman, he will find no want of admirers in the navy.But there are
some young doctors who enter the service, knowing their profession to be
sure, and how to hold a knife and fork--not a carving-fork though--but
knowing little else; yet even these soon settle down, and, if they are
not dismissed by court-martial for knocking some one down at cards, or
on the quarter-deck, turn out good service-officers.Indeed, after all,
I question if it be good to know too much of fine-gentility on entering
the service, for, although the navy officers one meets have much that is
agreeable, honest, and true, there is through it all a vein of what can
only be designated as the coarse.The science of conversation, that
beautiful science that says and lets say, that can listen as well as
speak, is but little studied.Mostly all the talk is "shop," or rather
"ship."There is a want of tone in the discourse, a lack of refinement.The delicious chit-chat on new books, authors, poetry, music, or the
drama, interspersed with anecdote, incident, and adventure, and
enlivened with the laughter-raising pun or happy bon-mot, is, alas!but
too seldom heard: the rough joke, the tales of women, ships, and former
ship-mates, and the old, old, stale "good things,"--these are more
fashionable at our navy mess-board.Those who would object to such
conversation are in the minority, and prefer to let things hang as they
grew.Now, only one thing can ever alter this, and that is a good and
perfect library in every ship, to enable officers, who spend most of
their time out of society, to keep up with the times if possible.But I
fear I am drifting imperceptibly into the subject of navy-reform, which
I prefer leaving to older and wiser heads.Combatant (from combat, a battle), fighting officers,--as if
the medical offices didn't fight likewise.It would be better to take
away the "combat," and leave the "ant"--ant-officers, as they do the
work of the ship.There is one grievance which the medical officers, in common with their
combatant brethren, have to complain of--I refer to _compulsory
shaving_; neither is this by any means so insignificant a matter as it
may seem.It may appear a ridiculous statement, but it is nevertheless
a true one, that this regulation has caused many a young surgeon to
prefer the army to the navy."Mere dandies," the reader may say, "whom
this grievance would affect;" but there is many a good man a dandy, and
no one could surely respect a man who was careless of his personal
appearance, or who would willingly, and without a sigh, disfigure his
face by depriving it of what nature considers both ornate and useful--
ornate, as the ladies and the looking-glass can prove; and useful, as
the blistered chin and upper lip of the shaven sailor, in hot climates,
points out.From the earliest ages the moustache has been worn,--even
the Arabs, who shave the head, leave untouched the upper lip.What
would the pictures of some of the great masters be without it?Didn't
the Roman youths dedicate the first few downy hairs of the coming
moustache to the gods?Does not the moustache give a manly appearance
to the smallest and most effeminate?Does it not even beget a certain
amount of respect for the wearer?What sort of guys would the razor
make of Count Bismark, Dickens, the Sultan of Turkey, or Anthony
Trollope?Were the Emperor Napoleon deprived of his well-waxed
moustache, it might lose him the throne of France.Were Garibaldi to
call on his barber, he might thereafter call in vain for volunteers, and
English ladies would send him no more splints nor sticking-plaster.Shave Tennyson, and you may put him in petticoats as soon as you please.As to the moustache movement in the navy, it is a subject of talk--
admitting of no discussion--in every mess in the service, and thousands
are the advocates in favour of its adoption.Indeed, the arguments in
favour of it are so numerous, that it is a difficult matter to choose
the best, while the reasons against it are few, foolish, and despotic.At the time when the Lords of the Admiralty gave orders that the navy
should keep its upper lip, and three fingers' breadth of its royal chin,
smooth and copper-kettlish, it was neither fashionable nor respectable
to wear the moustache in good society.Those were the days of
cabbage-leaf cheeks, powdered wigs, and long queues; but those times are
past and gone from every corner of England's possessions save the navy.Barberism has been hunted from polite circles, but has taken refuge
under the trident of old Neptune; and, in these days of comparative
peace, more blood in the Royal Navy is drawn by the razor than by the
cutlass.In our little gunboat on the coast of Africa, we, both officers and men,
used, under the rose, to cultivate moustache and whiskers, until we fell
in with the ship of the commodore of the station.Then, when the
commander gave the order, "All hands to shave," never was such a
hurlyburly seen, such racing hither and thither (for not a moment was to
be lost), such sharpening of scissors and furbishing up of rusty razors.On one occasion I remember sending our steward, who was lathering his
face with a blacking-brush, and trying to scrape with a carving-knife,
to borrow the commander's razor; in the mean time the commander had
despatched his soapy-faced servant to beg the loan of mine.Both
stewards met with a clash, nearly running each other through the body
with their shaving gear.I lent the commander a Syme's bistoury, with
which he managed to pluck most of the hairs out by the root, as if he
meant to transplant them again, while I myself shaved with an amputating
knife.The men forward stuck by the scissors; and when the commander,
with bloody chin and watery eyes, asked why they did not shave,--"Why,
sir," replied the bo'swain's mate, "the cockroaches have been and gone
and eaten all our razors, they has, sir."Then, had you seen us reappear on deck after the terrible operation,
with our white shaven lips and shivering chins, and a foolish grin on
every face, you would, but for our uniform, have taken us for tailors on
strike, so unlike were we to the brave-looking, manly dare-devils that
trod the deck only an hour before.And if army officers and men have been graciously permitted to wear the
moustache since the Crimean war, why are not we?But perhaps the navy
took no part in that gallant struggle.But if we _must_ continue to do
penance by shaving, why should it not be the crown of the head, or any
other place, rather than the upper lip, which every one can see?One item of duty there is, which occasionally devolves on the medical
officer, and for the most part goes greatly against the feelings of the
_young_ surgeon; I refer to his compulsory attendance at floggings.It
is only fair to state that the majority of captains and commanders use
the cat as seldom as possible, and that, too, only sparingly.In some
ships, however, flogging is nearly as frequent as prayers of a morning.Again, it is more common on foreign stations than at home, and boys of
the first or second class, marines, and ordinary seamen, are for the
most part the victims.I do not believe I shall ever forget the first exhibition of this sort I
attended on board my own ship; not that the spectacle was in any way
more revolting than scores I have since witnessed, but because the sight
was new to me.I remember it wanted fully twenty minutes of seven in the morning, when
my servant aroused me."A flaying match, you know, sir," said Jones.My heart gave an anxious "thud" against my ribs, as if I myself were to
form the "ram for the sacrifice."I hurried through with my bath, and,
dressing myself as if for a holiday, in cocked hat, sword, and undress
coat, I went on deck.All the
minutiae of the scene I remember as though it were but yesterday,
morning was cool and clear, the hills clad in lilac and green, seabirds
floating high in air, and the waters of the bay reflecting the line of
the sky and the lofty mountain-sides, forming a picture almost dreamlike
in its quietness and serenity.The men were standing about in groups,
dressed in their whitest of pantaloons, bluest of smocks, and neatest of
black silk neckerchiefs.By-and-bye the culprit was led aft by a file
of marines, and I went below with him to make the preliminary
examination, in order to report whether or not he might be fit for the
punishment.He was as good a specimen of the British marine as one could wish to
look upon, hardy, bold, and wiry.His crime had been smuggling spirits
on board."Needn't examine me, Doctor," said he; "I ain't afeard of their four
dozen; they can't hurt me, sir,--leastways my back you know--my breast
though; hum-m!"and he shook his head, rather sadly I thought, as he
bent down his eyes."What," said I, "have you anything the matter with your chest?""Nay, Doctor, nay; its my feelins they'll hurt.I've a little girl at
home that loves me, and--bless you, sir, I won't look her in the face
again no-how."No lack of strength there, no nervousness; the artery
had the firm beat of health, the tendons felt like rods of iron beneath
the finger, and his biceps stood out hard and round as the mainstay of
an old seventy-four.I pitied the brave fellow, and--very wrong of me it was, but I could not
help it--filled out and offered him a large glass of rum.sir," he said, with a wistful eye on the ruby liquid, "don't tempt
me, sir.I can bear the bit o' flaying athout that: I wouldn't have my
messmates smell Dutch courage on my breath, sir; thankee all the same,
Doctor."All hands had already assembled, the men and boys on one side, and the
officers, in cocked hats and swords, on the other.A grating had been
lashed against the bulwark, and another placed on deck beside it.The
culprit's shoulders and back were bared, and a strong belt fastened
around the lower part of the loins for protection; he was then firmly
tied by the hands to the upper, and by the feet to the lower grating; a
little basin of cold water was placed at his feet; and all was now
prepared.The sentence was read, and orders given to proceed with the
punishment.The cat is a terrible instrument of torture; I would not
use it on a bull unless in self-defence: the shaft is about a foot and a
half long, and covered with green or red baize according to taste; the
thongs are nine, about twenty-eight inches in length, of the thickness
of a goose-quill, and with two knots tied on each.Men describe the
first blow as like a shower of molten lead.Combing out the thongs with his five fingers before each blow, firmly
and determinedly was the first dozen delivered by the bo'swain's mate,
and as unflinchingly received.Then, "One dozen, sir, please," he reported, saluting the commander."Continue the punishment," was the calm reply.Another dozen reported; again, the same reply.The flesh, like burning steel, had changed from red to
purple, and blue, and white; and between the third and fourth dozen, the
suffering wretch, pale enough now, and in all probability sick, begged a
comrade to give him a mouthful of water.There was a tear in the eye of
the hardy sailor who obeyed him, whispering as he did so--

"Keep up, Bill; it'll soon be over now.""Five, six," the corporal slowly counted--"seven, eight."It is the
last dozen, and how acute must be the torture!The blood
comes now fast enough, and--yes, gentle reader, I _will_ spare your
feelings.The man was cast loose at last and put on the sick-list; he
had borne his punishment without a groan and without moving a muscle.A
large pet monkey sat crunching nuts in the rigging, and grinning all the
time; I have no doubt _he_ enjoyed the spectacle immensely, _for he was
only an ape_.Tommie G--was a pretty, fair-skinned, blue-eyed boy, some sixteen
summers old.He was one of a class only too common in the service;
having become enamoured of the sea, he had run away from his home and
joined the service; and, poor little man!he found out, when too late,
that the stern realities of a sailor's life did not at all accord with
the golden notions he had formed of it.Being fond of stowing himself
away in corners with a book, instead of keeping his watch, Tommie very
often got into disgrace, spent much of his time at the mast-head, and
had many unpleasant palmar rencounters with the corporal's cane.One
day, his watch being over, he had retired to a corner with his little
"ditty-box."Nobody ever knew one-half of the beloved nicknacks and valued nothings
he kept in that wee box: it was in fact his private cabin, his sanctum
sanctorum, to which he could retreat when anything vexed him; a sort of
portable home, in which he could forget the toils of his weary watch,
the giddy mast-head, or even the corporal's cane.He had extracted, and
was dreamily gazing on, the portrait of a very young lady, when the
corporal came up and rudely seized it, and made a very rough and
inelegant remark concerning the fair virgin."That is my sister," cried Tommie, with tears in his eyes.sneered the corporal; "she is a--" and he added a word
that cannot be named.There was the spirit of young England, however,
in Tommie's breast; and the word had scarcely crossed the corporal's
lips, when those lips, and his nose too, were dyed in the blood the
boy's fist had drawn.For that blow poor Tommie was condemned to
receive four dozen lashes.And the execution of the sentence was
carried out with all the pomp and show usual on such occasions.Arrayed
in cooked-hats, epaulets, and swords, we all assembled to witness that
helpless child in his agony.One would have thought that even the rough
bo'swain's mate would have hesitated to disfigure skin so white and
tender, or that the frightened and imploring glance Tommie cast upward
on the first descending lash would have unnerved his arm.No,
reader; pity there doubtless was among us, but mercy--none.And the poor boy writhed in his agony; his screams and
cries were heartrending; and, God forgive us!we knew not till then he
was an orphan, till we heard him beseech his mother in heaven to look
down on her son, to pity and support him.well, perhaps she did,
for scarcely had the third dozen commenced when Tommie's cries were
hushed, his head drooped on his shoulder like a little dead bird's, and
for a while his sufferings were at an end.I gladly took the
opportunity to report further proceedings as dangerous, and he was
carried away to his hammock.I will not shock the nerves and feelings of the reader by any further
relation of the horrors of flogging, merely adding, that I consider
corporal punishment, as applied to men, _cowardly, cruel_, and debasing
to human nature; and as applied to boys, _brutal_, and sometimes even
_fiendish_.There is only one question I wish to ask of every
true-hearted English lady who may read these lines--Be you sister, wife,
or mother, could you in your heart have respected the commander who,
with folded arms and grim smile, replied to poor Tommie's frantic
appeals for mercy, "Continue the punishment"?The pay of medical officers is by no means high enough to entice young
doctors, who can do anything like well on shore, to enter the service.Ten shillings a day, with an increase of half-a-crown after five years'
service on full pay, is not a great temptation certainly.To be sure
the expenses of living are small, two shillings a day being all that is
paid for messing; this of course not including the wine-bill, the size
of which will depend on the "drouthiness" of the officer who contracts
it.Government provides all mess-traps, except silver forks and spoons.Then there is uniform to keep up, and shore-going clothes to be paid
for, and occasionally a shilling or two for boat-hire.However, with a
moderate wine-bill, the assistant-surgeon may save about four shillings
or more a day.Promotion to the rank of surgeon, unless to some fortunate individuals,
comes but slowly; it may, however, be reckoned on after from eight to
ten years.A few gentlemen out of each "batch" who "pass" into the
service, and who have distinguished themselves at the examination, are
promoted sooner.It seems to be the policy of the present Director-General to deal as
fairly as possible with every assistant-surgeon, after a certain
routine.On first joining he is sent for a short spell--too short,
indeed--to a hospital.He is then appointed to a sea-going ship for a
commission--say three years--on a foreign station.On coming home he is
granted a few months' leave on full pay, and is afterwards appointed to
a harbour-ship for about six months.By the end of this time he is
supposed to have fairly recruited from the fatigues of his commission
abroad; he is accordingly sent out again to some other foreign station
for three or four years.On again returning to his native land, he
might be justified in hoping for a pet appointment, say to a hospital,
the marines, a harbour-ship, or, failing these, to the Channel fleet.On being promoted he is sent off abroad again, and so on; and thus he
spends his useful life, and serves his Queen and country, and earns his
pay, and generally spends that likewise.Pensions are granted to the widows of assistant-surgeons--from forty to
seventy pounds a year, according to circumstances; and if he leaves no
widow, a dependent mother, or even sister, may obtain the pension.But
I fear I must give, to assistant-surgeons about to many, Punch's advice,
and say most emphatically, "Don't;" unless, indeed, the dear creature
has money, and is able to purchase a practice for her darling doctor.With a little increase of pay ungrudgingly given, shorter commissions
abroad, and less of the "bite and buffet" about favours granted, the
navy would be a very good service for the medical officer.However, as it is, to a man who has neither wife nor riches, it is, I
dare say, as good a way of spending life as any other; and I do think
that there are but few old surgeons who, on looking back to the life
they have led in the navy, would not say of that service,--"With all thy
faults I love thee still."Still Jimmy only stared at him and all the while the woman was becoming
more and more emphatic in her declaration that Jimmy knew where her baby
was."Sure, Jimmy," said Alfred, out of all patience with Jimmy's stupidity
and tiring of the strain of the woman's presence.cried the mother, and she towered over Jimmy with a wild light in
her eyes."Take me to him," she demanded; "take me to him."Jimmy rolled his large eyes first toward Aggie, then toward Zoie and at
last toward Alfred."Take her to him, Jimmy," commanded a concert of voices; and pursued by
a bundle of waving colours and a medley of discordant sounds, Jimmy shot
from the room.CHAPTER XXIV

The departure of Jimmy and the crazed mother was the occasion for a
general relaxing among the remaining occupants of the room.Exhausted
by what had passed Zoie had ceased to interest herself in the future.It
was enough for the present that she could sink back upon her pillows and
draw a long breath without an evil face bending over her, and without
the air being rent by screams.As for Aggie, she fell back upon the window seat and closed her eyes.The horrors into which Jimmy might be rushing had not yet presented
themselves to her imagination.Of the three, Alfred was the only one who had apparently received
exhilaration from the encounter.He was strutting about the room with
the babe in his arms, undoubtedly enjoying the sensations of a hero.When he could sufficiently control his feeling of elation, he looked
down at the small person with an air of condescension and again lent
himself to the garbled sort of language with which defenceless infants
are inevitably persecuted."Tink of dat horrid old woman wanting to steal our own little oppsie,
woppsie, toppsie babykins," he said.Then he turned to Zoie with an
air of great decision."That woman ought to be locked up," he declared,
"she's dangerous," and with that he crossed to Aggie and hurriedly
placed the infant in her unsuspecting arms."Here, Aggie," he said, "you
take Alfred and get him into bed."Glad of an excuse to escape to the next room and recover her self
control, Aggie quickly disappeared with the child.For some moments Alfred continued to pace up and down the room; then he
came to a full stop before Zoie."I'll have to have something done to that woman," he declared
emphatically."Jimmy will do enough to her," sighed Zoie, weakly."She's no business to be at large," continued Alfred; then, with a
business-like air, he started toward the telephone.He was now calling into the 'phone, "Give me
information."demanded Zoie, more and more disturbed by
his mysterious manner."One can't be too careful," retorted Alfred in his most paternal
fashion; "there's an awful lot of kidnapping going on these days.""Well, you don't suspect information, do you?"Again Alfred ignored her; he was intent upon things of more importance."Hello," he called into the 'phone, "is this information?"Apparently it
was for he continued, with a satisfied air, "Well, give me the Fullerton
Street Police Station."cried Zoie, sitting up in bed and looking about the room
with a new sense of alarm.shrieked the over-wrought young wife."Now, now, dear, don't get nervous,"
he said, "I am only taking the necessary precautions."And again he
turned to the 'phone.Alarmed by Zoie's summons, Aggie entered the room hastily.She was not
reassured upon hearing Alfred's further conversation at the 'phone."Is this the Fullerton Street Police Station?"echoed Aggie, and her eyes sought Zoie's inquiringly.called Alfred over his shoulder to the excited Aggie, then
he continued into the 'phone.Well, hello, Donneghey, this is your
old friend Hardy, Alfred Hardy at the Sherwood.I've just got back,"
then he broke the happy news to the no doubt appreciative Donneghey.he said, "I'm a happy father."Zoie puckered her small face in disgust.Alfred continued to elucidate joyfully at the 'phone."Doubles," he said, "yes--sure--on the level.""I don't know why you have to tell the whole neighbourhood," snapped
Zoie.But Alfred was now in the full glow of his genial account to his friend.he repeated in answer to an evident suggestion from the
other end of the line, "I should say I would.Tell
the boys I'll be right over.And say, Donneghey," he added, in a more
confidential tone, "I want to bring one of the men home with me.I
want him to keep an eye on the house to-night"; then after a pause, he
concluded confidentially, "I'll tell you all about it when I get there.It looks like a kidnapping scheme to me," and with that he hung up the
receiver, unmistakably pleased with himself, and turned his beaming face
toward Zoie."It's all right, dear," he said, rubbing his hands together with evident
satisfaction, "Donneghey is going to let us have a Special Officer to
watch the house to-night.""I won't HAVE a special officer," declared Zoie vehemently; then
becoming aware of Alfred's great surprise, she explained half-tearfully,
"I'm not going to have the police hanging around our very door.I would
feel as though I were in prison.""You ARE in prison, my dear," returned the now irrepressible Alfred."A
prison of love--you and our precious boys."He stooped and implanted a
gracious kiss on her forehead, then turned toward the table for his hat."Now," he said, "I'll just run around the corner, set up the drinks for
the boys, and bring the officer home with me," and drawing himself up
proudly, he cried gaily in parting, "I'll bet there's not another man in
Chicago who has what I have to-night.""I hope not," groaned Zoie.Then,
thrusting her two small feet from beneath the coverlet and perching on
the side of the bed, she declared to Aggie that "Alfred was getting more
idiotic every minute.""He's worse than idiotic," corrected Aggie.If
he gets the police around here before we give that baby back, they'll
get the mother.She'll tell all she knows and that will be the end of
Jimmy!"exclaimed Zoie, "it'll be the end of ALL of us.""I can see our pictures in the papers, right now," groaned Aggie."Jimmy IS a villain," declared Zoie.How am I ever going to get that other twin?""There is only one thing to do," decided Aggie, "I must go for it
myself."And she snatched up her cape from the couch and started toward
the door.cried Zoie, in alarm, "and leave me alone?""It's our only chance," argued Aggie."I'll have to do it now, before
Alfred gets back.""But Aggie," protested Zoie, clinging to her departing friend, "suppose
that crazy mother should come back?""Nonsense," replied Aggie, and before Zoie could actually realise what
was happening the bang of the outside door told her that she was alone.CHAPTER XXV

Wondering what new terrors awaited her, Zoie glanced uncertainly from
door to door.So strong had become her habit of taking refuge in the
bed, that unconsciously she backed toward it now.Barely had she reached
the centre of the room when a terrific crash of breaking glass from the
adjoining room sent her shrieking in terror over the footboard, and head
first under the covers.Here she would doubtless have remained until
suffocated, had not Jimmy in his backward flight from one of the
inner rooms overturned a large rocker.This additional shock to Zoie's
overstrung nerves forced a wild scream from her lips, and an answering
exclamation from the nerve-racked Jimmy made her sit bolt upright.She
gazed at him in astonishment.His tie was awry, one end of his collar
had taken leave of its anchorage beneath his stout chin, and was now
just tickling the edge of his red, perspiring brow.His hair was on end
and his feelings were undeniably ruffled.As usual Zoie's greeting did
not tend to conciliate him."The fire-escape," panted Jimmy and he nodded mysteriously toward the
inner rooms of the apartment.There was only one and that led through the
bathroom window.He was now peeping cautiously out of the
window toward the pavement below.Jimmy jerked his thumb in the direction of the street.Zoie gazed at him
with grave apprehension.Jimmy shook his head and continued to peer cautiously out of the window."What did _I_ do with her?"repeated Jimmy, a flash of his old
resentment returning.For the first time, Zoie became fully conscious of Jimmy's ludicrous
appearance.Her overstrained nerves gave way and she began to laugh
hysterically."Say," shouted Jimmy, towering over the bed and devoutly wishing that
she were his wife so that he might strike her with impunity."Don't you
sic any more lunatics onto me."It is doubtful whether Zoie's continued laughter might not have provoked
Jimmy to desperate measures, had not the 'phone at that moment directed
their thoughts toward worse possibilities.After the instrument had
continued to ring persistently for what seemed to Zoie an age, she
motioned to Jimmy to answer it.He responded by retreating to the other
side of the room."It may be Aggie," suggested Zoie.For the first time, Jimmy became aware that Aggie was nowhere in the
apartment.he exclaimed, as he realised that he was again tete-a-tete
with the terror of his dreams."Gone to do what YOU should have done," was Zoie's characteristic
answer."Well," answered Jimmy hotly, "it's about time that somebody besides me
did something around this place.""YOU," mocked Zoie, "all YOU'VE ever done was to hoodoo me from the very
beginning.""If you'd taken my advice," answered Jimmy, "and told your husband the
truth about the luncheon, there'd never have been any 'beginning.'""If, if, if," cried Zoie, in an agony of impatience, "if you'd tipped
that horrid old waiter enough, he'd never have told anyway.""I'm not buying waiters to cover up your crimes," announced Jimmy with
his most self-righteous air."You'll be buying more than that to cover up your OWN crimes before
you've finished," retorted Zoie."Before I've finished with YOU, yes," agreed Jimmy.He wheeled upon her
with increasing resentment."Do you know where I expect to end up?""I know where you OUGHT to end up," snapped Zoie."I'll finish in the electric chair," said Jimmy."I can feel blue
lightning chasing up and down my spine right now.""Well, I wish you HAD finished in the electric chair," declared Zoie,
"before you ever dragged me into that awful old restaurant."answered Jimmy shaking his fist at her across the
foot of the bed.For the want of adequate words to express his further
feelings, Jimmy was beginning to jibber, when the outer door was
heard to close, and he turned to behold Aggie entering hurriedly with
something partly concealed by her long cape."It's all right," explained Aggie triumphantly to Zoie.She threw her cape aside and disclosed the fruits of her conquest."So," snorted Jimmy in disgust, slightly miffed by the apparent ease
with which Aggie had accomplished a task about which he had made so much
ado, "you've gone into the business too, have you?"She continued in a businesslike tone to
Zoie."Thank Heaven," sighed Aggie, then she turned to Jimmy and addressed him
in rapid, decided tones."Now, dear," she said, "I'll just put the new
baby to bed, then I'll give you the other one and you can take it right
down to the mother."Jimmy made a vain start in the direction of the fire-escape.Four
detaining hands were laid upon him."Don't try anything like that," warned Aggie; "you can't get out of this
house without that baby.And Aggie sailed triumphantly out of the room to
make the proposed exchange of babies.Before Jimmy was able to suggest to himself an escape from Aggie's last
plan of action, the telephone again began to cry for attention.Neither Jimmy nor Zoie could summon courage to approach the impatient
instrument, and as usual Zoie cried frantically for Aggie.Aggie was not long in returning to the room and this time she bore in
her arms the infant so strenuously demanded by its mad mother."Here you are, Jimmy," she said; "here's the other one.Now take him
down stairs quickly before Alfred gets back."She attempted to place the
unresisting babe in Jimmy's chubby arms, but Jimmy's freedom was not to
be so easily disposed of.he exclaimed, backing away from the small creature in fear and
abhorrence, "take that bundle of rags down to the hotel office and have
that woman hystericing all over me."Oh well," answered Aggie, distracted by the persistent ringing of the
'phone, "then hold him a minute until I answer the 'phone."This at least was a compromise, and reluctantly Jimmy allowed the now
wailing infant to be placed in his arms."Jig it, Jimmy, jig it," cried Zoie.Jimmy looked down helplessly at
the baby's angry red face, but before he had made much headway with the
"jigging," Aggie returned to them, much excited by the message which she
had just received over the telephone."That mother is making a scene down stairs in the office," she said."You hear," chided Zoie, in a fury at Jimmy, "what did Aggie tell you?""If she wants this thing," maintained Jimmy, looking down at the bundle
in his arms, "she can come after it.""We can't have her up here," objected Aggie."Alfred may be back at any minute.You know what
happened the last time we tried to change them.""You can send it down the chimney, for all I care," concluded Jimmy.exclaimed Aggie, her face suddenly illumined."Oh Lord," groaned Jimmy, who had come to regard any elation on Zoie's
or Aggie's part as a sure forewarner of ultimate discomfort for him.Again Aggie had recourse to the 'phone."Hello," she called to the office boy, "tell that woman to go around to
the back door, and we'll send something down to her."There was a slight
pause, then Aggie added sweetly, "Yes, tell her to wait at the foot of
the fire-escape."Zoie had already caught the drift of Aggie's intention and she now fixed
her glittering eyes upon Jimmy, who was already shifting about uneasily
and glancing at Aggie, who approached him with a business-like air."Now, dear," said Aggie, "come with me.I'll hand Baby out through the
bathroom window and you can run right down the fire-escape with him.""If I do run down the fire-escape," exclaimed Jimmy, wagging his large
head from side to side, "I'll keep right on RUNNING.That's the last
you'll ever see of me.""But, Jimmy," protested Aggie, slightly hurt by his threat, "once that
woman gets her baby you'll have no more trouble."asked Jimmy, looking from one to the other."She'll be up here if you don't hurry," urged Aggie impatiently, and
with that she pulled Jimmy toward the bedroom door."Let her come," said Jimmy, planting his feet so as to resist Aggie's
repeated tugs, "I'm going to South America.""Why will you act like this," cried Aggie, in utter desperation, "when
we have so little time?""Say," said Jimmy irrelevantly, "do you know that I haven't had any----"

"Yes," interrupted Aggie and Zoie in chorus, "we know.""How long," continued Zoie impatiently, "is it going to take you to slip
down that fire-escape?""That depends on how fast I'slip,'" answered Jimmy doggedly."You'll'slip' all right," sneered Zoie.Further exchange of pleasantries between these two antagonists was cut
short by the banging of the outside door.exclaimed Aggie, glancing nervously over her shoulder,
"there's Alfred now.Hurry, Jimmy, hurry," she cried, and with that she
fairly forced Jimmy out through the bedroom door, and followed in his
wake to see him safely down the fire-escape.CHAPTER XXVI

Zoie had barely time to arrange herself after the manner of an
interesting invalid, when Alfred entered the room in the gayest of
spirits."Hello, dearie," he cried as he crossed quickly to her side.asked Zoie faintly and she glanced uneasily toward the door,
through which Jimmy and Aggie had just disappeared."I told you I shouldn't be long," said Alfred jovially, and he implanted
a condescending kiss on her forehead.he
asked, rubbing his hands together in satisfaction."You're all cold," pouted Zoie, edging away, "and you've been drinking.""I had to have one or two with the boys," said Alfred, throwing out his
chest and strutting about the room, "but never again.From now on I cut
out all drinks and cigars.This is where I begin to live my life for our
sons."asked Zoie, as she began to see long years
of boredom stretching before her."You and our boys are one and the same, dear," answered Alfred, coming
back to her side."You mean you couldn't go on loving ME if it weren't for the BOYS?"She was beginning to realise how completely
her hold upon him depended upon her hideous deception."Of course I could, Zoie," answered Alfred, flattered by what he
considered her desire for his complete devotion, "but----"

"But not so MUCH," pouted Zoie."Well, of course, dear," admitted Alfred evasively, as he sank down upon
the edge of the bed by her side--

"You needn't say another word," interrupted Zoie, and then with a shade
of genuine repentance, she declared shame-facedly that she hadn't been
"much of a wife" to Alfred.contradicted the proud young father, "you've given me the
ONE thing that I wanted most in the world.""But you see, dear," said Zoie, as she wound her little white arms about
his neck, and looked up into his face adoringly, "YOU'VE been the 'ONE'
thing that I wanted 'MOST' and I never realised until to-night how--how
crazy you are about things.""Well," said Zoie, letting her eyes fall before his and picking at a bit
of imaginary lint on the coverlet, "babies and things.""Oh," said Alfred, and he was about to proceed when she again
interrupted him."But now that I DO realise it," continued Zoie, earnestly, her fingers
on his lips, lest he again interrupt, "if you'll only have a little
patience with me, I'll--I'll----" again her eyes fell bashfully to the
coverlet, as she considered the possibility of being ultimately obliged
to replace the bogus twins with real ones."All the patience in the world," answered Alfred, little dreaming of the
problem that confronted the contrite Zoie."That's all I ask," declared Zoie, her assurance completely restored,
"and in case anything SHOULD happen to THESE----" she glanced anxiously
toward the door through which Aggie had borne the twins."But nothing is going to happen to these, dear," interrupted Alfred,
rising and again assuming an air of fatherly protection.There, there," he added, patting her small shoulder and nodding
his head wisely."That crazy woman has got on your nerves, but you
needn't worry, I've got everything fixed.Donneghey sent a special
officer over with me.shrieked Zoie, fixing her eyes on the bedroom door, through which
Jimmy had lately disappeared and wondering whether he had yet "slipped"
down the fire-escape."Yes," continued Alfred, walking up and down the floor with a masterly
stride."If that woman is caught hanging around here again, she'll get a
little surprise.My boys are safe now, God bless them!"Then reminded of
the fact that he had not seen them since his return, he started quickly
toward the bedroom door."I'll just have a look at the little rascals,"
he decided.She caught Alfred's arm as he passed the side of
her bed, and clung to him in desperation.Alfred looked down at her in surprise.She turned her face toward the door, and called lustily, "Aggie!questioned Alfred, thinking Zoie suddenly ill, "can
I get you something?"Before Zoie was obliged to reply, Aggie answered her summons.she asked, glancing inquiringly into Zoie's distressed
face."Alfred's here," said Zoie, with a sickly smile as she stroked his hand
and glanced meaningly at Aggie.cried Aggie, and involuntarily she took a step backward,
as though to guard the bedroom door."Yes," said Alfred, mistaking Aggie's surprise for a compliment to his
resource; "and now, Aggie, if you'll just stay with Zoie for a minute
I'll have a look at my boys."exclaimed Aggie, nervously, and she placed herself again in
front of the bedroom door.Alfred was plainly annoyed by her proprietory air."I'll not WAKE them," persisted Alfred, "I just wish to have a LOOK at
them," and with that he again made a move toward the door."But Alfred," protested Zoie, still clinging to his hand, "you're not
going to leave me again--so soon."Alfred was becoming more and more restive under the seeming absurdity of
their persistent opposition, but before he could think of a polite way
of over-ruling them, Aggie continued persuasively."You stay with Zoie," she said."I'll bring the boys in here and you can
both have a look at them.""But Aggie," argued Alfred, puzzled by her illogical behaviour, "would
it be wise to wake them?""Now you stay here and I'll get them."Before Alfred could protest further she was out of the room and the door
had closed behind her, so he resigned himself to her decision, banished
his temporary annoyance at her obstinacy, and glanced about the room
with a new air of proprietorship."This is certainly a great night, Zoie," he said."It certainly is," acquiesced Zoie, with an over emphasis that made
Alfred turn to her with new concern."I'm afraid that mad woman made you very nervous, dear," he said.Zoie's nerves were destined to bear still further strain, for at that
moment, there came a sharp ring at the door.Beside herself with anxiety Zoie threw her arms about Alfred, who had
advanced to soothe her, drew him down by her side and buried her head on
his breast."You ARE jumpy," said Alfred, and at that instant a wrangle of loud
voices, and a general commotion was heard in the outer hall.asked Alfred, endeavouring to disentangle himself from Zoie's
frantic embrace.Zoie clung to him so tightly that he was unable to rise, but his alert
ear caught the sound of a familiar voice rising above the din of dispute
in the hallway."That sounds like the officer," he exclaimed.cried Zoie, and she wound her arms more tightly about
him.CHAPTER XXVII

Propelled by a large red fist, attached to the back of his badly wilted
collar, the writhing form of Jimmy was now thrust through the outer
door."Let go of me," shouted the hapless Jimmy.The answer was a spasmodic shaking administered by the fist; then a
large burly officer, carrying a small babe in his arms, shoved the
reluctant Jimmy into the centre of the room and stood guard over him."I got him for you, sir," announced the officer proudly, to the
astonished Alfred, who had just managed to untwine Zoie's arms and to
struggle to his feet.Alfred's eyes fell first upon the dejected Jimmy, then they travelled to
the bundle of long clothes in the officer's arms.He snatched the infant from the officer
and pressed him jealously to his breast."I don't understand," he said,
gazing at the officer in stupefaction.asked the officer, nodding toward the unfortunate
Jimmy."I caught him slipping down your fire-escape.""I KNEW it," exclaimed Zoie in a rage, and she cast a vindictive look at
Jimmy for his awkwardness.Alfred
turned again to the officer, then to Jimmy, who was still flashing
defiance into the officer's threatening eyes.What's the matter with you,
Jimmy?This is the third time that you have tried to take my baby out
into the night.""Then you've had trouble with him before?"He
studied Jimmy with new interest, proud in the belief that he had brought
a confirmed "baby-snatcher" to justice."I've had a little trouble myself," declared Jimmy hotly, now resolved
to make a clean breast of it."I'm not asking about your troubles," interrupted the officer savagely,
and Jimmy felt the huge creature's obnoxious fingers tightening again on
his collar."Go ahead, sir," said the officer to Alfred."Well," began Alfred, nodding toward the now livid Jimmy, "he was out
with my boy when I arrived.I stopped him from going out with him
a second time, and now you, officer, catch him slipping down the
fire-escape.I don't know what to say," he finished weakly."_I_ do," exclaimed Jimmy, feeling more and more like a high explosive,
"and I'll say it."And before Jimmy could get further,
Alfred resumed with fresh vehemence."He's supposed to be a friend of mine," he explained to the officer, as
he nodded toward the wriggling Jimmy."He was all right when I left him
a few months ago.""You'll think I'm all right again," shouted Jimmy, trying to get free
from the officer, "before I've finished telling all I----"

"That won't help any," interrupted the officer firmly, and with another
twist of Jimmy's badly wilted collar he turned to Alfred with his most
civil manner, "What shall I do with him, sir?""I don't know," said Alfred, convinced that his friend was a fit subject
for a straight jacket."It's absurd," cried Zoie, on the verge of hysterics, and in utter
despair of ever disentangling the present complication without
ultimately losing Alfred, "you're all absurd," she cried wildly.exclaimed Alfred, turning upon her in amazement, "what do you
mean?""It's a joke," said Zoie, without the slightest idea of where the joke
lay."If you had any sense you could see it.""I DON'T see it," said Alfred, with hurt dignity."Neither do I," said Jimmy, with boiling resentment."Can you call it a joke," asked Alfred, incredulously, "to have our
boy----" He stopped suddenly, remembering that there was a companion
piece to this youngster.he exclaimed, "our other
boy----" He rushed to the crib, found it empty, and turned a terrified
face to Zoie."Now, Alfred," pleaded Zoie, "don't get excited; he's all right."Zoie did not know, but at that moment her eyes fell upon Jimmy, and as
usual he was the source of an inspiration for her."Jimmy never cared for the other one," she said, "did you, Jimmy?"Alfred turned to the officer, with a tone of command."Wait," he said,
then he started toward the bedroom door to make sure that his other
boy was quite safe.The picture that confronted him brought the hair
straight up on his head.True to her promise, and ignorant of Jimmy's
return with the first baby, Aggie had chosen this ill-fated moment to
appear on the threshold with one babe on each arm."Here they are," she said graciously, then stopped in amazement at sight
of the horrified Alfred, clasping a third infant to his breast.exclaimed Alfred, stroking his forehead with his unoccupied
hand, and gazing at what he firmly believed must be an apparition,
"THOSE aren't MINE," he pointed to the two red mites in Aggie's arms.stammered Aggie for the want of something better
to say.Then he turned in appeal to his young wife,
whose face had now become utterly expressionless.There was an instant's pause, then the blood returned to Zoie's face and
she proved herself the artist that Alfred had once declared her."OURS, dear," she murmured softly, with a bashful droop of her lids.persisted Alfred, pointing to the baby in his arms, and
feeling sure that his mind was about to give way."Why--why--why," stuttered Zoie, "THAT'S the JOKE."echoed Alfred, looking as though he found it anything but
such."Yes," added Aggie, sharing Zoie's desperation to get out of their
temporary difficulty, no matter at what cost in the future.stammered Alfred, "what IS there to tell?""Why, you see," said Aggie, growing more enthusiastic with each
elaboration of Zoie's lie, "we didn't dare to break it to you too
suddenly."gasped Alfred; a new light was beginning to dawn on
his face."So," concluded Zoie, now thoroughly at home in the new situation, "we
asked Jimmy to take THAT one OUT."Jimmy cast an inscrutable glance in Zoie's direction.Was it possible
that she was at last assisting him out of a difficulty?"Yes," confirmed Aggie, with easy confidence, "we wanted you to get used
to the idea gradually."He was afraid to allow his mind to accept
too suddenly the whole significance of their disclosure, lest his joy
over-power him."You--you--do--don't mean----" he stuttered."Yes, dear," sighed Zoie, with the face of an angel, and then with a
languid sigh, she sank back contentedly on her pillows.cried Alfred, now delirious with delight."Give
them to me," he called to Aggie, and he snatched the surprised infants
savagely from her arms."Give me ALL of them, ALL of them."He clasped
the three babes to his breast, then dashed to the bedside of the
unsuspecting Zoie and covered her small face with rapturous kisses.Feeling the red faces of the little strangers in such close proximity to
hers, Zoie drew away from them with abhorrence, but unconscious of her
unmotherly action, Alfred continued his mad career about the room, his
heart overflowing with gratitude toward Zoie in particular and mankind
in general.Finding Aggie in the path of his wild jubilee, he treated
that bewildered young matron to an unwelcome kiss.A proceeding which
Jimmy did not at all approve.Hardly had Aggie recovered from her surprise when the disgruntled
Jimmy was startled out of his dark mood by the supreme insult of a
loud resounding kiss implanted on his own cheek by his excitable young
friend.Jimmy raised his arm to resist a second assault, and Alfred
veered off in the direction of the officer, who stepped aside just in
time to avoid similar demonstration from the indiscriminating young
father.Finding a wide circle prescribed about himself and the babies, Alfred
suddenly stopped and gazed about from one astonished face to the other."Well," said the officer, regarding Alfred with an injured air,
and feeling much downcast at being so ignominiously deprived of his
short-lived heroism in capturing a supposed criminal, "if this is all a
joke, I'll let the woman go.""The woman," repeated Alfred; "what woman?""I nabbed a woman at the foot of the fire-escape," explained the
officer.Zoie and Aggie glanced at each other inquiringly."I thought
she might be an accomplice."His manner was
becoming more paternal, not to say condescending, with the arrival of
each new infant."Don't be silly, Alfred," snapped Zoie, really ashamed that Alfred was
making such an idiot of himself."Oh, that's it," said Alfred, with a wise nod of comprehension; "the
nurse, then she's in the joke too?""You're all in it," he exclaimed, flattered to think
that they had considered it necessary to combine the efforts of so many
of them to deceive him."Yes," assented Jimmy sadly, "we are all 'in it.'""Well, she's a great actress," decided Alfred, with the air of a
connoisseur."She sure is," admitted Donneghey, more and more disgruntled as he felt
his reputation for detecting fraud slipping from him."She put up a
phoney story about the kid being hers," he added."But I could tell she
wasn't on the level.Good-night, sir," he called to Alfred, and ignoring
Jimmy, he passed quickly from the room."Oh, officer," Alfred called after him.I'll
be down later and fix things up with you."Again Alfred gave his whole
attention to his new-found family.He leaned over the cradle and gazed
ecstatically into the three small faces below his."This is too much,"
he murmured."Much too much," agreed Jimmy, who was now sitting hunched up on the
couch in his customary attitude of gloom."You were right not to break it to me too suddenly," said Alfred, and
with his arms encircling three infants he settled himself on the couch
by Jimmy's side."You're a cute one," he continued to Jimmy, who was
edging away from the three mites with aversion.In the absence of any
answer from Jimmy, Alfred appealed to Zoie, "Isn't he a cute one, dear?""Oh, yes, VERY," answered Zoie, sarcastically.Shutting his lips tight and glancing at Zoie with a determined effort at
self restraint, Jimmy rose from the couch and started toward the door."If you women are done with me," he said, "I'll clear out."exclaimed Alfred, rising quickly and placing himself
between his old friend and the door."What a chance," and he laughed
boisterously."You're not going to get out of my sight this night," he
declared."I'm just beginning to appreciate all you've done for me.""So am I," assented Jimmy, and unconsciously his hand sought the spot
where his dinner should have been, but Alfred was not to be resisted."A man needs someone around," he declared, "when he's going through a
thing like this.I need all of you, all of you," and with his eyes he
embraced the weary circle of faces about him."I feel as though I could
go out of my head," he explained and with that he began tucking the
three small mites in the pink and white crib designed for but one.Zoie regarded him with a bored expression'

"You act as though you WERE out of your head," she commented, but Alfred
did not heed her.He was now engaged in the unhoped for bliss of singing
three babies to sleep with one lullaby.The other occupants of the room were just beginning to relax and to show
some resemblance to their natural selves, when their features were again
simultaneously frozen by a ring at the outside door.CHAPTER XXVIII

Annoyed at being interrupted in the midst of his lullaby, to three,
Alfred looked up to see Maggie, hatless and out of breath, bursting into
the room, and destroying what was to him an ideally tranquil home scene.But Maggie paid no heed to Alfred's look of inquiry.She made directly
for the side of Zoie's bed."If you plaze, mum," she panted, looking down at Zoie, and wringing her
hands.asked Aggie, who had now reached the side of the bed."'Scuse me for comin' right in"--Maggie was breathing hard--"but me
mother sint me to tell you that me father is jus afther comin' home from
work, and he's fightin' mad about the babies, mum."cautioned Aggie and Zoie, as they glanced nervously toward
Alfred who was rising from his place beside the cradle with increasing
interest in Maggie's conversation.he repeated, "your father is mad about babies?""It's all right, dear," interrupted Zoie nervously; "you see," she
went on to explain, pointing toward the trembling Maggie, "this is our
washerwoman's little girl.Our washerwoman has had twins, too, and it
made the wash late, and her husband is angry about it.""Oh," said Alfred, with a comprehensive nod, but Maggie was not to be so
easily disposed of."If you please, mum," she objected, "it ain't about the wash.repeated Alfred, drawing himself up in the fond conviction that
all his heirs were boys, "No wonder your pa's angry.Come now," he said to Maggie, patting the child on the shoulder and
regarding her indulgently, "you go straight home and tell your father
that what HE needs is BOYS.""Well, of course, sir," answered the bewildered Maggie, thinking that
Alfred meant to reflect upon the gender of the offspring donated by her
parents, "if you ain't afther likin' girls, me mother sint the money
back," and with that she began to feel for the pocket in her red flannel
petticoat.repeated Alfred, in a puzzled way, "what money?"It was again Zoie's time to think quickly."The money for the wash, dear," she explained.retorted Alfred, positively beaming generosity, "who talks
of money at such a time as this?"And taking a ten dollar bill from his
pocket, he thrust it in Maggie's outstretched hand, while she was trying
to return to him the original purchase money."Here," he said to the
astonished girl, "you take this to your father.Tell him I sent it to
him for his babies.Tell him to start a bank account with it."This was clearly not a case with which one small addled mind could deal,
or at least, so Maggie decided.She had a hazy idea that Alfred was
adding something to the original purchase price of her young sisters,
but she was quite at a loss to know how to refuse the offer of such
a "grand 'hoigh" gentleman, even though her failure to do so would no
doubt result in a beating when she reached home.She stared at Alfred
undecided what to do, the money still lay in her outstretched hand."I'm afraid Pa'll niver loike it, sir," she said.exclaimed Alfred in high feather, and he himself closed her
red little fingers over the bill, "he's GOT to like it.Now you run along," he concluded to Maggie, as he urged her
toward the door, "and tell him what I say.""Yes, sir," murmured Maggie, far from sharing Alfred's enthusiasm.Feeling no desire to renew his acquaintance with Maggie, particularly
under Alfred's watchful eye, Jimmy had sought his old refuge, the high
backed chair.As affairs progressed and there seemed no doubt of Zoie's
being able to handle the situation to the satisfaction of all concerned,
Jimmy allowed exhaustion and the warmth of the firelight to have their
way with him.His mind wandered toward other things and finally into
space.His head dropped lower and lower on his chest; his breathing
became laboured--so laboured in fact that it attracted the attention of
Maggie, who was about to pass him on her way to the door.Then coming close to the
side of the unsuspecting sleeper, she hissed a startling message in his
ear."Me mother said to tell you that me fadder's hoppin' mad at you,
sir."He studied the young person at his
elbow, then he glanced at Alfred, utterly befuddled as to what had
happened while he had been on a journey to happier scenes.Apparently
Maggie was waiting for an answer to something, but to what?Jimmy
thought he detected an ominous look in Alfred's eyes.Letting his hand
fall over the arm of the chair so that Alfred could not see it, Jimmy
began to make frantic signals to Maggie to depart; she stared at him the
harder."Go away," whispered Jimmy, but Maggie did not move.he
said, and waved her off with his hand.Puzzled by Jimmy's sudden aversion to this apparently harmless child,
Alfred turned to Maggie with a puckered brow.For once Jimmy found it in his heart to be grateful to Zoie for the
prompt answer that came from her direction."The wash, dear," said Zoie to Alfred; "Jimmy had to go after the wash,"
and then with a look which Maggie could not mistake for an invitation to
stop longer, Zoie called to her haughtily, "You needn't wait, Maggie; we
understand.""Sure, an' it's more 'an I do," answered Maggie, and shaking her head
sadly, she slipped from the room.But Alfred could not immediately dismiss from his mind the picture of
Maggie's inhuman parent."Just fancy," he said, turning his head to one side meditatively, "fancy
any man not liking to be the father of twins," and with that he again
bent over the cradle and surveyed its contents."Think, Jimmy," he said,
when he had managed to get the three youngsters in his arms, "just think
of the way THAT father feels, and then think of the way _I_ feel.""And then think of the way _I_ feel," grumbled Jimmy.exclaimed Alfred; "what have you to feel about?"Before Jimmy could answer, the air was rent by a piercing scream and a
crash of glass from the direction of the inner rooms.whispered Aggie, with an anxious glance toward Zoie."Sounded like breaking glass," said Alfred.exclaimed Zoie, for want of anything better to suggest.repeated Alfred with a superior air; "nonsense!Here," he said, turning to Jimmy, "you hold the boys and I'll go
see----" and before Jimmy was aware of the honour about to be thrust
upon him, he felt three red, spineless morsels, wriggling about in his
arms.He made what lap he could for the armful, and sat up in a stiff,
strained attitude on the edge of the couch.In the meantime, Alfred had
strode into the adjoining room with the air of a conqueror.Aggie looked
at Zoie, with dreadful foreboding.shrieked the voice of the Italian mother from the adjoining
room.Regardless of the discomfort of his three disgruntled charges, Jimmy
began to circle the room.So agitated was his mind that he could
scarcely hear Aggie, who was reporting proceedings from her place at the
bedroom door."She's come up the fire-escape," cried Aggie; "she's beating Alfred to
death."shrieked Zoie, making a flying leap from her coverlets."She's locking him in the bathroom," declared Aggie, and with that she
disappeared from the room, bent on rescue.cried Zoie, tragically, and she started in pursuit of
Aggie."Wait a minute," called Jimmy, who had not yet been able to find
a satisfactory place in which to deposit his armful of clothes and
humanity."Eat 'em," was Zoie's helpful retort, as the trailing end of her
negligee disappeared from the room.CHAPTER XXIX

Now, had Jimmy been less perturbed during the latter part of this
commotion, he might have heard the bell of the outside door, which
had been ringing violently for some minutes.As it was, he was wholly
unprepared for the flying advent of Maggie."Oh, plaze, sir," she cried, pointing with trembling fingers toward
the babes in Jimmy's arms, "me fadder's coming right behind me.He's
a-lookin' for you sir.""For me," murmured Jimmy, wondering vaguely why everybody on earth
seemed to be looking for HIM."Put 'em down, sir," cried Maggie, still pointing to the three babies,
"put 'em down.asked Jimmy, now utterly confused as to which way to
turn."There," said Maggie, and she pointed to the cradle beneath his very
eyes."Of course," said Jimmy vapidly, and he sank on his knees and strove to
let the wobbly creatures down easily.And with that
disconcerting warning, she too deserted him.Jimmy rose very cautiously from the
cradle, his eyes sought the armchair.He
looked towards the opposite door; beyond that was the mad Italian woman.His one chance lay in slipping unnoticed through the hallway; he made
a determined dash in that direction, but no sooner had he put his head
through the door, than he drew it back quickly.The conversation between
O'Flarety and the maid in the hallway was not reassuring.Jimmy decided
to take a chance with the Italian mother, and as fast as he could, he
streaked it toward the opposite door.The shrieks and denunciations that
he met from this direction were more disconcerting than those of
the Irish father.For an instant he stood in the centre of the room,
wavering as to which side to surrender himself.The thunderous tones of the enraged father drew nearer; he threw himself
on the floor and attempted to roll under the bed; the space between the
railing and the floor was far too narrow.Why had he disregarded Aggie's
advice as to diet?The knob of the door handle was turning--he vaulted
into the bed and drew the covers over his head just as O'Flarety,
trembling with excitement, and pursued by Maggie, burst into the room."Lave go of me," cried O'Flarety to Maggie, who clung to his arm in a
vain effort to soothe him, and flinging her off, he made straight for
the bed."Ah," he cried, gazing with dilated nostrils at the trembling object
beneath the covers, "there you are, mum," and he shook his fist above
what he believed to be the cowardly Mrs."'Tis well ye may cover
up your head," said he, "for shame on yez!Me wife may take in washing,
but when I comes home at night I wants me kids, and I'll be after havin'
'em too.Then getting no response from the
agitated covers, he glanced wildly about the room.he exclaimed as his eyes fell on the crib; but he stopped short in
astonishment, when upon peering into it, he found not one, or two, but
three "barren.""They're child stalers, that's what they are," he declared to Maggie,
as he snatched Bridget and Norah to his no doubt comforting breast."Me
little Biddy," he crooned over his much coveted possession."Me little
Norah," he added fondly, looking down at his second.The thought of his
narrow escape from losing these irreplaceable treasures rekindled
his wrath.Again he strode toward the bed and looked down at the now
semi-quiet comforter."The black heart of ye, mum," he roared, then ordering Maggie to give
back "every penny of that shameless creetur's money" he turned toward
the door.So intense had been O'Flarety's excitement and so engrossed was he in
his denunciation that he had failed to see the wild-eyed Italian woman
rushing toward him from the opposite door.cried the frenzied woman and, to O'Flarety's astonishment,
she laid two strong hands upon his arm and drew him round until he faced
her.she asked, then peering into
the face of the infant nearest to her, she uttered a disappointed
moan.She scanned the face of the second
infant--again she moaned.Having begun to identify this hysterical creature as the possible mother
of the third infant, O'Flarety jerked his head in the direction of the
cradle."I guess you'll find what you're lookin' for in there," he said.Then
bidding Maggie to "git along out o' this" and shrugging his shoulders
to convey his contempt for the fugitive beneath the coverlet, he swept
quickly from the room.Clasping her long-sought darling to her heart and weeping with delight,
the Italian mother was about to follow O'Flarety through the door when
Zoie staggered into the room, weak and exhausted.called the indignant Zoie to the departing mother."How dare
you lock my husband in the bathroom?"She pointed to the key, which the
woman still unconsciously clasped in her hand."Give me that key," she
demanded, "give it to me this instant.""Take your horrid old key," said the mother, and she threw it on the
floor."If you ever try to get my baby again, I'll lock your husband in
JAIL," and murmuring excited maledictions in her native tongue, she took
her welcome departure.Zoie stooped for the key, one hand to her giddy head, but Aggie, who had
just returned to the room, reached the key first and volunteered to go
to the aid of the captive Alfred, who was pounding desperately on the
bathroom door and demanding his instant release."I'll let him out," said Aggie."You get into bed," and she slipped
quickly from the room.Utterly exhausted and half blind with fatigue Zoie lifted the coverlet
and slipped beneath it.Her first sensation was of touching something
rough and scratchy, then came the awful conviction that the thing
against which she lay was alive.Without stopping to investigate the identity of her uninvited
bed-fellow, or even daring to look behind her, Zoie fled from the room
emitting a series of screams that made all her previous efforts in that
direction seem mere baby cries.So completely had Jimmy been enveloped
in the coverlets and for so long a time that he had acquired a vague
feeling of aloftness toward the rest of his fellows, and had lost all
knowledge of their goings and comings.But when his unexpected companion
was thrust upon him he was galvanised into sudden action by her scream,
and swathed in a large pink comforter, he rolled ignominiously from the
upper side of the bed, where he lay on the floor panting and enmeshed,
awaiting further developments.Of one thing he was certain, a great deal
had transpired since he had sought the friendly solace of the covers and
he had no mind to lose so good a friend as the pink comforter.By the
time he had summoned sufficient courage to peep from under its edge, a
babel of voices was again drawing near, and he hastily drew back in his
shell and waited.Not daring to glance at the scene of her fright, Zoie pushed Aggie
before her into the room and demanded that she look in the bed.Seeing the bed quite empty and noticing nothing unusual in the fact that
the pink comforter, along with other covers, had slipped down behind it,
Aggie hastened to reassure her terrified friend."You imagined it, Zoie," she declared, "look for yourself."Zoie's small face peeped cautiously around the edge of the doorway."Well, perhaps I did," she admitted; then she slipped gingerly into the
room, "my nerves are jumping like fizzy water."They were soon to "jump" more, for at this instant, Alfred, burning with
anger at the indignity of having been locked in the bathroom, entered
the room, demanding to know the whereabouts of the lunatic mother, who
had dared to make him a captive in his own house.he called to Zoie and Aggie, and his eye roved wildly
about the room.Then his mind reverted with anxiety to his newly
acquired offspring.he cried, and he rushed toward the crib."Not ALL of them," said Zoie."All," insisted Alfred, and his hands went distractedly toward his head.Zoie and Aggie looked at each other in a dazed way.They had a hazy
recollection of having seen one babe disappear with the Italian woman,
but what had become of the other two?"I don't know," said Zoie, with the first truth she had spoken that
night, "I left them with Jimmy."shrieked Alfred, and a diabolical light lit his features.he snorted, with sudden comprehension, "then he's at it again.And
with that decision he started toward the outer door.protested Zoie, really alarmed by the look that she saw on
his face.Alfred turned to his trembling wife with suppressed excitement, and
patted her shoulder condescendingly."Control yourself, my dear," he said."Control yourself; I'll get
your babies for you--trust me, I'll get them.And then," he added with
parting emphasis from the doorway, "I'll SETTLE WITH JIMMY!"By uncovering one eye, Jimmy could now perceive that Zoie and Aggie
were engaged in a heated argument at the opposite side of the room.By
uncovering one ear he learned that they were arranging a line of action
for him immediately upon his reappearance.He determined not to wait for
the details.Fixing himself cautiously on all fours, and making sure that he was
well covered by the pink comforter, he began to crawl slowly toward the
bedroom door.Turning away from Aggie with an impatient exclamation, Zoie suddenly
beheld what seemed to her a large pink monster with protruding claws
wriggling its way hurriedly toward the inner room.she screamed, and pointing in horror toward the dreadful
creature now dragging itself across the threshold, she sank fainting
into Aggie's outstretched arms.CHAPTER XXX

Having dragged the limp form of her friend to the near-by couch, Aggie
was bending over her to apply the necessary restoratives, when Alfred
returned in triumph.He was followed by the officer in whose arms were
three infants, and behind whom was the irate O'Flarety, the hysterical
Italian woman, and last of all, Maggie."Bring them all in here, officer," called Alfred over his shoulder."I'll soon prove to you whose babies those are."Then turning to Aggie,
who stood between him and the fainting Zoie he cried triumphantly,
"I've got them Aggie, I've got them.""She's fainted," said Aggie, and stepping from in front of the young
wife, she pointed toward the couch.cried Alfred, with deep concern as he rushed to Zoie
and began frantically patting her hands.Then he turned to the officer, his sense of injury welling high within
him, "You see what these people have done to my wife?Ignoring the uncomplimentary remarks of O'Flarety, he again bent over
Zoie."Rouse yourself, my dear," he begged of her.snorted O'Flarety, unable longer to control his pent up
indignation."I'll let you know when I want to hear from you," snarled the officer to
O'Flarety."But they're NOT her babies," protested the Italian woman desperately."Cut it," shouted the officer, and with low mutterings, the outraged
parents were obliged to bide their time.Lifting Zoie to a sitting posture Alfred fanned her gently until she
regained her senses."Your babies are all right," he assured her."I've
brought them all back to you."gasped Zoie weakly, and she wondered what curious fate had been
intervening to assist Alfred in such a prodigious undertaking."Yes, dear," said Alfred, "every one," and he pointed toward the three
infants in the officer's arms.Zoie turned her eyes upon what SEEMED to her numberless red faces.she moaned and again she swooned."I told you she'd be afraid to face us," shouted the now triumphant
O'Flarety.retorted the still credulous Alfred, "how dare you
persecute this poor demented mother?"Alfred's persistent solicitude for Zoie was too much for the resentful
Italian woman."She didn't persecute me, oh no!"Again Zoie was reviving and again Alfred lifted her in his arms and
begged her to assure the officer that the babies in question were hers."Let's hear her SAY it," demanded O'Flarety."You SHALL hear her," answered Alfred, with confidence.Then he beckoned
to the officer to approach, explaining that Zoie was very weak."Sure," said the officer; then planting himself directly in front of
Zoie's half closed eyes, he thrust the babies upon her attention.Zoie opened her eyes to see three small red faces immediately opposite
her own.she cried, with a frantic wave of her arm, "take them
away!"This hateful reminder brought
Alfred again to the protection of his young and defenceless wife."The excitement has unnerved her," he said to the officer."Ain't you about done with my kids?"asked O'Flarety, marvelling how any
man with so little penetration as the officer, managed to hold down a
"good payin' job.""What do you want for your proof anyway?"But Alfred's
faith in the validity of his new parenthood was not to be so easily
shaken."My wife is in no condition to be questioned," he declared."She's out
of her head, and if you don't----"

He stepped suddenly, for without warning, the door was thrown open and a
second officer strode into their midst dragging by the arm the reluctant
Jimmy."I guess I've got somethin' here that you folks need in your business,"
he called, nodding toward the now utterly demoralised Jimmy.exclaimed Aggie, having at last got her breath.cried Alfred, bearing down upon the panting Jimmy with a
ferocious expression."I caught him slipping down the fire-escape," explained the officer.exclaimed Aggie and Alfred in tones of deep reproach."Jimmy," said Alfred, coming close to his friend, and fixing his eyes
upon him in a determined effort to control the poor creature's fast
failing faculties, "you know the truth of this thing.You are the one
who sent me that telegram, you are the one who told me that I was a
father."asked Aggie, trying to protect her dejected
spouse."Of course I am," replied Alfred, with every confidence, "but I have to
prove it to the officer.Then turning to
the uncomfortable man at his side, he demanded imperatively, "Tell the
officer the truth, you idiot.Am I a father or am
I not?""If you're depending on ME for your future offspring," answered Jimmy,
wagging his head with the air of a man reckless of consequences, "you
are NOT a father."gasped Alfred, and he stared at his friend in
bewilderment."Ask them," answered Jimmy, and he nodded toward Zoie and Aggie.Alfred bent over the form of the again prostrate Zoie."My darling,"
he entreated, "rouse yourself.""Now," said
Alfred, with enforced self-control, "you must look the officer squarely
in the eye and tell him whose babies those are," and he nodded toward
the officer, who was now beginning to entertain grave doubts on the
subject.cried Zoie, too exhausted for further lying.exclaimed Alfred, his hand on his forehead."I only borrowed them," said Zoie, "to get you home," and with that she
sank back on the couch and closed her eyes.cried the triumphant O'Flarety."I guess they're your'n all right," admitted the officer doggedly, and
he grudgingly released the three infants to their rightful parents."I guess they'd better be," shouted O'Flarety; then he and the Italian
woman made for the door with their babes pressed close to their hearts.O'Flarety turned in the doorway and raised a warning fist."If you don't leave my kids alone, you'll GIT 'an understanding.'""On your way," commanded the officer to the pair of them, and together
with Maggie and the officer, they disappeared forever from the Hardy
household.he exclaimed; then he turned to
Jimmy who was still in the custody of the second officer: "If I'm not a
father, what am I?""I'd hate to tell you," was Jimmy's unsympathetic reply, and in utter
dejection Alfred sank on the foot of the bed and buried his head in his
hands."What shall I do with this one, sir?"asked the officer, undecided as to
Jimmy's exact standing in the household."Shoot him, for all I care," groaned Alfred, and he rocked to and fro.exclaimed Aggie, then she signalled to the officer to
go."No more of your funny business," said the officer with a parting nod at
Jimmy and a vindictive light in his eyes when he remembered the bruises
that Jimmy had left on his shins.said Aggie sympathetically, and she pressed her hot face
against his round apoplectic cheek.And after all you
have done for us!""Yes," sneered Zoie, having regained sufficient strength to stagger to
her feet, "he's done a lot, hasn't he?"And then forgetting that her
original adventure with Jimmy which had brought about such disastrous
results was still unknown to Aggie and Alfred, she concluded bitterly,
"All this would never have happened, if it hadn't been for Jimmy and his
horrid old luncheon."This was too much, and just as he had seemed to be
well out of complications for the remainder of his no doubt short life.He turned to bolt for the door but Aggie's eyes were upon him.exclaimed Aggie and she regarded him with a puzzled frown.Zoie's hand was already over her lips, but too late.Recovering from his somewhat bewildering sense of loss, Alfred, too, was
now beginning to sit up and take notice.Zoie gazed from Alfred to Aggie, then at Jimmy, then resolving to make
a clean breast of the matter, she sidled toward Alfred with her most
ingratiating manner."Now, Alfred," she purred, as she endeavoured to act one arm about
his unsuspecting neck, "if you'll only listen, I'll tell you the REAL
TRUTH."A wild despairing cry from Alfred, a dash toward the door by Jimmy, and
a determined effort on Aggie's part to detain her spouse, temporarily
interrupted Zoie's narrative.But in spite of these discouragements, Zoie did eventually tell Alfred
the real truth, and before the sun had risen on the beginning of another
day, she had added to her confession, promises whose happy fulfillment
was evidenced for many years after by the chatter of glad young voices,
up and down the stairway of Alfred's new suburban home, and the flutter
of golden curls in and out amongst the sunlight and shadows of his
ample, well kept grounds.He might indeed reach it by the
ladder, but he would have to break the glass and crawl through, a mode
of escape likely to be attended by personal risk."No, that won't do," thought Dan."At any rate, I won't try it till
other things fail."Meanwhile Donovan, in the bar-room above, was in high good humor.He
felt that he had done a sharp thing, and more than once chuckled as he
thought of his prisoner below.Indeed he could not forbear, after about
half an hour, lifting the trap and calling down stairs:

"Hallo, there!""You're an impudent jackanapes!""You'll
get enough of it before you're through.""So will you," answered Dan, boldly."I'll take the risk," chuckled Donovan."Do you know what you remind me
of?""You're like a rat in a trap.""Not exactly," answered Dan, as a bright thought dawned upon him."Because a rat can do no harm, and I can."It occurred to Donovan that Dan might have some matches in his pocket,
and was momentarily alarmed at the thought that our hero might set the
house on fire."If you had," said the saloon-keeper, relieved, "it would do you no good
to set a fire."I don't mean to set the house on fire," said Dan, composedly.returned Dan, rising from his seat on the box.asked Donovan, following with his glance the
boy's motion."I'm going to take the spigot out of them
whisky-kegs, and let the whisky run out on the floor."exclaimed the saloon-keeper, now thoroughly
frightened.As he spoke Dan dextrously pulled the spigot from a keg, and Donovan, to
his dismay, heard the precious liquid--precious in his eyes--pouring out
upon the floor.With an exertion he raised the trap-door, hastily descended the ladder,
and rushed to the keg to replace the spigot.Meanwhile Dan ran up the ladder, pulled it after him, and made his late
jailer a captive."Put down the ladder, you young rascal!"roared Donovan, when, turning
from his work, he saw how the tables had been turned."It wouldn't be convenient just yet," answered Dan, coolly.He shut the trap-door, hastily lugged the ladder to the rear of the
house (unobserved, for there were no customers present), then dashed up
stairs and beckoned to Althea to follow him.Donovan was stupefied by liquor.Putting on her things, the little girl hastily and gladly obeyed.As they passed through the saloon, Donovan's execrations and shouts were
heard proceeding from the cellar."Never you mind, Althea," said Dan.The two children hurried to the nearest horse-car, which luckily came up
at the moment, and jumped on board.Dan looked back with a smile at the saloon, saying to himself:

"I rather think, Mr.Donovan, you've found your match this time.I hope
you'll enjoy the cellar as much as I did."In about an hour and a half Dan, holding Althea by the hand,
triumphantly led her into his mother's presence."I've brought her back, mother," he said."Oh, my dear, dear little girl!""I
thought I should never, never see you again.But we will not wait to hear a twice-told tale.Rather let us return to
Donovan, where the unhappy proprietor is still a captive in his own
cellar.Here he remained till his cries attracted the attention of a
wondering customer, who finally lifted the trap-door."What are you doin' down there?""Put down the ladder and let me up first of all."It was a considerable time before the ladder was found.Then the
saloon-keeper emerged from his prison in a very bad humor."I wish I had left you there," said the customer, with justifiable
indignation."This is your gratitude for my trouble, is it?""Excuse me, but I'm so mad with that cursed boy."Come, that's talking," said the placated customer."Wait a minute," said Donovan, a sudden fear possessing him.He rushed up stairs and looked for Althea.His wife was lying on the floor, breathing heavily, but the little girl
was gone.exclaimed Donovan,
sinking into a chair.Then, in a blind fury with the wife who didn't prevent the little girl's
recapture, he seized a pail of water and emptied it over the face of the
prostrate woman.Donovan came to, and berated her husband furiously."Serves you right, you jade!"It was certainly an unlucky day for the Donovans.After calling at Donovan's, on the day when Dan recovered Althea, John
Hartley crossed the Courtlandt street ferry, and took a train to
Philadelphia with Blake, his accomplice in the forged certificates.The
two confederates had raised some Pennsylvania railway certificates,
which they proposed to put on the Philadelphia market.They spent several days in the Quaker City, and thus Hartley heard
nothing of the child's escape.Donovan did not see fit to inform him, as this would stop the weekly
remittance for the child's board, and, moreover, draw Hartley's
indignation down upon his head.One day, in a copy of the _New York Herald_, which he purchased at the
news-stand in the Continental Hotel, Hartley observed the arrival of
Harriet Vernon at the Fifth Avenue Hotel."I thought she would come," he said to himself, with a smile."I have
her in my power at last.She must submit to my terms, or lose sight of
the child altogether.""Blake," he said, aloud, "I must take the first train to New York.""On the contrary, I see a chance of making a good haul."Vernon sat in her room at the Fifth
Avenue Hotel.A servant brought up a card bearing the name of John
Hartley."He is prompt," she said to herself, with a smile."Probably he has not
heard of Althea's escape from the den to which he carried her.I will
humor him, in that case, and draw him out.""I will see the gentleman in the parlor," she said.Five minutes later she entered the ladies' parlor.Hartley rose to
receive her with a smile of conscious power, which told Harriet Vernon
that he was ignorant of the miscarriage of his plans."I heard of your _unexpected_ arrival, Mrs.Vernon," he commenced, "and
have called to pay my respects.""Your motive is appreciated, John Hartley," she said, coldly."That's pleasant," he said, mockingly."May I beg to apologize for
constraining you to cross the Atlantic?""Don't apologize; you have merely acted out your nature.""Probably that is not meant to be complimentary.However, it can't be
helped.""I suppose you have something to say to me, John Hartley," said Mrs.I wrote you that I had ferreted out your cunningly
devised place of concealment for my daughter."She seemed very cool and composed,
whereas he expected she would be angry and disturbed."We may as well come to business at once," he said."If you wish to
recover the charge of your ward, you must accede to my terms.""They are expressed in my letter to you.You must agree to pay me a
thousand dollars each quarter.""It strikes me you are exorbitant in your demands."At any rate, the money won't come out of you.It will
come from my daughter's income.""So you would rob your daughter, John Hartley?"Is
she to live in luxury, and with thousands to spare, while I, her only
living parent, wander penniless and homeless about the world.""I might sympathize with you, if I did not know how you have misused the
gifts of fortune, and embittered the existence of my poor sister.As it
is, it only disgusts me.""I don't want you sympathy, Harriet Vernon," he said, roughly."I want
four thousand dollars a year.""Suppose I decline to let you have it?""Then you must take the consequences," he said, quickly."That you and Althea will be forever separated.He looked at her intently to see the effect of his threat.Harriet Vernon was as cool and imperturbable as ever."Have you been in New York for a week past?"she asked, as he thought,
irrelevantly."Because you don't appear to know what has happened."As for me, I bid you good-evening.""I mean, John Hartley, that you are not as shrewd as you imagine.I mean
that a boy has foiled you; and while you were doubtless laughing at his
simplicity, he has proved more than a match for you.You have no claim
upon me, and I must decline your disinterested proposal."She left the room, leaving him crest-fallen and stupefied.He started for Brooklyn immediately, and toward eleven o'clock entered
the saloon at Donovan's."She's gone," he cried, "but I couldn't help it, Mr.On my
honor, I couldn't."The story was told, Donovan ending by invoking curses upon the boy who
had played such a trick upon him."I am ashamed of you, for
allowing a boy to get the best of you.""That boy's a fox," said Donovan."He's a match for the old one, he is.I'd like to break his neck for him."I may get hold of the girl again," mused Hartley, as
he rose to go."If I do, I won't put her in charge of such a
dunderhead."He left Donovan's and returned to New York, but he had hardly left the
Fulton ferry-boat when he was tapped on the shoulder by an officer."A little financial irregularity, as they call it in Wall street.You
may know something about some raised railroad certificates!"The morning papers contained an account of John Hartley's arrest, and
the crime with which he was charged.Harriet Vernon read it at the breakfast-table with an interest which may
be imagined."I don't like to rejoice in any man's misfortune," she said to herself,
"but now I can have a few years of peace.My precious brother-in-law
will doubtless pass the next few years in enforced seclusion, and I can
have a settled home."Directly after breakfast, she set out for the humble home of her niece.She found all at home, for Dan was not to go back to business till
Monday."Well, my good friend," she said, "I have news for you.""Good news, I hope," said Dan.Henceforth I can have Althea with me.The obstacle that
separated us is removed."Mordaunt's countenance fell, and Dan looked sober.It was plain
that Althea was to be taken from them, and they had learned to love her."I am very glad," faltered Mrs."You don't look glad," returned Mrs."You see we don't like to part with Althea," explained Dan, who
understood his mother's feelings."Who said you were to part with the child?""I thought you meant to take her from us."Your mistake is a natural one, for I have not told you my
plans.I mean to take a house up town, install Mrs.Mordaunt as my
housekeeper and friend, and adopt this young man (indicating Dan),
provided he has no objection."I have plenty of money, and no one to care for, or to
care for me.I have taken a fancy to you all, and I am quite sure that
we can all live happily together.Althea is my niece, and you, Dan, may
call me aunt, too, if you like.Dan offered her his hand in a frank, cordial way, which she liked."So it is settled, then," she said, in a pleased voice."I ought to warn
you," she added, "that I have the reputation of being ill-tempered.You
may get tired of living with me.""We'll take the risk," said Dan, smiling.Vernon, whose habit it was to act promptly, engaged a house on
Madison avenue, furnished it without regard to expense, and in less than
a fortnight, installed her friends in it.Then she had a talk with Dan
about his plans."Do you wish to remain in your place," she asked, "or would you like to
obtain a better education first?""To obtain an education," said Dan, promptly."Then give notice to your employer of your intention."Vernon in a second interview informed him that besides defraying
his school expenses, she should give him an allowance of fifty dollars a
month for his own personal needs."May I give a part of it to my mother?""You don't ask why I refuse," she said."I suppose you have a good reason," said Dan, dubiously."My reason is that I shall pay your mother double this sum.Unless she
is very extravagant it ought to be enough to defray her expenses."exclaimed Dan, in fresh
astonishment.All these important changes in the position of the Mordaunts were
unknown to their old friends, who, since their loss of property, had
given them the cold shoulder.One day Tom Carver, in passing the house, saw Dan coming down the steps
quite as handsomely dressed as himself."I didn't know what else could carry you to such a house.""Oh, that's easily explained," said Dan."You don't mean to say she boards there?"asked Tom, in a more deferential tone.At any rate she gives me a handsome allowance.""And you don't have anything to do?""Why, my father only
allows me three dollars a week."I don't need as much as my aunt allows me.""I say, Dan," said Tom, in the most friendly terms, "I'm awfully hard
up."Yes," said Dan, secretly amused with the change in Tom's manner.said Tom, linking his arm in Dan's."I'm very glad you're rich again."Thank you," said Dan, smiling, "but I'm afraid you have forgotten
something.""You know I used to be a newsboy in front of the Astor House.""And you might not care to associate with a newsboy.""Well, you are all right now," said Tom, magnanimously."You didn't always think so, Tom.""I always thought you were a gentleman, Dan."I suppose it's the way of the world," thought Dan."It is lucky that
there are some true friends who stick by us through thick and thin."Mordaunt had an experience similar to Dan's.Her old acquaintances,
who, during her poverty never seemed to recognize her when they met,
gradually awoke to the consciousness of her continued existence, and
left cards.She received them politely, but rated their professions of
friendship at their true value.They had not been "friends in need," and
she could not count them "friends indeed."Six years rolled by, bringing with them many changes.The little family
on Madison avenue kept together.She had a hearty love for young people, and enjoyed the growth and
development of her niece Althea, and Dan, whom she called her nephew and
loved no less.He completed his preparation for college, and
graduated with high honors.He is no less frank, handsome, and
self-reliant than when as a boy he sold papers in front of the Astor
House for his mother's support.He looks forward to a business life, and
has accepted an invitation to go abroad to buy goods in London and Paris
for his old firm.He was, in fact, preparing to go when a mysterious
letter was put in his hands.It ran thus:


     "MR.DANIEL MORDAUNT:--I shall take it as a great favor if you will
     come to the St.Nicholas Hotel this evening, and inquire for me.I
     am sick, or I would not trouble you.John went back to the kitchen.I have to speak
     to you on a matter of great importance."I don't know of any one of that name."I cannot think of any one," said Mrs."I hope you won't go,
Dan," she added, anxiously; "it may be a trap laid by a wicked and
designing man.""You forget that I am not a boy any longer, mother," said Dan, smiling."I think I can defend myself, even if Mr.Davis is a wicked and
designing person."To her he was
still a boy, though in the eyes of others an athletic young man.Davis at the hotel, Dan was ushered into a room on
the third floor.Seated in an arm-chair was an elderly man, weak and
wasted, apparently in the last stages of consumption."It would have been well if he had not known me, for I did him a great
wrong."said Dan, trying to connect the name with his
father.You see before you Robert Hunting, once your
father's book-keeper."Dan's handsome face darkened, and he said, bitterly:

"You killed my father!""Heaven help me, I fear I did!"sighed Davis--to call him by his later
name."The money of which you robbed him caused him to fail, and failure led
to his death.""I have accused myself of this crime oftentimes," moaned Davis."Don't
think that the money brought happiness, for it did not."From Europe I went to
Brazil, and engaged in business in Rio Janeiro.A year since I found my
health failing, and have come back to New York to die.But before I die
I want to make what reparation I can.""You cannot call my father back to me," said Dan, sadly."No; but I can restore the money that I stole.That is the right
word--stole.I hope you and your mother have not suffered?""We saw some hard times, but for years we have lived in comfort."Will you bring a lawyer to me to-morrow evening?"You might keep every dollar if you would bring my father back."The next evening Davis transferred to Dan and his mother property
amounting to fifty thousand dollars, in payment of what he had taken,
with interest, and in less than a month later he died, Dan taking upon
himself the charge of the funeral.His trip to Europe was deferred, and
having now capital to contribute, he was taken as junior partner into
the firm where he had once filled the position of office-boy.His father had failed disastrously, and
Tom is glad to accept a minor clerkship from the boy at whom he once
sneered.Julia Rogers has never lost her preference for Dan.It is whispered that
they are engaged, or likely soon to be, and Dan's assiduous attentions
to the young lady make the report a plausible one.John Hartley was sentenced to a term of years in prison.Harriet Vernon
dreaded the day of his release, being well convinced that he would seize
the earliest opportunity to renew his persecutions.She had about made
up her mind to buy him off, when she received intelligence that he was
carried off by fever, barely a month before the end of his term.It was
a sad end of a bad life, but she could not regret him.Althea was saved
the knowledge of her father's worthlessness.She was led to believe that
he had died when she was a little girl.Dan, the young detective, has entered
upon a career of influence and prosperity.The hardships of his earlier
years contributed to strengthen his character, and give him that
self-reliance of which the sons of rich men so often stand in need.A
similar experience might have benefited Tom Carver, whose lofty
anticipations have been succeeded by a very humble reality.Let those
boys who are now passing through the discipline of poverty and
privation, take courage and emulate the example of "Dan, the Detective."A. L. BURT'S PUBLICATIONS

For Young People

BY POPULAR WRITERS,

97-99-101 Reade Street, New York.+Bonnie Prince Charlie+: A Tale of Fontenoy and Culloden.By G. A.
     HENTY.With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.The adventures of the son of a Scotch officer in French service.The
boy, brought up by a Glasgow bailie, is arrested for aiding a Jacobite
agent, escapes, is wrecked on the French coast, reaches Paris, and
serves with the French army at Dettingen.He kills his father's foe in a
duel, and escaping to the coast, shares the adventures of Prince
Charlie, but finally settles happily in Scotland."Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of 'Quentin Durward.'The
     lad's journey across France, and his hairbreadth escapes, make up
     as good a narrative of the kind as we have ever read.For freshness
     of treatment and variety of incident Mr.Henty has surpassed
     himself."--_Spectator._


     +With Clive in India+; or, the Beginnings of an Empire.By G. A.
     HENTY.With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.The period between the landing of Clive as a young writer in India and
the close of his career was critical and eventful in the extreme.At its
commencement the English were traders existing on sufferance of the
native princes.At its close they were masters of Bengal and of the
greater part of Southern India.The author has given a full and accurate
account of the events of that stirring time, and battles and sieges
follow each other in rapid succession, while he combines with his
narrative a tale of daring and adventure, which gives a lifelike
interest to the volume."He has taken a period of Indian history of the most vital
     importance, and he has embroidered on the historical facts a story
     which of itself is deeply interesting.Young people assuredly will
     be delighted with the volume."--_Scotsman._


     +The Lion of the North+: A Tale of Gustavus Adolphus and the Wars of
     Religion.With full-page Illustrations by JOHN
     SCHÖNBERG.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Henty gives the history of the first part of the
Thirty Years' War.The issue had its importance, which has extended to
the present day, as it established religious freedom in Germany.The
army of the chivalrous king of Sweden was largely composed of Scotchmen,
and among these was the hero of the story."The tale is a clever and instructive piece of history, and as boys
     may be trusted to read it conscientiously, they can hardly fail to
     be profited."--_Times._


     +The Dragon and the Raven+; or, The Days of King Alfred.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author gives an account of the fierce struggle between
Saxon and Dane for supremacy in England, and presents a vivid picture of
the misery and ruin to which the country was reduced by the ravages of
the sea-wolves.The hero, a young Saxon thane, takes part in all the
battles fought by King Alfred.He is driven from his home, takes to the
sea and resists the Danes on their own element, and being pursued by
them up the Seine, is present at the long and desperate siege of Paris."Treated in a manner most attractive to the boyish
     reader."--_Athenæum._


     +The Young Carthaginian+: A Story of the Times of Hannibal.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.Boys reading the history of the Punic Wars have seldom a keen
appreciation of the merits of the contest.That it was at first a
struggle for empire, and afterward for existence on the part of
Carthage, that Hannibal was a great and skillful general, that he
defeated the Romans at Trebia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannæ, and all but
took Rome, represents pretty nearly the sum total of their knowledge.To
let them know more about this momentous struggle for the empire of the
world Mr.Henty has written this story, which not only gives in graphic
style a brilliant description of a most interesting period of history,
but is a tale of exciting adventure sure to secure the interest of the
reader.From first to last nothing
     stays the interest of the narrative.It bears us along as on a
     stream whose current varies in direction, but never loses its
     force."--_Saturday Review._


     +In Freedom's Cause+: A Story of Wallace and Bruce.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.In this story the author relates the stirring tale of the Scottish War
of Independence.The extraordinary valor and personal prowess of Wallace
and Bruce rival the deeds of the mythical heroes of chivalry, and indeed
at one time Wallace was ranked with these legendary personages.The
researches of modern historians have shown, however, that he was a
living, breathing man--and a valiant champion.The hero of the tale
fought under both Wallace and Bruce, and while the strictest historical
accuracy has been maintained with respect to public events, the work is
full of "hairbreadth'scapes" and wild adventure."It is written in the author's best style.Full of the wildest and
     most remarkable achievements, it is a tale of great interest, which
     a boy, once he has begun it, will not willingly put on one
     side."--_The Schoolmaster._


     +With Lee in Virginia+: A Story of the American Civil War.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.The story of a young Virginian planter, who, after bravely proving his
sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters, serves with no less courage
and enthusiasm under Lee and Jackson through the most exciting events of
the struggle.He has many hairbreadth escapes, is several times wounded
and twice taken prisoner; but his courage and readiness and, in two
cases, the devotion of a black servant and of a runaway slave whom he
had assisted, bring him safely through all difficulties."One of the best stories for lads which Mr.The picture is full of life and color, and the stirring and
     romantic incidents are skillfully blended with the personal
     interest and charm of the story."--_Standard._


     +By England's Aid+; or, The Freeing of the Netherlands (1585-1604).With full-page Illustrations by ALFRED PEARSE, and
     Maps.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The story of two English lads who go to Holland as pages in the service
of one of "the fighting Veres."After many adventures by sea and land,
one of the lads finds himself on board a Spanish ship at the time of the
defeat of the Armada, and escapes only to fall into the hands of the
Corsairs.He is successful in getting back to Spain under the protection
of a wealthy merchant, and regains his native country after the capture
of Cadiz.It overflows with stirring
     incident and exciting adventure, and the color of the era and of
     the scene are finely reproduced.The illustrations add to its
     attractiveness."--_Boston Gazette._


     +By Right of Conquest+; or, With Cortez in Mexico.With full-page Illustrations by W. S. STACEY, and Two Maps.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.50.The conquest of Mexico by a small band of resolute men under the
magnificent leadership of Cortez is always rightly ranked among the most
romantic and daring exploits in history.With this as the groundwork of
his story Mr.Henty has interwoven the adventures of an English youth,
Roger Hawkshaw, the sole survivor of the good ship Swan, which had
sailed from a Devon port to challenge the mercantile supremacy of the
Spaniards in the New World.He is beset by many perils among the
natives, but is saved by his own judgment and strength, and by the
devotion of an Aztec princess.At last by a ruse he obtains the
protection of the Spaniards, and after the fall of Mexico he succeeds in
regaining his native shore, with a fortune and a charming Aztec bride."'By Right of Conquest' is the nearest approach to a perfectly
     successful historical tale that Mr.Henty has yet
     published."--_Academy._


     +In the Reign of Terror+: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy.By G.
     A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by J. SCHÖNBERG.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.Harry Sandwith, a Westminster boy, becomes a resident at the chateau of
a French marquis, and after various adventures accompanies the family to
Paris at the crisis of the Revolution.Imprisonment and death reduce
their number, and the hero finds himself beset by perils with the three
young daughters of the house in his charge.After hairbreadth escapes
they reach Nantes.There the girls are condemned to death in the
coffin-ships, but are saved by the unfailing courage of their boy
protector."Harry Sandwith, the Westminster boy, may fairly be said to beat
     Mr.His adventures will delight boys by the
     audacity and peril they depict.... The story is one of Mr.Henty's
     best."--_Saturday Review._


     +With Wolfe in Canada+; or, The Winning of a Continent.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.Henty gives an account of the struggle between
Britain and France for supremacy in the North American continent.On the
issue of this war depended not only the destinies of North America, but
to a large extent those of the mother countries themselves.The fall of
Quebec decided that the Anglo-Saxon race should predominate in the New
World; that Britain, and not France, should take the lead among the
nations of Europe; and that English and American commerce, the English
language, and English literature, should spread right round the globe."It is not only a lesson in history as instructively as it is
     graphically told, but also a deeply interesting and often thrilling
     tale of adventure and peril by flood and field."--_Illustrated
     London News._


     +True to the Old Flag+: A Tale of the American War of Independence.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author has gone to the accounts of officers who took
part in the conflict, and lads will find that in no war in which
American and British soldiers have been engaged did they behave with
greater courage and good conduct.The historical portion of the book
being accompanied with numerous thrilling adventures with the redskins
on the shores of Lake Huron, a story of exciting interest is interwoven
with the general narrative and carried through the book."Does justice to the pluck and determination of the British
     soldiers during the unfortunate struggle against American
     emancipation.The son of an American loyalist, who remains true to
     our flag, falls among the hostile redskins in that very Huron
     country which has been endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye
     and Chingachgook."--_The Times._


     +The Lion of St.Mark+: A Tale of Venice in the Fourteenth Century.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A story of Venice at a period when her strength and splendor were put to
the severest tests.The hero displays a fine sense and manliness which
carry him safely through an atmosphere of intrigue, crime, and
bloodshed.He contributes largely to the victories of the Venetians at
Porto d'Anzo and Chioggia, and finally wins the hand of the daughter of
one of the chief men of Venice."Every boy should read 'The Lion of St.Henty has never
     produced a story more delightful, more wholesome, or more
     vivacious."--_Saturday Review._


     +A Final Reckoning+: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by W. B. WOLLEN.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.The hero, a young English lad, after rather a stormy boyhood, emigrates
to Australia, and gets employment as an officer in the mounted police.A
few years of active work on the frontier, where he has many a brush with
both natives and bushrangers, gain him promotion to a captaincy, and he
eventually settles down to the peaceful life of a squatter.Henty has never published a more readable, a more carefully
     constructed, or a better written story than this."--_Spectator._


     +Under Drake's Flag+: A Tale of the Spanish Main.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.A story of the days when England and Spain struggled for the supremacy
of the sea.The heroes sail as lads with Drake in the Pacific
expedition, and in his great voyage of circumnavigation.The historical
portion of the story is absolutely to be relied upon, but this will
perhaps be less attractive than the great variety of exciting adventure
through which the young heroes pass in the course of their voyages."A book of adventure, where the hero meets with experience enough,
     one would think, to turn his hair gray."--_Harper's Monthly
     Magazine._


     +By Sheer Pluck+: A Tale of the Ashanti War.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The author has woven, in a tale of thrilling interest, all the details
of the Ashanti campaign, of which he was himself a witness.His hero,
after many exciting adventures in the interior, is detained a prisoner
by the king just before the outbreak of the war, but escapes, and
accompanies the English expedition on their march to Coomassie.Henty keeps up his reputation as a writer of boys' stories.'By Sheer Pluck' will be eagerly read."--_Athenæum._


     +By Pike and <DW18>+: A Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic.By G.
     A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by MAYNARD BROWN, and 4
     Maps.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Henty traces the adventures and brave deeds of an
English boy in the household of the ablest man of his age--William the
Silent.Edward Martin, the son of an English sea-captain, enters the
service of the Prince as a volunteer, and is employed by him in many
dangerous and responsible missions, in the discharge of which he passes
through the great sieges of the time.He ultimately settles down as Sir
Edward Martin."Boys with a turn for historical research will be enchanted with
     the book, while the rest who only care for adventure will be
     students in spite of themselves."--_St.James' Gazette._


     +St.George for England+: A Tale of Cressy and Poitiers.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.No portion of English history is more crowded with great events than
that of the reign of Edward III.Cressy and Poitiers; the destruction of
the Spanish fleet; the plague of the Black Death; the Jacquerie rising;
these are treated by the author in "St.The hero of
the story, although of good family, begins life as a London apprentice,
but after countless adventures and perils becomes by valor and good
conduct the squire, and at last the trusted friend of the Black Prince.Henty has developed for himself a type of historical novel for
     boys which bids fair to supplement, on their behalf, the historical
     labors of Sir Walter Scott in the land of fiction."--_The
     Standard._


     +Captain Kidd's Gold+: The True Story of an Adventurous Sailor Boy.By JAMES FRANKLIN FITTS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.There is something fascinating to the average youth in the very idea of
buried treasure.A vision arises before his eyes of swarthy Portuguese
and Spanish rascals, with black beards and gleaming
eyes--sinister-looking fellows who once on a time haunted the Spanish
Main, sneaking out from some hidden creek in their long, low schooner,
of picaroonish rake and sheer, to attack an unsuspecting trading craft.There were many famous sea rovers in their day, but none more celebrated
than Capt.Perhaps the most fascinating tale of all is Mr.Fitts'
true story of an adventurous American boy, who receives from his dying
father an ancient bit of vellum, which the latter obtained in a curious
way.The document bears obscure directions purporting to locate a
certain island in the Bahama group, and a considerable treasure buried
there by two of Kidd's crew.The hero of this book, Paul Jones Garry, is
an ambitious, persevering lad, of salt-water New England ancestry, and
his efforts to reach the island and secure the money form one of the
most absorbing tales for our youth that has come from the press.+Captain Bayley's Heir+: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California.By
     G. A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.A frank, manly lad and his cousin are rivals in the heirship of a
considerable property.The former falls into a trap laid by the latter,
and while under a false accusation of theft foolishly leaves England for
America.He works his passage before the mast, joins a small band of
hunters, crosses a tract of country infested with Indians to the
Californian gold diggings, and is successful both as digger and trader.Henty is careful to mingle instruction with entertainment; and
     the humorous touches, especially in the sketch of John Holl, the
     Westminster dustman, Dickens himself could hardly have
     excelled."--_Christian Leader._


     +For Name and Fame+; or, Through Afghan Passes.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.An interesting story of the last war in Afghanistan.The hero, after
being wrecked and going through many stirring adventures among the
Malays, finds his way to Calcutta and enlists in a regiment proceeding
to join the army at the Afghan passes.He accompanies the force under
General Roberts to the Peiwar Kotal, is wounded, taken prisoner, carried
to Cabul, whence he is transferred to Candahar, and takes part in the
final defeat of the army of Ayoub Khan."The best feature of the book--apart from the interest of its
     scenes of adventure--is its honest effort to do justice to the
     patriotism of the Afghan people."--_Daily News._


     +Captured by Apes+: The Wonderful Adventures of a Young Animal
     Trainer.12mo, cloth, $1.00.The scene of this tale is laid on an island in the Malay Archipelago.Philip Garland, a young animal collector and trainer, of New York, sets
sail for Eastern seas in quest of a new stock of living curiosities.The
vessel is wrecked off the coast of Borneo and young Garland, the sole
survivor of the disaster, is cast ashore on a small island, and captured
by the apes that overrun the place.The lad discovers that the ruling
spirit of the monkey tribe is a gigantic and vicious baboon, whom he
identifies as Goliah, an animal at one time in his possession and with
whose instruction he had been especially diligent.The brute recognizes
him, and with a kind of malignant satisfaction puts his former master
through the same course of training he had himself experienced with a
faithfulness of detail which shows how astonishing is monkey
recollection.Very novel indeed is the way by which the young man
escapes death.Prentice has certainly worked a new vein on juvenile
fiction, and the ability with which he handles a difficult subject
stamps him as a writer of undoubted skill.+The Bravest of the Brave+; or, With Peterborough in Spain.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.There are few great leaders whose lives and actions have so completely
fallen into oblivion as those of the Earl of Peterborough.This is
largely due to the fact that they were overshadowed by the glory and
successes of Marlborough.His career as general extended over little
more than a year, and yet, in that time, he showed a genius for warfare
which has never been surpassed.Henty never loses sight of the moral purpose of his work--to
     enforce the doctrine of courage and truth.Lads will read 'The
     Bravest of the Brave' with pleasure and profit; of that we are
     quite sure."--_Daily Telegraph._


     +The Cat of Bubastes+: A Story of Ancient Egypt.With
     full-page Illustrations.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A story which will give young readers an unsurpassed insight into the
customs of the Egyptian people.Amuba, a prince of the Rebu nation, is
carried with his charioteer Jethro into slavery.They become inmates of
the house of Ameres, the Egyptian high-priest, and are happy in his
service until the priest's son accidentally kills the sacred cat of
Bubastes.In an outburst of popular fury Ameres is killed, and it rests
with Jethro and Amuba to secure the escape of the high-priest's son and
daughter."The story, from the critical moment of the killing of the sacred
     cat to the perilous exodus into Asia with which it closes, is very
     skillfully constructed and full of exciting adventures.It is
     admirably illustrated."--_Saturday Review._


     +With Washington at Monmouth+: A Story of Three Philadelphia Boys.By
     JAMES OTIS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Three Philadelphia boys, Seth Graydon "whose mother conducted a
boarding-house which was patronized by the British officers;" Enoch
Ball, "son of that Mrs.Ball whose dancing school was situated on
Letitia Street," and little Jacob, son of "Chris, the Baker," serve as
the principal characters.The story is laid during the winter when Lord
Howe held possession of the city, and the lads aid the cause by
assisting the American spies who make regular and frequent visits from
Valley Forge.One reads here of home-life in the captive city when bread
was scarce among the people of the lower classes, and a reckless
prodigality shown by the British officers, who passed the winter in
feasting and merry-making while the members of the patriot army but a
few miles away were suffering from both cold and hunger.The story
abounds with pictures of Colonial life skillfully drawn, and the
glimpses of Washington's soldiers which are given show that the work has
not been hastily done, or without considerable study.+For the Temple+: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem.With full-page Illustrations by S. J. SOLOMON.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.Henty here weaves into the record of Josephus an admirable and
attractive story.The troubles in the district of Tiberias, the march of
the legions, the sieges of Jotapata, of Gamala, and of Jerusalem, form
the impressive and carefully studied historic setting to the figure of
the lad who passes from the vineyard to the service of Josephus, becomes
the leader of a guerrilla band of patriots, fights bravely for the
Temple, and after a brief term of slavery at Alexandria, returns to his
Galilean home with the favor of Titus.Henty's graphic prose pictures of the hopeless Jewish
     resistance to Roman sway add another leaf to his record of the
     famous wars of the world."--_Graphic._


     +Facing Death+; or, The Hero of the Vaughan Pit.A Tale of the Coal
     Mines.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON
     BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00."Facing Death" is a story with a purpose.It is intended to show that a
lad who makes up his mind firmly and resolutely that he will rise in
life, and who is prepared to face toil and ridicule and hardship to
carry out his determination, is sure to succeed.The hero of the story
is a typical British boy, dogged, earnest, generous, and though
"shamefaced" to a degree, is ready to face death in the discharge of
duty."The tale is well written and well illustrated and there is much
     reality in the characters.If any father, clergyman, or
     schoolmaster is on the lookout for a good book to give as a present
     to a boy who is worth his salt, this is the book we would
     recommend."--_Standard._


     +Tom Temple's Career.+ By HORATIO ALGER.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Tom Temple, a bright, self-reliant lad, by the death of his father
becomes a boarder at the home of Nathan Middleton, a penurious insurance
agent.Though well paid for keeping the boy, Nathan and his wife
endeavor to bring Master Tom in line with their parsimonious habits.The
lad ingeniously evades their efforts and revolutionizes the household.As Tom is heir to $40,000, he is regarded as a person of some importance
until by an unfortunate combination of circumstances his fortune shrinks
to a few hundreds.He leaves Plympton village to seek work in New York,
whence he undertakes an important mission to California, around which
center the most exciting incidents of his young career.Some of his
adventures in the far west are so startling that the reader will
scarcely close the book until the last page shall have been reached.Alger's most fascinating style, and is bound to
please the very large class of boys who regard this popular author as a
prime favorite.+Maori and Settler+: A Story of the New Zealand War.With full-page Illustrations by ALFRED PEARSE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.The Renshaws emigrate to New Zealand during the period of the war with
the natives.Wilfrid, a strong, self-reliant, courageous lad, is the
mainstay of the household.Atherton, a
botanist and naturalist of herculean strength and unfailing nerve and
humor.In the adventures among the Maoris, there are many breathless
moments in which the odds seem hopelessly against the party, but they
succeed in establishing themselves happily in one of the pleasant New
Zealand valleys."Brimful of adventure, of humorous and interesting conversation,
     and vivid pictures of colonial life."--_Schoolmaster._


     +Julian Mortimer+: A Brave Boy's Struggle for Home and Fortune.By
     HARRY CASTLEMON.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Here is a story that will warm every boy's heart.There is mystery
enough to keep any lad's imagination wound up to the highest pitch.The
scene of the story lies west of the Mississippi River, in the days when
emigrants made their perilous way across the great plains to the land of
gold.One of the startling features of the book is the attack upon the
wagon train by a large party of Indians.Our hero is a lad of uncommon
nerve and pluck, a brave young American in every sense of the word.He
enlists and holds the reader's sympathy from the outset.Surrounded by
an unknown and constant peril, and assisted by the unswerving fidelity
of a stalwart trapper, a real rough diamond, our hero achieves the most
happy results.Harry Castlemon has written many entertaining stories for
boys, and it would seem almost superfluous to say anything in his
praise, for the youth of America regard him as a favorite author."+Carrots+:" Just a Little Boy.With
     Illustrations by WALTER CRANE."One of the cleverest and most pleasing stories it has been our
     good fortune to meet with for some time.Carrots and his sister are
     delightful little beings, whom to read about is at once to become
     very fond of."--_Examiner._

     "A genuine children's book; we've seen 'em seize it, and read it
     greedily.Children are first-rate critics, and thoroughly
     appreciate Walter Crane's illustrations."--_Punch._


     +Mopsa the Fairy.+ By JEAN INGELOW.Ingelow is, to our mind, the most charming of all living
     writers for children, and 'Mopsa' alone ought to give her a kind of
     pre-emptive right to the love and gratitude of our young folks.It
     requires genius to conceive a purely imaginary work which must of
     necessity deal with the supernatural, without running into a mere
     riot of fantastic absurdity; but genius Miss Ingelow has and the
     story of 'Jack' is as careless and joyous, but as delicate, as a
     picture of childhood."--_Eclectic._


     +A Jaunt Through Java+: The Story of a Journey to the Sacred
     Mountain.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The central interest of this story is found in the thrilling adventures
of two cousins, Hermon and Eustace Hadley, on their trip across the
island of Java, from Samarang to the Sacred Mountain.In a land where
the Royal Bengal tiger runs at large; where the rhinoceros and other
fierce beasts are to be met with at unexpected moments; it is but
natural that the heroes of this book should have a lively experience.Hermon not only distinguishes himself by killing a full-grown tiger at
short range, but meets with the most startling adventure of the journey.There is much in this narrative to instruct as well as entertain the
reader, and so deftly has Mr.Ellis used his material that there is not
a dull page in the book.The two heroes are brave, manly young fellows,
bubbling over with boyish independence.They cope with the many
difficulties that arise during the trip in a fearless way that is bound
to win the admiration of every lad who is so fortunate as to read their
adventures.+Wrecked on Spider Island+; or, How Ned Rogers Found the Treasure.By
     JAMES OTIS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A "down-east" plucky lad who ships as cabin boy, not from love of
adventure, but because it is the only course remaining by which he can
gain a livelihood.While in his bunk, seasick, Ned Rogers hears the
captain and mate discussing their plans for the willful wreck of the
brig in order to gain the insurance.Once it is known he is in
possession of the secret the captain maroons him on Spider Island,
explaining to the crew that the boy is afflicted with leprosy.While
thus involuntarily playing the part of a Crusoe, Ned discovers a wreck
submerged in the sand, and overhauling the timbers for the purpose of
gathering material with which to build a hut finds a considerable amount
of treasure.Raising the wreck; a voyage to Havana under sail; shipping

of Fortyforefoot's house I think perhaps you'll be more comfortable if
you ride on my shoulder instead of in my coat-pocket.""Thank you very much," said Jimmieboy, as Bludgeonhead lifted him up
from the ground and set him lightly as a feather on his shoulder."I think I'd like to be
as tall as this all the time, Bludgeonhead.What a great thing it would
be on parade days to be as tall as this.Why I can see miles and miles
of country from here.""Yes, it's pretty fine--but I don't think I'd care to be so tall
always," returned Bludgeonhead, as he stepped over a great broad river
that lay in his path."It makes one very uppish to be as high in the air
as this; and you'd be all the time looking down on your friends, too,
which would be so unpleasant for your friends that they wouldn't have
anything to do with you after a while.I'm going to
jump over this mountain in front of us."Here Bludgeonhead drew back a little and then took a short run, after
which he leaped high in the air, and he and Jimmieboy sailed easily over
the great hills before them, and then alighted safe and sound on the
other side.cried Jimmieboy, clapping his hands with glee."I hope there are lots more hills like that to be jumped over.""No, there aren't," said Bludgeonhead, "but if you like it so much I'll
go back and do it again."Bludgeonhead turned back and jumped over the mountain half a dozen times
until Jimmieboy was satisfied and then he resumed his journey."This," he said, after trudging along in silence for some time, "this is
Fortyforefoot Valley, and in a short time we shall come to the giant's
castle; but meanwhile I want you to see what a wonderful place this is.The valley itself will give you a better idea of Fortyforefoot's great
power as a magician than anything else that I know of.Do you know what
this place was before he came here?""It was a great big hole in the ground," returned Bludgeonhead.Fortyforefoot liked the situation because it was
surrounded by mountains and nobody ever wanted to come here because sand
pits aren't worth visiting.There wasn't a tree or a speck of a green
thing anywhere in sight--nothing but yellow sand glaring in the sun all
day and sulking in the moon all night."It's all covered with beautiful trees and
gardens and brooks now," said Jimmieboy, which was quite true, for the
Fortyforefoot Valley was a perfect paradise to look at, filled with
everything that was beautiful in the way of birds and trees and flowers
and water courses."How could he make the trees and flowers grow in dry
hot sand like that?""By his magic power, of course," answered Bludgeonhead."He filled up a
good part of the sand pit with stones that he found about here, and then
he changed one part of the desert into a pond so that he could get all
the water he wanted.Then he took a square mile of sand and changed
every grain of it into blades of grass.Other portions he transformed
into forests until finally simply by the wonderful power he has to
change one thing into another he got the place into its present shape.""But the birds, how did he make them?""He didn't," said Bludgeonhead.They saw
what a beautiful place this was and they simply moved in."Bludgeonhead paused a moment in his walk and set Jimmieboy down on the
ground again."I think I'll take a rest here before going on.We are very near to
Fortyforefoot's castle now," he said."I'll sit down here for a few
moments and sharpen my sword and get in good shape for a fight if one
becomes necessary.This place is full of
traps for just such fellows as you who come in here.That's the way
Fortyforefoot catches them for dinner."So Jimmieboy staid close by Bludgeonhead's side and was very much
entertained by all that went on around him.He saw the most wonderful
birds imaginable, and great bumble-bees buzzed about in the flowers
gathering honey by the quart.Once a great jack-rabbit, three times as
large as he was, came rushing out of the woods toward him, and Jimmieboy
on stooping to pick up a stone to throw at Mr.Bunny to frighten him
away, found that all the stones in that enchanted valley were precious.He couldn't help laughing outright when he discovered that the stone he
had thrown at the rabbit was a huge diamond as big as his fist, and that
even had he stopped to choose a less expensive missile he would have had
to confine his choice to pearls, rubies, emeralds, and other gems of the
rarest sort.And then he noticed that what he thought was a rock upon
which he and Bludgeonhead were sitting was a massive nugget of pure
yellow gold.This lead him on to inspect the trees about him and then he
discovered a most absurd thing.Fortyforefoot's extravagance had
prompted him to make all his pine trees of the most beautifully polished
and richly inlaid mahogany; every one of the weeping willows was made of
solid oak, ornamented and carved until the eye wearied of its beauty,
and as for the birds in the trees, their nests were made not of stray
wisps of straw and hay stolen from the barns and fields, but of the
softest silk, rich in color and lined throughout with eiderdown, the
mere sight of which could hardly help being restful to a tired bird--or
boy either, for that matter, Jimmieboy thought."Did he make all this out of sand?All these jewels and magnificent
carvings?""Simply took up a handful of sand and tossed
it up in the air and whatever he commanded it to be it became.But the
most wonderful thing in this place is his spring.He made what you might
call a 'Wish Dipper' out of an old tin cup.Then he dug a hole and
filled it with sand which he commanded to become liquid, and, when the
sand heard him say that, it turned to liquid, but the singular thing
about it is that as Fortyforefoot didn't say what kind of liquid it
should be, it became any kind.So now if any one is thirsty and wants a
glass of cider all he has to do is to dip the wish dipper into the
spring and up comes cider.If he wants lemonade up comes lemonade.If he
wants milk up comes milk.As Bludgeonhead spoke these words Jimmieboy was startled to hear
something very much like an approaching footstep far down the road.he asked, seizing Bludgeonhead by the hand."Yes, I did," replied Bludgeonhead, in a whisper."It sounded to me like
Fortyforefoot's step, too.""I'd better hide, hadn't I?"Climb inside
my coat and snuggle down out of sight in my pocket.We musn't let him
see you yet awhile."Jimmieboy did as he was commanded, and found the pocket a very
comfortable place, only it was a little stuffy."It's pretty hot in here," he whispered."Well, look up on the left hand corner of the outer side of the pocket
and you'll find two flaps that are buttoned up," replied Bludgeonhead,
softly.One will let in all the air you want, and the
other will enable you to peep out and see Fortyforefoot without his
seeing you."In a minute the buttons were found and the flaps opened.Everything
happened as Bludgeonhead said it would, and in a minute Jimmieboy,
peering out through the hole in the cloak, saw Fortyforefoot
approaching.The owner of the beautiful valley seemed very angry when he caught sight
of Bludgeonhead sitting on his property, and hastening up to him, he
cried:

"What business have you here in the Valley of Fortyforefoot?"Jimmieboy shrank back into one corner of the pocket, a little overcome
with fear.Fortyforefoot was larger and more terrible than he thought."I am not good at riddles," said Bludgeonhead, calmly."That is at
riddles of that sort.If you had asked me the difference between a duck
and a garden rake I should have told you that a duck has no teeth and
can eat, while a rake has plenty of teeth and can't eat.But when you
ask me what business I have here I am forced to say that I can't say.""You are a very bright sort of a giant," sneered Fortyforefoot."The fact is I can't help being bright.My
mother polishes me every morning with a damp chamois.""Do you know to whom you are speaking?"asked Fortyforefoot,
threateningly."No; not having been introduced to you, I can't say I know you,"
returned Bludgeonhead.You are Anklehigh, the
Dwarf."At this Fortyforefoot turned purple with rage."I'll right quickly teach thee a
lesson thou rash fellow."Fortyforefoot strode up close to Bludgeonhead, whose size he could not
have guessed because Bludgeonhead had been sitting down all this time
and was pretty well covered over by his cloak.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD SHOWS JIMMIEBOY TO FORTYFOREFOOT.[Blank Page]

"I'll take thee by thine ear and toss thee to the moon," he cried,
reaching out his hand to make good his word."Nonsense, Anklehigh," returned Bludgeonhead, calmly.No dwarf can fight with a giant of my size.""But I am not the dwarf Anklehigh," shrieked Fortyforefoot."And I am Bludgeonhead," returned the other, rising and towering way
above the owner of the valley.cried Fortyforefoot, falling on his knees in abject
terror.Pardon, O, Bludgeonhead.I did not know
you when I was so hasty as to offer to throw you to the moon.I thought
you were--er--that you were--er----"

"More easily thrown," suggested Bludgeonhead."Yes--yes--that was it," stammered Fortyforefoot."And now, to show that
you have forgiven me, I want you to come to my castle and have dinner
with me.""I'll be very glad to," replied Bludgeonhead."What are you going to
have for dinner?""Anything you wish," said Fortyforefoot."I was going to have a very
plain dinner to-night because for to-morrow's dinner I have invited my
brother Fortythreefoot and his wife Fortytwoinch to have a little
special dish I have been so fortunate as to secure.""Oh, only a sniveling creature I caught in one of my traps this
afternoon.He was a soldier, and he wasn't very brave about being
caught, but I judge from looking at him that he will make good eating,"
said Fortyforefoot."I couldn't gather from him who he was.He had on a
military uniform, but he behaved less like a warrior than ever I
supposed a man could.It seems from his story that he was engaged upon
some secret mission, and on his way back to his army, he stumbled over
and into one of my game traps where I found him.He begged me to let him
go, but that was out of the question.I haven't had a soldier to eat for
four years, so I took him to the castle, had him locked up in the
ice-box, and to-morrow we shall eat him."asked Bludgeonhead, thoughtfully.He told me so many names that I didn't
believe he really owned any of them," said Fortyforefoot."All I could
really learn about him was that he was as brave as a lion, and that if I
would spare him he would write me a poem a mile long every day of my
life.""Very attractive offer, that," said Bludgeonhead, with a smile."Yes; but I couldn't do it.I wouldn't miss eating him for anything,"
replied Fortyforefoot, smacking his lips, hungrily."I'd give anything
anybody'd ask, too, if I could find another as good.""Well, now, I thought you
would, and that is really what I have come here for.I have in my pocket
here a real live general that I have captured.Now between you and me, I
don't eat generals.I don't care for them--they fight so.I prefer
preserved cherries and pickled peaches and--er--strawberry jam and
powdered sugar and almonds, and other things like that, you know, and it
occurred to me that if I let you have the general you would supply me
with what I needed of the others.""You have come to the right place, Bludgeonhead," said Fortyforefoot,
eagerly."I'll give you a million cans of jam, all the pickled peaches
and other things you can carry if this general you speak about is a fine
specimen.""Well, here he is," said Bludgeonhead, hauling Jimmieboy out of his
pocket--whispering to Jimmieboy at the same time not to be afraid
because he wouldn't let anything happen to him, and so of course
Jimmieboy felt perfectly safe, though a little excited."No," answered Bludgeonhead, putting Jimmieboy back into his pocket
again."If I ever do find another, though, you shall have him."This of course put Fortyforefoot in a tremendously good humor, and
before an hour had passed he had not only transformed pebbles and twigs
and leaves of trees and other small things into the provisions that the
tin soldiers needed, but he had also furnished horses and wagons enough
to carry them back to headquarters, and then Fortyforefoot accompanied
by Bludgeonhead entered the castle, where the proprietor demanded that
Jimmieboy should be given up to him.Bludgeonhead handed him over at once, and ten minutes later Jimmieboy
found himself locked up in the pantry.Hardly had he time to think over the strange events of the afternoon
when he heard a noise in the ice-box over in one corner of the pantry,
and on going there to see what was the cause of it he heard a familiar
voice repeating over and over again these mournful lines:

    "From Giant number one I ran--
       But O the sequel dire!I truly left a frying-pan
       And jumped into a fire.""Hullo in there," whispered Jimmieboy."The bravest man of my time," replied the voice in the ice-box."Major
Mortimer Carraway Blueface of the 'Jimmieboy Guards.'""Oh, I am so glad to find you again," cried Jimmieboy, throwing open the
ice-box door."I thought it was you the minute I heard your poetry.""You recognized the beauty of
the poem?""But you said you were in the fire when I
knew you were in the ice-box, and so of course----"

"Of course," said the major, with a frown."You remembered that when I
say one thing I mean another.Well, I'm glad to see you again, but why
did you desert me so cruelly?"For a moment Jimmieboy could say nothing, so surprised was he at the
major's question.Then he simply repeated it, his amazement very evident
in the tone of his voice."Why did we desert you so cruelly?"When two of my companions
in arms leave me, the way you and old Spriteyboy did, I think you ought
to make some explanation."But we didn't desert you," said Jimmieboy."No such idea ever entered
our minds.The minute Spritey turned into
Bludgeonhead you ran away just about as fast as your tin legs could
carry you--frightened to death evidently.""Jimmieboy," said the major, his voice husky with emotion, "any other
person than yourself would have had to fight a duel with me for casting
such a doubt as you have just cast upon my courage.The idea of me, of
I, of myself, Major Mortimer Carraway Blueface, the hero of a hundred
and eighty-seven real sham fights, the most poetic as well as the
handsomest man in the 'Jimmieboy Guards' being accused of running away!"I've been accused of dreadful things,
     Of wearing copper finger-rings,
     Of eating green peas with a spoon,
     Of wishing that I owned the moon,
     Of telling things that weren't the truth,
     Of having cut no wisdom tooth,
     In times of war of stealing buns,
     And fainting at the sound of guns,
     Yet never dreamed I'd see the day
     When it was thought I'd run away.Alack--O--well-a-day--alas!Alas--O--well-a-day--alack!Alas--alack--O--well-a-day!Aday--alas--O--lack-a-well--"

"Are you going to keep that up forever?""If you are
I'm going to get out.I've heard stupid poetry in this campaign, but
that's the worst yet.""I only wanted to show you what I could do in the way of a lamentation,"
said the major."If you've had enough I'll stop of course; but tell me,"
he added, sitting down upon a cake of ice, and crossing his legs, "how
on earth did you ever get hold of the ridiculous notion that I ran away
frightened?"The minute
the sprite was changed into Bludgeonhead I turned to speak to you, and
all I could see of you was your coat-tails disappearing around the
corner way down the road.""And just because my coat-tails behaved like that you put me down as a
coward?"I hurried
off; but not because I was afraid.I was simply going down the road to
see if I couldn't find a looking-glass so that Spriteyboy could see how
he looked as a giant.""That's a magnificent excuse," he said."I thought you'd think it was," said the major, with a pleased smile."And when I finally found that there weren't any mirrors to be had
along the road I went back, and you two had gone and left me."It's a great thing, sleep is, and I wrote the
lines off in two tenths of a fifth of a second.As I remember it, this
is the way they went:

    "SLEEP.Deserted by my friends I sit,
       And silently I weep,
     Until I'm wearied so by it,
     I lose my little store of wit;
       I nod and fall asleep.Then in my dreams my friends I spy--
       Once more are they my own.I cease to murmur and to cry,
     For then 'tis sure to be that I
       Forget I am alone.'Tis hence I think that sleep's the best
       Of friends that man has got--
      Not only does it bring him rest
     But makes him feel that he is blest
       With blessings he has not.""Why didn't you go to sleep if you felt that way?""I wanted to find you and I hadn't time.There was only time for me to
scratch that poem off on my mind and start to find you and Bludgeyboy,"
replied the major."His name isn't Bludgeyboy," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."Oh, yes, I forgot," said the major."It's a good name, too,
Bludgeonpate is.""How did you come to be captured by Fortyforefoot?"asked Jimmieboy,
after he had decided not to try to correct the major any more as to
Bludgeonhead's name."The idea of a miserable
ogre like Fortyforefoot capturing me, the most sagacitacious soldier of
modern times.I suppose you think I fell into one of his game traps?""That's what he said," said Jimmieboy."He said you acted in a very
curious way, too--promised him all sorts of things if he'd let you go.""That's just like those big, bragging giants," said the major.I came here of my own free will
and accord."Down here into this pantry and into the ice-chest?You can't fool me," said Jimmieboy."To meet you, of course," retorted the major.I knew it
was part of your scheme to come here.You and I were to be put into the
pantry and then old Bludgeyhat was to come and rescue us.I was the one
to make the scheme, wasn't I?"It was Bludgeonhead," said Jimmieboy, who didn't know whether to
believe the major or not."That's just the way," said the major, indignantly, "he gets all the
credit just because he's big and I don't get any, and yet if you knew of
all the wild animals I've killed to get here to you, how I met
Fortyforefoot and bound him hand and foot and refused to let him go
unless he would permit me to spend a week in his ice-chest, for the sole
and only purpose that I wished to meet you again, you'd change your mind
mighty quick about me.""Did you ever see me in a real sham battle?""No, I never did," said Jimmieboy."Well, you'd better never," returned the major, "unless you want to be
frightened out of your wits.I have been called the living telescope,
sir, because when I begin to fight, in the fiercest manner possible, I
sort of lengthen out and sprout up into the air until I am taller than
any foe within my reach."queried Jimmieboy, with a puzzled air about him."Well, I should like to see it once," said Jimmieboy."Then you will never believe it," returned the major, "because you will
never see it.I never fight in the presence of others, sir."As the major spoke these words a heavy footstep was heard on the stairs.cried the major, springing to his feet."I do not ask you for your gold,
       Nor for an old straw hat--
     I simply ask that I be told
       Oh what, oh what is that?""It is a footstep on the stairs," said Jimmieboy.moaned the major "If it is Fortyforefoot all is
over for us."I was afraid he could not wait,
       The miserable sinner,
     To serve me up in proper state
       At his to-morrow's dinner.Alas, he comes I greatly fear
       In search of Major Me, sir,
     And that he'll wash me down with beer
       This very night at tea, sir.""Oh, why did I come here--why----"

"I shall!"roared a voice out in the passage-way."You shall not," roared another voice, which Jimmieboy was delighted to
recognize as Bludgeonhead's."I am hungry," said the first voice, "and what is mine is my own to do
with as I please."I will toss you into the air, my dear Fortyforefoot," returned
Bludgeonhead's voice, "if you advance another step; and with such force,
sir, that you will never come down again."Stand aside," roared the voice of
Fortyforefoot.The two prisoners in the pantry heard a tremendous scuffling, a crash,
and a loud laugh.Then Bludgeonhead's voice was heard again."Good-by, Fortyforefoot," it cried."I hope he is not going to leave us," whispered Jimmieboy, but the major
was too frightened to speak, and he trembled so that half a dozen times
he fell off the ice-cake that he had been sitting on."Give my love to the moon when you pass her, and when you get up into
the milky way turn half a million of the stars there into baked apples
and throw 'em down to me," called Bludgeonhead's voice."If you'll only lasso me and pull me back I'll do anything you want me
to," came the voice of Fortyforefoot from some tremendous height, it
seemed to Jimmieboy."Not if I know it," replied Bludgeonhead, with a laugh."I think I'd
like to settle down here myself as the owner of Fortyforefoot Valley.Whatever answer was made to this it was too indistinct for Jimmieboy to
hear, and in a minute the key of the pantry door was turned, the door
thrown open, and Bludgeonhead stood before them."You are free," he said, grasping Jimmieboy's hand and squeezing it
affectionately."But I had to get rid of him.It was the only way to do
it."And did you really throw him off into the air?"asked Jimmieboy, as he
walked out into the hall.ejaculated Jimmieboy, as he glanced upward and saw a huge rent in
the ceiling, through which, gradually rising and getting smaller and
smaller the further he rose, was to be seen the unfortunate
Fortyforefoot."I simply picked him up and tossed him over
my head.I shall turn myself into Fortyforefoot
and settle down here forever, only instead of being a bad giant I shall
be a good one--but hallo!The major had crawled out of the ice-chest and was now trying to appear
calm, although his terrible fright still left him trembling so that he
could hardly speak."It is Major Blueface," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."He was Fortyforefoot's other prisoner.""N--nun--not at--t--at--at all," stammered the major."I
def--fuf--feated him in sus--single combat.""But what are you trembling so for now?""I--I am--m not tut--trembling," retorted the major."I--I am o--only
sh--shivering with--th--the--c--c--c--cold.I--I--I've bub--been in
th--that i--i--i--ice bu--box sus--so long."Jimmieboy and Bludgeonhead roared with laughter at this.Then giving the
major a warm coat to put on they sent him up stairs to lie down and
recover his nerves.After the major had been attended to, Bludgeonhead changed himself back
into the sprite again, and he and Jimmieboy sauntered in and out among
the gardens for an hour or more and were about returning to the castle
for supper when they heard sounds of music.There was evidently a brass
band coming up the road.In an instant they hid themselves behind a
tree, from which place of concealment they were delighted two or three
minutes later to perceive that the band was none other than that of the
"Jimmieboy Guards," and that behind it, in splendid military form,
appeared Colonel Zinc followed by the tin soldiers themselves.cried Jimmieboy, throwing his cap into the air.shrieked the colonel, waving his sword with delight, and
commanding his regiment to halt, as he caught sight of Jimmieboy.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD COMES TO THE RESCUE.[Blank Page]

"Us likewise!"cheered the soldiers: following which came a trembling
voice from one of the castle windows which said:

    "I also wish to add my cheer
       Upon this happy day;
     And if you'll kindly come up here
       You'll hear me cry 'Hooray.'""No," said the sprite, motioning to Jimmieboy not to betray the major."Only a little worn-out by the fight we have had with Fortyforefoot.""Yes," said the sprite, modestly."We three have got rid of him at
last.""Do you know who
Fortyforefoot really was?"asked Jimmieboy, his curiosity aroused."The Parallelopipedon himself," said the colonel."We found that out
last night, and fearing that he might have captured our general and our
major we came here to besiege him in his castle and rescue our
officers.""But I don't see how Fortyforefoot could have been the
Parallelopipedon," said Jimmieboy."What would he want to be him for,
when, all he had to do to get anything he wanted was to take sand and
turn it into it?""Ah, but don't you see," explained the colonel, "there was one thing he
never could do as Fortyforefoot.The law prevented him from leaving this
valley here in any other form than that of the Parallelopipedon.He
didn't mind his confinement to the valley very much at first, but after
a while he began to feel cooped up here, and then he took an old packing
box and made it look as much like a living Parallelopipedon as he could.Then he got into it whenever he wanted to roam about the world.Probably
if you will search the castle you will find the cast-off shell he used
to wear, and if you do I hope you will destroy it, because it is said to
be a most horrible spectacle--frightening animals to death and causing
every flower within a mile to wither and shrink up at the mere sight of
it.""It's all true, Jimmieboy," said the sprite.Why,
he only gave us those cherries and peaches there in exchange for
yourself because he expected to get them all back again, you know.""It was a glorious victory," said the colonel."I will now announce it
to the soldiers."This he did and the soldiers were wild with joy when they heard the
news, and the band played a hymn of victory in which the soldiers
joined, singing so vigorously that they nearly cracked their voices.When they had quite finished the colonel said he guessed it was time to
return to the barracks in the nursery."Not before the feast," said the sprite."We have here all the
provisions the general set out to get, and before you return home,
colonel, you and your men should divide them among you."So the table was spread and all went happily.In the midst of the feast
the major appeared, determination written upon every line of his face.The soldiers cheered him loudly as he walked down the length of the
table, which he acknowledged as gracefully as he could with a stiff bow,
and then he spoke:

"Gentlemen," he said, "I have always been a good deal of a favorite with
you, and I know that what I am about to do will fill you with deep
grief.I am going to stop being a man of war.The tremendous victory we
have won to-day is the result entirely of the efforts of myself, General
Jimmieboy and Major Sprite--for to the latter I now give the title I
have borne so honorably for so many years.Our present victory is one of
such brilliantly brilliant brilliance that I feel that I may now retire
with lustre enough attached to my name to last for millions and millions
of years.I need rest, and here I shall take it, in this beautiful
valley, which by virtue of our victory belongs wholly and in equal parts
to General Jimmieboy, Major Sprite and myself.Hereafter I shall be
known only as Mortimer Carraway Blueface, Poet Laureate of Fortyforefoot
Hall, Fortyforefoot Valley, Pictureland.As Governor-General of the
country we have decided to appoint our illustrious friend, Major
Benjamin Bludgeonhead Sprite.General Jimmieboy will remain commander of
the forces, and the rest of you may divide amongst yourselves, as a
reward for your gallant services, all the provisions that may now be
left upon this table.That
is that you do not take the table.It is of solid mahogany and must be
worth a very considerable sum.Now let the saddest word be said,
    Now bend in sorrow deep the head.Let tears flow forth and drench the dell:
    Farewell, brave soldier boys, farewell."Here the major wiped his eyes sadly and sat down by the sprite who shook
his hand kindly and thanked him for giving him his title of major."We'll have fine times living here together," said the sprite."I'm going to see if I can't have
myself made over again, too, Spritey.I'll be pleasanter for you to look
at.What's the use of being a tin soldier in a place where even the
cobblestones are of gold and silver.""You can be plated any how," said Jimmieboy."Yes, and maybe I can have a platinum sword put in, and a real solid
gold head--but just at present that isn't what I want," said the major."What I am after now is a piece of birthday cake with real fruit raisins
in it and strips of citron two inches long, the whole concealed beneath
a one inch frosting."I don't think we have any here," said Jimmieboy, who was much pleased
to see the sprite and the major, both of whom he dearly loved, on such
good terms."But I'll run home and see if I can get some.""Well, we'll all go with you," said the colonel, starting up and
ordering the trumpeters to sound the call to arms."All except Blueface and myself," said the sprite."We will stay here
and put everything in readiness for your return.""That is a good idea," said Jimmieboy."And you'll have to hurry for we
shall be back very soon."This, as it turned out, was a very rash promise for Jimmieboy to make,
for after he and the tin soldiers had got the birthday cake and were
ready to enter Pictureland once more, they found that not one of them
could do it, the frame was so high up and the picture itself so hard
and impenetrable.Jimmieboy felt so badly to be unable to return to his
friends, that, following the major's hint about sleep bringing
forgetfulness of trouble, he threw himself down on the nursery couch,
and closing his brimming eyes dozed off into a dreamless sleep.It was quite dark when he opened them again and found himself still on
the couch with a piece of his papa's birthday cake in his hand, his
sorrows all gone and contentment in their place.His papa was sitting at
his side, and his mamma was standing over by the window smiling."You've had a good long nap, Jimmieboy," said she, "and I rather think,
from several things I've heard you say in your sleep, you've been
dreaming about your tin soldiers.""I don't believe it was a dream, mamma," he said, "it was all too real."And then he told his papa all that had happened."Well, it is very singular," said his papa, when Jimmieboy had finished,
"and if you want to believe it all happened you may; but you say all the
soldiers came back with you except Major Blueface?""Yes, every one," said Jimmieboy."Then we can tell whether it was true or not by looking in the tin
soldier's box.If the major isn't there he may be up in Fortyforefoot
castle as you say."Jimmieboy climbed eagerly down from the couch and rushing to the toy
closet got out the box of soldiers and searched it from top to bottom.The major was not to be seen anywhere, nor to this day has Jimmieboy
ever again set eyes upon him.Transcriber's Note:

The use of capitalisation for major and general has been retained as
appears in the original publication.Changes have been made as follows:

    Page 60
    ejaculated the Paralleopipedon _changed to_
    ejaculated the Parallelopipedon?Surrounded by these pleasant fields and faithful friends,
by those I have loved, I hope to end my days.The farmers should vote only for such men as are able and willing to
guard and advance the interests of labor.We should know better than
to vote for men who will deliberately put a tariff of three dollars
a thousand upon Canada lumber, when every farmer in the States is a
purchaser of lumber.People who live upon the prairies ought to vote for
cheap lumber.We ought to have intelligence
enough to know what we want and how to get it.The real laboring men of
this country can succeed if they are united.By laboring men, I do not
mean only the farmers.I mean all who contribute in some way to the
general welfare.Eat the best things you raise and sell
the rest.Have good things to cook and good things to cook with.Of all
people in our country, you should live the best.Throw your miserable
little stoves out of the window.Get ranges, and have them so built that
your wife need not burn her face off to get you a breakfast.Do not make
her cook in a kitchen hot as the orthodox perdition.The beef, not the
cook, should be roasted.It is just as easy to have things convenient
and right as to have them any other way.There is no reason why farmers should not be the kindest and most
cultivated of men.There is nothing in plowing the fields to make men
cross, cruel and crabbed.To look upon the sunny <DW72>s covered with
daisies does not tend to make men unjust.Whoever labors for the
happiness of those he loves, elevates himself, no matter whether he
works in the dreary shop or the perfumed field.The wagons stood
in the sun and rain, and the plows rusted in the fields.There was
no leisure, no feeling that the work was done.It was all labor and
weariness and vexation of spirit.The crops were destroyed by wandering
herds, or they were put in too late, or too early, or they were blown
down, or caught by the frost, or devoured by bugs, or stung by flies,
or eaten by worms, or carried away by birds, or dug up by gophers, or
washed away by floods, or dried up by the sun, or rotted in the stack,
or heated in the crib, or they all ran to vines, or tops, or straw, or
cobs.And when in spite of all these accidents that lie in wait between
the plow and reaper, they did succeed in raising a good crop and a high
price was offered, then the roads would be impassable.And when the
roads got good, then the prices went down.The Farmer's Happy Winter

I can imagine no condition that carries with it such a promise of joy
as that of the farmer in early winter.He has his cellar filled--he had
made every preparation for the days of snow and storm--he looks forward
to three months of ease and rest; to three months of fireside content;
three months with wife and children; three months of long, delightful
evenings; three months of home; three months of solid comfort.The Almighty Dollar

Ainsworth R. Spofford--says Col.Ingersoll--gives the following facts
about interest: "One dollar loaned for one hundred years at six per
cent., with the interest collected annually and added to the principal,
will amount to three hundred and forty dollars.At eight per cent, it
amounts to two thousand two hundred and three dollars.At three per
cent, it amounts only to nineteen dollars and twenty-five cents.At ten
per cent, it is thirteen thousand eight hundred and nine dollars, or
about seven hundred times as much.At twelve per cent, it amounts
to eighty-four thousand and seventy-five dollars, or more than four
thousand times as much.At eighteen per cent, it amounts to fifteen
million one hundred and forty-five thousand and seven dollars.At
twenty-four per cent, it reaches the enormous sum of two billion, five
hundred and fifty-one million, seven hundred and ninety-five thousand,
four hundred and four dollars!"One dollar at compound interest, at
twenty-four per cent., for one hundred years, would produce a sum equal
to our national debt.The Farmer in Debt

Interest eats night and day, and the more it eats the hungrier it grows.The farmer in debt, lying awake at night, can, if he listens, hear it
gnaw.If he owes nothing, he can hear his corn grow.Get out of debt,
as soon as you possibly can.You have supported idle avarice and lazy
economy long enough.Own Your Own Home

There can be no such thing in the highest sense as a home unless you own
it.There must be an incentive to plant trees, to beautify the grounds,
to preserve and improve.It elevates a man to own a home.It gives a
certain independence, a force of character that is obtained in no other
way.A man without a home feels like a passenger.There is in such a man
a little of the vagrant.He who has sat by his
own fireside with wife and children, will defend it.Few men have been
patriotic enough to shoulder a musket in defense of a boarding-house.The prosperity and glory of our country depend upon the number of people
who are the owners of homes.What to do with the Idlers

Our country is filled with the idle and unemployed, and the great
question asking for an answer is: What shall be done with these men?To this there is but one answer: They must
cultivate the soil.Those who work
the land must have an honest pride in their business.They must educate
their children to cultivate the soil.Farm-Life Lonely

I say again, if you want more men and women on the farms, something must
be done to make farm-life pleasant.One great difficulty is that the
farm is lonely.People write about the pleasures of solitude, but they
are found only in books.The Best Farming States

The farmer in the Middle States has the best soil--the greatest return
for the least labor--more leisure--more time for enjoyment than any
other farmer in the world.He has the
long winters in which to become acquainted with his family--with his
neighbors--in which to read and keep abreast with the advanced thought
of his day.He has the time and means of self-culture.He has more time
than the mechanic, the merchant or the professional man.If the farmer
is not well informed it is his own fault.Books are cheap, and every
farmer can have enough to give him the outline of every science, and an
idea of all that has been accomplished by man.The Laborers, the Kings and Queens

The farmer has been elevated through science, and he should not forget
the debt he owes to the mechanic, to the inventor, to the thinker.He
should remember that all laborers belong to the same grand family--that
they are the real kings and queens, the only true nobility.HOME AND CHILDREN

Crossing the Alps," you can't tell after she has played it whether
Bonaparte ever got across or not.Men are oaks, women are vines,
children are flowers, and if there is any Heaven in this world it is
in the family.It is where the wife loves the husband, and the husband
loves the wife, and where the dimpled arms of children are about the
necks of both.I want to tell you this, you cannot get the robe of hypocrisy on you so
thick that the sharp eye of childhood will not see through every veil.Love and Freedom in a Cabin

I would rather go to the forest far away and build me a little
cabin--build it myself and daub it with mud, and live there with my wife
aud family--and have a little path that led down to the spring, where
the water bubbled out day and night, like a little poem from the heart
of the earth; a little hut with some hollyhocks at the corner, with
their bannered bosoms open to the sun, and with the thrush in the air,
like a song of joy in the morning; I would rather live there and have
some lattice work across the window, so that the sunlight would fall
checkered on the baby in the cradle; I would rather live there and have
my soul erect and free, than to live in a palace of gold and wear the
crown of imperial power and know that my soul was slimy with hypocrisy.The Turnpike Road of Happiness

Whoever marries simply for himself will make a mistake; but whoever
loves a woman so well that he says, "I will make her happy," makes no
mistake; and so with the woman who says, "I will make him happy."There
is only one way to be happy, and that is to make somebody else so, and
you can't be happy cross-lots; you have got to go the regular turnpike
road.Love Paying Ten Per Cent

I tell you to-night there is on the average more love in the homes of
the poor than in the palaces of the rich; and the meanest hut with love
in it is fit for the gods, and a palace without love is a den only fit
for wild beasts.You can't be so poor but that you
can help somebody.Good nature is the cheapest commodity in the world;
and love is the only thing that will pay ten per cent, to borrower and
lender both.Don't tell me that you have got to be rich!We have all a
false standard of greatness in the United States.We think here that a
man to be great must be notorious; he must be extremely wealthy or his
name must be between the lips of rumor.It is not
necessary to be rich to be great, or to be powerful to be happy; and the
happy man is the successful man.Happiness is the legal-tender of the
soul.A Word to the Cross-Grained

A cross man I hate above all things.What right has he to murder the
sunshine of the day?What right has he to assassinate the joy of life?When you go home you ought to feel the light there is in the house;
if it is in the night it will burst out of the doors and windows and
illuminate the darkness.It is just as well to go home a ray of sunshine
as an old, sour, cross curmudgeon, who thinks he is the head of the
family.Wise men think their mighty brains have been in a turmoil; they
have been thinking about who will be alderman from the Fifth ward; they
have been thinking about politics; great and mighty questions have been
engaging their minds; they have bought calico at eight cents or six, and
want to sell it for seven.Think of the intellectual strain that must
have been upon a man, and when he gets home everybody else in the house
must look out for his comfort.Daughters and Wives be Beautiful

I am a believer in fashion.It is the duty of every woman to make
herself as beautiful and attractive as she possibly can."Handsome is
as handsome does," but she is much handsomer if well dressed.The time
never ought to come in this country when you can tell a farmer's
daughter simply by the garments she wears.I say to every girl and
woman, no matter what the material of your dress may be, no matter how
cheap and coarse it is, cut it and make it in the fashion.Some people look upon it as barbaric, but in my judgment,
wearing jewelry is the first evidence the barbarian gives of a wish to
be civilized.To adorn ourselves seems to be a part of our nature, and
this desire, seems to be everywhere and in everything.I have sometimes
thought that the desire for beauty covers the earth with flowers.It
is this desire that paints the wings of moths, tints the chamber of the
shell, and gives the bird its plumage and its song.daughters and
wives if you would be loved, adorn yourselves--if you would be adorned,
be beautiful!A Wholesome Word to the Stingy

I despise a stingy man.I don't see how it is possible for a man to die
worth fifty millions of dollars or ten millions of dollars, in a city
full of want, when he meets almost every day the withered hand of
beggary and the white lips of famine.How a man can withstand all
that, and hold in the clutch of his greed twenty or thirty millions
of dollars, is past my comprehension.I do not see how he can do it.I
should not think he could do it any more than he could keep a pile of
lumber where hundreds and thousands of men were drowning in the sea.I
should not think he could do it.Do you know I have known men who would
trust their wives with their hearts and their honor, but not with their
pocketbook; not with a dollar.When I see a man of that kind I always
think he knows which of these articles is the most valuable.The Boss of the Family

If you are the grand emperor of the world, you had better be the grand
emperor of one loving and tender heart, and she the grand empress of
yours.The man who has really won the love of one good woman in this
world, I do not care if he dies a beggar, his life has been a success.I tell you it is an infamous word and an infamous feeling--a man who is
"boss," who is going to govern in his family; and when he speaks let all
the rest of them be still; some mighty idea is about to be launched from
his mouth.A good way to make children tell the truth is to tell it yourself.Keep
your word with your child the same as you would with your banker.Be
perfectly honor bright with your children, and they will be your friends
when you are old.The Opera at the Table

I like to hear children at the table telling what big things they have
seen during the day; I like to hear their merry voices mingling with the
clatter of knives and forks.I had rather hear that than any opera that
was ever put upon the stage.A Child's laugh sweeter than Apollo's lyre

I said, and I say again, no day can be so sacred but that the laugh of
a child will make the holiest day more sacred still.Strike with hand
of fire, oh, weird musician, thy harp, strung with Apollo's golden
hair; fill the vast cathedral aisles with symphonies sweet and dim, deft
toucher of the organ keys; blow, bugler, blow, until thy silver notes do
touch the skies, with moonlit waves, and charm the lovers wandering on
the vine-clad hills: but know, your sweetest strains are discords all,
compared with childhood's happy laugh, the laugh that fills the eyes
with light and every heart with joy; oh, rippling river of life, thou
art the blessed boundary-line between the beasts and man, and every
wayward wave of thine doth drown some fiend of care; oh, laughter,
divine daughter of joy, make dimples enough in the cheeks of the world
to catch and hold and glorify all the tears of grief.Don't Wake the Children

Let your children sleep.Do not drag them from their beds in the
darkness of night.Do not compel them to associate all that is tiresome,
irksome and dreadful with cultivating the soil.Treat your children with
infinite kindness--treat them as equals.There is no happiness in a home
not filled with love.When the husband hates his wife--where the wife
hates the husband; where the children hate their parents and each
other--there is a hell upon earth.How to Deal with Children

Some Christians act as though they thought when the Lord said, "Suffer
little children to come unto me," that he had a rawhide under his
mantle--they act as if they thought so.I tell my
children this: Go where you may, commit what crime you may, fall to what
depths of degradation you may, I can never shut my arms, my heart or my
door to you.As long as I live you shall have one sincere friend; do not
be afraid to tell anything wrong you have done; ten to one if I have not
done the same thing.I am not perfection, and if it is necessary to sin
in order to have sympathy, I am glad I have committed sin enough to have
sympathy.The sterness of perfection I do not want.I am going to live
so that my children can come to my grave and truthfully say, "He who
sleeps here never gave us one moment of pain."Whether you call that
religion or infidelity, suit yourselves; that is the way I intend to do
it.Give a Child a Chance

Do not create a child to be a post set in an orthodox row; raise
investigators and thinkers, not disciples and followers; cultivate
reason, not faith; cultivate investigation, not superstition; and if
you have any doubt yourself about a thing being so, tell them about it;
don't tell them the world was made in six days--if you think six days
means six good whiles, tell them six good whiles.If you have any doubts
about anybody being in a furnace and not being burnt, or even getting
uncomfortably warm, tell them so--be honest about it.If you look upon
the jaw-bone of a donkey as not a good weapon, say so.If you think a man never went to sea in a fish, tell them so, it
won't make them any worse.Be honest--that's all; don't cram their heads
with things that will take them years to unlearn; tell them facts--it
is just as easy.It is as easy to find out botany, and astronomy, and
geology, and history--it is as easy to find out all these things as to
cram their minds with things you know nothing about.The Greatest Liars in Michigan

I was over in Michigan the other day.There was a boy over there at
Grand Rapids about five or six years old, a nice, smart boy, as you will
see from the remark he made--what you might call a nineteenth century
boy.His father and mother had promised to take him out riding for about
three weeks, and they would slip off and go without him.Well, after
a while that got kind of played out with the little boy, and the day
before I was there they played the trick on him again.They went out and
got the carriage, and went away, and as they rode away from the front of
the house, he happened to be standing there with his nurse, and he
saw them.The whole thing flashed on him in a moment.He took in the
situation, and turned to his nurse and said, pointing to his father and
mother: "There go the two biggest liars in the State of Michigan!"When
you go home fill the house with joy, so that the light of it will stream
out the windows and doors, and illuminate even the darkness.It is just
as easy that way as any in the world.When your child confesses to you that it has com mitted a fault, take
the child in your arms, and let it feel your heart beat against its
heart, and raise your children in the sunlight of love, and they will be
sunbeams to you along the pathway of life.Abolish the club and the whip
from the house, because, if the civilized use a whip, the ignorant and
the brutal will use a club, and they will use it because you use the
whip.A Solemn Satire on Whipping Children

If there is one of you here that ever expect to whip your child again,
let me ask you something.Have your photograph taken at the time, and
let it show your face red with vulgar anger, and the face of the little
one with eyes swimming in tears.If that little child should die I
cannot think of a sweeter way to spend an Autumn afternoon than to take
that photograph and go to the cemetery, where the maples are clad in
tender gold, and when little scarlet runners are coming, like poems of
regret, from the sad heart of the earth; and sit down upon that mound,
I look upon that photograph, and think of the flesh, made dust, that you
beat.I could not bear to die in the arms of a child
that I had whipped.I could not bear to feel upon my lips, when they
were withering beneath the touch of death, the kiss of one that I had
struck.Children are better treated than they used to be; the old whips and
gods are out of the schools, and they are governing children by love and
sense.The world is getting better; it is getting better in Maine.It
has got better in Maine, in Vermont.It is getting better in every State
of the North.INDIVIDUALITY




38.Absolute Independence of the Individual

What we want to-day is what our fathers wrote.They did not attain to
their ideal; we approach it nearer, but have not yet reached it.We
want, not only the independence of a state, not only the independence of
a nation, but something far more glorious--the absolute independence of
the individual.I want it so that I, one of the
children of Nature, can stand on an equality with the rest; that I can
say this is my air, my sunshine, my earth, and I have a right to live,
and hope, and aspire, and labor, and enjoy the fruit of that labor, as
much as any individual, or any nation on the face of the globe.Saved by Disobedience

I tell you there is something splendid in man that will not always mind.Why, if we had done as the kings told us five hundred years ago, we
would all have been slaves.If we had done as the priests told us, we
would all have been idiots.If we had done as the doctors told us, we
would all have been dead.We have
been saved by that splendid thing called independence, and I want to
see more of it, day after day, and I want to see children raised so they
will have it.Intellectual Tyranny

Nothing can be more infamous than intellectual tyranny.To put chains
upon the body is as nothing compared with putting shackles on the brain.No god is entitled to the worship or the respect of man who does not
give, even to the meanest of his children, every right that he claims
for himself.Say What You Think

I do not believe that the tendency is to make men and women brave and
glorious when you tell them that there are certain ideas upon certain
subjects that they must never express; that they must go through life
with a pretense as a shield; that their neighbors will think much more
of them if they will only keep still; and that above all is a God who
despises one who honestly expresses what he believes.For my part, I
believe men will be nearer honest in business, in politics, grander in
art--in everything that is good and grand and beautiful, if they are
taught from the cradle to the coffin to tell their honest opinions.I Want to Put Out the Fires of Hell

Some people tell me that I take away the hope of immortality.I want to put out the fires of hell.I want to
transfer the war from this earth to heaven.Some tell me Jehovah is God,
and another says Ali is God, and another that Brahma is God.I say, let
Jehovah, and Ali, and Brahma fight it out.Let them fight it out there,
and whoever is victor, to that God I will bow.The Puritans

When the Puritans first came they were narrow.They did not understand
what liberty meant--what religious liberty, what political liberty, was;
but they found out in a few years.There was one feeling among them that
rises to their eternal honor like a white shaft to the clouds--they were
in favor of universal education.Wherever they went they built school
houses, introduced books, and ideas of literature.They believed that
every man should know how to read and how to write, and should find out
all that his capacity allowed him to comprehend.That is the glory of
the Puritan fathers.A Star in the Sky of Despair

Every Christian, every philanthropist, every believer in human liberty,
should feel under obligation to Thomas Paine for the splendid service
rendered by him in the darkest days of the American Revolution.In the
midnight of Valley Forge, "The Crisis" was the first star that glittered
in the wide horizon of despair.Every good man should remember with
gratitude the brave words spoken by Thomas Paine in the French
Convention against the death of Louis.He said: "We will kill the king,
but not the man.You send missionaries to Turkey, and tell them that the Koran is a lie.You tell them that Mahomet was not a prophet.You go to India, and you tell them
that Vishnu was nothing, that Purana was nothing, that Buddha was
nobody, and your Brahma, he is nothing.You should not do that; you ought not to hurt their feelings.I tell you
no man on earth has a right to be shocked at the expression of an honest
opinion when it is kindly done, and I don't believe there is any God in
the universe who has put a curtain over the fact and made it a crime for
the honest hand of investigation to endeavor to draw that curtain.I will Settle with God Myself

They say to me, "God will punish you forever, if you do these things."I had rather settle with him than
any one of his agents.In theology I am a
granger--I do not believe in middlemen.What little business I have with
Heaven I will attend to myself.I Claim my Right to Guess

I claim, standing under the flag of nature, under the blue and the
stars, that I am the peer of any other man, and have the right to think
and express my thoughts.I claim that in the presence of the Unknown,
and upon a subject that nobody knows anything about, and never did, I
have as good a right to _guess_ as anybody else.The Brain a Castle

Surely it is worth something to feel that there are no priests, no
popes, no parties, no governments, no kings, no gods, to whom your
intellect can be compelled to pay reluctant homage.Surely it is a joy
to know that all the cruel ingenuity of bigotry can devise no prison,
no dungeon, no cell in which for one instant to confine a thought; that
ideas cannot be dislocated by racks, nor crushed in iron boots, nor
burned with fire.Surely it is sublime to think that the brain is a
castle, and that within its curious bastions and winding halls the
soul, in spite of all words and all beings, is the supreme sovereign of
itself.I am Something

The universe is all there is, or was, or will be.It is both subject and
object; contemplator and contemplated; creator and created; destroyer
and destroyed; preserver and preserved; and hath within itself all
causes, modes, motions, and effects.Without the
all, the infinite cannot be.Every Man a Bight to Think

Now we have come to the conclusion that every man has a right to think.Would God give a bird wings and make it a crime to fly?Would he give me
brains and make it a crime to think?Any God that would damn one of his
children for the expression of his honest thought wouldn't make a decent
thief.When I read a book and don't believe it, I ought to say so.I
will do so and take the consequence like a man.Too Early to Write a Creed

These are the excuses I have for my race, and taking everything into
consideration, I think we have done extremely well.Let us have more
liberty and free thought.It is too
early in the history of the world to write a creed.Our fathers were
intellectual slaves; our fathers were intellectual serfs.There never
has been a free generation on the globe.Every creed you have got bears
the mark of whip, and chain, and fagot.There has been no creed written by a free brain.Wait until we have had
two or three generations of liberty and it will then be time enough to
seize the swift horse of progress by the bridle and say--thus far and
no farther; and in the meantime let us be kind to each other; let us be
decent towards each other.We are all travelers on the great plain we
call life, and there is nobody quite sure what road to take--not just
dead sure, you know.There are lots of guide-boards on the plain and you
find thousands of people swearing to-day that their guide-board is the
only board that shows the right direction.I go and talk to them and
they say: "You go that way, or you will be damned."I go to another and
they say: "You go this way, or you will be damned."Every Mind True to Itself

In my judgment, every human being should take a road of his own.Every
mind should be true to itself--should think, investigate and conclude
for itself.This is a duty alike incumbent upon pauper and prince.In every age some men carried the torch of progress and handed it
to some other, and it has been carried through all the dark ages of
barbarism, and had it not been for such men we would have been naked
and uncivilized to-night, with pictures of wild beasts tattooed on our
skins, dancing around some dried snake fetish.Gold makes a Barren Landscape

Only a few days ago I was where they wrench the precious metals from
the miserly clutch of the rocks.When I saw the mountains; treeless,
shrubless, flowerless, without even a spire of grass, it seemed to me
that gold had the same effect upon the country that holds it, as upon
the man who lives and labors only for it.It affects the land as it
does the man.It leaves the heart barren without a flower of
kindness--without a blossom of pity.A Grand Achievement

There is nothing grander than to rescue from the leprosy of slander the
reputation of a great and generous name.There is nothing nobler than to
benefit our benefactors.The Divorce of Church and State

The Constitution of the United States was the first decree entered in
the high court of a nation, forever divorcing Church and State.Professors

Instead of dismissing professors for finding something out, let us
rather discharge those who do not.Let each teacher understand that
investigation is not dangerous for him; that his bread is safe, no
matter how much truth he may discover, and that his salary will not be
reduced, simply because he finds that the ancient Jews did not know the
entire history of the world.Developement

I thought after all I had rather belong to a race of people that came
from skulless vertebrae in the dim Laurentian period, that wiggled
without knowing they were wiggling, that began to develope and came up
by a gradual developement until they struck this gentleman in the dugout
coming up slowly--up--up--up--until, for instance, they produced such a
man as Shakespeare--he who harvested all the fields of dramatic thought,
and after whom all others have been only gleaners of straw, he who found
the human intellect dwelling in a hut, touched it with the wand of his
genius and it became a palace--producing him and hundreds of others I
might mention--with the angels of progress leaning over the far horizon
beckoning this race of work and thought--I had rather belong to a race
commencing at the skulless vertebrae producing the gentleman in the
dugout and so on up, than to have descended from a perfect pair, upon
which the Lord has lost money from that day to this.I had rather belong
to a race that is going up than to one that is going down.I would
rather belong to one that commenced at the skulless vertebrae and
started for perfection, than to belong to one that started from
perfection and started for the skulless vertebrae.Poet's Dream

When every church becomes a school, every cathedral a university, every
clergyman a teacher, and all their hearers brave and honest
thinkers, then, and not until then, will the dream of poet, patriot,
philanthropist and philosopher, become a real and blessed truth.The Temple of the Future

We are laying the foundations of the grand temple of the future--not the
temple of all the gods, but of all the people--wherein, with appropriate
rites, will be celebrated the religion of Humanity.We are doing what
little we can to hasten the coming of the day when society shall cease
producing millionaires and mendicants--gorged indolence and famished
industry--truth in rags, and superstition robed and crowned.We are
looking for the time when the useful shall be the honorable; and when
Reason, throned upon the world's brain, shall be the King of Kings, and
God of Gods.The final Goal

We do not expect to accomplish everything in our day; but we want to
do what good we can, and to render all the service possible in the
holy cause of human progress.We know that doing away with gods and
supernatural persons and powers is not an end.It is a means to the end;
the real end being the happiness of man.The Eighteenth Century

At that time the seeds sown by the great Infidels were beginning to
bear fruit in France.The Eighteenth
Century was crowning its gray hairs with the wreath of Progress.On
every hand Science was bearing testimony against the Church.Voltaire
had filled Europe with light; D'Holbach was giving to the _elite_
of Paris the principles contained in his "System of Nature."The
Encyclopedists had attacked superstition with information for the
masses.A few had the
courage to keep their shoes on and let the bush burn.America had set an
example to the world.The word Liberty was in the mouths of men, and
they began to wipe the dust from their knees.The dawn of a new day had
appeared.POLITICAL QUESTIONS




63.Ours is the only flag that
has in reality written upon it: Liberty, Fraternity, Equality--the three
grandest words in all the languages of men.Liberty: Give to every man
the fruit of his own labor--the labor of his hand and of his brain.Fraternity: Every man in the right is my brother.Equality: The rights
of all are equal.No race, no color, no previous condition, can change
the rights of men.The Declaration of Independence has at last been
carried out in letter and in spirit.To-day the black man looks upon his
child and says: The avenues of distinction are open to you--upon your
brow may fall the civic wreath.We are celebrating the courage and
wisdom of our fathers, and the glad shout of a free people, the anthem
of a grand nation, commencing at the Atlantic, is following the sun to
the Pacific, across a continent of happy homes.Is it
nothing to fill the world with light, with discovery, with science?Is it nothing to dignify man and exalt the intellect?Is it nothing to
grope your way into the dreary prisons, the damp and dropping dungeons,
the dark and silent cells of superstition, where the souls of men
are chained to floors of stone?Is it nothing to conduct these souls
gradually into the blessed light of day,--to let them see again the
happy fields, the sweet, green earth, and hear the everlasting music of
the waves?Is it nothing to make men wipe the dust from their swollen
knees, the tears from their blanched and furrowed cheeks?Is it nothing
to relieve the heavens of an insatiate monster, and write upon the
eternal dome, glittering with stars, the grand word--Liberty?Ingersoll Not a Politician

I want it perfectly understood that I am not a politician.I believe in
liberty, and I want to see the time when every man, woman and child will
enjoy every human right.Civilization

Civilization is the child of free thought.The new world has drifted
away from the rotten wharf of superstition.The politics of this country
are being settled by the new ideas of individual liberty, and parties
and churches that cannot accept the new truths must perish.Cornell University

With the single exception of Cornell, there is not a college in the
United States where truth has ever been a welcome guest.The moment one
of the teachers denies the inspiration of the Bible, he is discharged.If he discovers a fact inconsistent with that book, so much the worse
for the fact, and especially for the discoverer of the fact.He must not
corrupt the minds of his pupils with demonstrations.He must beware
of every truth that cannot, in some way, be made to harmonize with the
superstitions of the Jews.Church and School Divorced

Our country will never be filled with great institutions of learning
until there is an absolute divorce between church and school.As long
as the mutilated records of a barbarous people are placed by priest and
professor above the reason of mankind, we shall reap but little benefit
from church or school.Laws That Want Repealing

All laws defining and punishing blasphemy--making it a crime to give
your honest ideas about the Bible, or to laugh at the ignorance of
the ancient Jews, or to enjoy yourself on the Sabbath, or to give your
opinion of Jehovah, were passed by impudent bigots, and should be at
once repealed by honest men.Government Secular

Our government should be entirely and purely secular.The religious
views of a candidate should be kept entirely out of sight.He should not
be compelled to give his opinion as to the inspiration of the bible,
the propriety of infant baptism, or the immaculate conception.He should be allowed to settle such
things for himself.In 1876, our forefathers retired God from politics.They said all
power comes from the people.They kept God out of the Constitution, and
allowed each State to settle the question for itself.Candidates Made Hypocrites

Candidates are forced to pretend that they are Catholics with Protestant
proclivities, or Christians with liberal tendencies, or temperance men
who now and then take a glass of wine, or, that although not members of
any church their wives are, and that they subscribe liberally to
all.The result of all this is that we reward hypocrisy and elect men
entirely destitute of real principle; and this will never change until
the people become grand enough to allow each other to do their own
thinking.The Church and the Throne

So our fathers said: "We shall form a secular government, and under the
flag with which we are going to enrich the air, we will allow every man
to worship God as he thinks best."They said: "Religion is an individual
thing between each man and his Creator, and he can worship as he pleases
and as he desires."The history of the world
warned them that the liberty of man was not safe in the clutch and grasp
of any church.They had read of and seen the thumbscrews, the racks and
the dungeons of the inquisition.They knew all about the hypocrisy of
the olden time.They knew that the church had stood side by side with
the throne; that the high priests were hypocrites, and that the kings
were robbers.They also knew that if they gave to any church power, it
would corrupt the best church in the world.And so they said that power
must not reside in a church, nor in a sect, but power must be wherever
humanity is--in the great body of the people.And the officers and
servants of the people must be responsible.And so I say again, as
I said in the commencement, this is the wisest, the profoundest, the
bravest political document that ever was written and signed by man.The Old Idea

What was the old idea?The old idea was that no political power came
from, nor in any manner belonged to, the people.The old idea was that
the political power came from the clouds; that the political power came
in some miraculous way from heaven; that it came down to kings, and
queens, and robbers.The nobles lived upon the
labor of the people; the people had no rights; the nobles stole what
they had and divided with the kings, and the kings pretended to divide
what they stole with God Almighty.The source, then, of political power
was from above.The people were responsible to the nobles, the nobles to
the king, and the people had no political rights whatever, no more than
the wild beasts of the forest.The kings were responsible to God, not to
the people.The kings were responsible to the clouds, not to the toiling
millions they robbed and plundered.Liberty for Politicians

I would like also to liberate the politician.At present, the successful
office-seeker is a good deal like the centre of the earth; he weighs
nothing himself, but draws everything else to him.There are so many
societies, so many churches, so many isms, that it is almost impossible
for an independent man to succeed in a political career.Tax all Church Property

I am in favor of the taxation of all church property.If that property
belongs to God, he is able to pay the tax.If we exempt anything, let
us exempt the home of the widow and orphan.The church has to-day
$600,000,000 or $700,000,000 of property in this country.It must cost
$2,000,000 a week, that is to say $500 a minute to run these churches.You give me this money and if I don't do more good with it than
four times as many churches I'll resign.Let them make the churches
attractive and they'll get more hearers.They will have less empty pews
if they have less empty heads in the pulpit.The time will come when the
preacher will become a teacher.The Source of Power

The Declaration of Independence announces the sublime truth, that all
power comes from the people.This was a denial, and the first denial of
a nation, of the infamous dogma that God confers the right upon one man
to govern others.It was the first grand assertion of the dignity of the
human race.It declared the governed to be the source of power, and in
fact denied the authority of any and all gods.The Best Blood of the Old Word come to the New

The kings of the old world endeavored to parcel out this land to their
favorites.There was too much courage
required for them to take and keep it, and so men had to come here
who were dissatisfied with the old country--who were dissatisfied
with England, dissatisfied with France, with Germany, with Ireland and
Holland.Men came here for liberty,
and on account of certain principles they entertained and held dearer
than life.And they were willing to work, willing to fell the forests,
to fight the savages, willing to go through all the hardships, perils
and dangers of a new country, of a new land; and the consequences was
that our country was settled by brave and adventurous spirits, by men
who had opinions of their own, and were willing to live in the wild
forests for the sake of expressing those opinions, even if they
expressed them only to trees, rocks, and savage men.The best blood of
the old world came to the new.No State Church

Happily for us, there was no church strong enough to dictate to the
rest.Fortunately for us, the colonists not only, but the colonies
differed widely in their religious views.There were the Puritans who
hated the Episcopalians, and Episcopalians who hated the Catholics,
and the Catholics who hated both, while the Quakers held them all in
contempt.There they were of every sort, and color, and kind, and how
was it that they came together?They
wanted to form a new nation.More than that, most of them cordially
hated Great Britain; and they pledged each other to forget these
religious prejudices, for a time at least, and agreed that there should
be only one religion until they got through, and that was the religion
of patriotism.They solemnly agreed that the new nation should not
belong to any particular church, but that it should secure the rights of
all.The Enthusiasts of 1776

These grand men were enthusiasts; and the world has only been raised
by enthusiasts.In every country there have been a few who have given
a national aspiration to the people.The enthusiasts of 1776 were the
builders and framers of this great and splendid government; and they
were the men who saw, although others did not, the golden fringe of the
mantle of glory, that will finally cover this world.They knew, they
felt, they believed they would give a new constellation to the political
heavens--that they would make the Americans a grand people--grand as
the continent upon which they lived.The Church Must Have no Sword

Our fathers founded the first secular government that was ever founded
in this world.The first secular government; the first
government that said every church has exactly the same rights and no
more.In other words our fathers were the first men who had the sense,
had the genius, to know that no church should be allowed to have a
sword; that it should be allowed only to exert its moral influence.I want the power where some one can use
it.As long as a man is responsible to the people there is no fear of
despotism.And when any man talks about
despotism, you may be sure he wants to steal or be up to devilment.If
we have any sense, we have got to have localization of brain.If we have
any power, we must have centralization.We want centralization of the
right kind.The man we choose for our head wants the army in one hand,
the navy in the other; and to execute the supreme will of the supreme
people.In the long run the nation that is honest, the people that are
industrious, will pass the people that are dishonest, the people that
are idle; no matter what grand ancestry they might have had.To work for others is, in reality, the only way in which a man can work
for himself.Speculators cannot make unless
somebody loses.In the realm of speculation, every success has at least
one victim.The harvest reaped by the farmer benefits all and injures
none.For him to succeed, it is not necessary that some one should fail.The same is true of all producers--of all laborers.State Sovereignty

I despise the doctrine of State sovereignty.I believe in the rights
of the States, but not in the sovereignty of the States.Rising above States as the Alps above valleys
are the rights of man.Rising above the rights of the government even in
this Nation are the sublime rights of the people.Governments are good
only so long as they protect human rights.But the rights of a man never
should be sacrificed upon the altar of the State or upon the altar of
the Nation.The King of America

I am not only in favor of free speech, but I am also in favor of an
absolutely honest ballot.There is one king in this country; there
is one emperor; there is one supreme czar; and that is the legally
expressed will of the majority of the people.The man who casts an
illegal vote, the man who refuses to count a legal vote, poisons the
fountain of power, poisons the spring of justice, and is a traitor to
the only king in this land.I have always said, and I say again, that
the more liberty there is given away the more you have.There is room in
this world for us all; there is room enough for all of our thoughts;
out upon the intellectual sea there is room for every sail, and in the
intellectual air there is space for every wing.A man that exercises a
right that he will not give to others is a barbarian.A State that does
not allow free speech is uncivilized, and is a disgrace to the American
Union.I have been told that during the war we had plenty of money.I saw promises for dollars,
but not dollars.And the greenback, unless you have the gold behind it,
is no more a dollar than a bill of fare is a dinner.You cannot make
a paper dollar without taking a dollar's worth of paper.I want it issued by the government, and I
want behind every one of these dollars either a gold or silver dollar,
so that every greenback under the flag can lift up its hand and swear,
"I know that my redeemer liveth."The Wail of Dead Nations

A government founded upon anything except liberty and justice cannot and
ought not to stand.All the wrecks on either side of the stream of time,
all the wrecks of the great cities, and all the nations that have passed
away--all are a warning that no nation founded upon injustice can stand.From the sand-enshrouded Egypt, from the marble wilderness of Athens,
and from every fallen, crumbling stone of the once mighty Rome, comes
a wail, as it were, the cry that no nation founded upon injustice can
permanently stand.What the Republican Party Did

I am a Republican.I will tell you why: This is the only free government
in the world.The Republican party took
the chains from 4,000,000 of people.The Republican party, with the wand
of progress, touched the auction-block and it became a school-house; The
Republican party put down the rebellion, saved the nation, kept the old
banner afloat in the air, and declared that slavery of every kind should
be exterpated from the face of the continent.Doings of Democrats

I am opposed to the Democratic party, and I will tell you why.Every
State that seceded from the United States was a Democratic State.Every
ordinance of secession that was drawn was drawn by a Democrat.Every man
that endeavored to tear the old flag from the heaven that it enriches
was a Democrat.Every man that tried to destroy the nation was a
Democrat.Every enemy this great republic has had for twenty years has
been a Democrat.Every man that shot Union soldiers was a Democrat.Every man that starved Union soldiers and refused them in the extremity
of death, a crust, was a Democrat.Every man that loved slavery better
than liberty was a Democrat.The man that assassinated Abraham Lincoln
was a Democrat.Every man that sympathized with the assassin--every
man glad that the noblest President ever elected was assassinated, was a
Democrat.Every man that wanted the privilege of whipping another man to make him
work for him for nothing and pay him with lashes on his naked back, was
a Democrat.Every man that raised blood-hounds to pursue human beings
was a Democrat.Every man that clutched from shrieking, shuddering,
crouching mothers, babes from their breasts, and sold them into slavery,
was a Democrat.Every man that impaired the credit of the United States,
every man that swore we would never pay the bonds, every man that swore
we would never redeem the greenbacks, every maligner of his country's
credit, every calumniator of his country's honor, was a Democrat.Every
man that resisted the draft, every man that hid in the bushes and shot
at Union men simply because they were endeavoring to enforce the laws
of their country, was a Democrat.Every man that wept over the corpse of
slavery was a Democrat.The flag that will not protect its protectors is a dirty rag that
contaminates the air in which it waves.The government that will not
defend its defenders is a disgrace to the nations of the world.I am
a Republican because the Republican party says, "We will protect the
rights of American citizens at home, and if necessary we will march
an army into any State to protect the rights of the humblest American
citizen in that State."I am a Republican because that party allows
me to be free--allows me to do my own thinking in my own way.I am a
Republican because it is a party grand enough and splendid enough and
sublime enough to invite every human being in favor of liberty and
progress to fight shoulder to shoulder for the advancement of mankind.It invites the Methodist; it invites the Catholic; it invites the
Presbyterian and every kind of sectarian; it invites the free-thinker;
it invites the infidel, provided he is in favor of giving to every other
human being every chance and every right that he claims for himself.I
am a Republican, I tell you.Every man that tried to spread smallpox and yellow fever
in the North, as the instrumentalities of civilized war, was a Democrat.Soldiers, every scar you have got on your heroic bodies was given you
by a Democrat.Every scar, every arm that is lacking, every limb that
is gone, every scar is a souvenir of a Democrat.Every man that was the enemy of human liberty in this country was a
Democrat.Every man that wanted the fruit of all the heroism of all the
ages to turn to ashes upon the lips--every one was a Democrat.Give Every Man a Chance

Now, my friends, thousands of the Southern people, and thousands of the
Northern Democrats, are afraid that the <DW64>s are going to pass them
in the race for life.Democrat, he will do it unless you attend
to your business.The simple fact that you are white cannot save you
always.You have got to be industrious, honest, to cultivate a justice.If you don't the <DW52> race will pass you, as sure as you live.I am
for giving every man a chance.Shall the people that saved this country rule it?Shall the men who
saved the old flag hold it?Shall the men who saved the ship of state
sail it?or shall the rebels walk her quarter-deck, give the orders
and sink it?Shall a solid South, a united South,
united by assassination and murder, a South solidified by the shot-gun;
shall a united South, with the aid of a divided North, shall they
control this great and splendid country?Well, then, the North must
wake up.We are right back where we were in 1861.This is simply a
prolongation of the war.This is the war of the idea, the other was the
war of the musket.The other was the war of cannon, this is the war of
thought, and we have got to beat them in this war of thought, recollect
that.The question is, Shall the men who endeavored to destroy this
country rule it?Shall the men that said, This is not a nation, have
charge of the nation?The Declaration of Independence

The Declaration of Independence is the grandest, the bravest, and
the profoundest political document that was ever signed by the
representatives of the people.It is the embodiment of physical and
moral courage and of political wisdom.I say physical courage, because
it was a declaration of war against the most powerful nation then on the
globe; a declaration of war by thirteen weak, unorganized colonies; a
declaration of war by a few people, without military stores, without
wealth, without strength, against the most powerful kingdom on the
earth; a declaration of war made when the British navy, at that day the
mistress of every sea, was hovering along the coast of America, looking
after defenseless towns and villages to ravage and destroy.It was made
when thousands of English soldiers were upon our soil, and when the
principal cities of America were in the substantial possession of
the enemy.And so, I say, all things considered, it was the bravest
political document ever signed by man.I have a dream that this world is growing better and better every day
and every year; that there is more charity, more justice, more love
every day.I have a dream that prisons will not always curse the earth;
that the shadow of the gallows will not always fall on the land; that
the withered hand of want will not always be stretched out for charity;
that finally wisdom will sit in the legislature, justice in the courts,
charity will occupy all the pulpits, and that finally the world will be
controlled by liberty and love, by justice and charity.That is my
dream, and if it does not come true, it shall not be my fault.The Column of July

I stood, a little while ago, in the city of Paris, where stood the
Bastile, where now stands the column of July, surmounted by the figure
of Liberty.In its right hand is a broken chain, in its left hand a
hammer; upon its shining forehead a glittering star--and as I looked
upon it I said, such is the Republican party of my country.A Nation of Rascals

Samuel J. Tilden says we are a nation of thieves and rascals.If that is
so he ought to be President.But I denounce him as a calumniator of
my country; a maligner of this nation.This country is
covered with asylums for the aged, the helpless, the insane, the orphan,
the wounded soldiers.Thieves and rascals don't build such things.In the cities of the Atlantic coast this summer, they built floating
hospitals, great ships, and took the little children from the
sub-cellars and narrow, dirty streets of New York city, where the
Democratic party is the strongest--took these poor waifs and put them in
these great hospitals out at sea, and let the breezes of ocean kiss the
rose of health back to their pallid cheeks.Rascals and thieves do not
do so.When Chicago burned, railroads were blocked with the charity of
the American people.Thieves and rascals did not do so.We are a Great People

We are a great people.Three millions have increased to fifty--thirteen
states to thirty-eight.We have better homes, and more of the
conveniences of life than any other people upon the face of the globe.The farmers of our country live better than did the kings and princes
two hundred years ago--and they have twice as much sense and heart.Remember that the man who acts best his part--who loves
his friends the best--is most willing to help others--truest to the
obligation--who has the best heart--the most feeling--the deepest
sympathies--and who freely gives to others the rights that he claims for
himself, is the best man.We have disfranchised the aristocrats of the
air, and have given one country to mankind.Mule Equality

Suppose there was a great horse-race here to-day, free to every horse
in the world, and to all the mules, and all the scrubs, and all the
donkeys.At the tap of the drum they come to the line, and the judges
say "it is a go."Let me ask you, what does the blooded horse, rushing
ahead, with nostrils distended, drinking in the breath of his own
swiftness, with his mane flying like a banner of victory, with his veins
standing out all over him, as if a net of life had been cast around
him--with his thin neck, his high withers, his tremulous flanks--what
does he care how many mules and donkeys run on the track?But the
Democratic scrub, with his chuckle-head and lop-ears, with his tail full
of cockle-burs, jumping high and short, and digging in the ground when
he feels the breath of the coming mule on his cockle-bur tail, he is
the chap that jumps the track and says, "I am down on mule equality."My
friends, the Republican party is the blooded horse in this race.There is room in the Republican air for every wing; there is room on
the Republican sea for every sail.Republicanism says to every man: "Let
your soul be like an eagle; fly out in the great dome of thought, and
question the stars for yourself."I am a Republican because it is the only free party that ever existed.It is a party that had a platform as broad as humanity, a platform as
broad as the human race, a party that says you shall have all the
fruit of the labor of your hands, a party that says you may think for
yourself; a party that says no chains for the hands, no fetters for the
soul.Our Government the best on Earth

We all want a good government.We
all want to live in a land where the law is supreme.We desire to live
beneath a flag that will protect every citizen beneath its folds.We
desire to be citizens of a government so great and so grand that it will
command the respect of the civilized world.Most of us are convinced
that our government is the best upon this earth.Will the Second Century of America be as good as the First?Standing here amid the sacred memories of the first, on the golden
threshold of the second, I ask, Will the second century be as good
as the first?I believe it will because we are growing more and more
humane; I believe there is more human kind-ness and a greater desire
to help one another in America, than in all the world besides.The steam
engine--the telegraph--these are but the toys with which science has
been amusing herself.A grander standard of character, of literature and
art.We have now half as many millions of people as we have years.We are struggling more and more to get at the philosophy of
life--trying more and more to answer the questions of the eternal
Sphinx.The second century will be grander than the first.Science found agriculture plowing with a stick--reaping with a
sickle--commerce at the mercy of the treacherous waves and the
inconstant winds--a world without books--without schools--man denying
the authority of reason, employing his ingenuity in the manufacture
of instruments of torture, in building inquisitions and cathedrals.It found the land filled with malicious monks--with persecuting
Protestants, and the burners of men.The glory of science is, that it is
freeing the soul--breaking the mental manacles--getting the brain out
of bondage--giving courage to thought--filling the world with mercy,
justice, and joy.The Tables Turned

For the establishment of facts, the word of man is now considered
far better than the word of God.In the world of science, Jehovah was
superseded by Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler.All that God told
Moses, admitting the entire account to be true, is dust and ashes
compared to the discoveries of Des Cartes, La Place, and Humboldt.In
matters of fact, the Bible has ceased to be regarded as a standard.Science has succeeded in breaking the chains of theology.A few years
ago, science endeavored to show that it was not inconsistent with the
Bible.The tables have been turned, and now, religion is endeavoring to
prove that the Bible is not inconsistent with science.Science Better than a Creed

It seems to me that a belief in the great truths of science are fully as
essential to salvation, as the creed of any church.We are taught that
a man may be perfectly acceptable to God even if he denies the rotundity
of the earth, the Copernican system, the three laws of Kepler, the
indestructibility of matter and the attraction of gravitation.And we
are also taught that a man may be right upon all these questions, and
yet, for failing to believe in the "scheme of salvation," be eternally
lost.The Religion of Science

Every assertion of individual independence has been a step toward
infidelity.Luther started toward Humboldt,--Wesley, toward John Stuart
Mill.To really reform the church is to destroy it.Every new religion
has a little less superstition than the old, so that the religion of
science is but a question of time.Science not Sectarian

The sciences are not sectarian.People do not persecute each other on
account of disagreements in mathematics.Families are not divided about
botany, and astronomy does not even tend to make a man hate his father
and mother.It is what people do not know, that they persecute each
other about.Science will bring, not a sword, but peace.The Epitaph of all Religions

Science has written over the high altar its mene, mene, tekel,
UPHARSIN--the old words, destined to be the epitaph of all religions?The Real Priest

When we abandon the doctrine that some infinite being created matter
and force, and enacted a code of laws for their government, the idea
of interference will be lost.The real priest will then be, not the
mouth-piece of some pretended deity, but the interpreter of nature.From
that moment the church ceases to exist.The tapers will die out upon the
dusty altar; the moths will eat the fading velvet of pulpit and pew;
the Bible will take its place with the Shastras, Puranas, Vedas, Eddas,
Sagas and Korans, and the fetters of a degrading faith will fall from
the minds of men.Science is Power

From a philosophical point of view, science is knowledge of the laws
of life; of the conditions of happiness; of the facts by which we are
surrounded, and the relations we sustain to men and things--by means
of which, man, so to speak, subjugates nature and bends the elemental
powers to his will, making blind force the servant of his brain.Science Supreme

The element of uncertainty will, in a great measure, be removed from the
domain of the future, and man, gathering courage from a succession of
victories over the obstructions of nature, will attain a serene grandeur
unknown to the disciples of any superstition.The plans of mankind will
no longer be interfered with by the finger of a supposed omnipotence,
and no one will believe that nations or individuals are protected or
destroyed by any deity whatever.Science, freed from the chains of pious
custom and evangelical prejudice, will, within her sphere, be supreme.The mind will investigate without reverence, and publish its conclusions
without fear.Agassiz will no longer hesitate to declare the Mosaic
cosmogony utterly inconsistent with the demonstrated truths of geology,
and will cease pretending any reverence for the Jewish scriptures.The
moment science succeeds in rendering the church powerless for evil, the
real thinkers will be outspoken.The little flags of truce carried by
timid philosophers will disappear, and the cowardly parley will give
place to victory--lasting and universal.Science Opening the Gates of Thought

We are not endeavoring to chain the future, but to free the present.We
are not forging fetters for our children, but we are breaking those our
fathers made for us.We are the advocates of inquiry, of investigation
and thought.This of itself, is an admission that we are not perfectly
satisfied with all our conclusions.Philosophy has not the egotism of
faith.While superstition builds walls and creates obstructions, science
opens all the highways of thought.Stars and Grains of Sand

We do not say that we have discovered all; that our doctrines are the
all in all of truth.We know of no end to the development of man.We
cannot unravel the infinite complications of matter and force.The
history of one monad is as unknown as that of the universe; one drop of
water is as wonderful as all the seas; one leaf, as all the forests; and
one grain of sand, as all the stars.The Trinity of Science

Reason, Observation and Experience--the Holy Trinity of Science--have
taught us that happiness is the only good; that the time to be happy is
now, and the way to be happy is to make others so.In this belief we are content to live and die.If by any possibility
the existence of a power superior to, and independent of, nature shall
be demonstrated, there will then be time enough to kneel.Until then,
let us all stand nobly erect.The Old and the New Old ideas perished in the retort of the
chemist, and useful truths took their places.One by one religious
conceptions have been placed in the crucible of science, and thus far,
nothing but dross has been found.A new world has been discovered by the
microscope; everywhere has been found the infinite; in every direction
man has investigated and explored, and nowhere, in earth or stars,
has been found the footstep of any being superior to or independent
of nature.Nowhere has been discovered the slightest evidence of any
interference from without.The Triumphs of Science

I do not know what inventions are in the brain of the future; I do not
know what garments of glory may be woven for the world in the loom of
years to be; we are just on the edge of the great ocean of discovery.I
do not know what is to be discovered; I do not know what science will do
for us.I do know that science did just take a handful of sand and make
the telescope, and with it read all the starry leaves of heaven; I know
that science took the thunderbolts from the hands of Jupiter, and now
the electric spark, freighted with thought and love, flashes under the
waves of the sea; I know that science stole a tear from the cheek of
unpaid labor, converted it into steam, and created a giant that turns
with tireless arms the countless wheels of toil; I know that science
broke the chains from human limbs and gave us instead the forces of
nature for our slaves; I know that we have made the attraction of
gravitation work for us; we have made the lightnings our messengers; we
have taken advantage of fire and flames and wind and sea; these slaves
have no backs to be whipped; they have no hearts to be lacerated; they
have no children to be stolen, no cradles to be violated.I know that
science has given us better houses; I know it has given us better
pictures and better books; I know it has given us better wives and
better husbands, and more beautiful children.I know it has enriched
a thousand-fold our life; and therefore I am in favor of perfect
intellectual liberty.It found the world at the mercy of disease and famine; men trying to
read their fates in the stars, and to tell their fortunes by signs and
wonders; generals thinking to conquer their enemies by making the sign
of the cross, or by telling a rosary.It found all history full of petty
and ridiculous falsehood, and the Almighty was supposed to spend most
of his time turning sticks into snakes, drowning boys for swimming on
Sunday, and killing little children for the purpose of converting their
parents.It found the earth filled with slaves and tyrants, the people
in all countries downtrodden, half naked, half starved, without hope,
and without reason in the world.Science the only Lever

Such was the condition of man when the morning of science dawned upon
his brain, and before he had heard the sublime declaration that the
universe is governed by law.For the change that has taken place we are
indebted solely to science--the only lever capable of raising mankind.Abject faith is barbarism; reason is civilization.To obey is slavish;
to act from a sense of obligation perceived by the reason, is noble.Ignorance worships mystery; Reason explains it: the one grovels, the
other soars.I have sometimes wished that there were words of pure hatred out of
which I might construct sentences like snakes, out of which I might
construct sentences with mouths fanged, that had forked tongues, out of
which I might construct sentences that writhed and and hissed; then I
could give my opinion of the rebels during the great struggle for the
preservation of this nation.Slavery in the Name of Religion

Just think of it!Our churches and best people, as they call themselves,
defending the institution of slavery.When I was a little boy I used
to see steamers go down the Mississippi river with hundreds of men and
women chained hand to hand, and even children, and men standing about
them with whips in their hands and pistols in their pockets in the name
of liberty, in the name of civilization and in the name of religion!I
used to hear them preach to these slaves in the South and the only text
they ever took was "Servants be obedient unto your masters."That was
the salutation of the most merciful God to a man whose back was bleeding
that was the salutation of the most merciful God to the slave-mother
bending over an empty cradle, to the woman from whose breast a child
had been stolen--"Servants be obedient unto your masters."That was
what they said to a man running for his life and for his liberty through
tangled swamps and listening to the baying of blood-hounds, and when
he listened for them the voice came from heaven:--"Servants be obedient
unto your masters."Think how we have crouched and cringed before wealth even!How
they used to cringe in old times before a man who was rich--there are so
many of them gone into bankruptcy lately that we are losing a little of
our fear.The Patrons of Slavery

It is not possible for the human imagination to conceive of the horrors
of slavery.It has left no possible wrong uncommitted, no possible crime
un-perpetrated.It has been practiced and defended by all nations in
some form.It has been defended
by nearly every pulpit.From the profits derived from the slave trade,
churches have been built, cathedrals reared and priests paid.Slavery
has been blessed by bishop, by cardinal and by pope.It has received the
sanction of statesmen, of kings, of queens.Clergymen have taken their part of the spoil, reciting passages
of scripture in its defense, and judges have taken their portion in the
name of equity and law.A <DW52> Man in Congress

The world has changed!I have had the supreme pleasure of seeing a
man--once a slave--sitting in the seat of his former master in the
Congress of the United States.When I saw that sight, my eyes were
filled with tears.I felt that we had carried out the Declaration of
Independence, that we had given reality to it, and breathed the breath
of life into every word.I felt that our flag would float over and
protect the <DW52> man and his little children--standing straight in
the sun--just the same as though he were white and worth a million!The Zig-zag Strip

I have some excuses to offer for the race to which I belong.My first
excuse is that this is not a very good world to raise folks in anyway.It is not very well adapted to raising magnificent people.There's only
a quarter of it land to start with.It is three times better for raising
fish than folks; and in that one-quarter of land there is not a tenth
part fit to raise people on.You can't raise people without a good
climate.You have got to have the right kind of climate, and you have
got to have certain elements in the soil or you can't raise good people.Do you know that there is only a little zig-zag strip around the world
within which have been produced all men of genius?Black People have Suffered Enough

In my judgment the black people have suffered enough.They have been
slaves for two hundred years.They have been owned two hundred years,
and, more than all, they have been compelled to keep the company of
those who owned them.Think of being compelled to keep the society of
the man who is stealing from you.Think of being compelled to live with
a man that stole your child from the cradle before your very eyes.Think
of being compelled to live with a thief all your life, to spend your
days with a white loafer, and to be under his control.The History of Civilization

The history of civilization is the history of the slow and painful
enfranchisement of the human race.In the olden times the family was a
monarchy, the father being the monarch.The mother and children were the
veriest slaves.The will of the father was the supreme law.He had the
power of life and death.It took thousands of years to civilize this
father, thousands of years to make the condition of the wife and mother
and children even tolerable.A few families constituted a tribe; the
tribe had a chief; the chief was a tyrant; a few tribes formed a nation;
the nation was governed by a king, who was also a tyrant.A strong
nation robbed, plundered and took captive the weaker ones.Is there, in the civilized world, to-day, a clergyman who believes
in the divinity of slavery?Does the Bible teach man to enslave his
brother?If it does, is it not blasphemous to say that it is inspired
of God?If you find the institution of slavery upheld in a book said
to have been written by God, what would you expect to find in a book
inspired by the devil?Would you expect to find that book in favor of
liberty?Modern Christians, ashamed of the God of the Old Testament,
endeavor now to show that slavery was neither commanded nor opposed by
Jehovah.Solemn Defiance

For my part, I never will, I never can, worship a God who upholds the
institution of slavery.I neither want his
heaven, nor fear his hell.The Soldiers of the Republic

The soldiers of the Republic were not seekers after vulgar glory.They
were not animated by the hope of plunder or the love of conquest.They
fought to preserve the blessings of liberty and that their children
might have peace.They were the defenders of humanity, the destroyers
of prejudice, the breakers of chains, and in the name of the future they
slew the monster of their time.They blotted from the statute books laws that
had been passed by hypocrites at the instigation of robbers, and tore
with indignant hands from the Constitution that infamous clause that
made men the catchers of their fellow men.They made it possible for
judges to be just, for statesmen to be human, and for politicians to be
honest.They broke the shackles from the limbs of slaves, from the souls
of martyrs, and from the Northern brain.They kept our country on the
map of the world and our flag in heaven.Seven long years of war--fighting for what?For the principle that
all men were created equal--a truth that nobody ever disputed except
a scoundrel; nobody in the entire history of this world.No man ever
denied that truth who was not a rascal, and at heart a thief; never,
never, and never will.Simply that in
America every man should have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.Nobody ever denied that except a villain; never, never.It has been denied by kings--they were thieves.It has been denied by
statesmen--they were liars.It has been denied by priests, by clergymen,
by cardinals, by bishops and by popes--they were hypocrites.For the idea that all political power is vested
in the great body of the people.They make all the money; do all the
work.They plow the land; cut down the forests; they produce everything
that is produced.Then who shall say what shall be done with what is
produced except the producer?The Revolution Consummated

The soldiers of the Republic finished what the soldiers of the
Revolution commenced.They relighted the torch that fell from their
august hands and filled the world again with light.The soldiers went home to their waiting wives, to their glad children,
and to the girls they loved--they went back to the fields, the shops and
mines.They were
as honest in peace as they had been brave in war.Mocking at poverty,
laughing at reverses, they made a friend of toil.They said: "We saved
the nation's life, and what is life without honor?"They worked and
wrought with all of labor's sons, that every pledge the nation gave
should be redeemed.And their great leader, having put a shining hand of
friendship--a girdle of clasped and happy hands--around the globe, comes
home and finds that every promise made in war has now the ring and gleam
of gold.Manhood worth more than Gold

We say in this country manhood is worth more than gold.We say in this
country that without liberty the Nation is not worth preserving.I
appeal to every laboring man, and I ask him, "Is there another country
on this globe where you can have your equal rights with others?"Now,
then, in every country, no matter how good it is, and no matter how bad
it is--in every country there is something worth preserving, and there
is something that ought to be destroyed.Now recollect that every voter
is in his own right a king; every voter in this country wears a crown;
every voter in this country has in his hands the scepter of authority;
and every voter, poor and rich, wears the purple of authority alike.Recollect it; and the man that will sell his vote is the man that
abdicates the American throne.Grander than the Greek, nobler than the Roman, the soldiers of the
republic, with patriotism as taintless as the air, battled for the
rights of others; for the nobility of labor; fought that mothers might
own their babes; that arrogant idleness should not scar the back of
patient toil, and that our country should not be a many-headed monster
made of warring States, but a Nation, sovereign, great and free.Blood
was water; money, leaves, and life was common air until one flag floated
over a republic without a master and without a slave.Let us Drink to the Living and the Dead

The soldiers of the Union saved the South as well as the North.Their victory made us free and rendered tyranny in
every other land as insecure as snow upon volcano lips.And now let us
drink to the volunteers, to those who sleep in unknown, sunken graves,
whose names are only in the hearts of those they loved and left--of
those who only hear in happy dreams the footsteps of return.Let us
drink to those who died where lipless famine mocked at want--to all the
maimed whose scars give modesty a tongue, to all who dared and gave to
chance the care and keeping of their lives--to all the living and all
the dead--to Sherman, to Sheridan and to Grant, the foremost soldiers of
the world; and last, to Lincoln, whose loving life, like a bow of peace,
spans and arches all the clouds of war.Will the Wounds of the War be Healed?There is still another question: "Will all the wounds of the war be
healed?"The Southern people must submit, not to the
dictation of the North, but to the nation's will and to the verdict of
mankind.They were wrong, and the time will come when they will say
that they have been vanquished by the right.Freedom conquered them, and
freedom will cultivate their fields, educate their children, weave for
them the robes of wealth, execute their laws, and fill their land with
happy homes.Saviours of the Nation

They rolled the stone from the sepulchre of progress, and found therein
two angels clad in shining garments--nationality and liberty.The
soldiers were the Saviours of the Nation.In writing the proclamation of emancipation, Lincoln, greatest
of our mighty dead, whose memory is as gentle as the summer air,--when
reapers sing'mid gathered sheaves,--copied with the pen what Grant and
his brave comrades wrote with swords.General Grant

When the savagery of the lash, the barbarism of the chain, and the
insanity of secession confronted the civilization of our century, the
question, "Will the great republic defend itself?"trembled on the
lips of every lover of mankind.The North, filled with intelligence and
wealth, products of liberty, marshalled her hosts and asked only for
a leader.From civil life a man, silent, thoughtful, poised, and calm;
stepped forth, and with the lips of victory voiced the nation's first
and last demand: "Unconditional and immediate surrender."From that
moment the end was known.That utterance was the real declaration of
real war and in accordance with the dramatic unities of mighty
events, the great soldier who made it, received the final sword of the
rebellion.The soldiers of the republic were not seekers after vulgar
glory; they were not animated by the hope of plunder or the love of
conquest.They fought to preserve the homestead of liberty.MONEY THAT IS MONEY




142.Paper is not Money

Some people tell me that the government can impress its sovereignty on
a piece of paper, and that is money.Well, if it is, what's the use of
wasting it making one dollar bills?It takes no more ink and no more
paper--why not make $1000 bills?Why not make $100,000,000 and all be
billionaires?If the government can make money, what on earth does it
collect taxes for you and me for?Why don't it make what money it wants,
take the taxes out, and give the balance to us?Greenbacker, suppose
the government issued $1,000,000,000 to-morrow, how would you get any of
it?The Debt will be paid

It will be paid.The holders of the debt have got a mortgage on a
continent.They have a mortgage on the honor of the Republican party,
and it is on record.Every blade of grass that grows upon this continent
is a guarantee that the debt will be paid; every field of bannered corn
in the great, glorious West is a guarantee that the debt will be paid;
all the coal put away in the ground, millions of years ago by the old
miser, the sun; is a guarantee that every dollar of that debt will be
paid; all the cattle on the prairies, pastures and plains, every one of
them is a guarantee that this debt will be paid; every pine standing
in the sombre forests of the North, waiting for the woodman's axe, is
a guarantee that this debt will be paid; all the gold and silver hid in
the Sierra Nevadas, waiting for the miner's pick, is a guarantee that
the debt will be paid; every locomotive, with its muscles of iron and
breath of flame, and all the boys and girls bending over their books at
school, every dimpled child in the cradle, every good man and every good
woman, and every man that votes the Republican ticket, is a guarantee
that the debt will be paid.No man can imagine, all the languages of the world cannot express, what
the people of the United States suffered from 1873 to 1879.Men who
considered themselves millionaires found that they were beggars; men
living in palaces, supposing they had enough to give sunshine to the
winter of their age, supposing they had enough to have all they loved
in affluence and comfort, suddenly found that they were mendicants with
bonds, stocks, mortgages, all turned to ashes in their aged, trembling
hands.The chimneys grew cold, the fires in furnaces went out, the poor
families were turned adrift, and the highways of the United States were
crowded with tramps.Into the home of the poor crept the serpent of
temptation, and whispered in the ear of poverty the terrible word
"repudiation."A Voter because a Man

A man does not vote in this country simply because he is rich; he does
not vote in this country simply because he has an education; he does
not vote simply because he has talent or genius; we say that he votes
because he is a man, and that he has his manhood to support; and we
admit in this country that nothing can be more valuable to any human
being than his manhood, and for that reason we put poverty on an
equality with wealth.If you are a German, recollect that this country is kinder to you than
your own fatherland,--no matter what country you came from, remember
that this country is an asylum, and vote as in your conscience you
believe you ought to vote to keep this flag in heaven.I beg every
American to stand with that part of the country that believes in law, in
freedom of speech, in an honest vote, in civilization, in progress, in
human liberty, and in universal justice.Prosperity and Resumption hand in hand

The Republicans of the United States demand a man who knows that
prosperity and resumption, when they come, must come together; that when
they come they will come hand in hand through the golden harvest fields;
hand in hand by the whirling spindles and the turning wheels; hand in
hand past the open furnace doors; hand in hand by the chimneys filled
with eager fire, greeted and grasped by the countless sons of toil.This money has to be dug out of the earth.You cannot make it by passing
resolutions in a political convention.Every Poor Man should Stand by the Government

It is the only Nation where the man clothed in a rag stands upon an
equality with the one wearing purple.It is the only country in the
world where, politically, the hut is upon an equality with the palace.For that reason, every poor man should stand by the government, and
every poor man who does not is a traitor to the best interests of his
children; every poor man who does not is willing his children should
bear the badge of political inferiority; and the only way to make this
government a complete and perfect success is for the poorest man to
think as much of his manhood as the millionaire does of his wealth.I want to tell you that you cannot conceive of what the American people
suffered as they staggered over the desert of bankruptcy from 1873 to
1879.We are too near now to know how grand we were.The poor mechanic said
"No;" the ruined manufacturer said "No;" the once millionaire said "No,
we will settle fair; we will agree to pay whether we ever pay or
not, and we will never soil the American name with the infamous word,
'repudiation.'"Are you not glad
that our flag is covered all over with financial honors?The stars shine
and gleam now because they represent an honest nation.A Government with a Long Arm

I believe in a Government with an arm long enough to reach the collar
of any rascal beneath its flag.I want it with an arm long enough and
a sword sharp enough to strike down tyranny wherever it may raise its
snaky head.I want a nation that can hear the faintest cries of its
humblest citizen.I want a nation that will protect a freedman standing
in the sun by his little cabin, just as quick as it would protect
Vanderbilt in a palace of marble and gold.No Repudiation

Then it was, that the serpent of temptation whispered in the ear of want
that dreadful word "Repudiation."They
appealed to want, to misery, to threatened financial ruin, to the bare
hearthstones, to the army of beggars, We had grandeur enough to say:
"No; we'll settle fair if we don't pay a cent!"Is there a Democrat now who wishes we had taken the advice of
Bayard to scale the bonds?Is there an American, a Democrat here, who
is not glad we escaped the stench and shame of repudiation, and did not
take Democratic advice?Is there a Greenbacker here who is not glad we
didn't do it?He may say he is, but he isn't.I think there is the greatest heroism in living for a thing!There's no
glory in digging potatoes.You don't wear a uniform when you're picking
up stones.You can't have a band of music when you dig potatoes!In,
1873 came the great crash.No one can estimate the anguish of that time!Millionaires found
themselves paupers.The aged man,
who had spent his life in hard labor, and who thought he had accumulated
enough to support himself in his old age, and leave a little something
to his children and grandchildren, found they were all beggars.The
highways were filled with tramps.Promises Don't Pay

If I am fortunate enough to leave a dollar when I die, I want it to be
a good one; I don't wish to have it turn to ashes in the hands of
widowhood, or become a Democratic broken promise in the pocket of the
orphan; I want it money.I saw not long ago a piece of gold bearing the
stamp of the Roman Empire.That Empire is dust, and over it has been
thrown the mantle of oblivion, but that piece of gold is as good as
though Julius Caesar were still riding at the head of the Roman Legion.I want money to that will outlive the Democratic party.They told
us--and they were honest about it--they said, "when we have plenty of
money we are prosperous."And I said: "When we are prosperous, then we
have credit, and, credit inflates the currency.Whenever a man buys a
pound of sugar and says, 'Charge it,' he inflates the currency; whenever
he gives his note, he inflates the currency; whenever his word takes the
place of money, he inflates the currency."The consequence is that when
we are prosperous, credit takes the place of money, and we have what
we call "plenty."But you can't increase prosperity simply by using
promises to pay.I do not wish to trust the wealth of this nation with the demagogues of
the nation.I do not wish to trust the wealth of the country to every
blast of public opinion.I want money as solid as the earth on which we
tread, as bright as the stars that shine above us.The South and the Tariff

Where did this doctrine of a tariff for revenue only come from?The South would like to stab the prosperity of the North.They
had rather trade with Old England than with New England.They had rather
trade with the people who were willing to help them in war than those
who conquered the rebellion.They knew what gave us our strength in
war.They knew all the brooks and creeks and rivers in New England were
putting down the rebellion.They knew that every wheel that turned,
every spindle that revolved, was a soldier in the army of human
progress.They were so lured by the greed of office that
they were willing to trade upon the misfortune of a nation.I don't wish to belong to a party that succeeds only when my country
falls.I don't wish to belong to a party whose banner went up with
the banner of rebellion.I don't wish to belong to a party that was in
partnership with defeat and disaster.I am for Protection

And I will tell you why I am for protection, too.If we were all farmers
we would be stupid.If we were all shoemakers we would be stupid.If
we all followed one business, no matter what it was, we would become
stupid.Protection to American labor diversifies American industry, and
to have it diversified touches and developes every part of the human
brain.Protection protects integrity; it protects intelligence; and
protection raises sense; and by protection we have greater men and
better-looking women and healthier children.Free trade means that our
laborer is upon an equality with the poorest paid labor of this world.The Old Woman of Tewksbury

You Greenbackers are like the old woman in the Tewksbury, Mass.,
Poor-House.She used to be well off, and didn't like her quarters.You
Greenbackers have left your father's house of many mansions and have fed
on shucks about long enough.The Supervisor came into the Poor-House one
day and asked the old lady how she liked it.She said she didn't like
the company, and asked him what he would advise her to do under similar
circumstances."Do you think anybody is ever prejudiced in their sleep?"I dreamed I died and went to
Heaven.A nice man came to me and asked
me where I was from.Says I, 'From Tewksbury, Mass.'He looked in his
book and said, 'You can't stay here.'"I asked what he would advise me
to do under similar circumstances."'Well,' he said, 'there's hell down
there, you might try that.'"Well, I went down there, and the men told
me my name wasn't on the book and I couldn't stay there.'Well,' said I,
'What would you advise me to do under similar circumstances?''Said he,
'You'll have to go back to Tewksbury.'And when Green-backers remember
what they once were, you must feel now, when you were forced to join
the Democratic party, as bad as the old lady who had to go back to
Tewksbury.American Muscle, Coined into Gold

I believe in American labor, and I tell you why.The other day a man
told me that we had produced in the United States of America one million
tons of rails.In other
words, the million tons are worth $60,000,000.How much is a ton of iron
worth in the ground?American labor takes 25 cents of
iron in the ground and adds to it $59.75.One million tons of rails, and
the raw material not worth $24,000.We build a ship in the United States
worth $500,000, and the value of the ore in the earth, of the trees in
the great forest, of all that enters into the composition of that ship
bringing $500,000 in gold is only $20,000; $480,000 by American labor,
American muscle, coined into gold; American brains made a legal-tender
the world around.Inflation

I don't blame the man who wanted inflation.I don't blame him for
praying for another period of inflation."When it comes," said the man
who had a lot of shrunken property on his hands, "blame me, if I don't
unload, you may shoot me."It's a good deal like the game of poker!I
don't suppose any of you know anything about that game!Along towards
morning the fellow who is ahead always wants another deal.The fellow
that is behind says his wife's sick, and he must go home.You ought
to hear that fellow descant on domestic virtue!And the other fellow
accuses him of being a coward and wanting to jump the game.A man whose
dead wood is hung up on the shore in a dry time, wants the water to rise
once more and float it out into the middle of the stream.We have fifty-six thousand
square miles of land--nearly thirty-six million acres.Upon these plains
we can raise enough to feed and clothe twenty million people.Beneath
these prairies were hidden, millions of ages ago, by that old miser, the
sun, thirty-six thousand square miles of coal.The aggregate thickness
of these veins is at least fifteen feet.Think of a column of coal one
mile square and one hundred miles high!What
a sunbeam such a column would be!Think of all this force, willed and
left to us by the dead morning of the world!Think of the fireside of
the future around which will sit the fathers, mothers and children of
the years to be!Think of the sweet and happy faces, the loving and
tender eyes that will glow and gleam in the sacred light of all these
flames!They say that money is a measure of value.A bushel doesn't
measure values.If it measured
values, a bushel of potatoes would be worth as much as a bushel of
diamonds.They used to say,
"there's no use in having a gold yard-stick."You
don't buy the yard-stick.If money bore the same relation to trade as
a yard-stick or half-bushel, you would have the same money when you
got through trading as you had when you begun.A man don't sell
half-bushels.All we want is a little sense about these
things.Some said there
wasn't enough money.That's so; I know what that means myself.They said
if we had more money we'd be more prosperous.The truth is, if we
were more prosperous we'd have more money.They said more money would
facilitate business.Money by Work

How do you get your money?You have got to dig it
out of the ground.In old times there were
some men who thought they could get some way to turn the baser metals
into gold, and old gray-haired men, trembling, tottering on the verge of
the grave, were hunting for something to turn ordinary metals into gold;
they were searching for the fountain of eternal youth, but they did not
find it.No human ear has ever heard the silver gurgle of the spring of
immortal youth.Meat Twice a Year

I have been in countries where the laboring man had meat once a year;
sometimes twice--Christmas and Easter.And I have seen women carrying
upon their heads a burden that no man would like to carry, and at the
same time knitting busily with both hands.And those women lived without
meat; and when I thought of the American laborer I said to myself,
"After all, my country is the best in the world."And when I came back
to the sea and saw the old flag flying in the air, it seemed to me as
though the air from pure joy had burst into blossom.America a Glorious Land

Labor has more to eat and more to wear in the United States than in
any other land of this earth.I want America to produce everything
that Americans need.I want it so if the whole world should declare war
against us, so if we were surrounded by walls of cannon and bayonets and
swords, we could supply all human wants in and of ourselves.I want to
live to see the American woman dressed in American silk; the American
man in everything from hat to boots produced in America by the cunning
hand of the American toiler.How to Spend a Dollar

If you have only a dollar in the world and have got to spend it, spend
it like a man; spend it like a prince, like a king!If you have to spend
it, spend it as though it were a dried leaf, and you were the owner of
unbounded forests.Honesty is Best always and Everywhere

I am next in favor of honest money.I am in favor of gold and silver,
and paper with gold and silver behind it.I believe in silver, because
it is one of the greatest of American products, and I am in favor of
anything that will add to the value of American products.But I want a
silver dollar worth a gold dollar, even if you make it or have to make
it four feet in diameter.No government can afford to be a clipper of
coin.A great Republic cannot afford to stamp a lie upon silver or gold.Honest money, an honest people, an honest Nation.When our money is only
worth 80 cents on the dollar, we feel 20 per cent, below par.When our
money is good we feel good.When our money is at par, that is where we
are.I am a profound believer in the doctrine that for nations as well
as men, honesty is the best, always, everywhere and forever.A Fountain of Greenbacks

There used to be mechanics that tried to make perpetual motion by
combinations of wheels, shifting weights, and rolling balls; but somehow
the machine would never quite run.A perpetual fountain of greenbacks,
of wealth without labor, is just as foolish as a fountain of eternal
youth.The idea that you can produce money without labor is just as
foolish as the idea of perpetual motion.They are old follies under new
names.We had to borrow some money to pay for shot and
shell to shoot Democrats with.We found that we could get along with a
few less Democrats, but not with any less country, and so we borrowed
the money, and the question now is, will we pay it?And which party is
the most apt to pay it, the Republican party, that made the debt--the
party that swore it was constitutional, or the party that said it was
unconstitutional?Whenever a Democrat sees a greenback, the greenback
says to the Democrat, "I am one of the fellows that whipped you."Whenever a Republican sees a greenback, the greenback says to him, "You
and I put down the rebellion and saved the country."Honest Methods

So many presidents of savings banks, even those belonging to the Young
Men's Christian Association, run off with the funds; so many railroad
and insurance companies are in the hands of receivers; there is so much
bankruptcy on every hand, that all capital is held in the nervous clutch
of fear.Slowly, but surely, we are coming back to honest methods in
business.Confidence will return, and then enterprise will unlock the
safe and money will again circulate as of yore; the dollars will leave
their hitting places, and every one will be seeking investment.For my part I do not ask any interference on the part of the government
except to undo the wrong it has done.I do not ask that money be made
out of nothing.I do not ask for the prosperity born of paper.But I do
ask for the remonetization of silver.It was an imposition upon every solvent man; a fraud upon every honest
debtor in the United States.It was done in the
interest of avarice and greed, and should be undone by honest men.RELIGIOUS QUESTIONS




171.Redden your hands with human blood; blast by slander the fair fame
of the innocent; strangle the smiling child upon its mother's knees;
deceive, ruin and desert the beautiful girl who loves and trusts you,
and your case is not hopeless.For all this, and for all these you
may be forgiven.For all this, and for all these, that bankrupt court
established by the gospel, will give you a discharge; but deny the
existence of these divine ghosts, of these gods, and the sweet and
tearful face of Mercy becomes livid with eternal hate.Heaven's golden
gates are shut, and you, with an infinite curse ringing in your
ears, with the brand of infamy upon your brow, commence your endless
wanderings in the lurid gloom of hell--an immortal vagrant--an eternal
outcast--a deathless convict.Faith--A Mixture of Insanity and Ignorance

The doctrine that future happiness depends upon belief is monstrous.It is the infamy of infamies.The notion that faith in Christ is to
be rewarded by an eternity of bliss, while a dependence upon reason,
observation, and experience merits everlasting pain, is too absurd for
refutation, and can be relieved only by that unhappy mixture of insanity
and ignorance; called "faith."The church in the days of Voltaire contended that its servants were the
only legitimate physicians.The priests cured in the name of the church,
and in the name of God--by exorcism, relics, water, salt and oil.Gervasius was good for rheumatism, St.Ovidius
for deafness, St.Apollonia for
toothache, St.Clara for rheum in the eye, St.Devils were driven out with wax tapers, with incence (sp.), with holy
water, by pronouncing prayers.The church, as late as the middle of the
twelfth century, prohibited good Catholics from having anything to do
with physicians.The Sleep of Persecutors

All the persecutors sleep in peace, and the ashes of those who burned
their brothers in the name of Christ rest in consecrated ground.Whole
libraries could not contain even the names of the wretches who have
filled the world with violence and death in defense of book and creed,
and yet they all died the death of the righteous, and no priest or|
minister describes the agony and fear, the remorse and horror with which
their guilty souls were filled in the last moments of their lives.These
men had never doubted; they accepted the creed; they were not infidels;
they had not denied the divinity of Christ; they had been baptized;
they had partaken of the last supper; they had respected priests; they
admitted that the Holy Ghost had "proceeded;" and these things put
pillows beneath their dying heads and covered them with the drapery of
peace.There is no recorded instance where the uplifted hand of murder has been
paralyzed--no truthful account in all the literature of the world of the
innocent shielded by God.Thousands of crimes are being committed every
day--men are this moment lying in wait for their human prey; wives
are whipped and crushed, driven to insanity and death; little children
begging for mercy, lifting imploringly tear-filled eyes to the brutal
faces of fathers and mothers; sweet girls are deceived, lured, and
outraged; but God has no time to prevent these things--no time to defend
the good and to protect the pure.He is too busy numbering hairs and
watching sparrows.All kinds of criminals, except infidels, meet death with reasonable
serenity.As a rule, there is nothing in the death of a pirate to cast
any discredit on his profession.The murderer upon the scaffold, with
a priest on either side, smilingly exhorts the multitude to meet him in
heaven.The man who has succeeded in making his home a hell meets death
without a quiver, provided he has never expressed any doubt as to the
divinity of Christ or the eternal "procession" of the holy ghost.The
king who has waged cruel and useless war, who has filled countries with
widows and fatherless children, with the maimed and diseased, and who
has succeeded in offering to the Moloch of ambition the best and bravest
of his subjects, dies like a saint.The first Corpse and the first Cathedral

Now and then, in the history of this world, a man of genius, of sense,
of intellectual honesty has appeared.These men have denounced the
superstitions of their day.To see priests
devour the substance of the people filled them with indignation.These
men were honest enough to tell their thoughts.Then they were denounced,
condemned, executed.Some of them escaped the fury of the people who
loved their enemies, and died naturally in their beds.It would not be
for the church to admit that they died peacefully.That would show that
religion was not actually necessary in the last moment.Religion got
much of its power from the terror of death.Superstition is the child of
ignorance and fear.The first
corpse was the first priest.It would not do to have the common people
understand that a man could deny the Bible, refuse to look at the cross,
contend that Christ was only a man, and yet die as calmly as Calvin did
after he had murdered Servetus, or as King David, after advising one son
to kill another.The Sixteenth Century

In the sixteenth century every science was regarded as an outcast and an
enemy, and the church influenced the world, which was under its
power, to believe anything, and the ignorant mob was always too ready,
brutalized by the church, to hang, kill or crucify at their bidding.Such was the result of a few centuries of Christianity.An Orthodox Gentleman

By Orthodox I mean a gentleman who is petrified in his mind, whooping
around intellectually, simply to save the funeral expenses of his soul.A Bold Assertion

The churches point to their decayed saints, and their crumbled Popes
and say, "Do you know more than all the ministers that ever lived?"And without the slightest egotism or blush I say, yes, and the name of
Humboldt outweighs them all.The men who stand in the front rank, the
men who know most of the secrets of nature, the men who know most are
to-day the advanced infidels of this world.I have lived long enough to
see the brand of intellectual inferiority on every orthodox brain.If we admit that some infinite being has controlled the destinies of
persons and peoples, history becomes a most cruel and bloody farce.Age after age, the strong have trampled upon the weak; the crafty
and heartless have ensnared and enslaved the simple and innocent,
and nowhere, in all the annals of mankind, has any god succored the
oppressed.Weak ones Suffering--Heaven deaf

Most of the misery has been endured by the weak, the loving and the
innocent.Women have been treated like poisonous beasts, and little
children trampled upon as though they had been vermin.Numberless altars
have been reddened, even with the blood of babes; beautiful girls have
been given to slimy serpents; whole races of men doomed to centuries
of slavery, and everywhere there has been outrage beyond the power
of genius to express.During all these years the suffering have
supplicated; the withered lips of famine have prayed; the pale victims
have implored, and Heaven has been deaf and blind.Heaven has no Ear, no Hand

Man should cease to expect aid from on high.By this time he should know
that heaven has no ear to hear, and no hand to help.The present is the
necessary child of all the past.There has been no chance, and there can
be no interference.Religion is Tyrannical

Religion does not, and cannot, contemplate man as free.She accepts only
the homage of the prostrate, and scorns the offerings of those who stand
erect.The wide and sunny
fields belong not to her domain.The star-lit heights of genius and
individuality are above and beyond her appreciation and power.Her
subjects cringe at her feet, covered with the dust of obedience.Religion and Facts

What has religion to do with facts?Is there any such thing
as Methodist mathematics, Presbyterian botany, Catholic astronomy or
Baptist biology?What has any form of superstition or religion to do
with a fact or with any science?Nothing but hinder, delay or embarass.I want, then, to free the schools; and I want to free the politicians,
so that a man will not have to pretend he is a Methodist, or his wife
a Baptist, or his grandmother a Catholic; so that he can go through
a campaign, and when he gets through will find none of the dust of
hypocrisy on his knees.Religion not the End of Life

We deny that religion is the end or object of this life.When it is so
considered it becomes destructive of happiness--the real end of life.It becomes a hydra-headed monster, reaching in terrible coils from the
heavens, and thrusting its thousand fangs into the bleeding, quivering
hearts of men.It devours their substance, builds palaces for God, (who
dwells not in temples made with hands,) and allows his children to
die in huts and hovels.It fills the earth with mourning, heaven with
hatred, the present with fear, and all the future with despair.Creeds

Just in proportion that the human race has advanced, the Church has lost
power.No nation ever materially
advanced that held strictly to the religion of its founders.No nation
ever gave itself wholly to the control of the Church without losing its
power, its honor, and existence.Every Church pretends to have found
the exact truth.Every creed is a rock in running
water; humanity sweeps by it.Every creed cries to the universe, "Halt!"A creed is the ignorant Past bullying the enlightened Present.The Worst Religion in the World

The worst religion of the world was the Presbyterianism of Scotland as
it existed in the beginning of the eighteenth century.The kirk had all
the faults of the church of Rome, without a redeeming feature.The kirk
hated music, painting, statuary, and architecture.Anything touched with
humanity--with the dimples of joy--was detested and accursed.God was
to be feared, not loved.Happiness was a snare, and human love was wicked,
weak, and vain.The Presbyterian priest of Scotland was as cruel,
bigoted, and heartless as the familiar of the inquisition.In the beginning of this, the nineteenth century, a boy
seventeen years of age, Thomas Aikenhead, was indicted and tried
at Edinburgh for blasphemy.He had on several occasions, when cold,
jocularly wished himself in hell, that he might get warm.The poor,
frightened boy recanted--begged for mercy; but he was found guilty,
hanged, thrown in a hole at the foot of the scaffold; and his weeping
mother vainly begged that his bruised and bleeding body might be given
to her.Religion Demanding Miracles

The founder of a religion must be able to turn water into wine--cure
with a word the blind and lame, and raise with a simple touch the dead
to life.It was necessary for him to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of his barbarian disciple, that he was superior to nature.In times of
ignorance this was easy to do.The credulity of the savage was almost
boundless.To him the marvelous was the beautiful, the mysterious was
the sublime.Consequently, every religion has for its foundation a
miracle--that is to say, a violation of nature--that is to say, a
falsehood.We Want One Fact

We have heard talk enough.We have listened to all the drowsy, idealess,
vapid sermons that we wish to hear.We have read your Bible and the
works of your best minds.We have heard your prayers, your solemn groans
and your reverential amens.We beg at the doors of your churches for just one little
fact.We pass our hats along your pews and under your pulpits and
implore you for just one fact.We know all about your mouldy wonders and
your stale miracles.The Design Argument

These religious people see nothing but designs everywhere, and personal,
intelligent interference in everything.They insist that the universe
has been created, and that the adaptation of means to ends is perfectly
apparent.They point us to the sunshine, to the flowers, to the April
rain, and to all there is of beauty and of use in the world.Did it ever
occur to them that a cancer is as beautiful in its development as is the
reddest rose?That what they are pleased to call the adaptation of
means to ends, is as apparent in the cancer as in the April rain?By what ingenious methods the
blood is poisoned so that the cancer shall have food!By what wonderful
contrivances the entire system of man is made to pay tribute to this
divine and charming cancer!See by what admirable instrumentalities it
feeds itself from the surrounding quivering, dainty flesh!See how it
gradually but surely expands and grows!By what marvelous mechanism
it is supplied with long and slender roots that reach out to the most
secret nerves of pain for sustenance and life!Down, Forever Down

Down, forever down, with any religion that requires upon its ignorant
altar the sacrifice of the goddess Reason, that compels her to abdicate
forever the shining throne of the soul, strips from her form the
imperial purple, snatches from her hand the sceptre of thought and makes
her the bondwoman of a senseless faith!The Back

Upon this rack I have described, this victim was placed, and those
chains were attached to his ankles and then to his waist, and clergyman,
good men pious men!men that were shocked at the immorality of their
day!they talked about playing cards and the horrible crime of dancing!how such things shocked them; men going to the theatres and seeing a
play written by the grandest genius the world ever has produced--how it
shocked their sublime and tender souls!but they commenced turning this
machine and they kept on turning until the ankles, knees, hips, elbows,
shoulders and wrists were all dislocated and the victim was red with the
sweat of agony, and they had standing by a physician to feel the pulse,
so that the last faint flutter of life would not leave his veins.simply that they might
have the pleasure of racking him once again.That is the spirit, and it
is a spirit born of the doctrine that there is upon the throne of the
universe a being who will eternally damn his children, and they said:
"If God is going to have the supreme happiness of burning them forever,
certainly he might not to begrudge to us the joy of burning them for an
hour or two."That was their doctrine, and when I read these things it
seems to me that I have suffered them myself.An Awful Admission

Just think of going to the day of judgment, if there is one, and
standing up before God and admitting without a blush that you had lived
and died a Scotch Presbyterian.I would expect the next sentence would
be, "Depart ye curged into everlasting fire."CHURCHES AND PRIESTS




195.The Church Forbids Investigation

The first doubt was the womb and cradle of progress, and from the first
doubt, man has continued to advance.Men began to investigate, and the
church began to oppose.The astronomer scanned the heavens, while the
church branded his grand forehead with the word, "Infidel;" and now,
not a glittering star in all the vast expanse bears a Christian name.In spite of all religion, the geologist penetrated the earth, read her
history in books of stone, and found, hidden within her bosom souvenirs
of all the ages.The Church Charges Falsely

Notwithstanding the fact that infidels in all ages have battled for
the rights of man, and have at all times been the fearless advocates
of liberty and justice, we are constantly charged by the Church with
tearing down without building again.The Church in the "Dark Ages"

During that frightful period known as the "Dark Ages," Faith reigned,
with scarcely a rebellious subject.Her temples were "carpeted with
knees," and the wealth of nations adorned her countless shrines.The
great painters prostituted their genius to immortalize her vagaries,
while the poets enshrined them in song.At her bidding, man covered the
earth with blood.The scales of Justice were turned with her gold, and
for her use were invented all the cunning instruments of pain.She built
cathedrals for God, and dungeons for men.She peopled the clouds with
angels and the earth with slaves.For ages, a deadly conflict has been waged between a few brave men and
women of thought and genius upon the one side, and the great ignorant
religious mass on the other.The few have appealed to reason, to honor, to law, to freedom, to the
known, and to happiness here in this world.The many have appealed
to prejudice, to fear, to miracle, to slavery, to the unknown, and
to misery hereafter.The many have said,
"Believe!"The Church and the Tree of Knowledge

The gods dreaded education and knowledge then just as they do now.The
church still faithfully guards the dangerous tree of knowledge, and has
exerted in all ages her utmost power to keep mankind from eating the
fruit thereof.The priests have never ceased repeating the old falsehood
and the old threat: "Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,
lest ye die."Let the church, or one of its
intellectual saints, perform a miracle, and we will believe.We are told
that nature has a superior.Let this superior, for one single instant,
control nature and we will admit the truth of your assertions.The Heretics Cried, "Halt!"A few infidels--a few heretics cried, "Halt!"to the great rabble of
ignorant devotion, and made it possible for the genius of the nineteenth
century to revolutionize the cruel creeds and superstitions of mankind.The World not so Awful Flat

According to the Christian system this world was the centre of
everything.The stars were made out of what little God happened to have
left when he got the world done.God lived up in the sky, and they said
this earth must rest upon something, and finally science passed its hand
clear under, and there was nothing.It was self-existent in infinite
space.Then the Church began to say they didn't say it was flat, not so
awful flat--it was kind of rounding.According to the ancient Christians God lived from all eternity, and
never worked but six days in His whole life, and then had the impudence
to tell us to be industrious.Christian nations are the warlike nations of this world.Christians have
invented the most destructive weapons of war.Christianity gave us the
revolver, invented the rifle, made the bombshell; and Christian
nations here and there had above all other arts the art of war; and as
Christians they have no respect for the rights of barbarians or for the
rights of any nation or tribe that happens to differ with them.See what
it does in our society; we are divided off into little sects that used
to discuss these questions with fire and sword, with chain and <DW19>,
and that discuss, some of them, even to-day, with misrepresentation and
slander.Every day something happens to show me that the old spirit that
that was in the inquisition still slumbers in the breasts of men.Another Day of Divine Work

I heard of a man going to California over the plains, and there was a
clergyman on board, and he had a great deal to say, and finally he
fell in conversation with the forty-niner, and the latter said to the
clergyman, "Do you believe that God made this world in six days?"They were then going along the Humboldt.Says he, "Don't you think
he could put in another day to advantage right around here?"The Donkey and the Lion

Owing to the attitude of the churches for the last fifteen hundred
years, truth-telling has not been a very lucrative business.As a rule,
hypocrisy has worn the robes, and honesty the rags.You cannot now answer the argument of a man by pointing at
the holes in his coat.Thomas Paine attacked the Church when it was
powerful--when it had what is called honors to bestow--when it was
the keeper of the public conscience--when it was strong and cruel.The
Church waited till he was dead, and then attacked his reputation and his
clothes.Once upon a time a donkey kicked a lion, but the lion was dead.The Orthodox Christian

The highest type of the orthodox Christian does not forget; neither
does he learn.He is a living fossil
embedded in that rock called faith.He makes no effort to better his
condition, because all his strength is exhausted in keeping other people
from improving theirs.The supreme desire of his heart is to force all
others to adopt his creed, and in order to accomplish this object he
denounces free-thinking as a crime, and this crime he calls heresy.When
he had power, heresy was the most terrible and formidable of words.It
meant confiscation, exile, imprisonment, torture, and death.Alms-Dish and Sword

I will not say the Church has been an unmitigated evil in all respects.It has delighted in the production
of extremes.It has furnished murderers for its own martyrs.It has
sometimes fed the body, but has always starved the soul.It has been a
charitable highwayman--a profligate beggar--a generous pirate.It
has produced some angels and a multitude of devils.It has built more
prisons than asylums.It made a hundred orphans while it cared for one.In one hand it has carried the alms-dish and in the other a sword.The Church the Great Robber

The Church has been, and still is, the great robber.She has rifled not
only the pockets but the brains of the world.She is the stone at the
sepulchre of liberty; the upas tree, in whose shade the intellect of man
has withered; the Gorgon beneath whose gaze the human heart has turned
to stone.Under her influence even the Protestant mother expects to be
happy in heaven, while her brave boy, who fell fighting for the rights
of man, shall writhe in hell.The Church Impotent

The Church, impotent and malicious, regrets, not the abuse, but the loss
of her power, and seeks to hold by falsehood what she gained by cruelty
and force, by fire and fear.Christianity cannot live in peace with any
other form of faith.Toleration

Let it be remembered that all churches have persecuted heretics to the
extent of their power.Toleration has increased only when and where the
power of the church has diminished.From Augustine until now the
spirit of the Christians has remained the same.There has been the same
intolerance, the same undying hatred of all who think for themselves,
and the same determination to crush out of the human brain all knowledge
inconsistent with an ignorant creed.Shakespeare's Plays v. Sermons

What would the church people think if the theatrical people should
attempt to suppress the churches?What harm would it do to have an opera
here tonight?It would elevate us more than to hear ten thousand sermons
on the worm that never dies.There is more practical wisdom in one of
the plays of Shakespeare than in all the sacred books ever written.What
wrong would there be to see one of those grand plays on Sunday?There
was a time when the church would not allow you to cook on Sunday.You
had to eat your victuals cold.There was a time they thought the more
miserable you feel the better God feels.Give any orthodox church the power, and to-day they would punish heresy
with whip, and chain, and fire.As long as a church deems a certain
belief essential to salvation, just so long it will kill and burn if it
has the power.Why should the Church pity a man whom her God hates?Why
should she show mercy to a kind and noble heretic whom her God will burn
in eternal fire?Cathedrals and domes, and chimes and chants--temples frescoed and
groined and carved, and gilded with gold--altars and tapers, and
paintings of virgin and babe--censer and chalice--chasuble, paten
and alb--organs, and anthems and incense rising to the winged and
blest--maniple, amice and stole--crosses and crosiers, tiaras
and crowns--mitres and missals and masses--rosaries, relics and
robes--martyrs and saints, and windows stained as with the blood of
Christ--never, never for one moment awed the brave, proud spirit of the
Infidel.He knew that all the pomp and glitter had been purchased with
Liberty--that priceless jewel of the soul.In looking at the cathedral
he remembered the dungeon.The music of the organ was loud enough to
drown the clank of fetters.He could not forget that the taper had
lighted the fagot.He knew that the cross adorned the hilt of the sword,
and so where others worshiped, he wept and scorned.Back to Chaos

Suppose the Church could control the world today, we would go back to
chaos and old night philosophy would be branded as infamous; science
would again press its pale and thoughtful face against the prison bars,
and round the limbs of liberty would climb the bigot's flame.Infinite Impudence of the Church

Who can imagine the infinite impudence of a Church assuming to think for
the human race?Who can imagine the infinite impudence of a Church
that pretends to be the mouthpiece of God, and in his name threatens to
inflict eternal punishment upon those who honestly reject its claims and
scorn its pretensions?By what right does a man, or an organization
of men, or a god, claim to hold a brain in bondage?When a fact can be
demonstrated, force is unnecessary; when it cannot be demonstrated, an
appeal to force is infamous.In the presence of the unknown all have an
equal right to think.Wanted!--A New Method

The world is covered with forts to protect Christians from Christians,
and every sea is covered with iron monsters ready to blow Christian
brains into eternal froth.Millions upon millions are annually expended
in the effort to construct still more deadly and terrible engines of
death.Industry is crippled, honest toil is robbed, and even beggary is
taxed to defray the expenses of Christian warfare.There must be some
other way to reform this world.The Kirk of Scotland

The Church was ignorant, bloody, and relentless.In Scotland the "Kirk"
was at the summit of its power.It was a full sister of the Spanish
Inquisition.It was the enemy of
happiness, the hater of joy, and the despiser of religious liberty.It
taught parents to murder their children rather than to allow them to
propagate error.If the mother held opinions of which the infamous
"Kirk" disapproved, her children were taken from her arms, her babe from
her very bosom, and she was not allowed to see them, or to write them a
word.It would not allow shipwrecked sailors to be rescued from drowning
on Sunday.It sought to annihilate pleasure, to pollute the heart by
filling it with religious cruelty and gloom, and to change mankind into
a vast horde of pious, heartless fiends.One of the most famous Scotch
divines said: "The Kirk holds that religious toleration is not far from
blasphemy."The Church Looks Back

The Church is, and always has been, incapable of a forward movement.The Church has already reduced Spain to a
guitar, Italy to a hand-organ, and Ireland to exile.Diogenes

The Church used painting, music and architecture, simply to degrade
mankind.There have been at all
times brave spirits that dared even the gods.Some proud head has always
been above the waves.In every age some Diogenes has sacrificed to all
the gods.True genius never cowers, and there is always some Samson
feeling for the pillars of authority.The Church and War

It does seem as though the most zealous Christian must at times
entertain some doubt as to the divine origin of his religion.For
eighteen hundred years the doctrine has been preached.For more than
a thousand years the Church had, to a great extent, the control of the
civilized world, and what has been the result?Are the Christian nations
patterns of charity and forbearance?On the contrary, their principal
business is to destroy each other.More than five millions of Christians
are trained, educated, and drilled to murder their fellow-christians.Every nation is groaning under a vast debt incurred in carrying on war
against other Christians.The Call to Preach

An old deacon, wishing to get rid of an unpopular preacher, advised him
to give up the ministry and turn his attention to something else.The
preacher replied that he could not conscientiously desert the pulpit, as
he had had a "call" to the ministry.To which the deacon replied, "That
may be so, but it's very unfortunate for you, that when God called you
to preach, he forgot to call anybody to hear you."Burning Servetus

The maker of the Presbyterian creed caused the fugitive Servetus to be
arrested for blasphemy.He was
convicted and condemned to death by fire.On the morning of the fatal
day, Calvin saw him, and Servetus, the victim, asked forgiveness of
Calvin, the murderer.Servetus was bound to the stake, and the <DW19>s
were lighted.The wind carried the flames somewhat away from his body,
so that he slowly roasted for hours.Vainly he implored a speedy death.At last the flames climbed round his form; through smoke and fire his
murderers saw a white, heroic face.And there they watched until a man
became a charred and shriveled mass.Liberty was banished from Geneva,
and nothing but Presbyterianism was left.Freedom for the Clergy

One of the first things I wish to do is to free the orthodox clergy.I
am a great friend of theirs, and in spite of all they may say against
me, I am going to do them a great and lasting service.Upon their necks
are visible the marks of the collar, and upon their backs those of the
lash.They are not allowed to read and think for themselves.They are
taught like parrots, and the best are those who repeat, with the fewest
mistakes, the sentences they have been taught.They sit like owls upon
some dead limb of the tree of knowledge, and hoot the same old hoots
that have been hooted for eighteen hundred years.The Pulpit Weakening

There was a time when a falsehood, fulminated from the pulpit, smote
like a sword; but, the supply having greatly exceeded the demand,
clerical misrepresentation has at last become almost an innocent
amusement.Remembering that only a few years ago men, women, and even
children, were imprisoned, tortured and burned, for having expressed
in an exceedingly mild and gentle way, the ideas entertained by me, I
congratulate myself that calumny is now the pulpit's last resort.Origin of the Priesthood

This was the origin of the priesthood.The priest pretended to stand
between the wrath of the gods and the helplessness of man.He was man's
attorney at the court of heaven.He carried to the invisible world a
flag of truce, a protest and a request.He came back with a command,
with authority and with power.Man fell upon his knees before his own
servant, and the priest, taking advantage of the awe inspired by his
supposed influence with the gods, made of his fellow-man a cringing
hypocrite and slave.The Clergy on Heaven

The clergy, however, balance all the real ills of this life with the
expected joys of the next.We are assured that all is perfection in
heaven--there the skies are cloudless--there all is serenity and peace.Here empires may be overthrown; dynasties may be extinguished in blood;
millions of slaves may toil 'neath the fierce rays of the sun, and the
cruel strokes of the lash; yet all is happiness in heaven.Pestilences
may strew the earth with corpses of the loved; the survivors may bend
above them in agony--yet the placid bosom of heaven is unruffled.Children may expire vainly asking for bread; babes may be devoured by
serpents, while the gods sit smiling in the clouds.The Parson, the Crane and the Fish

A devout clergyman sought every opportunity to impress upon the mind
of his son the fact, that God takes care of all his creatures; that the
falling sparrow attracts his attention, and that his loving-kindness is
over all his works.Happening, one day, to see a crane wading in quest
of food, the good man pointed out to his son the perfect adaptation of
the crane to get his living in that manner."See," said he, "how his
legs are formed for wading!Observe how
nicely he folds his feet when putting them in or drawing them out of
the water!He is thus enabled
to approach the fish without giving them any notice of his arrival.My son," said he, "it is impossible to look at that bird without
recognizing the design, as well as the goodness of God, in thus
providing the means of subsistence.""Yes," replied the boy, "I think I
see the goodness of God, at least so far as the crane is concerned; but,
after all, father, don't you think the arrangement a little tough on the
fish?"Give me the storm of tempest and action, rather than the dead calm of
ignorance and faith.Banish me from Eden when you will; but first let me
eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge!The Pulpit's Cry of Fear

From every pulpit comes the same cry, born of the same fear: "Lest
they eat and become as gods, knowing good and evil."For this reason,
religion hates science, faith detests reason, theology is the sworn
enemy of philosophy, and the church with its flaming sword still guards
the hated tree, and like its supposed founder, curses to the lowest
depths the brave thinkers who eat and become as gods.Restive Clergymen

Some of the clergy have the independence to break away, and the
intellect to maintain themselves as free men, but the most are compelled
to submit to the dictation of the orthodox, and the dead.They are
not employed to give their thoughts, but simply to repeat the ideas of
others.They are not expected to give even the doubts that may suggest
themselves, but are required to walk in the narrow, verdureless path
trodden by the ignorance of the past.The forests and fields on either
side are nothing to them.The Parson Factory at Andover

They have in Massachusetts, at a place called Andover, a kind of
minister-factory; and every professor in that factory takes an oath once
in every five years--that is as long as an oath will last--that not only
has he not during the last five years, but so help him God, he will not
during the next five years intellectually advance; and probably there is
no oath he could easier keep.Since the foundation of that institution
there has not been one case of perjury.They believe the same creed they
first taught when the foundation stone was laid, and now when they send
out a minister they brand him as hardware from Sheffield and Birmingham.And every man who knows where he was educated knows his creed, knows
every argument of his creed, every book that he reads, and just what he
amounts to intellectually, and knows he will shrink and shrivel.A Charge to Presbyteries

Go on, presbyteries and synods, go on!Thrust the heretics out of the
Church--that is to say, throw away your brains,--put out your eyes.Every
deserter from your camp is a recruit for the army of progress.Cling to
the ignorant dogmas of the past; read the 109th Psalm; gloat over the
slaughter of mothers and babes; thank God for total depravity; shower
your honors upon hypocrites, and silence every minister who is touched
with that heresy called genius.Turn out the
astronomers, the geologists, the naturalists, the chemists, and all the
honest scientists.With a whip of scorpions, drive them all out.Nature the True Bible

The true Bible appeals to man in the name of demonstration.It has no fear of being read, of being contradicted,
of being investigated and understood.It does not pretend to be holy, or
sacred; it simply claims to be true.It challenges the scrutiny of
all, and implores every reader to verify every line for himself.It is
incapable of being blasphemed.This book appeals to all the surroundings
of man.Each thing that exists testifies of its perfection.The earth,
with its heart of fire and crowns of snow; with its forests and plains,
its rocks and seas; with its every wave and cloud; with its every leaf
and bud and flower, confirms its every word, and the solemn stars,
shining in the infinite abysses, are the eternal witnesses of its truth.Inspiration

I will tell you what I mean by inspiration.I go and look at the sea,
and the sea says something to me; it makes an impression upon my mind.That impression depends, first, upon my experience; secondly, upon
my intellectual capacity.He has a
different brain, he has had a different experience, he has different
memories and different hopes.The sea may speak to him of joy and to me
of grief and sorrow.The sea cannot tell the same thing to two beings,
because no two human beings have had the same experience.So, when I
look upon a flower, or a star, or a painting, or a statue, the more I
know about sculpture the more that statue speaks to me.The more I have
had of human experience, the more I have read, the greater brain I have,
the more the star says to me.In other words, nature says to me all that
I am capable of understanding.Think of a God wicked and malicious enough to inspire this prayer in
the 109th Psalm.Had this
inspired psalm been found in some temple erected for the worship of
snakes, or in the possession of some cannibal king, written with blood
upon the dried skins of babes, there would have been a perfect harmony
between its surroundings and its sentiments.I Don't Believe the Bible

Now, I read the Bible, and I find that God so loved this world that he
made up his mind to damn the most of us.I have read this book, and what
shall I say of it?I believe it is generally better to be honest.Now,
I don't believe the Bible.They say that if you
do you will regret it when you come to die.If that be true, I know a
great many religious people who will have no cause to regret it--they
don't tell their honest convictions about the Bible.The Bible the Real Persecutor

The Bible was the real persecutor.The Bible burned heretics, built
dungeons, founded the Inquisition, and trampled upon all the liberties
of men.How long, O how long will mankind worship a book?How long will
they grovel in the dust before the ignorant legends of the barbaric
past?How long, O how long will they pursue phantoms in a darkness
deeper than death?Immoralities of the Bible

The believers in the Bible are loud in their denunciation of what they
are pleased to call the immoral literature of the world; and yet few
books have been published containing more moral filth than this inspired
word of God.These stories are not redeemed by a single flash of wit or
humor.They never rise above the dull details of stupid vice.For one,
I cannot afford to soil my pages with extracts from them; and all such
portions of the Scriptures I leave to be examined, written upon, and
explained by the clergy.Clergymen may know some way by which they can
extract honey from these flowers.Until these passages are expunged from
the Old Testament, it is not a fit book to be read by either old or
young.It contains pages that no minister in the United States would
read to his congregation for any reward whatever.There are chapters
that no gentleman would read in the presence of a lady.There are
chapters that no father would read to his child.There are narratives
utterly unfit to be told; and the time will come when mankind will
wonder that such a book was ever called inspired.The Bible Stands in the Way

But as long as the Bible is considered as the work of God, it will be
hard to make all men too good and pure to imitate it; and as long as it
is imitated there will be vile and filthy books.The literature of
our country will not be sweet and clean until the Bible ceases to be
regarded as the production of a god.The Bible False

In the days of Thomas Paine the Church believed and taught that every
word in the Bible was absolutely true.Since his day it has been proven
false in its cosmogony, false in its astronomy, false in its chronology,
false in its history, and so far as the Old Testament is concerned,
false in almost everything.There are but few, if any, scientific men
who apprehend that the Bible is literally true.Who on earth at this
day would pretend to settle any scientific question by a text from
the Bible?The old belief is confined to the ignorant and zealous.The Church itself will before long be driven to occupy the position of
Thomas Paine.The Man I Love

I love any man who gave me, or helped to give me, the liberty I enjoy
to-night.I love every man who helped put our flag in heaven.I love
every man who has lifted his voice in all the ages for liberty, for a
chainless body, and a fetterless brain.I love every man who has given
to every other human being every right that he claimed for himself.I
love every man who thought more of principle than he did of position.I
love the men who have trampled crowns beneath their feet that they might
do something for mankind.Whale, Jonah and All

The best minds of the orthodox world, to-day, are endeavoring to prove
the existence of a personal Deity.You are no longer asked to swallow the Bible whole, whale,
Jonah and all; you are simply required to believe in God, and pay your
pew-rent.There is not now an enlightened minister in the world who will
seriously contend that Samson's strength was in his hair, or that the
necromancers of Egypt could turn water into blood, and pieces of wood
into serpents.Damned for Laughing at Samson

For my part, I would infinitely prefer to know all the results of
scientific investigation, than to be inspired as Moses was.Supposing
the Bible to be true; why is it any worse or more wicked for free
thinkers to deny it, than for priests to deny the doctrine of Evolution,
or the dynamic theory of heat?Why should we be damned for laughing at
Samson and his foxes, while others, holding the Nebular Hypothesis in
utter contempt, go straight to heaven?The Man, Not the Book, Inspired

Now when I come to a book, for instance I read the writings of
Shakespeare--Shakespeare, the greatest human being who ever existed upon
this globe.All that I have sense enough to
understand.Let another read him who knows
nothing of the drama, who knows nothing of the impersonation of passion;
what does he get from him?In other words, every man gets
from a book, a flower, a star, or the sea, what he is able to get from
his intellectual development and experience.Do you then believe that
the Bible is a different book to every human being that receives it?Can God, then, through the Bible, make the same revelation to two
men?Because the man who reads is the man who inspires.Inspiration is in the man and not in the book.The Bible a Chain

The real oppressor, enslaver and corrupter of the people is the Bible.That book is the chain that binds, the dungeon that holds the clergy.That book spreads the pall of superstition over the colleges and
schools.That book puts out the eyes of science, and makes honest
investigation a crime.That book unmans the politician and degrades the
people.That book fills the world with bigotry, hypocrisy and fear.Absurd and Foolish Fables

Volumes might be written upon the infinite absurdity of this most
incredible, wicked and foolish of all the fables contained in that
repository of the impossible, called the Bible.To me it is a matter
of amazement, that it ever was for a moment believed by any intelligent
human being.The Bible the Work of Man

Is it not infinitely more reasonable to say that this book is the work
of man, that it is filled with mingled truth and error, with mistakes
and facts, and reflects, too faithfully perhaps, the "very form and
pressure of its time?"If there are mistakes in the Bible, certainly
they were made by man.If there is anything contrary to nature, it
was written by man.If there is anything immoral, cruel, heartless
or infamous, it certainly was never written by a being worthy of the
adoration of mankind.Something to Admire, not Laugh at

It strikes me that God might write a book that would not necessarily
excite the laughter of his children.In fact, I think it would be
safe to say that a real God could produce a work that would excite the
admiration of mankind.An Intellectual Deformity

The man who now regards the Old Testament as, in any sense, a sacred or
inspired book, is, in my judgment, an intellectual and moral deformity.There is in it so much that is cruel, ignorant, and ferocious, that it
is to me a matter of amazement that it was ever thought to be the work
of a most merciful Deity.The Bible a Poor Product

Admitting that the Bible is the Book of God, is that his only good job?Will not a man be damned as quick for denying the equator as denying
the Bible?Will he not be damned as quick for denying geology as for
denying the scheme of salvation?When the Bible was first written it was
not believed.Had they known as much about science as we know now, that
Bible would not have been written.The Bible the Battle Ground of Sects

Every sect is a certificate that God has not plainly revealed his will
to man.To each reader the Bible conveys a different meaning.About the
meaning of this book, called a revelation, there have been ages of war,
and centuries of sword and flame.If written by an infinite God, he must
have known that these results must follow; and thus knowing, he must be
responsible for all.The Bible Childish

Paine thought the barbarities of the Old Testament inconsistent with
what he deemed the real character of God.He believed that murder,
massacre and indiscriminate slaughter had never been commanded by
the Deity.He regarded much of the Bible as childish, unimportant
and foolish.Paine
attacked the Bible precisely in the same spirit in which he had attacked
the pretensions of kings.All the pomp in the
world could not make him cower.His reason knew no "Holy of Holies,"
except the abode of Truth.Where Moses got the Pentateuch

Nothing can be clearer than that Moses received from the Egyptians the
principal parts of his narrative, making such changes and additions as
were necessary to satisfy the peculiar superstitions of his own people.God's Letter to His Children

According to the theologians, God, the Father of us all, wrote a letter
to his children.The children have always differed somewhat as to the
meaning of this letter.In consequence of these honest differences,
these brothers began to cut out each other's hearts.In every land,
where this letter from God has been read, the children to whom and for
whom it was written have been filled with hatred and malice.They have
imprisoned and murdered each other, and the wives and children of each
other.In the name of God every possible crime has been committed, every
conceivable outrage has been perpetrated.Brave men, tender and loving
women, beautiful girls, and prattling babes have been exterminated in
the name of Jesus Christ.Examination a Crime

The Church has burned honesty and rewarded hypocrisy.And all this,
because it was commanded by a book--a book that men had been taught
implicitly to believe, long before they knew one word that was in it.They had been taught that to doubt the truth of this book--to examine
it, even--was a crime of such enormity that it could not be forgiven,
either in this world or in the next.All that is necessary, as it seems to me, to convince any reasonable
person that the Bible is simply and purely of human invention--of
barbarian invention--is to read it.Read it as you would any other book;
think of it as you would any other; get the bandage of reverence from
your eyes; drive from your heart the phantom of fear; push from the
throne of your brain the cowled form of superstition--then read the Holy
Bible, and you will be amazed that you ever, for one moment, supposed a
being of infinite wisdom, goodness and purity, to be the author of such
ignorance and such atrocity.An Infallible Book Makes Slaves

Whether the Bible is false or true, is of no consequence in comparison
with the mental freedom of the race.Salvation from slavery is inestimable.As long as man
believes the Bible to be infallible, that book is his master.The
civilization of this century is not the child of faith, but of
unbelief--the result of free thought.Can a Sane Man Believe in Inspiration?What man who ever thinks, can believe that blood can appease God?And
yet our entire system of religion is based on that belief.The Jews
pacified Jehovah with the blood of animals, and according to the
Christian system, the blood of Jesus softened the heart of God a little,
and rendered possible the salvation of a fortunate few.It is hard to
conceive how any sane man can read the Bible and still believe in the
doctrine of inspiration.An Inspiration Test

The Bible was originally written in the Hebrew language, and the Hebrew
language at that time had no vowels in writing.It was written entirely
with consonants, and without being divided into chapters and verses, and
there was no system of punctuation whatever.After you go home to-night
write an English sentence or two with only consonants close together,
and you will find that it will take twice as much inspiration to read it
as it did to write it.The Real Bible

The real Bible is not the work of inspired men, nor prophets, nor
evangelists, nor of Christs.The real Bible has not yet been written,
but is being written.Every man who finds a fact adds a word to this
great book.The Bad Passages in the Bible not Inspired

The bad passages in the Bible are not inspired.No God ever upheld
human slavery, polygamy or a war of extermination.No God ever ordered
a soldier to sheathe his sword in the breast of a mother.No God ever
ordered a warrior to butcher a smiling, prattling babe.No God ever said, be subject to the powers that be.No
God ever endeavored to make man a slave and woman a beast of burden.There are thousands of good passages in the Bible.There are in it wise laws, good customs, some lofty and splendid things.And I do not care whether they are inspired or not, so they are true.But what I do insist upon is that the bad is not inspired.Too much Pictorial

There is no hope for you.It is just as bad to deny hell as it is to
deny heaven.The Garden of Eden is pictorial; a pictorial snake and
a pictorial woman, I suppose, and a pictorial man, and may be it was a
pictorial sin.One Plow worth a Million Sermons

Man must learn to rely upon himself.Reading Bibles will not protect
him from the blasts of winter, but houses, fire and clothing will.To
prevent famine one plow is worth a million sermons, and even patent
medicines will cure more diseases than all the prayers uttered since the
beginning of the world.The Infidels of 1776

By the efforts of these infidels--Paine, Jefferson and Franklin--the
name of God was left out of the Constitution of the United States.They
knew that if an infinite being was put in, no room would be left for the
people.They knew that if any church was made the mistress of the state,
that mistress, like all others, would corrupt, weaken, and destroy.Washington wished a church, established by law, in Virginia.He was
prevented by Thomas Jefferson.It was only a little while ago that
people were compelled to attend church by law in the Eastern States,
and taxes were raised for the support of churches the same as for the
construction of highways and bridges.The great principle enunciated
in the Constitution has silently repealed most of these laws.In the
presence of this great instrument the constitutions of the States grew
small and mean, and in a few years every law that puts a chain upon the
mind, except in Delaware, will be repealed, and for these our children
may thank the infidels of 1776.The Legitimate Influence of Religion

Religion should have the influence upon mankind that its goodness, that
its morality, its justice, its charity, its reason and its argument give
it, and no more.Religion should have the effect upon mankind that it
necessarily has, and no more.Infidels the Flowers of the World

The infidels have been the brave and thoughtful men; the flower of all
the world; the pioneers and heralds of the blessed day of liberty and
love; the generous spirits of the unworthy past; the seers and
prophets of our race; the great chivalric souls, proud victors on the
battle-fields of thought, the creditors of all the years to be.The Noblest Sons of, Earth

Who at the present day can imagine the courage, the devotion to
principle, the intellectual and moral grandeur it once required to be an
infidel, to brave the Church, her racks, her fagots, her dungeons, her
tongues of fire--to defy and scorn her heaven and her hell--her devil
and her God?They were the noblest sons of earth.They were the real
saviors of our race, the destroyers of superstition, and the creators
of Science.They were the real Titans who bared their grand foreheads to
all the thunderbolts of all the gods.How Ingersoll became an Infidel

I may say right here that the Christian idea that any God can make me
His friend by killing mine is about as great a mistake as could be made.They seem to have the idea that just as soon as God kills all the people
that a person loves, he will then begin to love the Lord.What drew
my attention first to these questions was the doctrine of eternal
punishment.This was so abhorrent to my mind that I began to hate the
book in which it was taught.Then, in reading law, going back to find
the origin of laws, I found one had to go but a little way before the
legislator and priest united.This led me to study a good many of the
religions of the world.At first I was greatly astonished to find most
of them better than ours.I then studied our own system to the best of
my ability, and found that people were palming off upon children
and upon one another as the inspired words of God a book that upheld
slavery, polygamy, and almost every other crime.Whether I am right or
wrong, I became convinced that the Bible is not an inspired book, and
then the only question for me to settle was as to whether I should say
what I believed or not.This realty was not the question in my mind,
because, before even thinking of such a question, I expressed my belief,
and I simply claim that right, and expect to exercise it as long as I
live.I may be damned for it in the next world, but it is a great source
of pleasure to me in this.Why should it be taken for granted that the men who devoted their lives
to the liberation of their fellowmen should have been hissed at in
the hour of death by the snakes of conscience, while men who defended
slavery--practiced polygamy--justified the stealing of babes from the
breasts of mothers, and lashed the naked back of unpaid labor, are
supposed to have passed smilingly from earth to the embraces of the
angels?Why should we think that the brave thinkers, the investigators,
the honest men must have left the crumbling shore of time in dread and
fear, while the instigators of the massacre of St.Bartholomew, the
inventors and users of thumb screws, of iron boots and racks, the
burners and tearers of human flesh, the stealers, the whippers, and the
enslavers of men, the buyers and beaters of maidens, mothers, and babes,
the founders of the inquisition, the makers of chains, the builders of
dungeons, the calumniators of the living, the slanderers of the
dead, and even the murderers of Jesus Christ, all died in the odor of
sanctity, with white, forgiven hands folded upon the breasts of peace,
while the destroyers of prejudice, the breakers of fetters, the creators
of light, died surrounded by the fierce fiends of God?Infidelity is Liberty

Infidelity is liberty; all religion is slavery.In every creed man is
the slave of God--woman is the slave of man and the sweet children are
the slaves of all.We do not want creeds; we want knowledge--we want
happiness.The World in Debt to Infidels

What would the world be if infidels had never been?Did all the priests of Rome increase the mental wealth of man as much
as Bruno?Did all the priests of France do as great a work for the
civilization of the world as Diderot and Voltaire?Did all the ministers
of Scotland add as much to the sum of human knowledge as David Hume?Have all the clergymen, monks, friars, ministers, priests, bishops,
cardinals, and popes, from the day of Pentecost to the last election,
done as much for human liberty as Thomas Paine?Infidels the Pioneers of Progress

The history of intellectual progress is written in the lives of
infidels.Political rights have been preserved by traitors--the liberty
of the mind by heretics.To attack the king was treason--to dispute the
priest was blasphemy.The throne and the altar were twins--vultures from the same
egg.It was James I. who said: "No bishop, no king."He might have said:
"No cross, no crown."The king owned the bodies, and the priest the
souls, of men.One lived on taxes, the other on alms.One was a robber,
the other a beggar.The king made laws, the priest made creeds.With bowed backs the people
received the burdens of the one, and, with wonder's open mouth, the
dogmas of the other.If any aspired to be free, they were slaughtered by
the king, and every priest was a Herod who slaughtered the children
of the brain.The king ruled by force, the priest by fear, and both by
both.The king said to the people: "God made you peasants, and He made
me king.He made rags and hovels for you, robes and palaces for me.And the priest said: "God made you ignorant and
vile.If you do not obey me, God will punish
you here and torment you hereafter.Infidels the Great Discoverers

Infidels are the intellectual discoverers.They sail the unknown seas,
and in the realms of thought they touch the shores of other worlds.An
infidel is the finder of a new fact--one who in the mental sky has seen
another star.He is an intellectual capitalist, and for that reason
excites the envy of theological paupers.The Altar of Reason

Virtue is a subordination, of the passions to the intellect.It is to
act in accordance with your highest convictions.It does not consist in
believing, but in doing.This is the sublime truth that the Infidels in
all ages have uttered.They have handed the torch from one to the other
through all the years that have fled.Upon the altar of reason they have
kept the sacred fire, and through the long midnight of faith they fed
the divine flame.GODS AND DEVILS




275.Every Nation has Created a God

Each nation has created a God, and the God has always resembled his
creators.He hated and loved what they hated and loved.Each God was
intensely patriotic, and detested all nations but his own.All these
gods demanded praise, flattery and worship.Most of them were pleased
with sacrifice, and the smell of innocent blood has ever been considered
a divine perfume.All these gods have insisted on having a vast number
of priests, and the priests have always insisted upon being supported
by the people; and the principle business of these priests has been
to boast that their God could easily vanquish all the other gods put
together.Gods with Back-Hair

Man, having always been the physical superior of woman, accounts for
the fact that most of the high gods have been males.Had women been the
physical superior; the powers supposed to be the rulers of Nature would
have been woman, and instead of being represented in the apparel of man,
they would have luxuriated in trains, low-necked dresses, laces and
back-hair.Creation the Decomposition of the Infinite

Admitting that a god did create the universe, the question then arises,
of what did he create it?Nothing,
considered in the light of a raw material, is a most decided failure.It
follows, then, that the god must have made the universe out of himself,
he being the only existence.The universe is material, and if it was
made of god, the god must have been material.With this very thought in
his mind, Anaximander of Miletus, said: "Creation is the decomposition
of the infinite."The Gods Are as the People Are

No god was ever in advance of the nation that created him.The <DW64>s
represented their deities with black skins and curly hair: The Mongolian
gave to his a yellow complexion and dark almond-shaped eyes.The Jews
were not allowed to paint theirs, or we should have seen Jehovah with
a full beard, an oval face, and an aquiline nose.Zeus was a perfect
Greek, and Jove looked as though a member of the Roman senate.The gods
of Egypt had the patient face and placid look of the loving people who
made them.The gods of northern countries were represented warmly clad
in robes of fur; those of the tropics were naked.The gods of India
were often mounted upon elephants; those of some islanders were great
swimmers, and the deities of the Arctic zone were passionately fond of
whale's blubber.Gods Shouldn't Make Mistakes

Generally the devotee has modeled them after himself, and has given them
hands, heads, feet, eyes, ears, and organs of speech.Each nation made
its gods and devils not only speak its language, but put in their mouths
the same mistakes in history, geography, astronomy, and in all matters
of fact, generally made by the people.Miracles

No one, in the world's whole history, ever attempted to substantiate a
truth by a miracle.Nothing but
falsehood ever attested itself by signs and wonders.No miracle ever was
performed, and no sane man ever thought he had performed one, and until
one is performed, there can be no evidence of the existence of any power
superior to, and independent of nature.Plenty of Gods on Hand

Man has never been at a loss for gods.He has worshipped almost
everything, including the vilest and most disgusting beasts.He has
worshipped fire, earth, air, water, light, stars, and for hundreds, of
ages prostrated himself before enormous snakes.Savage tribes often make
gods of articles they get from civilized people.The Todas worship
a cowbell.The Kodas worship two silver plates, which they regard as
husband and wife, and another tribe manufactured a god out of a king of
hearts.The Devil Difficulty

In the olden times the existence of devils was universally admitted.The
people had no doubt upon that subject, and from such belief it followed
as a matter of course, that a person, in order to vanquish these devils,
had either to be a god, or to be assisted by one.All founders of
religions have established their claims to divine origin by controlling
evil spirits, and suspending the laws of nature.Casting out devils was
a certificate of divinity.A prophet, unable to cope with the powers of
darkness, was regarded with contempt.The utterance of the highest and
noblest sentiments, the most blameless and holy life, commanded but
little respect, unless accompanied by power to work miracles and command
spirits.If he was God, of course
the devil knew that fact, and yet, according to this account, the devil
took the omnipotent God and placed him upon a pinnacle of the temple,
and endeavored to induce him, to dash himself against the earth.Failing
in that, he took the creator, owner and governor of the universe up into
an exceeding high mountain, and offered him this world--this grain of
sand--if he, the God of all the worlds, would fall down and worship
him, a poor devil, without even a tax title to one foot of dirt!Is it
possible the devil was such an idiot?Should any great credit be given
to this deity for not being caught with such chaff?The
devil--the prince of sharpers--the king of cunning--the master of
finesse, trying to bribe God with a grain of sand that belonged to God!Industrious Deities

Few nations have been so poor as to have but one god.Gods were made
so easily, and the raw material cost so little, that generally the god
market was fairly glutted, and heaven crammed with these phantoms.These
gods not only attended to the skies, but were supposed to interfere in
all the affairs of men.All was supposed to be under their
immediate control.Nothing was too small--nothing too large; the falling
of sparrows and the motions of the planets were alike attended to by
these industrious and observing deities.God in Idleness

If a god created the universe, then, there must have been a time when he
commenced to create.Back of that time there must have been an eternity,
during which there had existed nothing--absolutely nothing--except this
supposed god.According to this theory, this god spent an eternity, so
to speak, in an infinite vacuum, and in perfect idleness.Fancy a Devil Drowning a World

One of these gods, according to the account, drowned an entire world,
with the exception of eight persons.The old, the young, the beautiful
and the helpless were remorselessly devoured by the shoreless sea.This,
the most fearful tragedy that the imagination of ignorant priests ever
conceived, was the act, not of a devil, but of a god, so-called, whom
men ignorantly worship unto this day.What a stain such an act would
leave upon the character of a devil!Some Gods Very Particular About Little Things

From their starry thrones they frequently came to the earth for the
purpose of imparting information to man.It is related of one that he
came amid thunderings and lightnings in order to tell the people that
they should not cook a kid in its mother's milk.Some left their shining
abodes to tell women that they should, or should not, have children, to
inform a priest how to cut and wear his apron, and to give directions as
to the proper manner of cleaning the intestines of a bird.288 The Gods of To-day the Scorn of To-morrow

Nations, like individuals, have their periods of youth, of manhood and
decay.The same inexorable destiny awaits them
all.The gods created by the nations must perish with their creators.They were created by men, and like men, they must pass away.The deities
of one age are the by-words of the next.No Evidence of a God in Nature

The best minds, even in the religious world, admit that in the material
nature there is no evidence of what they are pleased to call a god.They find their evidence in the phenomena of intelligence, and very
innocently assert that intelligence is above, and in fact, opposed to
nature.They insist that man, at least, is a special creation; that
he has somewhere in his brain a divine spark, a little portion of the
"Great First Cause."They say that matter cannot produce thought; but
that thought can produce matter.They tell us that man has intelligence,
and therefore there must be an intelligence greater than his.Why not
say, God has intelligence, therefore there must be an intelligence
greater than his?So far as we know, there is no intelligence apart
from matter.We cannot conceive of thought, except as produced within a
brain.Great Variety in Gods

Gods have been manufactured after numberless models., and according to
the most grotesque fashions.Some have a thousand arms, some a hundred
heads, some are adorned with necklaces of living snakes, some are armed
with clubs, some with sword and shield, some with bucklers, and some
have wings as a cherub; some were invisible, some would show themselves
entire, and some would only show their backs; some were jealous, some
were foolish, some turned themselves into men, some into swans, some
into bulls, some into doves, and some into Holy-Ghosts, and made love
to the beautiful daughters of men: Some were married--all ought to have
been--and some were considered as old bachelors from all eternity.Some
had children, and the children were turned into gods and worshiped as
their fathers had been.Most of these gods were revengeful, savage,
lustful, and ignorant.As they generally depended upon their priests for
information, their ignorance can hardly excite our astonishment.God Grows Smaller

"But," says the religionist, "you cannot explain everything; and that
which you cannot explain, that which you do not comprehend, is my God."We are understanding more every day;
consequently your God is growing smaller every day.Give the Devil His Due

If the account given in Genesis is really true, ought we not, after all,
to thank this serpent?He was the first schoolmaster, the first advocate
of learning, the first enemy of ignorance, the first to whisper in human
ears the sacred word liberty, the creator of ambition, the author of
modesty, of inquiry, of doubt, of investigation, of progress and of
civilization.Casting out Devils

Even Christ, the supposed son of God, taught that persons were possessed
of evil spirits, and frequently, according to the account, gave proof of
his divine origin and mission by frightening droves of devils out of his
unfortunate countrymen.Casting out devils was his principal employment,
and the devils thus banished generally took occasion to acknowledge him
as the true Messiah; which was not only very kind of them, but quite
fortunate for him.On the Horns of a Dilemma

The history of religion is simply the story of man's efforts in all ages
to avoid one of two great powers, and to pacify the other.Both powers
have inspired little else than abject fear.The cold, calculating sneer
of the devil, and the frown of God, were equally terrible.In any event,
man's fate was to be arbitrarily fixed forever by an unknown power
superior to all law, and to all fact.The Devil and the Swine

How are you going to prove a miracle?How would you go to work to prove
that the devil entered into a drove of swine?Who saw it, and who would
know a devil if he did see him?Some tell me that it is the desire of God that I should worship Him?If he is in want and I can assist Him and will
not, I would be an ingrate and an infamous wretch.But I am satisfied
that I cannot by any possibility assist the infinite.I can help feed the hungry, clothe the naked, enlighten
ignorance.I can help at least, in some degree, toward covering this
world with a mantle of joy I may be wrong, but I do not believe that
there is any being in this universe who gives rain for praise, who gives
sunshine for prayer, or who blesses a man simply because he kneels.If the infinite "Father" allows a majority of his children to live in
ignorance and wretchedness now, what evidence is there that he will ever
improve their condition?Can the conduct
of infinite wisdom, power and love ever change?Is the infinite capable
of any improvement whatever?According to the theologians, God prepared this globe expressly for the
habitation of his loved children, and yet he filled the forests with
ferocious beasts; placed serpents in every path; stuffed the world
with earthquakes, and adorned its surface with mountains of flame.Notwithstanding all this, we are told that the world is perfect; that
it was created by a perfect being, and is therefore necessarily perfect.The next moment, these same persons will tell us that the world was
cursed; covered with brambles, thistles and thorns, and that man was
doomed to disease and death, simply because our poor, dear mother ate an
apple contrary to the command of an arbitrary God.The Devils better than the Gods

Our ancestors not only had their God-factories, but they made devils
as well.These devils were generally disgraced and fallen gods.These
devils generally sympathized with man.In nearly all the theologies,
mythologies and religions, the devils have been much more humane and
merciful than the gods.No devil ever gave one of his generals an order
to kill children and to rip open the bodies of pregnant women.Such
barbarities were always ordered by the good gods!The pestilences were
sent by the most merciful gods!The frightful famine, during which the
dying child with pallid lips sucked the withered bosom of a dead
mother, was sent by the loving gods.No devil was ever charged with such
fiendish brutality.Is it possible that an infinite God created this world simply to be the
dwelling-place of slaves and serfs?simply for the purpose of raising
orthodox Christians?That he did a few miracles to astonish them; that
all the evils of life are simply his punishments, and that he is finally
going to turn heaven into a kind of religious museum filled with Baptist
barnacles, petrified Presbyterians and Methodist mummies?I want no
heaven for which I must give my reason; no happiness in exchange for
my liberty, and no immortality that demands the surrender of my
individuality.Better rot in the windowless tomb, to which there is no
door but the red mouth of the pallid worm, than wear the jeweled collar
even of a god.It is impossible to conceive of a more thoroughly despicable, hateful,
and arrogant being, than the Jewish god.In the mythology of the world he has no parallel.He, only, is
never touched by agony and tears.He cares neither for love nor music,
beauty nor joy.A false friend, an unjust judge, a braggart, hypocrite,
and tyrant.Compared with Jehovah, Pharaoh was a benefactor, and the
tyranny of Egypt was freedom to those who suffered the liberty of God.HEAVEN AND HELL




302.Hope of a Future Life

For my part I know nothing of any other state of existence, either
before or after this, and I have never become personally acquainted with
anybody who did.There may be another life, and if there is the best
way to prepare for it is by making somebody happy in this.God certainly
cannot afford to put a man in hell who has made a little heaven in this
world.I would like to see how things come
out in this world when I am dead.There are some people I should like to
see again, but if there is no other life I shall never know it.I am Immortal

So far as I am concerned I am immortal; that is to say, I can't
recollect when I did not exist, and there never will be a time when I
will remember that I do not exist.I would like to have several millions
of dollars, and I may say I have a lively hope that some day I may be
rich; but to tell you the truth I have very little evidence of it.Our
hope of immortality does not come from any religions, but nearly all
religions come from that hope.The Old Testament, instead of telling
us that we are immortal, tells us how we lost immortality.You will
recollect that if Adam and Eve could have gotten to the tree of life,
they would have eaten of its fruit and would have lived forever; but for
the purpose of preventing immortality God turned them out of the Garden
of Eden, and put certain angels with swords or sabres at the gate to
keep them from getting back.The Old Testament proves, if it proves
anything, which I do not think it does, that there is no life after
this; and the New Testament is not very specific on the subject.There
were a great many opportunities for the Savior and his apostles to
tell us about another world, but they didn't improve them to any great
extent; and the only evidence so far as I know about another life is,
first, that we have no evidence; and, secondly, that we are rather sorry
that we have not, and wish we had.And suppose, after all, that death does end all.Next to eternal joy,
next to being forever with those we love and those who have loved us,
next to that is to be wrapped in the dreamless drapery of eternal peace.Upon the shadowy shore of death
the sea of trouble casts no wave.Eyes that have been curtained by the
everlasting dark will never know again the touch of tears.Lips that
have been touched by the eternal silence will never utter another word
of grief.And I had
rather think of those I have loved, and those I have lost, as having
returned to earth, as having become a part of the elemental wealth of
the the world.I would rather think of them as unconscious dust.I would
rather think of them as gurgling in the stream, floating in the cloud,
bursting into light upon the shores of worlds.I would rather think
of them thus than to have even a suspicion that their souls had been
clutched by an orthodox God.The Old World Ignorant of Destiny

Moses differed from most of the makers of sacred books by his failure
to say anything of a future life, by failing to promise heaven, and to
threaten hell.Upon the subject of a future state, there is not one
word in the Pentateuch.Probably at that early day God did not deem
it important to make a revelation as to the eternal destiny of man.He seems to have thought that he could control the Jews, at least, by
rewards and punishments in this world, and so he kept the frightful
realities of eternal joy and torment a profound secret from the people
of his choice.He thought it far more important to tell the Jews their
origin than to enlighten them as to their destiny.Where the Doctrine of Hell was born

I honestly believe that the doctrine of hell was born in the glittering
eyes of snakes that run in frightful coils watching for their prey.I
believe it was born in the yelping and howling and growling and snarling
of wild beasts.I believe it was born in the grin of hyenas and in the
malicious clatter of depraved apes.I despise it, I defy it, and I hate
it; and when the great ship freighted with the world goes down in
the night of death, chaos and disaster, I will not be guilty of the
ineffable meanness of pushing from my breast my wife and children and
paddling off in some orthodox canoe.I will go down with those I love
and with those who love me.I will go down with the ship and with my
race.Nothing can make me believe that there is any being that is going to
burn and torment and damn his children forever.The Grand Companionships of Hell

Since hanging has got to be a means of grace, I would prefer hell.I had
a thousand times rather associate with the pagan philosophers than with
the inquisitors of the middle ages.I certainly should prefer the worst
man in Greek or Roman history to John Calvin, and I can imagine no man
in the world that I would not rather sit on the same bench with than the
puritan fathers and the founders of orthodox churches.I would trade off
my harp any minute for a seat in the other country.All the poets will
be in perdition, and the greatest thinkers, and, I should think, most
of the women whose society would tend to increase the happiness of
man, nearly all the painters, nearly all the sculptors, nearly all
the writers of plays, nearly all the great actors, most of the best
musicians, and nearly all the good fellows--the persons who know good
stories, who can sing songs, or who will loan a friend a dollar.They will mostly all be in that country, and if I did not live there
permanently, I certainly would want it so I could spend my winter months
there.Let me put one case and I will be through with this branch of the
subject.The husband is a good
fellow and the wife a splendid woman.They live and love each other and
all at once he is taken sick, and they watch day after day and night
after night around his bedside until their property is wasted and
finally she has to go to work, and she works through eyes blinded with
tears, and the sentinel of love watches at the bedside of her prince,
and at the least breath or the least motion she is awake; and she
attends him night after night and day after day for years, and finally
he dies, and she has him in her arms and covers his wasted face with the
tears of agony and love.He dies, and
she buries him and puts flowers above his grave, and she goes there in
the twilight of evening and she takes her children, and tells her little
boys and girls through her tears how brave and how true and how tender
their father was, and finally she dies and goes to hell, because she was
not a believer; and he goes to the battlements of heaven and looks over
and sees the woman who loved him with all the wealth of her love, and
whose tears made his dead face holy and sacred, and he looks upon her
in the agonies of hell without having his happiness diminished in the
least.With all due respect to everybody I say, damn any such doctrine
as that.The Drama of Damnation

When you come to die, as you look back upon the record of your life, no
matter how many men you have wrecked and ruined, and no matter how many
women you have deceived and deserted--all that may be forgiven you;
but if you recollect that you have laughed at God's book you will see
through the shadows of death, the leering looks of fiends and the forked
tongues of devils.For instance, it
is the day of judgment.When the man is called up by the recording
secretary, or whoever does the cross-examining, he says to his soul:
"Where are you from?""Well, I don't like to talk about myself.""Well, I was a good fellow; I loved
my wife; I loved my children.My home was my heaven; my fireside was my
paradise, and to sit there and see the lights and shadows falling on the
faces of those I love, that to me was a perpetual joy.I never gave one
of them a solitary moment of pain.I don't owe a dollar in the world,
and I left enough to pay my funeral expenses and keep the wolf of want
from the door of the house I loved.That is the kind of a man I am."They were always expecting to be happy simply because somebody else was
to be damned.""Well, did you believe that rib story?"To tell you the
God's truth, that was a little more than I could swallow.""Yes, sir, and to the Young Men's Christian
Association.""Did you
ever run off with any of the money?""I don't like to tell, sir.""What kind of a bank did you have?""How much did you
run off with?""Did you take anything
else along with you?""Did you have a wife and children of your own?""Oh, yes; but such was my confidence in God that I
believed he would take care of them."I believed all of it, sir; I often used to be sorry that there were
not harder stories yet in the Bible, so that I could show what my faith
could do."Annihilation rather than be a God

No God has a right to make a man he intends to drown.Eternal wisdom has
no right to make a poor investment, no right to engage in a speculation
that will not finally pay a dividend.No God has a right to make
a failure, and surely a man who is to be damned forever is not a
conspicuous success.Yet upon love's breast, the Church has placed that
asp; around the child of immortality the Church has coiled the worm that
never dies.For my part I want no heaven, if there is to be a hell.I
would rather be annihilated than be a god and know that one human soul
would have to suffer eternal agony."All that have Red Hair shall be Damned."I admit that most Christians are honest--always have admitted it.I
admit that most ministers are honest, and that they are doing the best
they can in their way for the good of mankind; but their doctrines are
hurtful; they do harm in the world; and I am going to do what I can
against their doctrines.They preach this infamy: "He that believes
shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned."Every word
of that text has been an instrument of torture; every letter in that
text has been a sword thrust into the bleeding and quivering heart of
man; every letter has been a dungeon; every line has been a chain; and
that infamous sentence has covered this world with blood.I deny that
"whoso believes shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be
damned."No man can control his belief; you might as well say, "All that
have red hair shall be damned."The Conscience of a Hyena

But, after all, what I really want to do is to destroy the idea of
eternal punishment.That
doctrine fills hell with honest men, and heaven with intellectual and
moral paupers.That doctrine allows people to sin on a credit.That
doctrine allows the basest to be eternally happy and the most honorable
to suffer eternal pain.I think of all doctrines it is the most
infinitely infamous, and would disgrace the lowest savage, and any man
who believes it, and has imagination enough to understand it, has the
heart of a serpent and the conscience of a hyena.I Leave the Dead

But for me I leave the dead where nature leaves them, and whatever
flower of hope springs up in my heart I will cherish.But I cannot
believe that there is any being in this universe who has created a
soul for eternal pain, and I would rather that every God would destroy
himself, I would rather that we all should go back to the eternal chaos,
to the black and starless night, than that just one soul should suffer
eternal agony.Swedenborg did one thing for which I feel almost grateful.He gave an
account of having met John Calvin in hell.Nothing connected with the
supernatural could be more natural than this.The only thing detracting
from the value of this report is, that if there is a hell, we know
without visiting the place that John Calvin must be there.GOVERNING GREAT MEN




315.Jesus Christ

And let me say here once for all, that for the man Christ I have
infinite respect.Let me say once for all that the place where man has
died for man is holy ground.Let me say once for all, to that great and
serene man I gladly pay--I _gladly_ pay the tribute of my admiration and
my tears.He was an infidel in his
time.He was regarded as a blasphemer, and his life was destroyed by
hypocrites who have in all ages done what they could to trample freedom
out of the human mind.Had I lived at that time I would have been his
friend.And should he come again he will not find a better friend than
I will be.For the theological creation I have
a different feeling.If he was in fact God, he knew there was no such
thing as death; he knew that what we call death was but the eternal
opening of the golden gates of everlasting joy.And it took no heroism
to face a death that was simply eternal life.The Emperor Constantine, who lifted Christianity into power, murdered
his wife Fausta and his eldest son Crispus the same year that he
convened the council of Nice to decide whether Jesus Christ was a man or
the son of God.The council decided that Christ was substantial with
the Father.We are thus indebted to a wife
murderer for settling the vexed question of the divinity of the Savior.Theodosius called a council at Constantinople in 381, and this council
decided that the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father.Theodosius,
the younger, assembled another council at Ephesus to ascertain who the
Virgin Mary really was, and it was solemnly decided in the year 431 that
she was the mother of God.In 451 it was decided by a council held at
Chalcedon, called together by the Emperor Marcian, that Christ had two
natures--the human and divine.In 680, in another general council, held
at Constantinople, convened by order of Pognatius, it was also decided
that Christ had two wills, and in the year 1274 it was decided at the
council of Lyons that the Holy Ghost proceeded not only from the Father,
but from the Son as well.Had it not been for these councils we might
have been without a trinity even unto this day.When we take into
consideration the fact that a belief in the trinity is absolutely
essential to salvation, how unfortunate it was for the world that this
doctrine was not established until the year 1274.Think of the millions
that dropped into hell while these questions were being discussed.The church never has pretended that Jefferson or Franklin died in fear.Franklin wrote no books against the fables of the ancient Jews.He
thought it useless to cast the pearls of thought before the swine of
ignorance and fear.He was the father of a
great party.He gave his views in letters and to trusted friends.He
was a Virginian, author of the Declaration of Independence, founder of a
university, father of a political party, President of the United States,
a statesman and philosopher.He was too powerful for the churches of
his day.Paine was a foreigner, a citizen of the world.He had done these things openly, and what
he had said could not be answered.His arguments were so good that his
character was bad.The Emperor, stained with every crime, is supposed to have died like a
Christian.We hear nothing of fiends leering at him in the shadows of
death.He does not see the forms of his murdered wife and son covered
with the blood he shed.From his white and shriveled lips issued no
shrieks of terror.He does not cover his glazed eyes with thin and
trembling hands to shut out the visions of hell.His chamber is filled
with the rustle of wings waiting to bear his soul to the thrilling
realms of joy.Against the Emperor Constantine the church has hurled no
anathema.She has accepted the story of his vision in the clouds, and
his holy memory has been guarded by priest and pope.Diderot

Diderot was born in 1713.His parents were in what may be called the
humbler walks of life.Like Voltaire, he was educated by the Jesuits.He
had in him something of the vagabond, and was for several years almost a
beggar in Paris.He was endeavoring to live by his pen.In that day and
generation a man without a patron, endeavoring to live by literature,
was necessarily almost a beggar.He nearly starved--frequently going
for days without food.Afterward, when he had something himself, he was
generous as the air.No man ever was more willing to give, and no man
less willing to receive, than Diderot.His motto was, "Incredulity
is the first step toward philosophy."He had the vices of most
Christians--was nearly as immoral as the majority of priests.His vices
he shared in common--his virtues were his own--All who knew him united
in saying that he had the pity of a woman, the generosity of a prince,
the self-denial of an anchorite, the courage of Caesar, an insatiate
thirst foi knowledge, and the enthusiasm of a poet.He attacked with
every power of his mind the superstition of his day.He was in favor of universal
education--the church despised it.He wished to put the knowledge of
the whole world within reach of the poorest.He wished to drive from
the gate of the Garden of Eden the cherubim of superstition, so that
the child of Adam might return to eat once more the fruit of the tree
of knowledge.His poor little desk was
ransacked by the police, searching for manuscripts in which something
might be found that would justify the imprisonment of such a dangerous
man.Whoever, in 1750, wished to increase the knowledge of mankind was
regarded as the enemy of social order.Benedict Spinoza

One of the greatest thinkers of the world was Benedict Spinoza--a Jew,
born at Amsterdam in 1638.He asked the rabbis so many questions, and insisted to such a degree on
what he called reason, that his room was preferred to his company.His Jewish brethren excommunicated him from the synagogue.Under the
terrible curse of their religion he was made an outcast from every
Jewish home.His own father could not give him shelter, and his mother,
after the curse had been pronounced, could not give him bread, could not
even speak to him, without becoming an outcast herself.All the cruelty
of Jehovah was in this curse.Spinoza was but twenty-four years old
when he found himself without friends and without kindred.He earned his bread with willing hands, and cheerfully
divided his poor crust with those below.He tried to solve the problem
of existence.According to him the universe did not commence to
be.It is; from eternity it was; and to eternity it will be.He insisted
that God is inside, not outside, of what we call substance.Thomas Paine

Poverty was his mother--Necessity his master.He had more brains than
books; more sense than education; more courage than politeness;
more strength than polish.He had no veneration for old mistakes--no
admiration for ancient lies.He loved the truth for the truth's
sake, and for man's sake.He saw oppression on every hand; injustice
everywhere; hypocrisy at the altar, venality on the bench, tyranny on
the throne; and with a splendid courage he espoused the cause of the
weak against the strong--of the enslaved many against the titled few.The Greatest of all Political Writers

In my judgment, Thomas Paine was the best political writer that ever
lived."What he wrote was pure nature, and his soul and his pen ever
went together."Ceremony, pageantry, and all the paraphernalia of
power, had no effect upon him.He examined into the why and wherefore of
things.He was perfectly radical in his mode of thought.Nothing short
of the bed-rock satisfied him.His enthusiasm for what he believed to
be right knew no bounds.During all the dark scenes of the Revolution,
never for one moment did he despair.Year after year his brave words
were ringing through the land, and by the bivouac fires the weary
soldiers read the inspiring words of "Common Sense," filled with ideas
sharper than their swords, and consecrated themselves anew to the cause
of Freedom.The Writings of Paine

The writings of Paine are gemmed with compact statements that carry
conviction to the dullest.Day and night he labored for America, until
there was a government of the people and for the people.At the close
of the Revolution no one stood higher than Thomas Paine.Had he been
willing to live a hypocrite, he would have been respectable, he at least
could have died surrounded by other hypocrites, and at his death there
would have been an imposing funeral, with miles of carriages, filled
with hypocrites, and above his hypocritical dust there would have been a
hypocritical monument covered with lies.The truth is, he died as he had lived.Some ministers were impolite
enough to visit him against his will.Several of them he ordered
from his room.A couple of Catholic priests, in all the meekness of
hypocrisy, called that they might enjoy the agonies of a dying friend
of man.Thomas Paine, rising in his bed, the few embers of expiring life
blown into flame by the breath of indignation, had the goodness to curse
them both.His physician, who seems to have been a meddling fool, just
as the cold hand of death was touching the patriot's heart, whispered
in the dull ear of the dying man: "Do you believe, or do you wish to
believe, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?"And the reply was: "I
have no wish to believe on that subject."These were the last remembered
words of Thomas Paine.He died as serenely as ever Christian passed
away.He died in the full possession of his mind, and on the very brink
and edge of death proclaimed the doctrines of his life.Paine Believed in God

Thomas Paine was a champion in both hemispheres of human liberty; one of
the founders and fathers of the Republic; one of the foremost men of his
age.He never wrote a word in favor of injustice.He was a despiser of
slavery.He wast in the widest and
best sense, a friend of all his race.His head was as clear as his heart
was good, and he had the courage to speak his honest thought.He was
the first man to write these words: "The United States of America."He furnished every thought
that now glitters in the Declaration of Independence.He believed in one
God and no more.He was a believer even in special providence, and he
hoped for immortality.The Intellectual Hera

Thomas Paine was one of the intellectual heroes--one of the men to whom
we are indebted.His name is associated forever with the Great Republic.As long as free government exists he will be remembered, admired and
honored.He lived a long, laborious and useful life.The world is better
for his having lived.John went to the office.For the sake of truth he accepted hatred and
reproach for his portion.His friends
were untrue to him because he was true to himself, and true to them.He
lost the respect of what is called society, but kept his own.His life
is what the world calls failure and what history calls success.If to
love your fellow-men more than self is goodness, Thomas Paine was good.If to be in advance of your time--to be a pioneer in the direction of
right--is greatness.If to avow your principles and discharge your
duty in the presence of death is heroic, Thomas Paine was a hero.At the
age of seventy-three, death touched his tired heart.He died in the land
his genius defended--under the flag he gave to the skies.Slander cannot
touch him now--hatred cannot reach him more.He sleeps in the sanctuary
of the tomb, beneath the quiet of the stars.Paine, Franklin, Jefferson

In our country there were three infidels--Paine, Franklin and Jefferson.The colonies were full of superstition, the Puritans with the spirit
of persecution.Laws savage, ignorant, and malignant had been passed in
every colony for the purpose of destroying intellectual liberty.The toleration acts of
Maryland tolerated only Christians--not infidels, not thinkers, not
investigators.The charity of Roger Williams was not extended to those
who denied the Bible, or suspected the divinity of Christ.It was not
based upon the rights of man, but upon the rights of believers, who
differed in non-essential points.David Hume

On the 26th of April, 1711, David Hume was born.David Hume was one of
the few Scotchmen of his day who were not owned by the church.He had
the manliness to examine historical and religious questions for himself,
and the courage to give his conclusions to the world.He was singularly
capable of governing himself.He was a philosopher, and lived a calm
and cheerful life, unstained by an unjust act, free from all excess,
and devoted in a reasonable degree to benefiting his fellow-men.After
examining the Bible he became convinced that it was not true.For
failing to suppress his real opinion, for failing to tell a deliberate
falsehood, he brought upon him the hatred of the church.Voltaire

Voltaire was the intellectual autocrat of his time.From his throne at
the foot of the Alps he pointed the finger of scorn at every hypocrite
in Europe.He left the quiver of ridicule without an arrow.He was the
pioneer of his century.Through the
shadows of faith and fable, through the darkness of myth and miracle,
through the midnight of Christianity, through the blackness of bigotry,
past cathedral and dungeon, past rack and stake, past altar and throne,
he carried, with brave and chivalric hands, the torch of reason.John Calvin

Calvin was of a pallid, bloodless complexion, thin, sickly, irritable,
gloomy, impatient, egotistic, tyrannical, heartless, and infamous.He
was a strange compound of revengeful morality, malicious forgiveness,
ferocious charity, egotistic humility, and a kind of hellish justice.In other words, he was as near like the God of the Old Testament as his
health permitted.Calvin's Five Fetters

This man forged five fetters for the brain.That is to say, predestination, particular redemption, total
depravity, irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints.About
the neck of each follower he put a collar bristling with these five iron
points.The presence of all these points on the collar is still the test
of orthodoxy in the church he founded.This man, when in the flush of
youth, was elected to the office of preacher in Geneva.He at once,
in union with Farel, drew up a condensed statement of the Presbyterian
doctrine, and all the citizens of Geneva, on pain of banishment, were
compelled to take an oath that they believed this statement.Of this
proceeding Calvin very innocently remarked that it produced great
satisfaction.A man named Caroli had the audacity to dispute with
Calvin.Humboldt

Humboldt breathed the atmosphere of investigation.Old ideas were
abandoned; old creeds, hallowed by centuries, were thrown aside; thought
became courageous; the athlete, Reason, challenged to mortal combat the
monsters of superstition.Humbolt's Travels

Europe becoming too small for his genius, he visited the tropics.He
sailed along the gigantic Amazon--the mysterious Orinoco--traversed the
Pampas--climbed the Andes until he stood upon the crags of Chimborazo,
more than eighteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, and climbed
on until blood flowed from his eyes and lips.For nearly five years he
pursued his investigations in the new world, accompanied by the intrepid
Bonplandi.He was the best intellectual
organ of these new revelations of science.He was calm, reflective and
eloquent; filled with a sense of the beautiful, and the love of truth.His collections were immense, and valuable beyond calculation to every
science.He endured innumerable hardships, braved countless dangers in
unknown and savage lands, and exhausted his fortune for the advancement
of true learning.Humboldt's Illustrious Companions

Humboldt was the friend and companion of the greatest poets, historians,
philologists, artists, statesmen, critics, and logicians of his time.He was the companion of Schiller, who believed that man would be
regenerated through the influence of the Beautiful of Goethe, the grand
patriarch of German literature; of Weiland, who has been called
the Voltaire of Germany; of Herder, who wrote the outlines of a
philosophical history of man; of Kotzebue, who lived in the world of
romance; of Schleiermacher, the pantheist; of Schlegel, who gave to
his countrymen the enchanted realm of Shakespeare; of the sublime Kant,
author of the first work published in Germany on Pure Reason; of Fichte,
the infinite idealist; of Schopenhauer, the European Buddhist who
followed the great Gautama to the painless and dreamless Nirwana, and
of hundreds of others, whose names are familiar to and honored by the
scientific world.Humboldt the Apostle of Science

Upon his return to Europe he was hailed as the second Columbus; as the
scientific discover of America; as the revealer of a new world; as the
great demonstrator of the sublime truth, that the universe is governed
by law.I have seen a picture of the old man, sitting upon a mountain
side--above him the eternal snow--below, the smiling valley of the
tropics, filled with vine and palm; his chin upon his breast, his
eyes deep, thoughtful and calm his forehead majestic--grander than the
mountain upon which he sat--crowned with the snow of his whitened hair,
he looked the intellectual autocrat of this world.Not satisfied with
his discoveries in America, he crossed the steppes of Asia, the wastes
of

Siberia, the great Ural range adding to the knowledge of mankind at
every step.H is energy acknowledged no obstacle, his life knew no
leisure; every day was filled with labor and with thought.He was one
of the apostles of science, and he served his divine master with
a self-sacrificing zeal that knew no abatement; with an ardor that
constantly increased, and with a devotion unwavering and constant as the
polar star.Ingersoll Muses by Napoleon's Tomb

A little while ago I stood by the grave of the old Napoleon--a
magnificent tomb of gilt and gold, fit almost for a dead deity--and
gazed upon the sarcophagus of black Egyptian marble, where rest at last
the ashes of the restless man.I leaned over the balustrade and thought
about the career of the greatest soldier of the modern world.I saw him
walking upon the banks of the Seine, contemplating suicide--I saw him
at Toulon--I saw him putting down the mob in the streets of Paris--I saw
him at the head of the army of Italy--I saw him crossing the bridge of
Lodi with the tri-color in his hand--I saw him in Egypt in the shadows
of the pyramids--I saw him conquer the Alps and mingle the eagles of
France with the eagles of the crags.I saw him at Marengo--at Ulm and
Austerlitz.I saw him in Russia, where the infantry of the snow and the
cavalry of the wild blast scattered his legions like Winter's withered
leaves.I saw him at Leipsic in defeat and disaster--driven by a million
bayonets back upon Paris--clutched like a wild beast--banished to Elba.I saw him escape and retake an empire by the force of his genius.I saw
him upon the frightful field of Waterloo, where chance and fate combined
to wreck the fortunes of their former king.Helena,
with his hands crossed behind him, gazing out upon the sad and solemn
sea.I thought of the orphans and widows he had made--of the tears that
had been shed for his glory, and of the only woman who ever loved him,
pushed from his heart by the cold hand of ambition.And I said I would
rather have been a French peasant, and worn wooden shoes.I would rather
have lived in a hut with a vine growing over the door, and the grapes
growing purple in the kisses of the Autumn sun.I would rather have been
that poor peasant with my loving wife by my side, knitting as the day
died out of the sky--with my children upon my knees and their arms about
me; I would rather have been that man and gone down to the tongueless
silence of the dreamless dust, than to have been that imperial
impersonation of force and murder known as Napoleon the Great.And so I
would, ten thousand times.Eulogy on J. G. Blaine

This is a grand year--a year filled with recollections of the
Revolution; filled with the proud and tender memories of the past; with
the sacred legends of liberty; a year in which the sons of freedom will
drink from the fountains of enthusiasm; a year in which the people call
for a man who has preserved in Congress what our soldiers won upon
the field; a year in which they call for the man who has torn from the
throat of treason the tongue of slander--for the man who has snatched
the mask of Democracy from the hideous face of rebellion; for this man
who, like an intellectual athlete, has stood in the arena of debate and
challenged all comers, and who is still a total stranger to defeat.Like
an armed warrior, like a plumed knight, James G. Blaine marched down the
halls of the American Congress and threw his shining lance full and
fair against the brazen foreheads of the defamers of his country and the
maligners of her honor.For the Republican party to desert this gallant
leader now is as though an army should desert their General upon the
field of battle.James G. Blaine is now and has been for years the
bearer of the sacred standard of the Republican party.A Model Leader

The Republicans of the United States want a man who knows that this
Government should protect every citizen, at home and abroad; who knows
that any Government that will not defend its defenders and protect its
protectors is a disgrace to the map of the world.They demand a man who
believes in the eternal separation and divorcement of church and school.They demand a man whose political reputation is as spotless as a star;
but they do not demand that their candidate shall have a certificate of
moral character signed by a Confederate Congress.The man who has, in
full, heaped and rounded measure, all these splendid qualifications is
the present grand and gallant leader of the Republican party--James G.
Blaine.Our country, crowned with the vast and marvelous achievements
of its first century, asks for a man worthy of the past and prophetic
of her future; asks for a man who has the audacity of genius; asks for
a man who is the grandest combination of heart, conscience and brain
beneath her flag.Such a man is James G. Blaine.Abraham Lincoln

This world has not been fit to live in fifty years.There is no liberty
in it--very little.Why, it is only a few years ago that all the
Christian nations were engaged in the slave trade.It was not until 1808
that England abolished the slave trade, and up to that time her priests
in her churches and her judges on her benches owned stock in slave
ships, and luxuriated on the profits of piracy and murder; and when a
man stood up and denounced it they mobbed him as though he had been a
common burglar or a horse thief.It was not until the 28th
day of August, 1833, that England abolished slavery in her colonies; and
it was not until the 1st day of January, 1862, that Abraham Lincoln, by
direction of the entire North, wiped that infamy out of this country;
and I never speak of Abraham Lincoln but I want to say that he was, in
my judgment, in many respects the grandest man ever President of the
United States.I say that upon his tomb there ought to be this line--and
I know of no other man deserving it so well as he: "Here lies one who
having been clothed with almost absolute power never abused it except on
the side of mercy."Swedenborg

Swedenborg was a man of great intellect, of vast acquirements, and of
honest intentions; and I think it equally clear that upon one subject,
at least, his mind was touched, shattered and shaken.Misled by
analogies, imposed upon by the bishop, deceived by the woman, borne to
other worlds upon the wings of dreams, living in the twilight of reason
and the dawn of insanity, he regarded every fact as a patched and ragged
garment with a lining of the costliest silk, and insisted that the wrong
side, even of the silk, was far more beautiful than the right.Jeremy Bentham

The glory of Bentham is, that he gave the true basis of morals, and
furnished the statesmen with the star and compass of this sentence: "The
greatest happiness of the greatest number."Charles Fourier

Fourier sustained about the same relation to this world that Swedenborg
did to the other.There must be something wrong about the brain of one
who solemnly asserts that "the elephant, the ox and the diamond were
created by the Sun; the horse, the lily, and the ruby, by Saturn; the
cow, the jonquil and the topaz, by Jupiter; and the dog, the violet
and the opal stones by the earth itself."And yet, forgetting these
aberrations of the mind, this lunacy of a great and loving soul, for
one, that's in tender-est regard the memory of Charles Fourier, one of
the best and noblest of our race.Auguste Comte

There was in the brain of the great Frenchman--Auguste Comte--the dawn
of that happy day in which humanity will be the only religion, good the
only God, happiness the only object, restitution the only atonement,
mistake the only sin, and affection guided by intelligence, the only
savior of mankind.This dawn enriched his poverty, illuminated the
darkness of his life, peopled his loneliness with the happy millions yet
to be, and filled his eyes with proud and tender tears.When everything
connected with Napoleon, except his crimes, shall be forgotten, Auguste
Comte will be lovingly remembered as a benefactor of the human race.Herbert Spencer

Herbert Spencer relies upon evidence, upon demonstration, upon
experience; and occupies himself with one world at a time.He perceives
that there is a mental horizon that we cannot pierce, and that beyond
that is the unknown, possibly the unknowable.He endeavors to examine
only that which is capable of being examined, and considers the
theological method as not only useless, but hurtful.After all God is
but a guess, throned and established by arrogance and assertion.Turning his attention to those things that have in some way affected
the condition of mankind, Spencer leaves the unknowable to priests and
believers.Robert Collyer

I have the honor of a slight acquaintance with Robert Collyer.I have
read with pleasure some of his exquisite productions.He has a brain
full of the dawn, the head of a philosopher, the imagination of a poet
and the sincere heart of a child.Had such men as Robert Collyer and
John Stuart Mill been present at the burning of Servetus, they would
have extinguished the flames with their tears.Had the presbytery of
Chicago been there, they would have quietly turned their backs, solemnly
divided their coat tails, and warmed themselves.John Milton

England was filled with Puritan gloom and Episcopal ceremony.All
religious conceptions were of the grossest nature.The ideas of crazy
fanatics and extravagant poets were taken as sober facts.Milton had
clothed Christianity in the soiled and faded finery of the gods--had
added to the story of Christ the fables of Mythology, He gave to the
Protestant Church the most outrageously material ideas of the Deity.He turned all the angels into soldiers--made heaven a battlefield, put
Christ in uniform, and described God as a militia general.His works
were considered by the Protestants nearly as sacred as the Bible
itself, and the imagination of the people was thoroughly polluted by the
horrible imagery, the sublime absurdity of the blind Milton.Ernst Haeckel

Amongst the bravest, side by side with the greatest of the world in
Germany, the land of science--stands Ernst Haeckel, who may be said
not only to have demonstrated the theories of Darwin, but the monistic
conception of the world.He has endeavored--and I think with complete
success--to show that there is not, and never was, and never can be,
the creator of anything.Haeckel is one of the bitterest enemies of the
church, and is, therefore, one of the bravest friends of man.Professor Swing, a Dove amongst Vultures

Professor Swing was too good a man to stay in the Presbyterian Church.He was a rose amongst thistles; he was a dove amongst vultures; and they
hunted him out, and I am glad he came out.I have the greatest respect
for Professor Swing, but I want him to tell whether the 109th Psalm is
inspired.Queen Victoria and George Eliot

Compare George Eliot with Queen Victoria.The Queen is clad in garments
given her by blind fortune and unreasoning chance, while George Eliot
wears robes of glory woven in the loom of her own genius.The time is coming when men will be rated at their real
worth; when we shall care nothing for an officer if he does not fill his
place.Bough on Rabbi Bien

I will not answer Rabbi Bien, and I will tell you why.Because he has
taken himself outside of all the limits of a gentleman; because he has
taken upon himself to traduce American women in language the beastliest
I ever read; and any man who says that the American women are not just
as good women as any God can make, and pick his mind to-day, is an
unappreciative barbarian.I will let him alone because he denounced all
the men in this country, all the members of Congress, all the members
of the Senate, all the Judges on the bench, as thieves and robbers.I
pronounce him a vulgar falsifier, and let him alone.General Garfield

No man has been nominated for the office since I was born, by either
party, who had more brains and more heart than James A. Garfield.He
was a soldier, he is a statesman.In time of peace he preferred the
avocations of peace; when the bugle of war blew in his ears he withdrew
from his work and fought for the flag, and then he went back to the
avocation of peace.And I say to-day that a man who, in a time of
profound peace, makes up his mind that he would like to kill folks for
a living is no better, to say the least of it, than the man who loves
peace in the time of peace, and who, when his country is attacked,
rushes to the rescue of her flag."Wealthy in Integrity; In Brain a Millionaire."James A. Garfield is to-day a poor man, and you know that there is not
money enough in this magnificent street to buy the honor and manhood of
James A. Garfield.Money cannot make such a man, and I will swear to you
that money cannot buy him.James A. Garfield to-day wears the glorious
robe of honest poverty.He is a poor man; but I like to say it here in
Wall street; I like to say it surrounded by the millions of America; I
like to say it in the midst of banks, and bonds, and stocks; I love to
say it where gold is piled--that, although a poor man, he is rich in
honor, in integrity he is wealthy, and in brain he is a millionaire.Garfield a Certificate of the Splendor of the American Constitution

Garfield is a certificate of the splendor of our Government, that says
to every poor boy: "All the avenues of honor are open to you."He is a scholar; he is a statesman; he was a
soldier; he is a patriot; and above all he is a magnificent man, and if
every man in New York knew him as well as I do, Garfield would not lose
a hundred votes in this city.W. Hiram Thomas

The best thing that has come from the other side is from Dr.I
regard him as by far the grandest intellect in the Methodist Church.He
is intellectually a wide and tender man.I cannot conceive of an article
being written in a better spirit.He finds a little fault with me for
not being exactly fair.Thomas
the probability is I never should have laid myself liable to criticism.There is some human nature in me, and I find it exceedingly difficult
to preserve at all times perfect serenity.I have the greatest possible
respect for Dr.Thomas, and must heartily thank him for his perfect
fairness.MISCELLANEOUS




355.Heresy and Orthodoxy

It has always been the man ahead that has been called the heretic.Heresy is the last and best thought always!Heresy extends the
hospitality of the brain to a new idea; that is what the rotting says to
flax growing; that is what the dweller in the swamp says to the man on
the sun-lit hill; that is what the man in the darkness cries out to the
grand man upon whose forehead is shining the dawn of a grander day; that
is what the coffin says to the cradle.Orthodoxy is a kind of shroud,
and heresy is a banner--Orthodoxy is a fog and Heresy a star shining
forever upon the cradle of truth.I do not mean simply in religion, I
mean in everything and the idea I wish to impress upon you is that you
should keep your minds open to all the influences of nature, you should
keep your minds open to reason; hear what a man has to say, and do not
let the turtle-shell of bigotry grow above your brain.Give everybody a
chance and an opportunity; that is all.We used to worship the golden calf, and the worst you can say of us now,
is, we worship the gold of the calf, and even the calves are beginning
to see this distinction.We used to go down on our knees to every man
that held office, now he must fill it if he wishes any respect.We care
nothing for the rich, except what will they do with their money?How does he fill it?--that is the question.And there is rapidly growing
up in the world an aristocracy of heart and brain--the only aristocracy
that has a right to exist.Truth will Bear the Test

If a man has a diamond that has been examined by the lapidaries of the
world, and some ignorant stonecutter told him that it is nothing but
an ordinary rock, he laughs at him; but if it has not been examined
by lapidaries, and he is a little suspicious himself that it is not
genuine, it makes him mad.Any doctrine that will not bear investigation
is not a fit tenant for the mind of an honest man.Any man who is afraid
to have his doctrine investigated is not only a coward but a hypocrite.Paring Nails

Why should we in this age of the world be dominated by the dead?Why
should barbarian Jews who went down to death and dust three thousand
years ago, control the living world?Why should we care for the
superstition of men who began the sabbath by paring their nails,
"beginning at the fourth finger, then going to the second, then to the
fifth, then to the third, and ending with the thumb?"How pleasing to
God this must have been.There may be a God

There may be for aught I know, somewhere in the unknown shoreless vast,
some being whose dreams are constellations and within whose thought the
infinite exists.About this being, if such an one exists, I have nothing
to say.He has written no books, inspired no barbarians, required no
worship, and has prepared no hell in which to burn the honest seeker
after truth.The People are Beginning to Think

The people are beginning to think, to reason and to investigate.Slowly,
painfully, but surely, the gods are being driven from the earth.Only
upon rare occasions are they, even by the most religious, supposed to
interfere in the affairs of men.In most matters we are at last supposed
to be free.Since the invention of steamships and railways, so that the
products of all countries can be easily interchanged, the gods have quit
the business of producing famine.Unchained Thought

For the vagaries of the clouds the infidels propose to substitute the
realities of earth; for superstition, the splendid demonstrations and
achievements of science; and for theological tyranny, the chainless
liberty of thought.Man the Victor of the Future

If abuses are destroyed, man must destroy them.If slaves are freed, man
must free them.If new truths are discovered, man must discover them.If the naked are clothed; if the hungry are fed; if justice is done;
if labor is rewarded; if superstition is driven from the mind; if the
defenseless are protected, and if the right finally triumphs, all must
be the work of man.The grand victories of the future must be won by
man, and by man alone.The Sacred Sabbath

Of all the superstitious of mankind, this insanity about the "sacred
Sabbath" is the most absurd.The idea of feeling it a duty to be solemn
and sad one-seventh of the time!To think that we can please an infinite
being by staying in some dark and sombre room, instead of walking in the
perfumed fields!Why should God hate to see a man happy?Why should it
excite his wrath to see a family in the woods, by some babbling stream,
talking, laughing and loving?Nature works on that "sacred" day.The
earth turns, the rivers run, the trees grow, buds burst into flower, and
birds fill the air with song.Why should we look sad, and think about
death, and hear about-hell?Why should that day be filled with gloom
instead of joy?Make the Sabbath Merry

Freethinkers should make the Sabbath a day of mirth and music; a day to
spend with wife and child--a day of games, and books, and dreams--a day
to put fresh flowers above our sleeping dead--a day of memory and hope,
of love and rest.Away to the Hills and the Sea

A poor mechanic, working all the week in dust and noise, needs a day of
rest and joy, a day to visit stream and wood--a day to live with wife
and child; a day in which to laugh at care, and gather hope and strength
for toils to come.And his weary wife needs a breath of sunny air, away
from street and wall, amid the hills or by the margin of the sea, where
she can sit and prattle with her babe, and fill with happy dreams the
long, glad day.Melancholy Sundays

When I was a little fellow most everybody thought that some days were
too sacred for the young ones to enjoy themselves in.Sunday used to commence Saturday night at sundown, under
the old text, "The evening and the morning were the first day."They
commenced then, I think, to get a good ready.When the sun went down
Saturday night, darkness ten thousand times deeper than ordinary night
fell upon that house.The boy that looked the sickest was regarded as
the most pious.You could not crack hickory nuts that night, and if you
were caught chewing gum it was another evidence of the total depravity
of the human heart.We would sometimes
sing, "Another day has passed."Everybody looked as though they had the
dyspesia--you know lots of people think they are pious, just because
they are bilious, as Mr.It was a solemn night, and the next
morning the solemnity had increased.Then we went to church, and the
minister was in a pulpit about twenty feet high.If it was in the winter
there was no fire; it was not thought proper to be comfortable while you
were thanking the Lord.The minister commenced at firstly and ran up to
about twenty-fourthly, and then he divided it up again; and then he
made some concluding remarks, and then he said lastly, and when he said
lastly he was about half through.Moses took Egyptian Law for his Model

It has been contended for many years that the ten commandments are the
foundation of all ideas of justice and of law.Eminent jurists have
bowed to popular prejudice, and deformed their works by statements to
the effect that the Mosaic laws are the fountains from which sprang all
ideas of right and wrong.Nothing can be more stupidly false than such
assertions.Thousands of years before Moses was born, the Egyptians
had a code of laws.They had laws against blasphemy, murder, adultery,
larceny, perjury, laws for the collection of debts, and the enforcement
of contracts.A False Standard of Success

It is not necessary to be rich, nor powerful, nor great, to be a
success; and neither is it necessary to have your name between the
putrid lips of rumor to be great.We have had a false standard of
success.In the years when I was a little boy we read in our books that
no fellow was a success that did not make a fortune or get a big office,
and he generally was a man that slept about three hours a night.They
never put down in the books the gentlemen who succeeded in life and yet
slept all they wanted to.Toilers and Idlers

You can divide mankind into two classes: the laborers and the idlers,
the supporters and the supported, the honest and the dishonest.Every
man is dishonest who lives upon the unpaid labor of others, no matter
if he occupies a throne.The laborers
should have equal-rights before the world and before the law.And I want
every farmer to consider every man who labors either with hand or brain
as his brother.Until genius and labor formed a partnership there was
no such thing as prosperity among men.Every reaper and mower, every
agricultural implement, has elevated the work of the farmer, and his
vocation grows grander with every invention.In the olden time the
agriculturist was ignorant; he knew nothing of machinery, he was the
slave of superstition.The Sad Wilderness History

While reading the Pentateuch, I am filled with indignation, pity and
horror.Nothing can be sadder than the history of the starved and
frightened wretches who wandered over the desolate crags and sands of
wilderness and desert, the prey of famine, sword and plague.Ignorant
and superstitious to the last degree, governed by falsehood, plundered
by hypocrisy, they were the sport of priests, and the food of fear.God
was their greatest enemy, and death their only friend.Law Much Older than Sinai

Laws spring from the instinct of self-preservation.Industry objected
to supporting idleness, and laws were made against theft.Laws were made
against murder, because a very large majority of the people have always
objected to being murdered.All fundamental laws were born simply of the
instinct of self-defence.Long before the Jewish savages assembled at
the foot of Sinai, laws had been made and enforced, not only in Egypt
and India, but by every tribe that ever existed.God raised the black flag, and
commanded his soldiers to kill even the smiling infant in its mother's
arms.Who is the blasphemer; the man who denies the existence of God, or
he who covers the robes of the infinite with innocent blood?Standing Tip for God

We are told in the Pentateuch that God, the father of us all, gave
thousands of maidens, after having killed their fathers, their mothers,
and their brothers, to satisfy the brutal lusts of savage men.If there
be a God, I pray him to write in his book, opposite my name, that I
denied this lie for him.Matter and Force

The statement in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, I
cannot accept.It is contrary to my reason, and I cannot believe it.It
appears reasonable for me that force has existed from eternity.Force
cannot, as it appears to me, exist apart from matter.Force, in its
nature, is forever active, and without matter it could not act; and so
I think matter must have existed forever.To conceive of matter without
force, or of force without matter, or of a time when neither existed,
or of a being who existed for an eternity without either, and who out of
nothing created both, is to me utterly impossible.It may be that I am led to these conclusions by "total depravity," or
that I lack the necessary humility of spirit to satisfactorily harmonize
Haeckel and Moses; or that I am carried away by pride, blinded by
reason, given over to hardness of heart that I might be damned, but I
never can believe that the earth was covered with leaves, and buds, and
flowers, and fruits, before the sun with glittering spear had driven
back the hosts of night.We are told that God made man; and the question naturally arises, how
was this done?Was it by a process of "evolution," "development;" the
"transmission of acquired habits;" the "survival of the fittest," or was
the necessary amount of clay kneaded to the proper consistency, and then
by the hands of God moulded into form?Modern science tells that man has
been evolved, through countless epochs, from the lower forms; that he
is the result of almost an infinite number of actions, reactions,
experiences, states, forms, wants and adaptations.General Joshua

My own opinion is that General Joshua knew no more about the motions of
the earth than he did mercy and justice.If he had known that the earth
turned upon its axis at the rate of a thousand miles an hour, and swept
in its course about the sun at the rate of sixty-eight thousand miles
an hour, he would have doubled the hailstones, spoken of in the same
chapter, that the Lord cast down from heaven, and allowed the sun and
moon to rise and set in the usual way.This getting up so early in the morning is a relic of barbarism.It has
made hundreds of thousands of young men curse business.There is no need
of getting up at three or four o'clock in the winter morning.The farmer
who persists in dragging his wife and children from their beds ought to
be visited by a missionary.It is time enough to rise after the sun has
set the example.Why
not feed them more the night before?In the old
times they used to get up about three o'clock in the morning, and go to
work long before the sun had risen with "healing upon his wings," and as
a just punishment they all had the ague; and they ought to have it now.Sleep is the best medicine
in the world.There is no such thing as health, without plenty of sleep.When you work, work;
and when you get through take a good, long and refreshing sleep.Never Rise at Four O'Clock

The man who cannot get a living upon Illinois soil without rising before
daylight ought to starve.Eight hours a day is enough for any farmer to
work except in harvest time.When you rise at four and work till dark
what is life worth?Of what use are all the improvements in farming?Of what use is all the improved machinery unless it tends to give the
farmer a little more leisure?What is harvesting now, compared with what
it was in the old time?Think of the days of reaping, of cradling, of
raking and binding and mowing.Think of threshing with the flail and
winnowing with the wind.And now think of the reapers and mowers, the
binders and threshing machines, the plows and cultivators, upon which
the farmer rides protected from the sun.If, with all these advantages,
you cannot get a living without rising in the middle of the night, go
into some other business.The Hermit is Mad

A hermit is a mad man.Without friends and wife and child, there is
nothing left worth living for.They
are filled with egotism and envy, with vanity and hatred.People who
live much alone become narrow and suspicious.They are apt to be the
property of one idea.They begin to think there is no use in anything.They look upon the happiness of others as a kind of folly.They hate
joyous folks, because, way down in their hearts, they envy them.Duke Orang-Outang

I think we came from the lower animals.I am not dead sure of it, but
think so.When I first read about it I didn't like it.My heart was
filled with sympathy for those people who leave nothing to be proud of
except ancestors.I thought how terrible this will be upon the nobility
of the old world.Think of their being forced to trace their ancestry
back to the Duke Orang-Outang or to the Princess Chimpanzee.After
thinking it all over I came to the conclusion that I liked that
doctrine.I read about
rudimentary bones and muscles.I was told that everybody had rudimentary
muscles extending from the ear into the cheek.I was told: "They are the remains of muscles; they became rudimentary
from the lack of use."They are the muscles
with which your ancestors used to flap their ears.Well, at first I was
greatly astonished, and afterward I was more astonished to find they had
become rudimentary.Self-Made Men

It is often said of this or that man that he is a self-made man--that
he was born of the poorest and humblest parents, and that with every
obstacle to overcome he became great.Most of the intellectual giants of the world
have been nursed at the sad but loving breast of poverty.Most of those
who have climbed highest on the shining ladder of fame commenced at the
lowest round.They were reared in the straw thatched cottages of Europe;
in the log houses of America; in the factories of the great cities; in
the midst of toil; in the smoke and din of labor.The One Window in the Ark

A cubit is twenty-two inches; so that the ark was five hundred and fifty
feet long, ninety-one feet and eight inches wide, and fifty-five feet
high.The ark was divided into three stories, and had on top, one window
twenty-two inches square.Ventillation must have been one of Jehovah's
hobbies.Think of a ship larger than the Great Eastern with only one
window, and that but twenty-two inches square!No Ante-Diluvian Camp-Meetings!It is a little curious that when God wished to reform the ante-diluvian
world he said nothing about hell; that he had no revivals, no
camp-meetings, no tracts, no out-pourings of the Holy Ghost, no
baptisms, no noon prayer meetings, and never mentioned the great
doctrine of salvation by faith.If the orthodox creeds of the world are
true, all those people went to hell without ever having heard that such
a place existed.If eternal torment is a fact, surely these miserable
wretches ought to have been warned.They were threatened only with water
when they were in fact doomed to eternal fire!Hard Work in the Ark

Eight persons did all the work.They attended to the wants of 175,000
birds, 3,616 beasts, 1,300 reptiles, and 2,000,000 insects, saying
nothing of countless animalculae.Can we believe that the inspired writer had any idea of the size of the
sun?Draw a circle five inches in diameter, and by its side thrust a pin
through the paper.The hole made by the pin will sustain about the same
relation to the circle that the earth does to the sun.Did he know that
the sun was eight hundred and sixty thousand miles in diameter; that it
was enveloped in an ocean of fire thousands of miles in depth, hotter
even than the Christian's hell?Did he know that the volume of the Earth
is less than one-millionth of that of the sun?Did he know of the one
hundred and four planets belonging to our solar system, all children of
the sun?Did he know of Jupiter eighty-five thousand miles in diameter,
hundreds of times as large as our earth, turning on his axis at the rate
of twenty-five thousand miles an hour accompanied by four moons making
the tour of his orbit once only in fifty years?Something for Nothing

It is impossible for me to conceive of something being created for
nothing.Nothing, regarded in the light of raw material, is a decided
failure.Neither is it
possible to think of force disconnected with matter.You cannot imagine
matter going back to absolute nothing.Neither can you imagine nothing
being changed into something.You may be eternally damned if you do not
say that you can conceive these things, but you cannot conceive them.Polygamy

Polygamy is just as pure in Utah as it could have been in the promised
land.Love and virtue are the same the whole world around, and justice
is the same in every star.All the languages of the world are not
sufficient to express the filth of polygamy.It makes of man a beast,
of woman a trembling slave.It destroys the fireside, makes virtue an
outcast, takes from human speech its sweetest words, and leaves the
heart a den, where crawl and hiss the slimy serpents of most loathsome
lust.The good family is the unit
of good government.The virtues grow about the holy hearth of home--they
cluster, bloom, and shed their perfume round the fireside where the
one man loves the one woman.Lover--husband--wife--mother--father--child--home!--without these sacred
words the world is but a lair, and men and women merely beasts.The Colonel in the Kitchen--How to Cook a Beefsteak

There ought to be a law making it a crime, punishable by imprisonment,
to fry a beefsteak.Broil it; it is just as easy, and when broiled it
is delicious.Fried beefsteak is not fit for a wild beast.You can broil
even on a stove.Shut the front damper--open the back one, and then take
off a griddle.There will then be a draft down through this opening.Put
on your steak, using a wire broiler, and not a particle of smoke will
touch it, for the reason that the smoke goes down.If you try to broil
it with the front damper open the smoke will rise.For broiling, coal,
even soft coal, makes a better fire than wood.Do not huddle together in a little room
around a red-hot stove, with every window fastened down.Do not live in
this poisoned atmosphere, and then, when one of your children dies, put
a piece in the papers commencing with, "Whereas, it has pleased divine
Providence to remove from our midst--."Have plenty of air, and plenty
of warmth.Do not imagine anything is unhealthy
simply because it is pleasant.Cooking a Fine Art

Cooking is one of the fine arts.Give your wives and daughters things to
cook, and things to cook with, and they will soon become most excellent
cooks.The man whose arteries
and veins are filled with rich blood made of good and well cooked food,
has pluck, courage, endurance and noble impulses.Remember that your
wife should have things to cook with.Scathing Impeachment of Intemperance

Intemperance cuts down youth in its vigor, manhood in its strength, and
age in its weakness.It breaks the father's heart, bereaves the doting
mother, extinguishes natural affections, erases conjugal loves, blots
out filial attachments, blights parental hope, and brings down mourning
age in sorrow to the grave.It produces weakness, not strength;
sickness, not health; death, not life.It makes wives widows; children
orphans; fathers fiends, and all of them paupers and beggars.It feeds
rheumatism, nurses gout, welcomes epidemics, invites cholera, imports
pestilence and embraces consumption.It covers the land with idleness,
misery and crime.It fills your jails, supplies your almshouses and
demands your asylums.It engenders controversies, fosters quarrels, and
cherishes riots.It crowds your penitentiaries and furnishes victims to
your scaffolds.It is the life blood of the gambler, the element of
the burglar, the prop of the highwayman and the support of the midnight
incendiary.It countenances the liar, respects the thief, esteems
the blasphemer.It violates obligations, reverences fraud, and honors
infamy.It defames benevolence, hates love, scorns virtue and slanders
innocence.It incites the father to butcher his helpless offspring,
helps the husband to massacre his wife, and the child to grind the
parricidal ax.It burns up men, consumes women, detests life, curses God,
and despises heaven.It suborns witnesses, nurses perjury, defiles
the jury box, and stains the judicial ermine.It degrades the citizen,
debases the legislator, dishonors statesmen, and disarms the patriot.It
brings shame, not honor; terror, not safety; despair, not hope; misery,
not happiness; and with the malevolence of a fiend, it calmly surveys
its frightful desolation, and unsatisfied with its havoc, it poisons
felicity, kills peace, ruins morals, blights confidence, slays
reputation, and wipes out national honors, then curses the world and
laughs at its ruin.Liberty Defined

The French convention gave the best definition of liberty I have ever
read: "The liberty of one citizen ceases only where the liberty of
another citizen commences."I ask you
to-day to make a declaration of individual independence.And if you are
independent, be just.Allow everybody else to make his declaration of
individual independence.Allow your wife, allow your husband, allow
your children to make theirs.It is a grand thing to be the owner of
yourself.It is a grand thing to protect the rights of others.It is a
sublime thing to be free and just.Free, Honest Thought

I am going to say what little I can to make the American people brave
enough and generous enough and kind enough to give everybody else the
rights they have themselves.Can there ever be any progress in this
world to amount to anything until we have liberty?The thoughts of a man
who is not free are not worth much--not much.A man who thinks with the
club of a creed above his head--a man who thinks casting his eye askance
at the flames of hell, is not apt to have very good thoughts.And for
my part, I would not care to have any status or social position even in
heaven if I had to admit that I never would have been there only I got
scared.When we are frightened we do not think very well.If you want to
get at the honest thoughts of a man he must free.If he is not free you
will not get his honest thought.Ingersoll Prefers Shoemakers to Princes

The other day there came shoemakers, potters, workers in wood and iron,
from Europe, and they were received in the city of New York as though
they had been princes.They had been sent by the great republic of
France to examine into the arts and manufactures of the great republic
of America.They looked a thousand times better to me than the Edward
Alberts and Albert Edwards--the royal vermin, that live on the body
politic.And I would think much more of our government if it would fete
and feast them, instead of wining and dining the imbeciles of a royal
line.I never saw a dignified man that was not after all an
old idiot Dignity is a mask; a dignified man is afraid that you will
know he does not know everything.A man of sense and argument is always
willing to admit what he don't know--why?--because there is so much
that he does know; and that is the first step towards learning
anything--willingness to admit what you don't know, and when you don't
understand a thing, ask--no matter how small and silly it may look to
other people--ask, and after that you know.A man never is in a state of
mind that he can learn until he gets that dignified nonsense out of him.The time is coming when a man will be rated at his real worth, and that
by his brain and heart.We care nothing now about an officer unless he
fills his place.The time will come when no matter how much money a man
has he will not be respected unless he is using it for the benefit of
his fellow-men.Three millions have increased to fifty--thirteen
States to thirty-eight.We have better homes, and more of the
conveniences of life than any other people upon the face of the globe.The farmers of our country live better than did the kings and princes
two hundred years ago--and they have twice as much sense and heart.Remember that the man who acts best his part--who loves
his friends the best--is most willing to help others--truest to the
obligation--who has the best heart--the most feeling--the deepest
sympathies--and who freely gives to others the rights that he claims for
himself, is the true nobleman.We have disfranchised the aristocrats of
the air and have given one country to mankind.Wanted!--More Manliness

I had a thousand times rather have a farm and be independent, than to be
President of the United States, without independence, filled with
doubt and trembling, feeling of the popular pulse, resorting to art and
artifice, inquiring about the wind of opinion, and succeeding at last in
losing my self-respect without gaining the respect of others.Man needs
more manliness, more real independence.This we can do by labor, and in this way we can preserve our
independence.We should try and choose that business or profession the
pursuit of which will give us the most happiness.We can be happy without being rich--without holding office--without
being famous.I am not sure that we can be happy with wealth, with
office, or with fame.Education of Nature

It has been a favorite idea with me that our forefathers were educated
by nature; that they grew grand as the continent upon which they landed;
that the great rivers--the wide plains--the splendid lakes--the lonely
forests--the sublime mountains--that all these things stole into and
became a part of their being, and they grew great as the country in
which they lived.They began to hate the narrow, contracted views of
Europe.The Worker Wearing the Purple

I want to see a workingman have a good house, painted white, grass in
the front yard, carpets on the floor and pictures on the wall.I want to
see him a man feeling that he is a king by the divine right of living in
the Republic.And every man here is just a little bit a king, you know.Every man here is a part of the sovereign power.Every man wears a
little of purple; every man has a little of crown and a little of
sceptre; and every man that will sell his vote for money or be ruled by
prejudice is unfit to be an American citizen.Flowers

Beautify your grounds with plants and flowers and vines.Remember that everything of beauty tends to the elevation of
man.Every little morning-glory whose purple bosom is thrilled with the
amorous kisses of the sun tends to put a blossom in your heart.Do not
judge of the value of everything by the market reports.Every flower
about a house certifies to the refinement of somebody.Every vine,
climbing and blossoming, tells of love and joy.The grave is not a throne, and a corpse is not a king.The living have
a right to control this world.I think a good deal more of to day than
I do of yesterday, and I think more of to-morrow than I do of this day;
because it is nearly gone--that is the way I feel.The time to be happy
is now; the way to be happy is to make somebody else happy and the place
to be happy is here.The School House a Fort

Education is the most radical thing in the world.To teach the alphabet is to inaugurate a revolution.To build a school
house is to construct a fort.We are Getting Free

We are getting free.We are
investigating with the microscope and the telescope.We are digging
into the earth and finding souvenirs of all the ages.We are finding out
something about the laws of health and disease.We are adding years to
the span of human life and we are making the world fit to live in.That is what we are doing, and every man that has an honest thought and
expresses it helps, and every man that tries to keep honest thought from
being expressed is an obstruction and a hindrance.The Solid Rock

I have made up my mind that if there is a God He will be merciful to the
merciful.That He will forgive the forgiving;
upon that rock I stand.That every man should be true to himself, and
that there is no world, no star, in which honesty is a crime; and upon
that rock I stand.An honest man, a good, kind, sweet woman, or a happy
child, has nothing to fear, neither in this world nor the world to come;
and upon that rock I stand.INGERSOLL'S FIVE GOSPELS




408.The Gospel of Cheerfulness

I believe in the gospel of cheerfulness; the gospel of good nature; in
the gospel of good health.Let us pay some attention to our bodies; take
care of our bodies, and our souls will take care of themselves.I believe the time will come when the public thought will be so
great and grand that it will be looked upon as infamous to perpetuate
disease.I believe the time will come when men will not fill the future
with consumption and with insanity.I believe the time will come when
with studying ourselves and understanding the laws of health, we will
say we are under obligations to put the flags of health in the cheeks of
our children.Even if I got to Heaven, and had a harp, I would hate to
look back upon my children and see them diseased, deformed, crazed, all
suffering the penalty of crimes that I had committed.The Gospel of Liberty

And I believe, too, in the gospel of liberty,---of giving to others what
we claim.And I believe there is room everywhere for thought, and
the more liberty you give away the more you will have.In liberty
extravagance is economy.Let us be just, let us be generous to each
other.The Gospel of 'Good Living

I believe in the gospel of good living.You cannot make any God happy by
fasting.Let us have good food, and let us have it well cooked; it is
a thousand times better to know how to cook it than it is to understand
any theology in the world.I
believe in the gospel of good houses; in the gospel of water and soap.The Gospel of Intelligence

I believe in the gospel of intelligence.That is the only lever capable
of raising mankind.I believe in the gospel of intelligence; in the
gospel of education.The school-house is my cathedral; the universe
is my Bible.And no God can put a man into hell in another world who has
made a little heaven in this.God cannot make miserable a man who has
made somebody else happy.God can not hate anybody who is capable of
loving his neighbor.So I believe in this great gospel of generosity.Ah, but they say it won't do.My gospel
of health will prolong life; my gospel of intelligence, my gospel of
loving, my gospel of good-fellowship will cover the world with happy
homes.My doctrine will put carpets upon your floors, pictures upon your
walls.My doctrine will put books upon your shelves, ideas in your mind.My doctrine will relieve the world of the abnormal monsters born of the
ignorance of superstition.My doctrine will give us health, wealth, and
happiness.The Gospel of Justice

I believe in the gospel of justice,--that we must reap what we sow.Smith, and God forgive me,
how does that help Smith?If I by slander cover some poor girl with
the leprosy of some imputed crime, and she withers away like a blighted
flower, and afterwards I get forgiveness, how does that help her?If
there is another world, we have got to settle; no bankruptcy court
there.Among the ancient Jews if you committed a crime you
had to kill a sheep; now they say, "Charge it.For every crime you commit you must answer to yourself and
to the one you injure.And if you have ever clothed another with
unhappiness as with a garment cf pain, you will never be quite as
happy as though you hadn't done that thing.No forgiveness, eternal,
inexorable, everlasting justice--that is what I believe in.And if it goes hard with me, I will stand it.And I will stick to my
logic, and I will bear it like a man.GEMS FROM THE CONTROVERSIAL GASKET

     Latest Utterances of Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll,
     in a Controversy with Judge Jere 8.Black,
     on "The Christian Religion"




413.The Origin of the Controversy

Several months ago, _The North American Review_ asked me to write an
article, saying that it would be published if some one would furnish a
reply.I wrote the article that appeared in the August number, and by
me it was entitled "Is All of the Bible Inspired?"Not until the
article was written did I know who was expected to answer.I make this
explanation for the purpose of dissipating the impression that Mr.To have struck his shield with my lance might
have given birth to the impression that I was somewhat doubtful as to
the correctness of my position.I naturally expected an answer from some
professional theologian, and was surprised to find that a reply had been
written by a "policeman," who imagined that he had answered my arguments
by simply telling me that my statements were false.It is somewhat
unfortunate that in a discussion like this any one should resort to the
slightest personal detraction.The theme is great enough to engage the
highest faculties of the human mind, and in the investigation of such a
subject vituperation is singularly and vulgarly out of place.Arguments
cannot be answered with insults.It is unfortunate that the intellectual
arena should be entered by a "policeman," who has more confidence in
concussion than discussion.Good nature is often
mistaken for virtue, and good health sometimes passes for genius.Anger blows out the lamp of the mind.In the examination of a great and
important question, every one should be serene, slow-pulsed, and calm.Black's reply, feeling that so
grand a subject should not be blown and tainted with malicious words, I
proceed to answer as best I may the arguments he has urged.Of course it is still claimed that we are a Christian people, indebted
to something we call Christianity, for all the progress we have made.There is still a vast difference of opinion as to what Christianity
really is, although many wavering sects have been discussing that
question, with fire and sword through centuries of creed and crime.Every new sect has been denounced at its birth as illegitimate, as
something born out of orthodox wedlock, and that should have been
allowed to perish on the steps where it was found.Summary of Evangelical Belief

Among the evangelical churches there is a substantial agreement
upon what they consider the fundamental truths of the gospel.These
fundamental truths, as I understand them, are:--That there is a personal
God, the creator of the material universe; that he made man of the dust,
and woman from part of the man; that the man and woman were tempted by
the devil; that they were turned out of the garden of Eden; that, about
fifteen hundred years afterward, God's patience having been exhausted by
the wickedness of mankind, He drowned His children, with the exception
of eight persons; that afterward He selected from their descendants
Abraham, and through him the Jewish people; that He gave laws to these
people, and tried to govern them in all things; that He made known His
will in many ways; that He wrought a vast number of miracles; that
He inspired men to write the Bible; that, in the fullness of time, it
having been found impossible to reform mankind, this God came upon earth
as a child born of the Virgin Mary; that He lived in Palestine; that He
preached for about three years, going from place to place, occasionally
raising the dead, curing the blind and the halt; that He was
crucified--for the crime of blasphemy, as the Jews supposed, but, that
as a matter of fact, He was offered as a sacrifice for the sins of
all who might have faith in Him; that He was raised from the dead and
ascended into heaven, where He now is, making intercession for His
followers; that He will forgive the sins of all who believe on Him,
and that those who do not believe will be consigned to the dungeons of
eternal pain.These--(it may be with the addition of the sacraments of
Baptism and the Last Supper)--constitute what is generally known as the
Christian religion.A Profound Change in the World of Thought

A profound change has taken place in the world of thought.The pews are
trying to set themselves somewhat above the pulpit.The layman discusses
theology with the minister, and smiles.Christians excuse themselves
for belonging to the church by denying a part of the creed.The idea
is abroad that they who know the most of nature believe the least about
theology.The sciences are regarded as infidels, and facts as scoffers.Thousands of most excellent people avoid churches, and, with few
exceptions, only those attend prayer meetings who wish to be alone.The
pulpit is losing because the people are rising.The Believer in the Inspiration of the Bible has too Much to Believe

But the believer in the inspiration of the Bible is compelled to declare
that there was a time when slavery was right--when men could buy and
women sell their babes.He is compelled to insist that there was a time
when polygamy was the highest form of virtue; when wars of extermination
were waged with the sword of mercy; when religious toleration was a
crime, and when death was the just penalty for having expressed an
honest thought.He must maintain that Jehovah is just as bad now as he
was four thousand years ago, or that he was just as good then as he is
now, but that human conditions have so changed that slavery, polygamy,
religious persecutions and wars of conquest are now perfectly devilish.Once they were right--once they were commanded by God himself; now, they
are prohibited.There has been such a change in the conditions of man
that, at the present time, the devil is in favor of slavery, polygamy,
religious persecution and wars of conquest.That is to say, the devil
entertains the same opinion to-day that Jehovah held four thousand
years ago, but in the meantime Jehovah has remained exactly the
same--changeless and incapable of change.A Frank Admission

It is most cheerfully admitted that a vast number of people not only
believe these things, but hold them in exceeding reverence, and imagine
them to be of the utmost importance to mankind.They regard the Bible as
the only light that God has given for the guidance of His children; that
it is the one star in nature's sky--the foundation of all morality, of
all law, of all order, and of all individual and national progress.They
regard it as the only means we have for ascertaining the will of God,
the origin of man, and the destiny of the soul.The mistake has hindered in countless ways the civilization of
man.The Bible Should be Better than any other Book

In all ages of which any record has been preserved, there have been
those who gave their ideas of justice, charity, liberty, love, and
law.Now, if the Bible is really the work of God, it should contain the
grandest and sublimest truths.It should, in all respects, excel the
works of man.Within that book should be found the best and loftiest
definitions of justice; the truest conceptions of human liberty; the
clearest outlines of duty; the tenderest, the highest, and the noblest
thoughts,--not that the human mind has produced, but that the human mind
is capable of receiving.Upon every page should be found the luminous
evidence of its divine origin.Unless it contains grander and more
wonderful things than man has written, we are not only justified in
saying, but we are compelled to say, that it was written by no being
superior to man.A Serious Charge

The Bible has been the fortress and the defense of nearly every crime.No civilized country could re-enact its laws.And in many respects its
moral code is abhorrent to every good and tender man.It is admitted,
however, that many of its precepts are pure, that many of its laws are
wise and just, and that many of its statements are absolutely true.If the Bible is Not Verbally Inspired, What Then?It may be said that it is unfair to call attention to certain bad things
in the Bible, while the good are not so much as mentioned.To this it
may be replied that a divine being would not put bad things in a book.Certainly a being of infinite intelligence, power, and goodness could
never fall below the ideal of "depraved and barbarous" man.It will not
do, after we find that the Bible upholds what we now call crimes, to say
that it is not verbally inspired.If the words are not inspired, what
is?It may be said that the thoughts are inspired.But this would
include only the thoughts expressed without words.If the ideas are
inspired, they must be contained in and expressed only by inspired
words; that is to say, the arrangement of the words, with relation to
each other, must have been inspired.A Hindu Example

Suppose that we should now discover a Hindu book of equal antiquity with
the Old Testament, containing a defense of slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution, would we regard it as evidence
that the writers were inspired by an infinitely wise and merciful God?A Test Fairly Applied

Suppose we knew that after "inspired" men had finished the Bible, the
devil had got possession of it and wrote a few passages, what part of
the sacred Scriptures would Christians now pick out as being probably
his work?Which of the following passages would naturally be selected
as having been written by the devil--"Love thy neighbor as thyself," or
"Kill all the males among the little ones, and kill every woman; but all
the women children keep alive for yourselves?"It will hardly be claimed at this day, that the passages in the
Bible upholding slavery, polygamy, war, and religious persecution are
evidences of the inspiration of that book.Suppose that there had been
nothing in the Old Testament upholding these crimes would any modern
Christian suspect that it was not inspired on account of that omission?Suppose that there had been nothing in the Old Testament but laws in
favor of these crimes, would any intelligent Christian now contend that
it was the work of the true God?Proofs of Civilization

We know that there was a time in the history of almost every nation when
slavery, polygamy, and wars of extermination were regarded as divine
institutions; when women were looked upon as beasts of burden, and when,
among some people, it was considered the duty of the husband to murder
the wife for differing with him on the subject of religion.Nations that
entertain these views to-day are regarded as savage, and, probably, with
the exception of the South Sea islanders, the Feejees, some citizens
of Delaware, and a few tribes in Central Africa, no human beings can be
found degraded enough to agree upon these subjects with the Jehovah of
the ancient Jews.The only evidence we have, or can have, that a
nation has ceased to be savage is the fact that it has abandoned these
doctrines.To every one, except the theologian, it is perfectly easy to
account for the mistakes, atrocities, and crimes of the past, by
saying that civilization is a slow and painful growth; that the moral
perceptions are cultivated through ages of tyranny, of want, of crime,
and of heroism; that it requires centuries for man to put out the eyes
of self and hold in lofty and in equal poise the scales of justice;
that conscience is born of suffering; that mercy is the child of the
imagination--of the power to put oneself in the sufferers place, and
that man advances only as he becomes acquainted with his surroundings,
with the mutual obligations of life, and learns to take advantage of the
forces of nature.A Persian Gospel

Do not misunderstand me.My position is that the cruel passages in
the Old Testament are not inspired; that slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution always have been, are, and
forever will be, abhorred and cursed by the honest, virtuous, and the
loving; that the innocent cannot justly suffer for the guilty, and that
vicarious vice and vicarious virtue are equally absurd; that eternal
punishment is eternal revenge; that only the natural can happen; that
miracles prove the dishonesty of the few and the credulity of the many;
and that, according to Matthew, Mark, and Luke, salvation does not
depend upon belief, nor the atonement, nor a "second birth," but that
these gospels are in exact harmony with the declaration of the great
Persian: "Taking the first footstep with the good thought, the second
with the good word, and the third with the good deed, I entered
paradise."The dogmas of the past no longer reach the level of the
highest thought, nor satisfy the hunger of the heart.While dusty
faiths, embalmed and sepulchered in ancient texts, remain the same,
the sympathies of men enlarge; the brain no longer kills its young; the
happy lips give liberty to honest thoughts; the mental firmament expands
and lifts; the broken clouds drift by; the hideous dreams, the foul,
misshapen children of the monstrous night, dissolve and fade.Man the Author of all Books

So far as we know, man is the author of all books.If a book had been
found on the earth by the first man, he might have regarded it as the
work of God; but as men were here a good while before any books were
found, and as man has produced a great many books, the probability is
that the Bible is no exception.God and Brahma

Can we believe that God ever said of any: "Let his children be
fatherless and his wife a widow; let his children be continually
vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also out of their desolate
places; let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the stranger
spoil his labor, let there be none to extend mercy unto him, neither let
there be any to favor his fatherless children."If he ever said these
words, surely he had never heard this line, this strain of music, from
the Hindu: "Sweet is the lute to those who have not heard the prattle of
their own children."Jehovah, "from the clouds and darkness of Sinai,"
said to the Jews: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me.... Thou
shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them; for I, the Lord thy
God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the
children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me."Contrast this with the words put by the Hindu in the mouth of Brahma:
"I am the same to all mankind.They who honestly serve other gods,
involuntarily worship me.I am he who partaketh of all worship, and I
am the reward of all worshipers."The first, a
dungeon where crawl the things begot of jealous slime; the other, great
as the domed firmament inlaid with suns.Matthew, Mark, and Luke

And I here take occasion to say, that with most of the teachings of the
gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke I most heartily agree.The miraculous
parts must, of course, be thrown aside.I admit that the necessity of
belief, the atonement, and the scheme of salvation are all set forth
in the Gospel of John,--a gospel, in my opinion, not written until long
after the others.Christianity Takes no Step in Advance

All the languages of the world have not words of horror enough to
paint the agonies of man when the church had power.Tiberius, Caligula,
Claudius, Nero, Domitian, and Commodus were not as cruel, false,
and base as many of the Christian Popes.Opposite the names of these
imperial criminals write John the XII., Leo the VIII., Boniface the VII.,
Benedict the IX., Innocent the III., and Alexander the VI.Was it under
these pontiffs that the "church penetrated the moral darkness like a
new sun," and covered the globe with institutions of mercy?Rome was far
better when Pagan than when Catholic.It was better to allow gladiators
and criminals to fight than to burn honest men.The greatest of Romans
denounced the cruelties of the arena.Seneca condemned the combats even
of wild beasts.He was tender enough to say that "we should have a bond
of sympathy for all sentiment beings, knowing that only the depraved
and base take pleasure in the sight of blood and suffering."Aurelius
compelled the gladiators to fight with blunted swords.Roman lawyers
declared that all men are by nature free and equal.Woman, under Pagan
rule in Rome, become as free as man.Zeno, long before the birth of
Christ, taught that virtue alone establishes a difference between men.We know that the Civil Law is the foundation of our codes.We know that
fragments of Greek and Roman art--a few manuscripts saved from Christian
destruction, some inventions and discoveries of the Moors--were the
seeds of modern civilization.Christianity, for a thousand years,
taught memory to forget and reason to believe.Not one step was taken in
advance.Over the manuscripts of philosophers and poets, priests, with
their ignorant tongues thrust out, devoutly scrawled the forgeries of
faith.Christianity a Mixture of Good and Evil

Mr.Black attributes to me the following expression: "Christianity is
pernicious in its moral effect, darkens the mind, narrows the soul,
arrests the progress of human society, and hinders civilization."Strange, that he is only able to answer what I did
not say.I endeavored to show that the passages in the Old Testament
upholding slavery, polygamy, wars of extermination, and religious
intolerance had filled the world with blood and crime.I admitted
that there are many wise and good things in the Old Testament.I also
insisted that the doctrine of the atonement--that is to say, of moral
bankruptcy--the idea that a certain belief is necessary to salvation,
and the frightful dogma of eternal pain, had narrowed the soul, had
darkened the mind, and had arrested the progress of human society.Like
other religions, Christianity is a mixture of good and evil.The church
has made more orphans than it has fed.It has never built asylums enough
to hold the insane of its own making.Jehovah, Epictetus and Cicero

If the Bible is really inspired, Jehovah commanded the Jewish people to
buy the children of the strangers that sojourned among them, and ordered
that the children thus bought should be an inheritance for the children
of the Jews, and that they should be bondmen and bondwomen forever.Yet
Epictetus, a man to whom no revelation was ever made, a man whose soul
followed only the light of nature, and who had never heard of the Jewish
God, was great enough to say: "Will you not remember that your servants
are by nature your brothers, the children of God?In saying that you
have bought them, you look down on the earth and into the pit, on the
wretched law of men long since dead,--but you see not the laws of the
Gods."We find that Jehovah, speaking to his chosen people, assured them
that their bondmen and bondmaids must be "of the heathen that were
round about them.""Of them," said Jehovah, "shall ye buy bondmen
and bondmaids."And yet Cicero, a pagan, Cicero, who had never been
enlightened by reading the Old Testament, had the moral grandeur to
declare: "They who say that we should love our fellow-citizens, but not
foreigners, destroy the universal brotherhood of mankind, with which
benevolence and justice would perish forever."The Atonement

In countless ways the Christian world has endeavored, for nearly two
thousand years, to explain the atonement, and every effort has ended in
an an mission that it cannot be understood, and a declaration that it
must be believed.Is it not immoral to teach that man can sin, that he
can harden his heart and pollute his soul, and that, by repenting
and believing something that he does not comprehend, he can avoid the
consequences of his crimes?Has the promise and hope of forgiveness ever
prevented the commission of a sin?Should men be taught that sin gives
happiness here; that they ought to bear the evils of a virtuous life in
this world for the sake of joy in the next; that they can repent between
the last sin and the last breath; that after repentance every stain
of the soul is washed away by the innocent blood of another; that the
serpent of regret will not hiss in the ear of memory; that the saved
will not even pity the victims of their own crimes; that the goodness
of another can be transferred to them; and that sins forgiven cease to
affect the unhappy wretches sinned against?Sin as a Debt

The Church says that the sinner is in debt to God, and that the
obligation is discharged by the Saviour.The best that can possibly be
said of such a transaction is, that the debt is transferred, not paid.The truth is, that a sinner is in debt to the person he has injured.If a man injures his neighbor, it is not enough for him to get the
forgiveness of God, but he must have the forgiveness of his neighbor.If a man puts his hand in the fire and God forgives him, his hand will
smart exactly the same.You must, after all, reap what you sow.No god
can give you wheat when you sow tares, and no devil can give you tares
when you sow wheat.The Logic of the Coffin

As to the doctrine of the atonement, Mr.Black has nothing to offer
except the barren statement that it is believed by the wisest and the
best.A Mohammedan, speaking in Constantinople, will say the same of the
Koran.A Brahman, in a Hindu temple, will make the same remark, and so
will the American Indian, when he endeavors to enforce something upon
the young of his tribe.He will say: "The best, the greatest of our
tribe have believed in this."This is the argument of the cemetery, the
philosophy of epitaphs, the logic of the coffin.We are the greatest and
wisest and most virtuous of mankind?This statement, that it has been
believed by the best, is made in connection with an admission that it
cannot be fathomed by the wisest.It is not claimed that a thing is
necessarily false because it is not understood, but I do claim that
it is not necessarily true because it cannot be comprehended.I still
insist that "the plan of redemption," as usually preached, is absurd,
unjust, and immoral.Judas Iscariot

For nearly two thousand years Judas Iscariot has been execrated by
mankind; and yet, if the doctrine of the atonement is true, upon his
treachery hung the plan of salvation.Suppose Judas had known of this
plan--known that he was selected by Christ for that very purpose, that
Christ was depending on him.And suppose that he also knew that only
by betraying Christ could he save either himself or others; what ought
Judas to have done?Are you willing to rely upon an argument that
justifies the treachery of that wretch?The Standard of Right

According to Mr.Black, the man who does not believe in a supreme being
acknowledges no standard of right and wrong in this world, and therefore
can have no theory of rewards and punishments in the next.Is it
possible that only those who believe in the God who persecuted for
opinion's sake have any standard of right and wrong?Were the greatest
men of all antiquity without this standard?In the eyes of intelligent
men of Greece and Rome, were all deeds, whether good or evil, morally
alike?Is it necessary to believe in the existence of an infinite
intelligence before you can have any standard of right and wrong?Is it
possible that a being cannot be just or virtuous unless he believes in
some being infinitely superior to himself?If this doctrine be true, how
can God be just or virtuous?Does He believe in some being superior to
himself?If man were incapable of suffering, if man could not
feel pain, the word "conscience" never would have passed his lips.The
man who puts himself in the place of another, whose imagination has been
cultivated to the point of feeling the agonies suffered by another, is
the man of conscience.Black says, "We have neither jurisdiction or capacity to rejudge
the justice of God."In other words, we have no right to think upon
this subject, no right to examine the questions most vitally affecting
human-kind.We are simply to accept the ignorant statements of barbarian
dead.This question cannot be settled by saying that "it would be a
mere waste of time and space to enumerate the proofs which show that the
universe was created by a pre-existent and self-conscious being."The
time and space should have been "wasted," and the proofs should have
been enumerated.These "proofs" are what the wisest and greatest are
trying to find.It cares nothing
for the opinions of the "great," nothing for the prejudices of the many,
and least of all, for the superstitions of the dead.In the world of
science--a fact is a legal tender.Assertions and miracles are base and
spurious coins.We have the right to rejudge the justice even of a god.No one should throw away his reason--the fruit of all experience.It is
the intellectual capital of the soul, the only light, the only guide,
and without it the brain becomes the palace of an idiot king, attended
by a retinue of thieves and hypocrites.The Liberty of the Bible

This is the religious liberty of the Bible.If you had lived in
Palestine, and if the wife of your bosom, dearer to you than your
own soul, had said: "I like the religion of India better than that of
Palestine," it would have been your duty to kill her."Your eye must not
pity her, your hand must be first upon her, and afterwards the hand of
all the people."If she had said: "Let us worship the sun--the sun that
clothes the earth in garments of green--the sun, the great fireside of
the world--the sun that covers the hills and valleys with flowers--that
gave me your face, and made it possible for me to look into the eyes
of my babe,--let us worship the sun," it was your duty to kill her.You
must throw the first stone, and when against her bosom--a bosom filled
with love for you--you had thrown the jagged and cruel rock, and had
seen the red stream of her life oozing from the dumb lips of death,
you could then look up and receive the congratulations of the God whose
commandment you had obeyed.Is it possible that a being of infinite
mercy ordered a husband to kill his wife for the crime of having
expressed, an opinion on the subject of religion?Has there been found
upon the records of the savage world anything more perfectly fiendish
than this commandment of Jehovah?This is justified on the ground that
"blasphemy was a breach of political allegiance, and idolatry an act of
overt treason."We can understand how a human king stands in need of the
service of his people.We can understand how the desertion of any of
his soldiers weakens his army; but were the king infinite in power,
his strength would still remain the same, and under no conceivable
circumstances could the enemy triumph.Slavery in Heaven

According to Mr.Black, there will be slavery in Heaven, and fast by
the throne of God will be the auction-block, and the streets of the New
Jerusalem will be adorned with the whipping-post, while the music of
the harp will be supplemented by the crack of the driver's whip.Black, "incorporate him into his family,
tame him, teach him to think, and give him a knowledge of the true
principles of human liberty and government, he would confer upon him a
most beneficent boon."Black is too late with his protest against
the freedom of his fellow-men.Liberty is making the tour of the world.Russia has emancipated her serfs; the slave trade is prosecuted only
by thieves and pirates; Spain feels upon her cheek the burning blush
of shame; Brazil, with proud and happy eyes, is looking for the dawn of
freedom's day; the people of the South rejoice that slavery is no more,
and every good and honest man (excepting Mr.Black) of every land and
clime hopes that the limbs of men will never feel again the weary weight
of chains.Jehovah Breaking His Own Laws

A very curious thing about these Commandments is that their supposed
author violated nearly every one.From Sinai, according to the account,
He said: "Thou shalt not kill," and yet He ordered the murder of
millions; "Thou shalt not commit adultery," and He gave captured maidens
to gratify the lust of captors; "Thou shalt not steal," and yet He gave
to Jewish marauders the flocks and herds of others; "Thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's house, nor his wife," and yet He allowed His chosen
people to destroy the homes of neighbors and to steal their wives;
"Honor thy father and mother," and yet this same God had thousands of
fathers butchered, and with the sword of war killed children yet unborn;
"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor," and yet
He sent abroad "lying spirits" to deceive His own prophets, and in a
hundred ways paid tribute to deceit.So far as we know, Jehovah kept
only one of these Commandments--He worshiped no other god.I know as little as anyone else about the "pla" of the universe; and as
to the "design," I know just as little.It will not do to say that the
universe was designed, and therefore there must be a designer.There
must first be proof that it was "designed."It will not do to say that
the universe has a "plan," and then assert that there must have been an
infinite maker.The idea that a design must have a beginning, and that a
designer need not, is a simple expression of human ignorance.We find
a watch, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a thing must have had a
maker."We find the watchmaker, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a
thing as man must have had a maker."We find God and we then say: "He is
so wonderful that he must _not_ have had a maker."In other words, all
things a little wonderful must have been created, but it is possible for
something to be so wonderful that it always existed.One would suppose
that just as the wonder increased the necessity for a creator increased,
because it is the wonder of the thing that suggests the idea of
creation.Is it possible that a designer exists from all eternity
without design?Was there no design in having an infinite designer?For
me, it is hard to see the plan or design in earthquakes and pestilences.It is somewhat difficult to discern the design or the benevolence in so
making the world that billions of animals live only on the agonies of
others.The justice of God is not visible to me in the history of this
world.When I think of the suffering and death, of the poverty and
crime, of the cruelty and malice, of the heartlessness of this "design"
and "plan," where beak and claw and tooth tear and rend the quivering
flesh of weakness and despair, I cannot convince myself that it is the
result of infinite wisdom, benevolence, and justice.What we Know of the Infinite

Of course, upon a question like this, nothing can be absolutely known.We live on an atom called Earth, and what we know of the infinite is
almost infinitely limited; but, little as we know, all have an equal
right to give their honest thought.Life is a shadowy, strange,
and winding road on which we travel for a little way--a few short
steps--just from the cradle, with its lullaby of love, to the low and
quiet wayside inn, where all at last must sleep, and where the only
salutation is--Good-night.The Universe Self-Existent

The universe, according to my idea, is, always was, and forever will
be.It did not "come into being;" it is the one eternal being--the only
thing that ever did, does, or can exist.We know nothing of what we call the laws of Nature except as we gather
the idea of law from the uniformity of phenomena springing from like
conditions.To make myself clear: Water always runs down hill.The
theist says that this happens because there is behind the phenomenon an
active law.As a matter of fact law is this side of the phenomenon.Law
does not cause the phenomenon, but the phenomenon causes the idea of law
in our minds, and this idea is produced from the fact that under like
circumstances the same phenomena always happens.Black probably
thinks that the difference in the weight of rocks and clouds was created
by law; that parallel lines fail to imite only because it is illegal;
that diameter and circumference could have been so made that it would
be a greater distance across than around a circle, that a straight line
could inclose a triangle if not prevented by law, and that a little
legislation could make it possible for two bodies to occupy the same
space at the same time.It seems to me that law can not be the cause of
phenomena, but it is an effect produced in our minds by their succession
and resemblance.To put a God back of the universe compels us to admit
that there was a time when nothing existed except this God; that this
God had lived from eternity in an infinite vacuum and in an absolute
idleness.The mind of every thoughtful man is forced to one of these two
conclusions, either that the universe is self-existent or that it
was created by a self-existent being.To my mied there are far more
difficulties in the second hypothesis than in the first.Jehovah's Promise Broken

If Jehovah was in fact God, He knew the end from the beginning.He knew
that his Bible would be a breastwork behind which tyranny and hypocrisy
would crouch; that it would be quoted by tyrants; that it would be the
defense of robbers called kings and of hypocrites called priests.He
knew that He had taught the Jewish people but little of importance.He
knew that He found them free and left them captives.He knew that He
had never fulfilled the promises made to them.He knew that while other
nations had advanced in art and science his chosen people were savage
still.He promised them the world, and gave them a desert.He promised
them liberty, and He made them slaves.He promised them victory, and He
gave them defeat.He said they should be kings, and He made them
serfs.He promised them universal empire, and gave them exile.When one
finishes the Old Testament, he is compelled to say: Nothing can add to
the misery of a nation whose King is Jehovah!Character Bather than Creed

For a thousand years the torch of progress was extinguished in the blood
of Christ, and His disciples, moved by ignorant zeal, by insane, cruel
creeds, destroyed with flame and sword a hundred millions of their
fellow-men.But if cathedrals had been
universities--if dungeons of the Inquisition had been laboratories--if
Christians had believed in character instead of creed--if they had taken
from the Bible all the good and thrown away the wicked and absurd--if
domes of temples had been observatories--if priests had been
philosophers--if missionaries had taught the useful arts--if astrology
had been astronomy--if the black art had been chemistry--if superstition
had been science--if religion had been humanity--it would have been a
heaven filled with love, with liberty, and joy.Mohammed the Prophet of God

Mohammed was a poor man, a driver of camels.He was without education,
without influence, and without wealth, and yet in a few years he
consolidated thousands of tribes, and millions of men confess that there
is "one God, and Mohammed is his prophet."His success was a thousand
times greater during his life than that of Christ.He was not crucified;
he was a conqueror."Of all men, he exercised the greatest influence
upon the human race."Never in the world's history did a religion
spread with the rapidity of his.It burst like a storm over the fairest
portions of the globe.Black is right in his position that
rapidity is secured only by the direct aid of the Divine Being,
then Mohammed was most certainly the prophet of God.As to wars of
extermination and slavery, Mohammed agreed with Mr.Black, and upon
polygamy with Jehovah.As to religious toleration, he was great enough
to say that "men holding to any form of faith might be saved, provided
they were virtuous."In this he was far in advance both of Jehovah and
Mr.Wanted!--A Little More Legislation

We are informed by Mr.Black that "polygamy is neither commanded or
prohibited in the Old Testament--that it is only discouraged."It seems
to me that a little legislation on that subject might have tended to its
"discouragement."Black assures us "consists of certain immutable rules to govern the
conduct of all men at all times and at all places in their private and
personal relations with others," not one word is found on the subject of
polygamy.There is nothing "discouraging" in the Ten Commandments, nor
in the records of any conversation Jehovah is claimed to have had with
Moses upon Sinai.The life of Abraham, the story of Jacob and Laban,
the duty of a brother to be the husband of the widow of his deceased
brother, the life of David, taken in connection with the practice of
one who is claimed to have been the wisest of men--all these things are
probably relied on to show that polygamy was at least "discouraged."Certainly Jehovah had time to instruct Moses as to the infamy of
polygamy.He could have spared a few moments from a description of
patterns of tongs and basins for a subject so important as this.A
few-words in favor of the one wife and one husband--in favor of the
virtuous and loving home--might have taken the place of instructions
as to cutting the garments of priests and fashioning candlesticks and
ounces of gold.If he had left out simply the order that rams' skins
should be dyed red, and in its place had said, "A man shall have but one
wife, and the wife but one husband," how much better it would have been.Again, it is urged that "the acceptance of Christianity by a large
portion of the generation contemporary with its Founder and His
Apostles, was under the circumstances, an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."If this is true,
then "the acceptance of Buddhism by a large portion of the generation
contemporary with its Founder was an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."The same could
be said of Mohammedanism, and, in fact, of every religion that has
ever benefited or cursed this world.This argument, when reduced to its
simplest form, is this: All that succeeds is inspired.The Morality in Christianity

The morality in Christianity has never opposed the freedom of thought.It has never put, nor tended to put, a chain on a human mind, nor a
manacle on a human limb; but the doctrines distinctively Christian--the
necessity of believing a certain thing; the idea that eternal punishment
awaited him who failed to believe; the idea that the innocent can suffer
for the guilty--these things have |opposed, and for a thousand years
substantially destroyed the freedom of the human mind.All religions
have, with ceremony, magic, and mystery, deformed, darkened, and
corrupted, the soul.Around the sturdy oaks of morality have grown and
clung the parasitic, poisonous vines of the miraculous and monstrous.Irenaeus assures us that all Christians possessed the power of
working miracles; that they prophesied, cast out devils, healed the
sick, and even raised the dead.Epiphanius asserts that some rivers
and fountains were annually transmuted into wine, in attestation of the
miracle of Cana, adding that he himself had drunk of these fountains.Augustine declares that one was told in a dream where the bones of
St.Stephen were buried and the bones were thus discovered and brought
to Hippo, and that they raised five dead persons to life, and that in
two years seventy miracles were performed with these relics.Justin
Martyr states that God once sent some angels to guard the human race,
that these angels fell in love with the daughters of men, and became the
fathers of innumerable devils.For hundreds of years miracles were
about the only things that happened.They were wrought by thousands of
Christians, and testified to by millions.The saints and martyrs, the
best and greatest, were the witnesses and workers of wonders.Even
heretics, with the assistance of the devil, could suspend the "laws
of nature."Must we believe these wonderful accounts because they were
written by "good men," by Christians," who made their statements in the
presence and expectation of death"?The truth is that these "good men"
were mistaken.They fed their minds on prodigies, and their imaginations
feasted on effects without causes.Doubts were regarded as "rude disturbers of the congregation."Credulity
and sanctity walked hand in hand.As the philosophy of the ancients was rendered almost worthless by the
credulity of the common people, so the proverbs of Christ, his religion
of forgiveness, his creed of kindness, were lost in the mist of miracle
and the darkness of superstition.The Honor Due to Christ

For the man Christ--for the reformer who loved his fellow-men--for the
man who believed in an Infinite Father, who would shield the innocent
and protect the just--for the martyr who expected to be rescued from the
cruel cross, and who at last, finding that his rope was dust, cried out
in the gathering gloom of death; "My God!--for that great and suffering man, mistaken though he was, I have
the highest admiration and respect.That man did not, as I believe,
claim a miraculous origin; he did not pretend to heal the sick nor raise
the dead.He claimed simply to be a man, and taught his fellow-men
that love is stronger far than hate.His life was written by reverent
ignorance.Loving credulity belittled his career with feats of jugglery
and magic art, and priests wishing to persecute and slay, put in his
mouth the words of hatred and revenge.The theological Christ is the
impossible union of the human and divine--man with the attributes of
God, and God with the limitations and weakness of man.Christianity has no Monopoly in Morals

The morality of the world is not distinctively Christian.Zoroaster,
Gautama, Mohammed, Confucius, Christ, and, in fact, all founders of
religions, have said to their disciples: You must not steal; You must
not murder; You must not bear false witness; You must discharge your
obligations.Christianity is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the
miraculous origin of Jesus Christ, his crucifixion, his resurrection,
his ascension, the inspiration of the Bible, the doctrine of the
atonement, and the necessity of belief.Buddhism is the ordinary moral
code, _plus_ the miraculous illumination of Buddha, the performance of
certain ceremonies, a belief in the transmigration of the soul, and
in the final absorption of the human by the infinite.The religion of
Mohammed is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the belief that Mohammed
was the prophet of God, total abstinence from the use of intoxicating
drinks, a harem for the faithful here and hereafter, ablutions, prayers,
alms, pilgrimages, and fasts.Old Age in Superstition's Lap

And here I take occasion to thank Mr.Black for having admitted that
Jehovah gave no commandment against the practice of polygamy, that he
established slavery, waged wars of extermination, and persecuted for
opinions' sake even unto death, Most theologians endeavor to putty,
patch, and paint the wretched record of inspired crime, but Mr.Black
has been bold enough and honest enough to admit the truth.In this age
of fact and demonstration it is refreshing to find a man who believes
so thoroughly in the monstrous and miraculous, the impossible and
immoral--who still clings lovingly to the legends of the bib and
rattle--who through the bitter experiences of a wicked world has kept
the credulity of the cradle, and finds comfort and joy in thinking about
the Garden of Eden, the subtile serpent, the flood, and Babel's tower,
stopped by the jargon of a thousand tongues--who reads with happy eyes
the story of the burning brimstone storm that fell upon the cities
of the plain, and smilingly explains the transformation of the
retrospective Mrs.Lot--who laughs at Egypt's plagues and Pharaoh's
whelmed and drowning hosts--eats manna with the wandering Jews, warms
himself at the burning bush, sees Korah's company by the hungry earth
devoured, claps his wrinkled hands with glee above the heathens'
butchered babes, and longingly looks back to the patriarchal days of
concubines and slaves.How touching when the learned and wise crawl back
in cribs and ask to hear the rhymes and fables once again!How charming
in these hard and scientific times to see old age in Superstition's lap,
with eager lips upon her withered breast!Ararat in Chicago

A little while ago, in the city of Chicago, a gentleman addressed a
number of Sunday-school children.In his address he stated that some
people were wicked enough to deny the story of the deluge; that he was
a traveler; that he had been to the top of Mount Ararat, and had brought
with him a stone from that sacred locality.The children were then
invited to form in procession and walk by the pulpit, for the purpose of
seeing this wonderful stone.After they had looked at it, the lecturer
said: "Now, children, if you ever hear anybody deny the story of the
deluge, or say that the ark did not rest on Mount Ararat, you can tell
them that you know better, because you have seen with your own eyes a
stone from that very mountain."How Gods and Devils are Made

It was supposed that God demanded worship; that he loved to be
flattered; that he delighted in sacrifice; that nothing made him happier
than to see ignorant faith upon its knees; that above all things he
hated and despised doubters and heretics, and regarded investigation as
rebellion.Each community felt it a duty to see that the enemies of God
were converted or killed.To allow a heretic to live in peace was
to invite the wrath of God.Every public evil--every misfortune--was
accounted for by something the community had permitted or done.When
epidemics appeared, brought by ignorance and welcomed by filth, the
heretic was brought out and sacrificed to appease the anger of God.By putting intention behind what man called good, God was produced.By
putting intention behind what man called bad, the Devil was created.Leave this "intention" out, and gods and devils fade away.If not a
human being existed, the sun would continue to shine, and tempest now
and then would devastate the earth; the rain would fall in pleasant
showers; violets would spread their velvet bosoms to the sun, the
earthquake would devour, birds would sing, and daisies bloom, and
roses blush, and volcanoes fill the heavens with their lurid glare; the
procession of the seasons would not be broken, and the stars would shine
as serenely as though the world were filled with loving hearts and happy
homes.The Romance of Figures

How long, according to the universal benevolence of the New Testament,
can a man be reasonably punished in the next world for failing to
believe something unreasonable in this?Can it be possible that any
punishment can endure forever?Suppose that every flake of snow that
ever fell was a figure nine, and that the first flake was multiplied by
the second, and that product by the third, and so on to the last flake.And then suppose that this total should be multiplied by every drop of
rain that ever fell, calling each drop a figure nine; and that total by
each blade of grass that ever helped to weave a carpet for the earth,
calling each blade a figure nine; and that again by every grain of sand
on every shore, so that the grand total would make a line of nines so
long that it would require millions upon millions of years for light,
traveling at the rate of one hundred and eighty-five thousand miles per
second, to reach the end.And suppose, further, that each unit in this
almost infinite total, stood for billions of ages--still that vast and
almost endless time, measured by all the years beyond, is as one flake,
one drop, one leaf, one blade, one grain, compared with all the flakes,
and drops, and leaves, and blades and grains.Upon love's breast the
Church has placed the eternal asp.And yet, in the same book in which is
taught this most infamous of doctrines, we are assured that "The Lord is
good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works."God and Zeno

If the Bible is inspired, Jehovah, God of all worlds, actually said:
"And if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die under
his hand, he shall be surely punished; notwithstanding, if he continue
a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money."And yet
Zeno, founder of the Stoics, centuries before Christ was born, insisted
that no man could be the owner of another, and that the title was bad,
whether the slave had become so by conquest, or by purchase.Jehovah,
ordered a Jewish general to make war, and gave, among others, this
command: "When the Lord thy God shall drive them before thee, thou shalt
smite them and utterly destroy them."And yet Epictetus, whom we have
already quoted, gave this marvelous rule for the guidance of human
conduct: "Live with thy inferiors as thou wouldst have thy superiors
live with thee."If Christ was in fact God, he knew all the future.Before him, like a
panorama, moved the history yet to be.He knew exactly how his words
would be interpreted.He knew what crimes, what horrors, what infamies,
would be committed in his name.He knew that the fires of persecution
would climb around the limbs of countless martyrs.He knew that brave
men would languish in dungeons, in darkness, filled with pain; that the
church would use instruments of torture, that his followers would appeal
to whip and chain.He must have seen the horizon of the future red with
the flames of the _auto da fe_.He knew all the creeds that would spring
like poison fungi from every text.He saw the sects waging war against
each other.He saw thousands of men, under the orders of priests,
building dungeons for their fellow-men.He heard the groans, saw the faces white with agony, the tears,
the blood--heard the shrieks and sobs of all the moaning, martyred
multitudes.He knew that commentaries would be written on his words with
swords, to be read by the light of fagots.He knew that the Inquisition
would be born of teachings attributed to him.He saw all the
interpolations and falsehoods that hypocrisy would write and tell.He
knew that above these fields of death, these dungeons, these burnings,
for a thousand years would float the dripping banner of the cross.He
knew that in his name his followers would trade in human flesh, that
cradles would be robbed and women's breasts unbabed for gold;--and yet
he died with voiceless lips.Why did he not
tell his disciples, and through them the world, that man should not
persecute, for opinion's sake, his fellow-man?Why did he not cry, You
shall not persecute in my name; you shall not burn and torment those who
differ from you in creed?Why did he not plainly say, I am the Son of
God?Why did he not explain the doctrine of the trinity?Why did he not
tell the manner of baptism that was pleasing to him?Why did he not say
something positive, definite, and satisfactory about another world?Why
did he not turn the tear-stained hope of heaven to the glad knowledge
of another life?Why did he go dumbly to his death, leaving the world to
misery and to doubt?The Philosophy of Action

Consequences determine the quality of an action.If consequences are
good, so is the action.If actions had no consequences, they would be
neither good nor bad.Man did not get his knowledge of the consequences
of actions from God, but from experience and reason.If man can, by
actual experiment, discover the right and wrong of actions, is it not
utterly illogical to declare that they who do not believe in God can
have no standard of right and wrong?Consequences are the standard by
which actions are judged.They are the children that testify as to the
real character of their parents.God or no God, larceny is the enemy of
industry--industry is the mother of prosperity--prosperity is a good,
and therefore larceny is an evil.God or no God, murder is a crime.There has always been a law against larceny, because the laborer wishes
to enjoy the fruit of his toil.As long as men object to being killed,
murder will be illegal.I have insisted, and I still insist, that it is still impossible for
a finite man to commit a crime deserving infinite punishment; and upon
this subject Mr.Black admits that "no revelation has lifted the veil
between time and eternity;" and, consequently, neither the priest nor
the "policeman" knows anything with certainty regarding another world.He simply insists that "in shadowy figures we are warned that a very
marked distinction will be made between the good and bad in the next
world."There is "a very marked distinction" in this; but there is this
rainbow in the darkest human cloud: The worst have hope of reform.All I
insist is, if there is another life, the basest soul that finds its way
to that dark or radiant shore will have the everlasting chance of
doing right.Nothing but the most cruel ignorance, the most heartless
superstition, the most ignorant theology, ever imagined that the
few days of human life spent here, surrounded by mists and clouds of
darkness, blown over life's sea by storms and tempests of passion, fixed
for all eternity the condition of the human race.If this doctrine be
true, this life is but a net, in which Jehovah catches souls for hell.We are told that "there is no good reason to doubt that the statements
of the Evangelists, as we have them now, are genuine."The fact is, no
one knows who made the "statements of the Evangelists."There are three
important manuscripts upon which the Christian world relies."The first
appeared in the catalogue of the Vatican, in 1475.Of the New, it contains the four gospels,--the Acts, the
seven Catholic Epistles, nine of the Pauline Epistles, and the
Epistle to the Hebrews, so far as the fourteenth verse of the ninth
chapter,"--and nothing more."The
second, the Alexandrine, was presented to King Charles the First, in
1628.It contains the Old and New Testaments, with some exceptions;
passages are wanting in Matthew, in John, and in II.It
also contains the Epistle of Clemens Romanus, a letter of Athanasius,
and the treatise of Eusebius on the Psalms."The last is the Sinaitic
Codex, discovered about 1850, at the Convent of St."It contains the Old and New Testaments, and in addition
the entire Epistle of Barnabas, and a portion of the Shepherd of
Hennas--two books which, up to the beginning of the fourth century, were
looked upon by many as Scripture."In this manuscript, or codex, the
gospel of St.Mark concludes with the eighth verse of the sixteenth
chapter, leaving out the frightful passage: "Go ye into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature.He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."In
matters of the utmost importance these manuscripts disagree, but even if
they all agreed it would not furnish the slightest evidence of their
truth.It will not do to call the statements made in the gospels
"depositions," until it is absolutely established who made them, and the
circumstances under which they were made.Neither can we say that "they
were made in the immediate prospect of death," until we know who made
them.It is absurd to say that "the witnesses could not have been
mistaken, because the nature of the facts precluded the possibility of
any delusion about them."Can it be pretended that the witnesses could
not have been mistaken about the relation the Holy Ghost is alleged to
have sustained to Jesus Christ?Is there no possibility of delusion
about a circumstance of that kind?Did the writers of the four gospels
have "the sensible and true avouch of their own eyes and ears" in that
behalf?How was it possible for any one of the four Evangelists to know
that Christ was the Son of God, or that he was God?Matthew says that an angel of the Lord told
Joseph in a dream, but Joseph never wrote an account of this wonderful
vision.Luke tells us that the angel had a conversation with Mary, and
that Mary told Elizabeth, but Elizabeth never wrote a word.There is no
account of Mary, or Joseph, or Elizabeth, or the angel, having had any
conversation with Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, in which one word was
said about the miraculous origin of Jesus Christ.The persons who knew
did not write, so that the account is nothing but hearsay.Black pretend that such statements would be admitted as evidence in any
court?But how do we know that the disciples of Christ wrote a word of
the gospels?How do we know
that the writers of the gospels "were men of unimpeachable character?"Black's Admission

For the purpose of defending the character of his infallible God, Mr.Black is forced to defend religious intolerance, wars of extermination,
human slavery, and almost polygamy.He admits that God established
slavery; that he commanded his chosen people to buy the children of the
heathen; that heathen fathers and mothers did right to sell their girls
and boys; that God ordered the Jews to wage wars of extermination and
conquest; that it was right to kill the old and young; that God forged
manacles for the human brain; that he commanded husbands to murder their
wives for suggesting the worship of the sun or moon; and that every
cruel, savage passage in the Old Testament was inspired by him.Such is
a "policeman's" view of God.The Stars Upon the Door of France

Mr.Black justifies all the crimes and horrors, excuses all the tortures
of all the Christian years, by denouncing the cruelties of the French
Revolution.Thinking people will not hasten to admit that an infinitely
good being authorized slavery in Judea, because of the atrocities of the
French Revolution.They will remember the sufferings of the Huguenots.They will not forget
the countless cruelties of priest and king.They will not forget the
dungeons of the Bastile.They will know that the Revolution was an
effect, and that liberty was not the cause--that atheism was not the
cause.Behind the Revolution they will see altar and throne--sword and
fagot--palace and cathedral--king and priest--master and slave--tyrant
and hypocrite.They will see that the excesses, the cruelties, and
crimes were but the natural fruit of seeds the church had sown.Upon that cloud of war, black with
the myriad miseries of a thousand years, dabbled with blood of king and
queen, of patriot and priest, there was this bow: "Beneath the flag of
France all men are free."In spite of all the blood and crime, in spite
of deeds that seem insanely base, the People placed upon a Nation's brow
these stars:--Liberty, Fraternity, Equality--grander words than ever
issued from Jehovah's lips.A KIND WORD FOR JOHN CHINAMAN

On the 27th day of March, 1880, Messrs.Wright, Dickey, O'Conner, and
Murch, of the Select Committee appointed by Congress to "Consider
the causes of the present depression of labor," presented the majority
special report on Chinese Immigration.The following quotations are
excerpts from Col.R. G. Ingersoll's caustic review of that report.The Select Committee Afraid

These gentlemen are in great fear for the future of our most holy and
perfectly authenticated religion, and have, like faithful watchmen,
from the walls and towers of Zion, hastened to give the alarm.They have
informed Congress that "Joss has his temple of worship in the Chinese
quarters, in San Francisco.Within the walls of a dilapidated structure
is exposed to the view of the faithful the God of the Chinaman, and here
are his altars of worship, Here he tears up his pieces of paper; here he
offers up his prayers; here he receives his religious consolations,
and here is his road to the celestial land."That "Joss is located in a
long, narrow room, in a building in a back alley, upon a kind of altar;"
that "he is a wooden image, looking as much like an alligator as like a
human being;" that the Chinese "think there is such a place as heaven;"
that "all classes of Chinamen worship idols;" that "the temple is open
every day at all hours;" that "the Chinese have no Sunday;" that this
heathen god has "huge jaws, a big red tongue, large white teeth, a half
dozen arms, and big, fiery, eyeballs.About him are placed offerings of
meat, and other eatables--a sacrificial offering."The Gods of the Joss-House and Patmos

No wonder that these members of the committee were shocked at such a
god, knowing as they did, that the only true God was correctly described
by the inspired lunatic of Patmos in the following words: "And there sat
in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of
Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps
with a golden girdle.His head and his hairs were white like wool, as
white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like
unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the
sound of many waters.And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out
of his mouth went a sharp, two-edged sword; and his countenance was as
the sun shining in his strength."Certainly, a large mouth, filled
with white teeth, is preferable to one used as the scabbard of a sharp,
two-edged sword.Why should these gentlemen object to a god with big
fiery eyeballs, when their own Deity has eyes like a flame of fire?A Little Too Late

Is it not a little late in the day to object to people because they
sacrifice meat and other eatables to their god?We all know, that for
thousands of years the "real" God was exceedingly fond of roasted meat;
that He loved the savor of burning flesh, and delighted in the perfume
of fresh warm blood.Christianity has a Fair Show in San Francisco

The world is also informed by these gentlemen that "the idolatry of
the Chinese produces a demoralizing effect upon our American youth by
bringing sacred things into disrespect and making religion a theme of
disgust and contempt."In San Francisco there are some three hundred
thousand people.Is it possible that a few Chinese can bring "our holy
religion" into disgust and contempt?In that city there are fifty times
as many churches as joss-houses.Scores of sermons are uttered every
week; religious books and papers are plentiful as leaves in autumn, and
somewhat dryer; thousands of bibles are within the reach of all.An Arrow from the Quiver of Satire

And there, too, is the example of a Christian city.Why should we send
missionaries to China, if we cannot convert the heathen when they come
here?When missionaries go to a foreign land the poor benighted people
have to take their word for the blessings showered upon a Christian
people; but when the heathen come here, they can see for themselves.What was simply a story becomes a demonstrated fact.They come in
contact with people who love their enemies.They see that in a Christian
land men tell the truth; that they will not take advantage of strangers;
that they are just and patient; kind and tender; and have no prejudice
on account of color, race or religion; that they look upon mankind as
brethren; that they speak of God as a Universal Father, and are
willing to work and even to suffer, for the good, not only of their own
countrymen, but of the heathen as well.All this the Chinese see and
know, and why they still cling to the religion of their country is, to
me, a matter of amazement.We Have no Religious System

I take this, the earliest opportunity, to inform these gentlemen
composing a majority of the committee, that we have in the United States
no "religious system;" that this is a secular government.That it has
no religious creed; that it does not believe nor disbelieve in a future
state of reward or punishment; that it neither affirms nor denies the
existence of a "living" God.Congress Nothing to Do with Religion

Congress has nothing to do with the religion of the people.Its members
are not responsible to God for the opinions of their constituents, and
it may tend to the happiness of the constituents for me to state that
they are in no way responsible for the religion of the members.Religion
is an individual, not a national matter.And where the nation interferes
with the right of conscience, the liberties of the people are devoured
by the monster Superstition.But I am astonished that four Christian statesmen, four members of
Congress in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, who seriously
object to people on account of their religious convictions, should
still assert that the very religion in which they believe--and the only
religion established by the living god-head of the American system--is
not adapted to the spiritual needs of one-third of the human race.It is
amazing that these four gentlemen have, in the defense of the Christian
religion, announced the discovery that it is wholly inadequate for
the civilization of mankind; that the light of the cross can never
penetrate the darkness of China; "that all the labors of the missionary,
the example of the good, the exalted character of our civilization, make
no impression upon the pagan life of the Chinese;" and that even
the report of this committee will not tend to elevate, refine and
Christianize the yellow heathen of the Pacific coast.In the name
of religion these gentlemen have denied its power and mocked at the
enthusiasm of its founder.Worse than this, they have predicted for the
Chinese a future of ignorance and idolatry in this world, and, if the
"American system" of religion is true, hell-fire in the next.Do not Trample on John Chinaman

Do not trample upon these people because they have a different
conception of things about which even this committee knows nothing.Give them the same privilege you enjoy of making a God after their own
fashion.Would you be willing
to have them remain, if one of their race, thousands of years ago, had
pretended to have seen God, and had written of him as follows: "There
went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth; coals
were kindled by it, * * * and he rode upon a cherub and did fly."Why
should you object to these people on account of their religion?Your
objection has in it the spirit of hate and intolerance.That spirit lighted the fagot, made the
thumb-screw, put chains upon the limbs, and lashes upon the backs of
men.The same spirit bought and sold, captured and kidnapped human
beings; sold babes, and justified all the horrors of slavery.Be Honest with the Chinese

If you wish to drive out the Chinese, do not make a pretext of religion.Do not pretend that you are trying to do God a favor.Injustice in his
name is doubly detestable.The assassin cannot sanctify his dagger by
falling on his knees, and it does not help a falsehood if it be uttered
as a prayer.Religion, used, to intensify the hatred of men toward men,
under the pretense of pleasing God, has cursed this world.An Honest Merchant the Best Missionary

I am almost sure that I have read somewhere that "Christ died for _all_
men," and that "God is no respecter of persons."It was once taught
that it was the duty of Christians to tell to all people the "tidings of
great joy."I have never believed these things myself, but have always
contended that an honest merchant was the best missionary.Commerce
makes friends, religion makes enemies; the one enriches, and the other
impoverishes; the one thrives best where the truth is told, the other
where falsehoods are believed.For myself, I have but little confidence
in any business, or enterprise, or investment, that promises dividends
only after the death of the stockholders.Good Words from Confucius

For the benefit of these four philosophers and prophets, I will give a
few extracts from the writings of Confucius that will, in my judgment,
compare favorably with the best passages of their report:

"My doctrine is that man must be true to the principles of his nature,
and the benevolent exercises of them toward others.""With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and with my bended arm
for a pillow, I still have joy.""Riches and honor acquired by injustice are to me but floating clouds.""The man who, in view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who, in view of
danger, forgets life; and who remembers an old agreement, however far
back it extends, such a man may be reckoned a complete man.""Recompense injury with justice, and kindness with kindness."There is one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's
life: Reciprocity is that word.The Ancient Chinese

When the ancestors of the four Christian Congressmen were barbarians,
when they lived in caves, gnawed bones, and worshiped dry snakes; the
infamous Chinese were reading these sublime sentences of Confucius.When
the forefathers of these Christian statesmen were hunting toads to
get the jewels out of their heads to be used as charms, the wretched
Chinamen were calculating eclipses, and measuring the circumference
of the earth.When the progenitors of these representatives of the
"American system of religion" were burning women charged with nursing
devils, these people "incapable of being influenced by the exalted
character of our civilization," were building asylums for the insane.The Chinese and Civil Service Reform

Neither should it be forgotten that, for thousands of years, the Chinese
have honestly practised the great principle known as civil service
reform--a something that even the administration of Mr.Hayes has
reached only through the proxy of promise.Invading China in the Name of Opium and Christ

The English battered down the door of China in the names of Opium and
Christ.This infamy was regarded as another triumph of the gospel.At last in self-defense the Chinese allowed Christians to touch their
shores.Their wise men, their philosophers, protested, and prophesied
that time would show that Christians could not be trusted.This re port
proves that the wise men were not only philosophers but prophets.Don't be Dishonest in the Name of God

Treat China as you would England.Change it if you will, according to the laws of nations, but on no
account excuse a breach of national faith by pretending that we are
dishonest for God's sake.CONCERNING CREEDS AND THE TYRANNY OF SECTS




482.Diversity of Opinion Abolished by Henry VIII

In the reign of Henry VIII--that pious and moral founder of the
apostolic Episcopal Church,--there was passed by the parliament
of England an act entitled, "An act for abolishing of diversity of
opinion."And in this act was set forth what a good Christian was
obliged to believe:

First, That in the sacrament was the real body and blood of Jesus
Christ.Second, That the body and blood of Jesus Christ was in the bread, and
the blood and body of Jesus Christ was in the wine.Fourth, That vows of chastity were of perpetual obligation.Fifth, That private masses ought to be continued; and,

Sixth, That auricular confession to a priest must be maintained.This creed was made by law, in order that all men might know just what
to believe by simply reading the statute.The Church hated to see the
people wearing out their brains in thinking upon these subjects.Spencer and Darwin Damned

According to the philosophy of theology, man has continued to degenerate
for six thousand years.To teach that there is that in nature which
impels to higher forms and grander ends, is heresy, of course.The
Deity will damn Spencer and his "Evolution," Darwin and his "Origin
of Species," Bastian and his "Spontaneous Generation," Huxley and his
"Protoplasm," Tyndall and his "Prayer Gauge," and will save those, and
those only, who declare that the universe has been cursed, from the
smallest atom to the grandest star; that everything tends to evil and to
that only, and that the only perfect thing in nature is the Presbyterian
Confession of Faith.The Dead do Not Persecute

Imagine a vine that grows at one end and decays at the other.The
end that grows is heresy, the end that rots is orthodox.The dead are
orthodox, and your cemetery is the most perfect type of a well regulated
church.No thought, no progress, no heresy there.Slowly and silently,
side by side, the satisfied members peacefully decay.There is only this
difference--the dead do not persecute.The Atheist a Legal Outcast in Illinois

The supreme court of Illinois decided, in the year of grace 1856, that
an unbeliever in the existence of an intelligent First Cause could not
be allowed to testify in any court.His wife and children might have
been murdered before his very face, and yet in the absence of other
witnesses, the murderer could not have even been indicted.To him, Justice was not only blind, but deaf.He
was liable, like other men, to support the government, and was forced to
contribute his share towards paying the salaries of the very judges
who decided that under no circumstances could his voice be heard in any
court.This was the law of Illinois, and so remained until the adoption
of the new Constitution By such infamous means has the Church endeavored
to chain the human mind, and protect the majesty of her God.How the Owls Hoot

Now and then somebody examines, and in spite of all keeps his manhood,
and has the courage to follow where his reason leads.Then the pious
get together and repeat wise saws, and exchange knowing nods and most
prophetic winks.The stupidly wise sit owl-like on the dead limbs of the
tree of knowledge, and solemnly hoot.The Fate of Theological Students

Thousands of young men are being educated at this moment by the various
Churches.In order that they may be prepared to investigate
the phenomena by which we are surrounded?The object, and the only
object, is that they may be prepared to defend a creed; that they may
learn the arguments of their respective churches, and repeat them in
the dull ears of a thoughtless congregation.If one, after being thus
trained at the expense of the Methodists, turns Presbyterian or Baptist,
he is denounced as an ungrateful wretch.Honest investigation is utterly
impossible within the pale of any Church, for the reason, that if you
think the Church is right you will not investigate, and if you think it
wrong, the Church will investigate you.The consequence of this is,
that most of the theological literature is the result of suppression, of
fear, tyranny and hypocrisy.Trials for Heresy

A trial for heresy means that the spirit of persecution still lingers in
the Church; that it still denies the right of private judgment; that it
still thinks more of creed than truth, and that it is still determined
to prevent the intellectual growth of man.It means the churches are
shambles in which are bought and sold the souls of men.It means that
the Church is still guilty of the barbarity of opposing thought with
force.It means that if it had the power, the mental horizon would be
bound by a creed; that it would bring again the whips and chains and
dungeon keys, the rack and fagot of the past.Presbyterianism Softening

Fortunately for us, civilization has had a softening effect even upon
the Presbyterian Church.To the ennobling influence of the arts and
sciences the savage spirit of Calvinism has, in some slight degree,
succumbed.True, the old creed remains substantially as it was written,
but by a kind of tacit understanding it has come to be regarded as a
relic of the past.The cry of "heresy" has been growing fainter and
fainter, and, as a consequence, the ministers of that denomination
have ventured, now and then, to express doubts as to the damnation of
infants, and the doctrine of total depravity.The Methodist "Hoist with his own Petard."A few years ago a Methodist clergyman took it upon himself to give me a
piece of friendly advice."Although you may disbelieve the bible," said
he, "you ought not to say so."Do
you believe the bible," said I. He replied, "Most assuredly."To which
I retorted, "Your answer conveys no information to me.You may be
following your own advice.Of
course a man who will advise others to dissimulate will not always be
particular about telling the truth himself."The Precious Doctrine of Total Depravity

What a precious doctrine is that of the total depravity of the human
heart!How sweet it is to believe that the lives of all the good and
great were continual sins and perpetual crimes; that the love a mother
bears her child is, in the sight of God, a sin; that the gratitude of
the natural heart is simple meanness; that the tears of pity are impure;
that for the unconverted to live and labor for others is an offense to
heaven; that the noblest aspirations of the soul are low and groveling
in the sight of God.Guilty of Heresy

Whoever has an opinion of his own, and honestly expresses it, will be
guilty of heresy.Heresy is what the minority believe; it is the name
given by the powerful to the doctrine of the weak.This word was born of
the hatred, arrogance and cruelty of those who love their enemies, and
who, when smitten on one cheek, turn the other.This word was born of
intellectual slavery in the feudal ages of thought.It was an epithet
used in the place of argument.From the commencement of the Christian
era, every art has been exhausted and every conceivable punishment
inflicted to force all people to hold the same religious opinions.This
effort was born of the idea that a certain belief was necessary to the
salvation of the soul.One great trouble is that most teachers are dishonest.They teach as
certainties those things concerning which they entertain doubts.They
do not say, "we _think_ this is so," but "we _know_ this is so."They do
not appeal to the reason of the pupil, but they command his faith.They
keep all doubts to themselves; they do not explain, they assert.In all ages reason has been regarded as the enemy of religion.Nothing
has been considered so pleasing to the Deity as a total denial of the
authority of your own mind.Self-reliance has been thought a deadly
sin; and the idea of living and dying without the aid and consolation
of superstition has always horrified the Church.By some unaccountable
infatuation, belief has been and still is considered of immense
importance.All religions have been based upon the idea that God will
forever reward the true believer, and eternally damn the man who doubts
or denies.Belief is regarded as the one essential thing.To practice
justice, to love mercy, is not enough.You must believe in some
incomprehensible creed.You must say, "Once one is three, and three
times one is one."The man who practiced every virtue, but failed to
believe, was execrated.Nothing so outrages the feelings of the Church
as a moral unbeliever--nothing so horrible as a charitable Atheist.A Hundred and Fifty Years Ago

One hundred and fifty years ago the foremost preachers would have
perished at the stake.A Universalist would have been torn in pieces in
England, Scotland, and America.Unitarians would have found themselves
in the stocks, pelted by the rabble with dead cats, after which their
ears would have been cut off, their tongues bored, and their foreheads
branded.The Despotism of Faith

The despotism of faith is justified upon the ground that Christian
countries are the grandest and most prosperous of the world.At one time
the same thing could have been truly said in India, in Egypt, in Greece,
in Rome, and in every other country that has, in the history of the
world, swept to empire.This argument proves too much not only, but the
assumption upon which it is based is utterly false.Believe, or Beware

And what does a trial for heresy mean?It means that the Church says
a heretic, "Believe as I do, or I will withdraw my support.I will pursue you until your garments are rags; until your
children cry for bread; until your cheeks are furrowed with tears.I
will hunt you to the very portals of the grave."Calvin's Petrified Heart

Luther denounced mental liberty with all the coarse and brutal vigor
of his nature; Calvin despised, from the very bottom of his petrified
heart, anything that even looked like religious toleration, and solemnly
declared that to advocate it was to crucify Christ afresh.All the
founders of all the orthodox churches have advocated the same infamous
tenet.The truth is, that what is called religion is necessarily
inconsistent with free thought.Must one be versed in Latin before he is entitled to express his opinion
as to the genuineness of a pretended revelation from God?Common sense
belongs exclusively to no tongue.Logic is not confined to, nor has it
been buried with, the dead languages.Paine attacked the bible as it is
translated.If the translation is wrong, let its defenders correct it.A gentleman, walking among the ruins of Athens came upon a fallen statue
of Jupiter; making an exceedingly low bow he said: "O Jupiter!He then added: "Should you ever sit upon the throne of heaven
again, do not, I pray you, forget that I treated you politely when you
were prostrate."The Tail of a Lion

There is no saying more degrading than this: "It is better to be the
tail of a lion than the head of a dog."It is a responsibility to think
and act for yourself.Most people hate responsibility; therefore they
join something and become the tail of some lion.They say, "My party
can act for me--my church can do my thinking.It is enough for me to
pay taxes and obey the lion to which I belong, without troubling myself
about the right, the wrong, or the why or the wherefore."While the Preachers Talked the People Slept

The fact is, the old ideas became a little monotonous to the people.The
fall of man, the scheme of redemption and irresistible grace, began
to have a familiar sound.The preachers told the old stories while the
congregations slept.Some of the ministers became tired of these stories
themselves.The five points grew dull, and they felt that nothing short
of irresistible grace could bear this endless repetition.The outside
world was full of progress, and in every direction men advanced, while
the church, anchored to a creed, idly rotted at the shore.Christianity no Friend to Progress

Christianity has always opposed every forward movement of the human
race.Across the highway of progress it has always been building
breastworks of bibles, tracts, commentaries, prayer-books, creeds,
dogmas and platforms, and at every advance the Christians have gathered
together behind these heaps of rubbish and shot the poisoned arrows of
malice at the soldiers of freedom.You may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into
a deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be
crowned and glorified in the next.You will also have the pleasure of
hearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here.While you
will not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to
smilingly express your entire acquiescence in the will of God.The one was lost, and the other has not
been found.The Real Eden is Beyond

Nations and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms.The intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass.Ideals grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy
becomes less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the
years sweep on.The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are
behind us and the real Eden is beyond.It is said that a desire for
knowledge lost us the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not,
it will certainly give us the Eden of the future.Party Names Belittle Men

Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics,
Presbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and
women.After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.All
other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,
given up our individuality.A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS




507.On which of the six days was he
created?Is it possible that God would make a successful
rival?He must have known that Adam and Eve would fall.He knew what
a snake with a "spotted, dappled skin" could do with an inexperienced
woman.He knew that if the serpent
got into the garden, Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive
them out, that afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he
himself would die upon the cross.Must We Believe Fables to be Good and True?Must we, in order to be
good, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that the creation of woman
was a second thought?That Jehovah really endeavored to induce Adam to
take one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?After all, is it
not possible to live honest and courageous lives without believing these
fables?Why was not the serpent kept out of the garden?Why did not the Lord God
take him by the tail and snap his head off?Why did he not put Adam
and Eve on their guard about this serpent?They, of course, were not
acquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing about the serpent's
reputation.Questions About the Ark

How was the ark kept clean?We know how it was ventilated; but what
was done with the filth?How were some
portions of the ark heated for animals from the tropics, and others
kept cool for the polar bears?How did the animals get back to their
respective countries?Some had to creep back about six thousand miles,
and they could only go a few feet a day.Some of the creeping things
must have started for the ark just as soon as they were made, and kept
up a steady jog for sixteen hundred years.Think of a couple of the
slowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting for the
plains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles.Going at the rate
rate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years.Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and
so sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon
their health.Of course, all the polar
bears did not go.It could be confounded only by the
destruction of memory.Did God destroy the memory of mankind at
that time, and if so, how?Did he paralyze that portion of the brain
presiding over the organs of articulation, so that they could not speak
the words, although they remembered them clearly, or did he so touch
the brain that they could not hear?Will some theologian, versed in
the machinery of the miraculous, tell us in what way God confounded the
language of mankind?Would God Kill a Man for Making Ointment?Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man
to be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment?We are told in
the thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take
myrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a
holy ointment for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables,
candlesticks and other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying,
at the same time, that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put
any of it on a stranger, should be put to death.In the same chapter,
the Lord furnishes Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying,
that whoever should make any which smelled like it, should be cut off
from his people.This, to me, sounds so unreasonable that I cannot
believe it.Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep
are?Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the
earth that he used on the occasion of the flood.How did these waters
happen to run up hill?Would a Real God Uphold Slavery?Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of
others?Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a
legal tender for labor performed?Must we regard the auction block as an
altar?Were the
stealers and whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?Will some minister, who now believes in religious liberty, and
eloquently denounces the intolerance of Catholicism, explain these
things; will he tell us why he worships an intolerant God?Is a god who
will burn a soul forever in another world, better than a christian who
burns the body for a few hours in this?Do the angels all discuss questions on the same side?Are all the
investigators in perdition?Will the penitent thief, winged and crowned,
laugh at the honest folks in hell?Will the agony of the damned increase
or decrease the happiness of God?Will there be, in the universe, an
eternal _auto da fe_?Why should a believer in God hate an atheist?Surely the atheist has
not injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and
entitled to all the rights of man.Would it not be far better to treat
this atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?ORIENT PEARLS AS RANDOM STRUNG

I do not believe that Christians are as bad as their creeds.The highest crime against a creed is to change it.A believer is a bird in a cage, a free-thinker is an eagle parting the
clouds with tireless wing.All that is good in our civilization is the result of commerce, climate,
soil, geographical position.The heretics have not thought and suffered and died in vain.Every
heretic has been, and is, a ray of light.No man ever seriously attempted to reform a Church without being cast
out and hunted down by the hounds of hypocrisy.After all, the poorest bargain that a human being can make, is to give
his individuality for what is called respectability.On every hand are the enemies of individuality and mental freedom.Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.There can be nothing more utterly subversive of all that is really
valuable than the suppression of honest thought.No man, worthy of the form he bears, will at the command of Church or
State solemnly repeat a creed his reason scorns.Although we live in what is called a free government,--and politically
we are free,--there is but little religious liberty in America.According to orthodox logic, God having furnished us with imperfect
minds, has a right to demand a perfect result.Nearly all people stand in great horror of annihilation, and yet to give
up your individuality is to annihilate yourself.When women reason, and babes sit in the lap of philosophy, the victory
of reason over the shadowy host of darkness will be complete.Of all the religions that have been produced by the egotism, the malice,
the ignorance and ambition of man, Presbyterianism is the most hideous.And what man who really thinks can help repeating the words of Ennius:
"If there are gods they certainly pay no attention to the affairs of
man."Events, like the pendulum of a clock have swung forward and backward,
but after all, man, like the hands, has gone steadily on.In spite of Church and dogma, there have been millions and millions of
men and women true to the loftiest and most generous promptings of the
human heart.I was taught to hate Catholicism with every drop of my blood, it is only
justice to say, that in all essential particulars it is precisely the
same as every other religion.Wherever brave blood has been shed, the sword of the Church has been
wet.On every chain has been the sign of the cross.The altar and throne
have leaned against and supported each other.We have all been taught by the Church that nothing is so well calculated
to excite the ire of the Deity as to express a doubt as to his
existence, and that to deny it is an unpardonable sin.Universal obedience is universal stagnation; disobedience is one of the
conditions of progress.Select any age of the world and tell me what
would have been the effect of implicit obedience.We have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen
is allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all
religions and deny the existence of all gods.Whatever may be the truth upon any subject has nothing to do with our
right to investigate that subject, and express any opinion we may form.All that I ask, is the same right I freely accord to all others.Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his
intellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.In this
sense, every church is a cemetery and every creed an epitaph.Think of reading the 109th Psalm to a heathen who has a Bible of his own
in which is found this passage: "Blessed is the man and beloved of all
the gods, who is afraid of no man, and of whom no man is afraid."The trouble with most people is, they bow to what is called authority;
they have a certain reverence for the old because it is old.They think
a man is better for being dead, especially if he has been dead a long
time.We should all remember that to be like other people is to be unlike
ourselves, and that nothing can be more detestable in character than
servile imitation.The great trouble with imitation is, that we are apt
to ape those who are in reality far below us.Suppose the Church had had absolute control of the human mind at any
time, would not the words liberty and progress have been blotted from
human speech?In defiance of advice, the world has advanced.Over every fortress of tyranny has waved, and still waves, the banner of
the Church.The Church has won no victories for the rights of man.We have advanced in spite of religious zeal, ignorance, and opposition.Luther labored to reform the Church--Voltaire, to reform men.There have been, and still are, too many men who own themselves--too
much thought, too much knowledge for the Church to grasp again the
sword of power.For the Eg-lon of superstition
Science has a message from Truth.It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality
enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions,--some one
who had the grandeur to say his say."The Church says the earth is flat; but I have seen its shadow on the
moon, and I have more confidence even in a shadow than in the Church.""On the prow of his ship were disobedience, defiance, scorn, and
success.INGERSOLL'S ORATION AT HIS BROTHER'S GRAVE

     A Tribute to Ebon C. Ingersoll, by his Brother
     Robert--The Record of a Generous Life Runs
     Like a  Vine Around the Memory of our
     Dead,   and   Every   Sweet,   Unselfish
     Act is Now a Perfumed Flower.Dear Friends: I am going to do that which the dead oft promised he would
do for me.The loved and loving brother, husband, father, friend, died where
manhood's morning almost touches noon, and while the shadows still were
falling toward the west.He had not passed on life's highway the stone that marks the highest
point; but, being weary for a moment, he lay down by the wayside, and,
using his burden for a pillow, fell into that dreamless sleep that
kisses down his eyelids still.While yet in love with life and raptured
with the world, he passed to silence and pathetic dust.Yet, after all, it may be best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour
of all the voyage, while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash
against the unseen rock, and in an instant hear the billows roar above a
sunken ship For whether in mid sea or '<DW41> the breakers of the farther
shore, a wreck at last must mark the end of each and all.And every
life, no matter if its every hour is rich with love and every moment
jeweled with a joy, will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep
and dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery and death.This brave and tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock; but
in the sunshine he was vine and flower.He was the friend of all heroic
souls.He climbed the heights, and left all superstitions far below,
while on his forehead fell the golden dawning of the grander day.He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form, and music touched to
tears.He sided with the weak, the poor, and wronged, and lovingly
gave alms.With loyal heart and with the purest hands he faithfully
discharged all public trusts.He was a worshiper of liberty, a friend of the oppressed.A thousand
times I have heard him quote these words: "For Justice all place a
temple, and all season, summer."He believed that happiness was the only
good, reason the only torch, justice the only worship, humanity the only
religion, and love the only priest.He added to the sum of human joy;
and were every one to whom he did some loving service to bring a blossom
to his grave, he would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of sweet
flowers.Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two
eternities.We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.We cry aloud,
and the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.From the voiceless
lips of the unreplying dead there comes no word; but in the night of
death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.He who sleeps here, when dying, mistaking the approach of death for the
return of health, whispered with his latest breath, "I am better now."Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears and tears, that
these dear words are true of all the countless dead.And now, to you, who have been chosen, from among the many men he loved,
to do the last sad office for the dead, we give his sacred dust.There was, there is, no gentler,
stronger, manlier man.INGERSOLL'S DREAM OF THE WAR

     The Following Words of Matchless Eloquence were
     Addressed by Col.Ingersoll to the Veteran
     Soldiers of Indianapolis.The past, as it were, rises before me like a dream.Again we are in the
great struggle for national life.We hear the sound of preparation--the
music of the boisterous drums--the silver voices of heroic bugles.We
see thousands of assemblages, and hear the appeals of orators; we see
the pale cheeks of women, and the flushed faces of men; and in those
assemblages we see all the dead whose dust we have covered with flowers.We are with them when they enlist in the
great army of freedom.Some are
walking for the last time in quiet, woody places with the maidens they
adore.We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of eternal love as
they lingeringly part forever.Others are bending over cradles kissing
babes that are asleep.Some are parting with
mothers who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again,
and say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with
brave words spoken in the old tones to drive away the awful fear.We see the wife standing in the door with the babe in her
arms--standing in the sunlight sobbing--at the turn of the road a hand
waves--she answers by holding high in her loving hands the child.We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting flags,
keeping time to the wild music of war--marching down the streets of the
great cities--through the towns and across the prairies--down to the
fields of glory, and do and to die for the eternal right.We are by their side on all the gory
fields, in all the hospitals of pain--on all the weary marches.We stand
guard with them in the wild storm and under the quiet stars.We are with
them in ravines running with blood--in the furrows of old fields.We are
with them between contending hosts, unable to move, wild with thirst,
the life ebbing slowly away among the withered leaves.We see them
pierced by balls and torn with shells in the trenches of forts, and in
the whirlwind of the charge, where men become iron with nerves of steel.We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine, but human speech
can never tell what they endured.We are at home when the news comes that they are dead.We see the maiden
in the shadow of her sorrow.We see the silvered head of the old man
bowed with the last grief.The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings
governed by the lash--we see them bound hand and foot--we hear the
strokes of cruel whips--we see the hounds tracking women through
tangled swamps.We see babes sold from the breasts of mothers.Four million bodies in chains--four million souls in fetters.All the
sacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the
brutal feet of might.All this was done under our own beautiful banner
of the free.We hear the roar and shriek of the bursting
shell.Instead of
slaves we see men and women and children.The wand of progress touches
the auction-block, the slave-pen, and the whipping-post, and we see
homes and firesides, and school-houses and books, and where all was want
and crime, and cruelty and fear, we see the faces of the free.They died for liberty--they died for us.They
are at rest, They sleep in the land they made free, under the flag
they rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, the
tearful willows, the embracing vines.They sleep beneath the shadows of
the clouds, careless alike of sunshine or storm, each in the window-less
palace of rest.Earth may run red with other wars--they are at peace.In
the midst of battle, in the roar of conflict, they found the serenity of
death.I have one sentiment for the soldiers living and dead--cheers for
the living and tears for the dead.It is not necessary to be a pig in order to raise one.A blow from a parent leaves a scar on the soul of the child.A mortgage casts a shadow on the sunniest field.Agriculture is the basis of all wealth.It is better to be a whole farmer than part of a mechanic.One good school-master is worth a thousand priests.Out in the intellectual sea there is room for every sail.An honest God is the noblest work of man.A King is a non-producing thief, sitting on a throne, surrounded by
vermin.Whiskey is the son of villainies, the father of all crimes, the mother
of all abominations, the devil's best friend, and God's worst enemy.An Orthodox Man is a gentleman petrified in his mind.Chicago is a marvel of energy, a miracle of nerva

The Pulpit is a pillory.Civilization is the Child of Forethought

Prejudice is the Child of Ignorance.I believe in the democracy of the fireside, in the republicanism of the
home.I believe in truth, in
investigation, in forethought.I believe in the gospel of education, of cheerfulness, of justice and
intelligence.The major was not to be seen anywhere, nor to this day has Jimmieboy
ever again set eyes upon him.Transcriber's Note:

    ejaculated the Parallelopipedon?_Military music is heard in the distance, nearing._

PIERRE

Yes, according to the assignment, it is the Ninth Regiment.EMIL GRELIEU

Let us hear it, Pierre.There it starts on the right, and there it dies down._They listen._

But they are brave fellows!François looks at them
askance and tries in vain to hear.The music begins to die out._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Walking away from the window._

Yesterday they played the "Marseillaise."_Emil Grelieu's wife enters quickly._

JEANNE

Do you hear it?Even our refugees smiled when
they heard it.Emil, I have brought you some telegrams, here.EMIL GRELIEU

What is it?_Reading the telegrams, he staggers to an armchair and sinks
into it.He turns pale._

PIERRE

What is it, father?EMIL GRELIEU

Read!_Pierre reads it over the shoulder of his father.The woman
looks at them with an enigmatical expression upon her face.She sits calmly, her beautiful head thrown back.Emil Grelieu
rises quickly, and both he and his son start to pace the room in
opposite directions._

PIERRE

Do you see?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes!JEANNE

_As though indifferently._

Emil, was that an interesting library which they have destroyed?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, very.JEANNE

Oh, I speak only of those books!Tell me, were there many books
there?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, many, many!JEANNE

And they've burned them?_She hums softly in afresh, strong voice._

"Only the halo of the arts crowns law, liberty, and the
King!--Law--"

EMIL GRELIEU

Books, books.JEANNE

And there was also a Cathedral there.Isn't
it true, Emil, that it was a beautiful structure?_Hums._

"Law, liberty, and the King--"

PIERRE

Father!EMIL GRELIEU

_He walks up and down the room._

JEANNE

Pierre, it will soon be time for you to leave.I'll give you
something to eat at once.Pierre, do you think it is true that
they are killing women and children?PIERRE

It is true, mother.EMIL GRELIEU

How can you say it, Jeanne?JEANNE

I say this on account of the children.Yes, there they write
that they are killing children, so they write there.And
all this was crowded upon that little slip of paper--and the
children, as well as the fire--

_Rises quickly and walks away, humming._

EMIL GRELIEU

Where are you going, Jeanne?JEANNE

Nowhere in particular._Without turning around, François walks out, his shoulders bent.Jeanne goes to the other door with a strange
half-smile._

PIERRE

Mamma!JEANNE

I will return directly.EMIL GRELIEU

What shall I call them?My dear Pierre, my
boy, what shall I call them?PIERRE

You are greatly agitated, father.EMIL GRELIEU

I have always thought, I have always been convinced that words
were at my command, but here I stand before this monstrous,
inexplicable--I don't know, I don't know what to call them.My
heart is crying out, I hear its voice, but the word!Pierre,
you are a student, you are young, your words are direct and
pure--Pierre, find the word!PIERRE

You want me to find it, father?Yes, I was a student, and I knew
certain words: Peace, Right, Humanity.My heart
is crying too, but I do not know what to call these scoundrels.EMIL GRELIEU

That is not strong enough.Pierre, I have decided--

PIERRE

Decided?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, I am going.EMIL GRELIEU

I decided to do it several days ago--even then, at the very
beginning.And I really don't know why I--.Oh, yes, I had to
overcome within me--my love for flowers._Ironically._

Yes, Pierre, my love for flowers.Oh, my boy, it is so hard to
change from flowers to iron and blood!PIERRE

Father, I dare not contradict you.EMIL GRELIEU

No, no, you dare not.Listen, Pierre, you
must examine me as a physician.PIERRE

I am only a student, father.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, but you know enough to say--.You see, Pierre, I must
not burden our little army with a single superfluous sick or
weak man.I must bring with me strength and
power, not shattered health.And I am asking
you, Pierre, to examine me, simply as a physician, as a young
physician.Must I
take this off, or can you do it without removing this?PIERRE

It can be done this way.EMIL GRELIEU

I think so, too.And--must I tell you everything, or--?At any
rate, I will tell you that I have not had any serious ailments,
and for my years I am a rather strong, healthy man.You know
what a life I am leading.PIERRE

That is unnecessary, father.EMIL GRELIEU

It is necessary.I want to say that in my
life there were none of those unwholesome--and bad excesses.Oh,
the devil take it, how hard it is to speak of it.PIERRE

Papa, I know all this.Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

But it is necessary to take my pulse, Pierre, I beg of you.PIERRE

_Smiling faintly._

It isn't necessary to do even that.As a physician, I can tell
you that you are healthy, but--you are unfit for war, you are
unfit for war, father!I am listening to you and I feel like
crying, father.EMIL GRELIEU

_Thoughtfully._

Yes, yes.Do you think,
Pierre, that I should not kill?Pierre, you think, that I, Emil
Grelieu, must not kill under any circumstances and at any time?PIERRE

_Softly._

I dare not touch upon your conscience, father.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, that is a terrible question for a man.Of course, I could take your gun, but not to fire--no,
that would have been disgusting, a sacrilegious deception!When
my humble people are condemned to kill, who am I that I should
keep my hands clean?That would be disgusting cleanliness,
obnoxious saintliness.My humble nation did not desire to kill,
but it was forced, and it has become a murderer.So I, too, must
become a murderer, together with my nation.Upon whose shoulders
will I place the sin--upon the shoulders of our youths and
children?And if ever the Higher Conscience of the
world will call my dear people to the terrible accounting, if
it will call you and Maurice, my children, and will say to you:
"What have you done?I will come forward and
will say: "First you must judge me; I have also murdered--and
you know that I am an honest man!"_Pierre sits motionless, his face covered with his hands.Enter
Jeanne, unnoticed._

PIERRE

_Uncovering his face._

But you must not die!EMIL GRELIEU

_Loudly, and with contempt._

Oh, death!Jeanne sits down and
speaks in the same tone of strange, almost cheerful calm._

JEANNE

Emil, she is here again.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes?JEANNE

She does not know herself.Emil, her dress and her hands were in
blood.EMIL GRELIEU

She is wounded?JEANNE

No, it is not her own blood, and by the color I could not tell
whose blood it is.PIERRE

Who is that, mother?I have combed her hair and
put a clean dress on her.Emil, I have
heard something--I understand that you want to go--?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.JEANNE

Together with your children, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.Pierre has examined me and finds that I am fit to enter the
ranks.JEANNE

You intend to go tomorrow?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.JEANNE

You cannot manage it today.Pierre, you have only an hour and a
half left._Silence._

PIERRE

Mamma!Tell him that he must not--Forgive me, father!--that he
should not go.He has given
to the nation his two sons--what more should he give?JEANNE

More, Pierre?PIERRE

Yes,--his life.You love him; you, yourself, would die if he
were killed--tell him that, mother!JEANNE

Yes, I love him.PIERRE

Oh, what are we, Maurice and I?Just as they have no
right to destroy temples in war or to bum libraries, just as
they have no right to touch the eternal, so he--he--has no right
to die.I am speaking not as your son, no; but to kill Emil
Grelieu--that would be worse than to bum books.Listen to me!--although I
am young and should be silent--Listen to me!They have deprived us of our land and of the air;
they have destroyed our treasures which have been created
by the genius of our people, and now we would cast our best
men into their jaws!Let them kill us all, let our land be turned into a waste
desert, let all living creatures be burned to death, but as long
as he lives, Belgium is alive!Oh,
do not be silent, mother!_Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Somewhat sternly._

Calm yourself, Pierre!JEANNE

Yesterday I--no, Pierre, that isn't what I was going to say--I
don't know anything about it.But yesterday
I--it is hard to get vegetables, and even bread, here--so I went
to town, and for some reason we did not go in that direction,
but nearer the field of battle--.How strange it is that we
found ourselves there!And there I saw them coming--

EMIL GRELIEU

Whom?They were coming from there--where the battle
raged for four days.There were not many of them--about a
hundred or two hundred.But we all--there were so many people in
the streets--we all stepped back to the wall in order to make
way for them.Emil, just think of it; how strange!They did not
see us, and we would have been in their way!They were black
from smoke, from mud, from dried blood, and they were swaying
from fatigue.But that is
nothing, that is all nothing.They did not see their surroundings, they still reflected that
which they had seen there--fire and smoke and death--and what
else?Some one said: "Here are people returning from hell."We
all bowed to them, we bowed to them, but they did not see that
either.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, Jeanne, that is possible.PIERRE

And he will go to that inferno?Emil Grelieu walks over to his wife and kisses her
hand.Suddenly she rises._

JEANNE

Forgive me; there is something else I must say--

_She moves quickly and lightly, but suddenly, as though
stumbling over an invisible obstacle, falls on one knee.Then
she tries to rise, kneels, pale and still smiling, bending to
one side.They rush over to her and lift her from the ground._

PIERRE

Mamma!EMIL GRELIEU

You have a headache?Jeanne, my dearest, what ails you?_She pushes them aside, stands up firmly, trying to conceal her
nervousness._

JEANNE

What is it?My foot
slipped--you know, the one that pained me.EMIL GRELIEU

A glass of water, Pierre.Jeanne sits down, hangs her
head, as one guilty, endeavoring not to look into his eyes._

JEANNE

What an excitable youth--your Pierre!EMIL GRELIEU

_Significantly._

Jeanne!No, no--why do you look at me this way?_Pierre brings her water, but Jeanne does not drink it._

JEANNE

Thank you, Pierre, but I don't want it._Silence._

How fragrant the flowers are.Pierre, please give me that
rose--yes, that one.How fresh it is, Emil, and what
a fine fragrance--come over here, Emil!_Emil Grelieu goes over to her and kisses the hand in which she
holds the rose.Looks at her._

JEANNE

_Lowering her hand._

No; I have asked for this flower simply because its fragrance
seems to me immortal--it is always the same--as the sky.How
strange it is, always the same.And when you bring it close to
your face, and close to your eyes, it seems to you that there is
nothing except this red rose and the blue sky.Nothing but the
red rose and the distant, pale--very pale--blue sky....

EMIL GRELIEU

Pierre!People speak of this only at
night, when they are alone with their souls--and she knows it,
but you do not know it yet.JEANNE

_Trembling, opening her eyes._

Yes, I know, Emil.EMIL GRELIEU

The life of the poet does not belong to him.The roof over the
heads of people, which shelters them--all that is a phantom for
me, and my life does not belong to me.I am always far away, not
here--I am always where I am not.You think of finding me among
the living, while I am dead; you are afraid of finding me in
death, mute, cold, doomed to decay, while I live and sing aloud
from my grave.Death which makes people mute, which leaves the
imprint of silence upon the bravest lips, restores the voice
to the poet.Am I--just think of it, Pierre, my boy,--am I to fear
death when in my most persistent searches I could not find the
boundary between life and death, when in my feelings I mix life
and death into one--as two strong, rare kinds of wine?Emil Grelieu looks at his son, smiling.Pierre has
covered his face with his hands.She turns her eyes from her weeping son to her husband._

PIERRE

_Uncovering his face._

Forgive me, father!JEANNE

Take this rose, Pierre, and when it fades and falls apart tear
down another rose--it will have the same fragrance as this one.You are a foolish little boy, Pierre, but I am also foolish,
although Emil is so kind that he thinks differently.Will you be
in the same regiment, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

No, hardly, Jeanne.PIERRE

Father, it is better that we be in the same regiment.I will
arrange it, father--will you permit me?And I will teach you how
to march--.You know, I am going to be your superior officer.EMIL GRELIEU

_Smiling._

Very well.JEANNE

_Goes out singing in a low voice._

"Only the halo of the arts is crowning--law, liberty, and the
King."Look, Pierre, here is the girl you
wished to see.Come in, come in, my dear child!He is a very good man
and will do you no harm._A girl enters; she is frail, very pale, and beautiful.She
wears a black dress, her hair is combed neatly, and she is
modest in her demeanor.She
is followed by the chambermaid, Silvina, a kind, elderly woman
in a white cap; by Madame Henrietta, and another woman in the
service of the Grelieu household.They stop at the threshold
and watch the girl curiously.The elder woman is weeping as she
looks at her._

GIRL

_Stretching forth her hand to Pierre._

Oh, that is a soldier!Be so kind, soldier, tell me how to go to
Lonua.PIERRE

_Confused._

I do not know, Mademoiselle.GIRL

_Looking at everybody mournfully._

Who knows?JEANNE

_Cautiously and tenderly leading her to a seat._

Sit down, child, take a rest, my dear, give your poor feet a
rest.Pierre, her feet are wounded, yet she wants to walk all
the time.ELDERLY WOMAN

I wanted to stop her, Monsieur Pierre, but it is impossible to
stop her.If we close the door before her the poor girl beats
her head against the walls, like a bird in a cage.François enters from the garden and occupies
himself again with the flowers.He glances at the girl from time
to time.It is evident that he is making painful efforts to hear
and understand what is going on._

GIRL

It is time for me to go.JEANNE

Rest yourself, here, my child!At night it
is so terrible on the roads.There, in the dark air, bullets are
buzzing instead of our dear bees; there wicked people, vicious
beasts are roaming.And there is no one who can tell you, for
there is no one who knows how to go to Lonua.GIRL

Don't you know how I could find my way to Lonua?PIERRE

_Softly._

What is she asking?Emil GRELIEU

Oh, you may speak louder; she can hear as little as François.She is asking about the village which the Prussians have set on
fire.Her home used to be there--now there are only ruins and
corpses there.There is no road that leads to Lonua!GIRL

Don't you know it, either?I have asked everybody,
and no one can tell me how to find my way to Lonua._She rises quickly and walks over to François._

Tell me; you are kindhearted!Don't you know the way to Lonua?_François looks at her intently.Silently he turns away and
walks out, stooping._

JEANNE

_Seating her again._

Sit down, little girl.GIRL

_Sadly._

I am asking, and they are silent.EMIL GRELIEU

I suppose she is also asking the bodies of the dead that lie in
the fields and in the ditches how to go to Lonua.JEANNE

Her hands and her dress were bloodstained.I will hold you in my arms,
and you will feel better and more comfortable, my little child.GIRL

_Softly._

Tell me, how can I find my way to Lonua?JEANNE

Yes, yes, come!Emil, I will go with her to my room.Emil Grelieu and
Pierre remain._

EMIL GRELIEU

Lonua!A quiet little village which no one ever noticed
before--houses, trees, and flowers.Who knows
the way to that little village?Pierre, the soul of our people
is roaming about in the watches of the night, asking the dead
how to find the way to Lonua!Pierre, I cannot endure it any
longer!Oh, weep,
you German Nation--bitter will be the fate of your children,
terrible will be your disgrace before the judgment of the free
nations!_Curtain_



SCENE III


_Night.The dark silhouette of Emil Grelieu's villa stands
out in the background.The gatekeeper's house is seen among
the trees, a dim light in the window.At the cast-iron fence
frightened women are huddled together, watching the fire in the
distance.An alarming redness has covered the sky; only in the
zenith is the sky dark.The reflection of the fire falls upon
objects and people, casting strange shadows against the mirrors
of the mute and dark villa.The voices sound muffled and timid;
there are frequent pauses and prolonged sighs.HENRIETTA

My God, my God!It is burning and burning,
and there is no end to the fire!SECOND WOMAN

Yesterday it was burning further away, and tonight the fire is
nearer.HENRIETTA

It is burning and burning, there is no end to the fire!Today
the sun was covered in a mist.SECOND WOMAN

It is forever burning, and the sun is growing ever darker!Now
it is lighter at night than in the daytime!SILVINA

I am afraid!HENRIETTA

Be silent, Silvina, be silent!_Silence._

SECOND WOMAN

I can't hear a sound.If I close my eyes
it seems to me that nothing is going on there.HENRIETTA

I can see all that is going on there even with my eyes closed.SILVINA

Oh, I am afraid!SECOND WOMAN

Where is it burning?HENRIETTA

I don't know.It is burning and burning, and there is no end to
the fire!It may be that they have all perished by this time.It may be that something terrible is going on there, and we are
looking on and know nothing._A fourth woman approaches them quietly._

FOURTH WOMAN

Good evening!SILVINA

_With restraint._

Oh!HENRIETTA

Oh, you have frightened us!FOURTH WOMAN

Good evening, Madame Henrietta!Never mind my coming here--it
is terrible to stay in the house!I guessed that you were not
sleeping, but here, watching.And we can't hear a sound--how quiet!HENRIETTA

It is burning and burning.Haven't you heard anything about your
husband?FOURTH WOMAN

No, nothing.HENRIETTA

And with whom are your children just now?FOURTH WOMAN

Alone.Is it true that Monsieur Pierre was
killed?HENRIETTA

_Agitated._

Just imagine!I simply cannot understand what is
going on!You see, there is no one in the house now, and we are
afraid to sleep there--

SECOND WOMAN

The three of us sleep here, in the gatekeeper's house.HENRIETTA

I am afraid to look into that house even in the daytime--the
house is so large and so empty!And there are no men there, not
a soul--

FOURTH WOMAN

Is it true that François has gone to shoot the Prussians?Everybody is talking about it, but we don't know.He
disappeared quietly, like a mouse.FOURTH WOMAN

He will be hanged--the Prussians hang such people!HENRIETTA

Wait, wait!Today, while I was in the garden, I heard the
telephone ringing in the house; it was ringing for a long time.I was frightened, but I went in after all--and, just think of
it!Some one said: "Monsieur Pierre was killed!"SECOND WOMAN

And nothing more?HENRIETTA

Nothing more; not a word!I felt so bad
and was so frightened that I could hardly run out.Now I will
not enter that house for anything!FOURTH WOMAN

Whose voice was it?SECOND WOMAN

Madame Henrietta says it was an unfamiliar voice.HENRIETTA

Yes, an unfamiliar voice.There seems to be a light in the windows of the
house--somebody is there!SILVINA

Oh, I am afraid!HENRIETTA

Oh, what are you saying; what are you saying?SECOND WOMAN

That's from the redness of the sky!FOURTH WOMAN

What if some one is ringing there again?HENRIETTA

How is that possible?Silence._

SECOND WOMAN

What will become of us?They are coming this way, and there is
nothing that can stop them!FOURTH WOMAN

I wish I might die now!When you are dead, you don't hear or see
anything.HENRIETTA

It keeps on all night like this--it is burning and burning!And
in the daytime it will again be hard to see things on account of
the smoke; and the bread will smell of burning!FOURTH WOMAN

They have killed Monsieur Pierre.SECOND WOMAN

They have killed him?SILVINA

You must not speak of it!_Weeps softly._

FOURTH WOMAN

They say there are twenty millions of them, and they have
already set Paris on fire.They say they have cannon which can
hit a hundred kilometers away.HENRIETTA

My God, my God!SECOND WOMAN

Merciful God, have pity on us!FOURTH WOMAN

And they are flying and they are hurling bombs from
airships--terrible bombs, which destroy entire cities!HENRIETTA

My God!Before this You were
alone in the sky, and now those base Prussians are there too!SECOND WOMAN

Before this, when my soul wanted rest and joy I looked at the
sky, but now there is no place where a poor soul can find rest
and joy!FOURTH WOMAN

They have taken everything away from our Belgium--even the sky!Don't you think that now my husband, my husband--

HENRIETTA

No, no!FOURTH WOMAN

Why is the sky so red?SECOND WOMAN

Have mercy on us, O God!The redness of the flames seems to be swaying over the
earth._

_Curtain_



SCENE IV


_Dawn.The sun has already risen, but it is hidden behind the
heavy mist and smoke._

_A large room in Emil Grelieu's villa, which has been turned
into a sickroom.There are two wounded there, Grelieu himself,
with a serious wound in his shoulder, and his son Maurice, with
a light wound on his right arm.The large window, covered with
half transparent curtains, admits a faint bluish light.In an armchair at the bedside of
Grelieu there is a motionless figure in white, Jeanne_.EMIL GRELIEU

_Softly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

Shall I give you some water?EMIL GRELIEU

No.JEANNE

Oh, no, not at all.Can't you fall
asleep, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

What time is it?_She goes over to the window quietly, and pushing the curtain
aside slightly, looks at her little watch.Then she returns just
as quietly._

JEANNE

It is still early.Perhaps you will try to fall asleep, Emil?It
seems to me that you have been suffering great pain; you have
been groaning all night.EMIL GRELIEU

No, I am feeling better.JEANNE

Nasty weather, Emil; you can't see the sun.Suddenly Maurice utters a cry in his sleep; the cry
turns into a groan and indistinct mumbling.Jeanne walks over to
him and listens, then returns to her seat._

EMIL GRELIEU

Is the boy getting on well?JEANNE

Don't worry, Emil.He only said a few words in his sleep.EMIL GRELIEU

He has done it several times tonight.JEANNE

I am afraid that he is disturbing you.We can have him removed
to another room and Henrietta will stay with him.The boy's
blood is in good condition.In another week, I believe, we shall
be able to remove the bandage from his arm.EMIL GRELIEU

No, let him stay here, Jeanne.JEANNE

What is it, my dear?_She kneels at his bed and kisses his hand carefully._

EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

I think your fever has gone down, my dear._Impresses another kiss upon his hand and clings to it._

EMIL GRELIEU

You are my love, Jeanne.JEANNE

Do not speak, do not speak._A brief moment of silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Moving his head restlessly._

It is so hard to breathe here, the air----

JEANNE

The window has been open all night, my dear.There is not a
breeze outside.EMIL GRELIEU

There is smoke.MAURICE

_Utters a cry once more, then mutters_--

Stop, stop, stop!_Again indistinctly._

It is burning, it is burning!Who is going to the battery,
who is going to the battery----

_He mutters and then grows silent._

EMIL GRELIEU

What painful dreams!JEANNE

That's nothing; the boy always used to talk in his sleep.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

What is it, my dear?EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne.... Are you thinking about Pierre?_Silence._

JEANNE

_Softly._

Don't speak of him.EMIL GRELIEU

You are right.JEANNE

_After a brief pause._

That's true.EMIL GRELIEU

We shall follow him later.He will not come here, but we shall
go to him.Do you
remember the red rose which you gave him?EMIL GRELIEU

It is so clear.You are the best woman in
the world._Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Tossing about in his bed._

It is so hard to breathe.JEANNE

My dear----

EMIL GRELIEU

No, that's nothing.Jeanne, was I
dreaming, or have I really heard cannonading?JEANNE

You really heard it, at about five o'clock.But very far away,
Emil--it was hardly audible.Close your eyes, my dear, rest
yourself._Silence_

MAURICE

_Faintly._

Mamma!_Jeanne walks over to him quietly._

JEANNE

Are you awake?JEANNE

He is awake.EMIL GRELIEU

Good morning, Maurice.MAURICE

Good morning, papa.EMIL GRELIEU

I, too, am feeling well.Jeanne, you may draw the curtain aside.Still it will be easier for you to
breathe when it is light._She draws the curtain aside slowly, so as not to make it too
light at once.Beyond the large window vague silhouettes of the
trees are seen at the window frames and several withered, bent
flowers.Maurice is trying to adjust the screen._

JEANNE

What are you doing, Maurice?MAURICE

My coat--Never mind, I'll fix it myself._Guiltily._

No, mamma, you had better help me.JEANNE

_Going behind the screen._

What a foolish boy you are, Maurice._Behind the screen._

Be careful, be careful, that's the way.MAURICE

_Behind the screen._

Pin this for me right here, as you did yesterday.JEANNE

_Behind the screen._

Of course._Maurice comes out, his right arm dressed in a bandage.He goes
over to his father and first kisses his hand, then, upon a sign
from his eyes, he kisses him on the lips._

EMIL GRELIEU

Good morning, good morning, my dear boy.MAURICE

_Looking around at the screen, where his mother is putting the
bed in order._

Papa, look!_He takes his hand out of the bandage and straightens it
quickly.Emil Grelieu
threatens him with his finger.Jeanne puts the screen aside, and
the bed is already in order._

JEANNE

I am through now.MAURICE

Oh, no; under no circumstances.Last
night I washed myself with my left hand and it was very fine._Walking over to the open window._

How nasty it is.These scoundrels have spoiled the day.Still,
it is warm and there is the smell of flowers.It's good, papa;
it is very fine.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, it is pleasant.MAURICE

Well, I am going.JEANNE

Clean your teeth; you didn't do it yesterday, Maurice._

What's the use of it now?_

Papa, do you know, well have good news today; I feel it._He is heard calling in a ringing voice, "Silvina."_

EMIL GRELIEU

I feel better.JEANNE

I'll let you have your coffee directly.You are looking much
better today, much better.EMIL GRELIEU

What is this?JEANNE

Perfume, with water.I'll bathe your face with it That's the
way.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.JEANNE

He didn't mean anything.He is very happy because he is a hero.EMIL GRELIEU

Do you know any news?JEANNE

_Irresolutely._

Nothing.EMIL GRELIEU

Tell me, Jeanne; you were firmer before.JEANNE

Was I firmer?Perhaps.... I have grown accustomed to talk to
you softly at night.Well--how shall I tell it to you?EMIL GRELIEU

Coming?Don't be excited, but I
think that it will be necessary for us to leave for Antwerp
today.EMIL GRELIEU

Are they near?JEANNE

Yes, they are near._Sings softly._

"Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté."I have not told you
that the King inquired yesterday about your health.I answered
that you were feeling better and that you will be able to leave
today.EMIL GRELIEU

Of course I am able to leave today.JEANNE

What did the King say?_Singing the same tune._

He said that their numbers were too great.EMIL GRELIEU

What else did he say?He said that there was a God and there was
righteousness.That's what I believe I heard him say--that there
was still a God and that righteousness was still in existence.But it is so good that they still
exist._Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, in the daytime you are so different.Where do you get so
much strength, Jeanne?EMIL GRELIEU

I am forever looking at your hair.I am wondering why it hasn't
turned gray.JEANNE

I dye it at night, Emil.Oh, yes, I haven't told you yet--some one
will be here to see you today--Secretary Lagard and some one
else by the name of Count Clairmont.EMIL GRELIEU

Count Clairmont?JEANNE

It is not necessary that you should know him.He is simply known
as Count Clairmont, Count Clairmont--.That's a good name for a
very good man.EMIL GRELIEU

I know a very good man in Belgium--

JEANNE

Tsh!You must only remember--Count
Clairmont.They have some important matters to discuss with you,
I believe.And they'll send you an automobile, to take you to
Antwerp.EMIL GRELIEU

_Smiling._

Count Clairmont?JEANNE

_Also smiling._

Yes.You are loved by everybody, but if I were a King, I would
have sent you an aeroplane._Throwing back her hands in sorrow which she is trying vainly to
suppress._

Ah, how good it would be now to rise from the ground and
fly--and fly for a long, long time._Enter Maurice._

MAURICE

I am ready now, I have cleaned my teeth.I've even taken a walk
in the garden.But I have never before noticed that we have such
a beautiful garden!JEANNE

Coffee will be ready directly.If he disturbs you with his talk,
call me, Emil.MAURICE

Oh, I did not mean to disturb you.I'll not
disturb you any more.EMIL GRELIEU

You may speak, speak.JEANNE

But you must save your strength, don't forget that, Emil._Exit._

MAURICE

_Sitting down quietly at the window._

Perhaps I really ought not to speak, papa?EMIL GRELIEU

_Smiling faintly._

Can you be silent?MAURICE

_Blushing._

No, father, I cannot just now.I suppose I seem to you very
young.EMIL GRELIEU

And what do you think of it yourself?MAURICE

_Blushing again._

I am no longer as young as I was three weeks ago.Yes, only
three weeks ago--I remember the tolling of the bells in our
church, I remember how I teased François.How strange that
François has been lost and no one knows where he is.What does
it mean that a human being is lost and no one knows where he is?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.But need an old
man love his fatherland less than I love it, for instance?The
old people love it even more intensely.I am not tiring you, am I?An old man came to us, he was
very feeble, he asked for bullets--well, let them hang me too--I
gave him bullets.A few of our regiment made sport of him, but
he said: "If only one Prussian bullet will strike me, it means
that the Prussians will have one bullet less."EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, that appeals to me, too.Have you heard the cannonading at
dawn?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.Did mamma tell you that they are
coming nearer and nearer?MAURICE

_Rising._

Really?EMIL GRELIEU

They are coming, and we must leave for Antwerp today._He rises and walks back and forth, forgetting his wounded arm.Clenches his fist._

MAURICE

Father, tell me: What do you think of the present state of
affairs?EMIL GRELIEU

Mamma says there is a God and there is righteousness.MAURICE

_Raising his hand._

Mamma says----Let God bless mamma!_His face twitches like a child's face.He is trying to repress
his tears._

MAURICE

I still owe them something for Pierre.Forgive me, father; I
don't know whether I have a right to say this or not, but I am
altogether different from you.It is wicked but I can't help it.I was looking this morning at your flowers in the garden and I
felt so sorry--sorry for you, because you had grown them.EMIL GRELIEU

Maurice!MAURICE

The scoundrels!I don't want to consider them human beings, and
I shall not consider them human beings._Enter Jeanne._

JEANNE

What is it, Maurice?_As he passes he embraces his mother with his left hand and
kisses her._

JEANNE

You had better sit down.It is dangerous for your health to walk
around this way.EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down, Maurice._Maurice sits down at the window facing the garden.Emil Grelieu
smiles sadly and closes his eyes.Silvina, the maid, brings in
coffee and sets it on the table near Grelieu's bed._

SILVINA

Good morning, Monsieur Emil.EMIL GRELIEU

_Opening his eyes._

Good morning, Silvina._Exit Silvina._

JEANNE

Go and have your breakfast, Maurice.MAURICE

_Without turning around._

I don't want any breakfast.Mamma, I'll take off my bandage
tomorrow.JEANNE

_Laughing._

Soldier, is it possible that you are capricious?Jeanne helps Emil Grelieu with his coffee._

JEANNE

That's the way.Is it convenient for you this way, or do you
want to drink it with a spoon?EMIL GRELIEU

Oh, my poor head, it is so weak--

MAURICE

_Going over to him._

Forgive me, father, I'll not do it any more.I was foolishly
excited, but do you know I could not endure it.May I have a
cup, mamma?JEANNE

Yes, this is yours.MAURICE

Yes, I do.EMIL GRELIEU

I am feeling perfectly well today, Jeanne.When is the bandage
to be changed?Count Clairmont will bring his surgeon along with him.MAURICE

Who is that, mamma?JEANNE

You'll see him.But, please, Maurice, when you see him, don't
open your mouth so wide.You have a habit--you open your mouth
and then you forget about it.MAURICE

_Blushing._

You are both looking at me and smiling._The sound of automobiles is heard._

JEANNE

_Rising quickly._

I think they are here.Maurice, this is only Count Clairmont,
don't forget.They will speak with you
about a very, very important matter, Emil, but you must not be
agitated.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, I know.JEANNE

_Kissing him quickly._

I am going._Exit, almost colliding with Silvina, who is excited._

MAURICE

_Whispering._

Who is it, Silvina?_Silvina makes some answer in mingled delight and awe.Maurice's
face assumes the same expression as Silvina's.Maurice walks quickly to the window and raises his left hand to
his forehead, straightening himself in military fashion.Thus he
stands until the others notice him._

_Enter Jeanne, Count Clairmont, followed by Secretary Lagard and
the Count's adjudant, an elderly General of stem appearance,
with numerous decorations upon his chest.The Count himself
is tall, well built and young, in a modest officer's uniform,
without any medals to signify his high station.He carries
himself very modestly, almost bashfully, but overcoming his
first uneasiness, he speaks warmly and powerfully and freely.All treat him with profound respect._

_Lagard is a strong old man with a leonine gray head.He speaks
simply, his gestures are calm and resolute.It is evident that
he is in the habit of speaking from a platform._

_Jeanne holds a large bouquet of flowers in her hands.Count
Clairmont walks directly toward Grelieu's bedside._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Confused._

I have come to shake hands with you, my dear master.Oh, but
do not make a single unnecessary movement, not a single one,
otherwise I shall be very unhappy!EMIL GRELIEU

I am deeply moved, I am happy.COUNT CLAIRMONT

No, no, don't speak that way.Here stands before you only a man
who has learned to think from your books.But see what they have
done to you--look, Lagard!LAGARD

How are you, Grelieu?I, too, want to shake your hand.Today I
am a Secretary by the will of Fate, but yesterday I was only a
physician, and I may congratulate you--you have a kind hand.GENERAL

_Coming forward modestly._

Allow me, too, in the name of this entire army of ours to
express to you our admiration, Monsieur Grelieu!EMIL GRELIEU

I thank you.COUNT CLAIRMONT

But perhaps it is necessary to have a surgeon?JEANNE

He can listen and talk, Count.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Noticing Maurice, confused._

Oh!Please put down your hand--you are wounded.MAURICE

I am so happy, Count.JEANNE

This is our second son.Our first son, Pierre, was killed at
Liège--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

I dare not console you, Madame Grelieu.Give me your hand,
Maurice.I dare not--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

My dear young man, I, too, am nothing but a soldier now.My children and my wife
have sent you flowers--but where are they?JEANNE

Here they are, Count.COUNT CLAIRMONT

Thank you.But I did not know that your flowers were better than
mine, for my flowers smell of smoke._To Count Clairmont._

His pulse is good.Grelieu, we have come to you not only to
express our sympathy.Through me all the working people of
Belgium are shaking your hand.EMIL GRELIEU

I am proud of it, Lagard.LAGARD

But we are just as proud.Yes; there is something we must
discuss with you.Count Clairmont did not wish to disturb you,
but I said: "Let him die, but before that we must speak to him."EMIL GRELIEU

I am not dying.Maurice, I think you had better go out.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Quickly._

Oh, no, no.He is your son, Grelieu, and he should be present to
hear what his father will say.Oh, I should have been proud to
have such a father.LAGARD

Our Count is a very fine young man--Pardon me, Count, I have
again upset our--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

That's nothing, I have already grown accustomed to it.Master,
it is necessary for you and your family to leave for Antwerp
today.EMIL GRELIEU

Are our affairs in such a critical condition?LAGARD

What is there to tell?That
horde of Huns is coming upon us like the tide of the sea.Today
they are still there, but tomorrow they will flood your house,
Grelieu.To what can we resort
in our defence?On this side are they, and there is the sea.Only very little is left of Belgium, Grelieu.Very soon there
will be no room even for my beard here.Dull sounds of cannonading are heard in the distance.All turn their eyes to the window._

EMIL GRELIEU

Is that a battle?COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Listening, calmly._

No, that is only the beginning.But tomorrow they will carry
their devilish weapons past your house.Do you know they are
real iron monsters, under whose weight our earth is quaking
and groaning.They are moving slowly, like amphibia that have
crawled out at night from the abyss--but they are moving!Another few days will pass, and they will crawl over to Antwerp,
they will turn their jaws to the city, to the churches--Woe to
Belgium, master!LAGARD

Yes, it is very bad.We are an honest and peaceful people
despising bloodshed, for war is such a stupid affair!And we
should not have had a single soldier long ago were it not for
this accursed neighbor, this den of murderers.GENERAL

And what would we have done without any soldiers, Monsieur
Lagard?LAGARD

And what can we do with soldiers, Monsieur General?COUNT CLAIRMONT

You are wrong, Lagard.With our little army there is still one
possibility--to die as freemen die.But without an army we would
have been bootblacks, Lagard!LAGARD

_Grumbling._

Well, I would not clean anybody's boots.Things are in bad
shape, Grelieu, in very bad shape.And there is but one remedy
left for us--.EMIL GRELIEU

I know.EMIL GRELIEU

The dam._Jeanne and Emil shudder and look at each other with terror in
their eyes._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

You shuddered, you are shuddering, madame.But what am I to do,
what are we to do, we who dare not shudder?JEANNE

Oh, I simply thought of a girl who was trying to find her way to
Lonua.She will never find her way to Lonua.COUNT CLAIRMONT

But what is to be done?The Count steps away to the window
and looks out, nervously twitching his mustaches.Maurice has
moved aside and, as before, stands at attention.Jeanne stands
a little distance away from him, with her shoulder leaning
against the wall, her beautiful pale head thrown back.Lagard is
sitting at the bedside as before, stroking his gray, disheveled
beard.The General is absorbed in gloomy thoughts._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Turning around resolutely._

I am a peaceful man, but I can understand why people take up
arms.That means a sword, a gun, explosive contrivances.Fire is killing people, but at the same time it
also gives light.There is something of the
ancient sacrifice in it.cold, dark, silent, covering
with mire, causing bodies to swell--water, which was the
beginning of chaos; water, which is guarding the earth by day
and night in order to rush upon it.My friend, believe me, I am
quite a daring man, but I am afraid of water!Lagard, what would
you say to that?LAGARD

We Belgians have too long been struggling against the water not
to have learned to fear it.JEANNE

But what is more terrible, the Prussians or water?GENERAL

_Bowing._

Madame is right.The Prussians are not more terrible, but they
are worse.It is terrible to release water
from captivity, the beast from its den, nevertheless it is a
better friend to us than the Prussians.I would prefer to see
the whole of Belgium covered with water rather than extend a
hand of reconciliation to a scoundrel!Neither they nor we shall
live to see that, even if the entire Atlantic Ocean rush over
our heads._Brief pause._

GENERAL

But I hope that we shall not come to that.Meanwhile it is
necessary for us to flood only part of our territory.JEANNE

_Her eyes closed, her head hanging down._

And what is to be done with those who could not abandon their
homes, who are deaf, who are sick and alone?_Silence._

JEANNE

There in the fields and in the ditches are the wounded.There
the shadows of people are wandering about, but in their veins
there is still warm blood.Oh, don't
look at me like that, Emil; you had better not listen to what I
am saying.I have spoken so only because my heart is wrung with
pain--it isn't necessary to listen to me at all, Count._Count Clairmont walks over to Grelieu's bed quickly and firmly.At first he speaks confusedly, seeking the right word; then he
speaks ever more boldly and firmly._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

My dear and honored master!We would not have dared to take
from you even a drop of your health, if--if it were not for the
assurance that serving your people may give new strength to your
heroic soul!Yesterday, it was resolved at our council to break
the dams and flood part of our kingdom, but I could not, I dared
not, give my full consent before I knew what you had to say to
this plan.I did not sleep all night long, thinking--oh, how
terrible, how inexpressibly sad my thoughts were!We are the
body, we are the hands, we are the head--while you, Grelieu, you
are the conscience of our people.Blinded by the war, we may
unwillingly, unwittingly, altogether against our will, violate
man-made laws.We are driven to despair, we have no Belgium any longer,
it is trampled by our enemies, but in your breast, Emil Grelieu,
the heart of all Belgium is beating--and your answer will be the
answer of our tormented, blood-stained, unfortunate land!Maurice is crying, looking at his
father._

LAGARD

_Softly._

Bravo, Belgium!The sound of cannonading is heard._

JEANNE

_Softly, to Maurice._

Sit down, Maurice, it is hard for you to stand.MAURICE

Oh, mamma!I am so happy to stand here now--

LAGARD

Now I shall add a few words.As you know, Grelieu, I am a man of
the people.I know the price the people pay for their hard work.I know the cost of all these gardens, orchards and factories
which we shall bury under the water.They have cost us sweat
and health and tears, Grelieu.These are our sufferings which
will be transformed into joy for our children.But as a nation
that loves and respects liberty above its sweat and blood and
tears--as a nation, I say, I would prefer that sea waves should
seethe here over our heads rather than that we should have to
black the boots of the Prussians.And if nothing but islands
remain of Belgium they will be known as "honest islands," and
the islanders will be Belgians as before._All are agitated._

EMIL GRELIEU

And what do the engineers say?GENERAL

_Respectfully waiting for the Count's answer._

Monsieur Grelieu, they say this can be done in two hours.LAGARD

_Grumbles._

In two hours!How many years have we been building
it!GENERAL

The engineers were crying when they said it, Monsieur.LAGARD

The engineers were crying?_Suddenly he bursts into sobs, and slowly takes a handkerchief
from his pocket._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

We are awaiting your answer impatiently, Grelieu.You are
charged with a grave responsibility to your fatherland--to lift
your hand against your own fatherland.EMIL GRELIEU Have we no other defence?Lagard dries
his eyes and slowly answers with a sigh_.JEANNE

_Shaking her head._

No.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Rapidly._

We must gain time, Grelieu.By the power of all our lives,
thrown in the fields, we cannot stop them._Stamping his foot._

Time, time!We must steal from fate a small part of eternity--a
few days, a week!The Russians are
coming to us from the East.The German steel has already
penetrated to the heart of the French land--and infuriated with
pain, the French eagle is rising over the Germans' bayonets
and is coming toward us!The noble knights of the sea--the
British--are already rushing toward us, and to Belgium are their
powerful arms stretched out over the abyss.Belgium is praying for a few days, for
a few hours!You have already given to Belgium your blood,
Grelieu, and you have the right to lift your hand against your
blood-stained fatherland!_Brief pause._

EMIL GRELIEU

We must break the dams._Curtain_



SCENE V


_Night.A sentinel
on guard at the door leading to the rooms occupied by the
Commander of the army.Two officers on duty are
talking lazily, suffering apparently from the heat.Only from time to time the measured footsteps of
pickets are heard, and muffled voices and angry exclamations._

VON RITZAU

Do you feel sleepy, von Stein?VON STEIN

I don't feel sleepy, but I feel like smoking.RITZAU

A bad habit!STEIN

But what if _he_ should come in?Not a breath of pure air enters the lungs.The air is poisoned with the smell of smoke.We must invent
something against this obnoxious odor.RITZAU

I am not an inventor.First of all it is necessary to wring out
the air as they wring the clothes they wash, and dry it in the
sun.It is so moist, I feel as though I were diving in it.Do
you know whether _he_ is in a good mood today?STEIN

Why, is he subject to moods, good or bad?RITZAU

Great self-restraint!STEIN

Have you ever seen him undressed--or half-dressed?Or have you
ever seen his hair in disorder?RITZAU

He speaks so devilishly little, Stein.STEIN

He prefers to have his cannon speak.It is quite a powerful
voice, isn't it, Ritzau?A tall, handsome officer enters quickly and
goes toward the door leading to the room of the Commander._

Blumenfeld!_The tall officer waves his hand and opens the door cautiously,
ready to make his bow._

He is malting his career!RITZAU

He is a good fellow.STEIN

Would you rather be in Paris?RITZAU

I would prefer any less unbearable country to this.How dull it
must be here in the winter time.STEIN

But we have saved them from dullness for a long time to come.Were you ever in the Montmartre cafés, Ritzau?STEIN

Doesn't one find there a wonderful refinement, culture and
innate elegance?Unfortunately, our Berlin people are far
different.RITZAU

Oh, of course._The tall officer comes out of the door, stepping backward.He
heaves a sigh of relief and sits down near the two officers.Takes out a cigar._

VON BLUMENFELD How are things?STEIN

Then I am going to smoke too.BLUMENFELD

You may smoke.He is not coming out Do you want to hear
important news?BLUMENFELD He laughed just now I

STEIN

Really!BLUMENFELD

Upon my word of honor!And he touched my shoulder with two
fingers--do you understand?STEIN

_With envy._

Of course!I suppose you brought him good news, Blumenfeld?_The military telegraphist, standing at attention, hands
Blumenfeld a folded paper._

TELEGRAPHIST

A radiogram, Lieutenant!BLUMENFELD

Let me have it._Slowly he puts his cigar on the window sill and enters the
Commander's room cautiously._

STEIN

He's a lucky fellow.You may say what you please about luck,
but it exists.Von?--Did you know his
father?RITZAU

I have reason to believe that he had no grandfather at all._Blumenfeld comes out and rejoins the two officers, taking up
his cigar._

STEIN

Another military secret?BLUMENFELD

Of course.Everything that is said and done here is a military
secret.The information we have
received concerns our new siege guns--they are advancing
successfully.BLUMENFELD

Yes, successfully.They have just passed the most difficult part
of the road--you know where the swamps are--

STEIN

Oh, yes.BLUMENFELD

The road could not support the heavy weight and caved in.He ordered a report about the
movement at each and every kilometer.STEIN

Now he will sleep in peace.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein!When he is not listening to
reports or issuing commands, he is thinking.As the personal
correspondent of his Highness I have the honor to know many
things which others are not allowed to know--Oh, gentlemen, he
has a wonderful mind!_Another very young officer enters, stands at attention before
Blumenfeld._

BLUMENFELD

Sit down, von Schauss.BLUMENFELD

He has a German philosophical mind which manages guns as
Leibnitz managed ideas.Everything is preconceived, everything
is prearranged, the movement of our millions of people has been
elaborated into such a remarkable system that Kant himself
would have been proud of it.Gentlemen, we are led forward by
indomitable logic and by an iron will._The officers express their approval by subdued exclamations of
"bravo."_

BLUMENFELD

How can he sleep, if the movement of our armies is but the
movement of parts of his brains!And what is the use of sleep
in general?I sleep very little myself, and I advise you,
gentlemen, not to indulge in foolish sleep.RITZAU

But our human organism requires sleep.BLUMENFELD

Nonsense!Organism--that is something invented by the doctors
who are looking for practice among the fools.I know only my desires and my will, which says:
"Gerhardt, do this!SCHAUSS

Will you permit me to take down your words in my notebook?BLUMENFELD

Please, Schauss._The telegraphist has entered._

ZIGLER

I really don't know, but something strange has happened.It
seems that we are being interfered with, I can't understand
anything.BLUMENFELD

What is it?ZIGLER

We can make out one word, "Water"--but after that all is
incomprehensible.And then again, "Water"--

BLUMENFELD

What water?ZIGLER

He is also surprised and cannot understand.BLUMENFELD

You are a donkey, Zigler!We'll have to call out--

_The Commander comes out.His voice is dry and unimpassioned._

COMMANDER

Blumenfeld!_All jump up, straighten themselves, as if petrified._

What is this?BLUMENFELD

I have not yet investigated it, your Highness.Zigler is
reporting--

COMMANDER

What is it, Zigler?ZIGLER

Your Highness, we are being interfered with.I don't know what
it is, but I can't understand anything.We have been able to
make out only one word--"Water."COMMANDER

_Turning around._

See what it is, Blumenfeld, and report to me--

_Engineer runs in._

ENGINEER

Where is Blumenfeld?COMMANDER

_Pausing._

What has happened there, Kloetz?ENGINEER

They don't respond to our calls, your Highness.COMMANDER

You think something serious has happened?ENGINEER

I dare not think so, your Highness, but I am alarmed.Silence is
the only answer to our most energetic calls._The second telegraphist has entered quietly._

GREITZER

They are silent, your Highness._Brief pause._

COMMANDER

_Again turning to the door._

Please investigate this, Lieutenant._He advances a step to the door, then stops.There is a
commotion behind the windows--a noise and the sound of voices.The noise keeps
growing, turning at times into a loud roar._

What is that?An officer, bareheaded, rushes in
excitedly, his hair disheveled, his face pale._

OFFICER

I want to see his Highness.BLUMENFELD

_Hissing._

You are insane!COMMANDER

Calm yourself, officer.I have the honor to report to you that the
Belgians have burst the dams, and our armies are flooded._With horror._

We must hurry, your Highness!OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.COMMANDER

Compose yourself, you are not behaving properly!I am asking you
about our field guns--

OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.We must hurry, your Highness, we are in a valley.They have broken the dams; and the water is
rushing this way violently.It is only five kilometers away from
here--and we can hardly--.The beginning of a terrible panic is felt,
embracing the entire camp.All watch impatiently the reddening
face of the Commander._

COMMANDER

But this is--

_He strikes the table with his fist forcibly._

Absurd!_He looks at them with cold fury, but all lower their eyes.The
frightened officer is trembling and gazing at the window.The
lights grow brighter outside--it is evident that a building has
been set on fire.A
dull noise, then the crash of shots is heard.The discipline is
disappearing gradually._

BLUMENFELD

They have gone mad!STEIN

But that can't be the Belgians!RITZAU

They may have availed themselves--

BLUMENFELD

Aren't you ashamed, Stein?I beg of you--

_Suddenly a piercing, wild sound of a horn is heard ordering to
retreat.The roaring sound is growing rapidly._

COMMANDER

_Shots._

Who has commanded to retreat?_Blumenfeld lowers his head._

COMMANDER

This is not the German Army!You are unworthy of being called
soldiers!BLUMENFELD

_Stepping forward, with dignity._

Your Highness!We are not fishes to swim in the water!_Runs out, followed by two or three others.The panic is
growing._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life is in danger--your
Highness.Only the
sentinel remains in the position of one petrified._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life--I am afraid that
another minute, and it will be too late!COMMANDER

But this is--

_Again strikes the table with his fist._

But this is absurd, Blumenfeld!_Curtain_



SCENE VI


_The same hour of night.In the darkness it is difficult to
discern the silhouettes of the ruined buildings and of the
trees.At the right, a half-destroyed bridge.From time to time the German flashlights are
seen across the dark sky.Near the bridge, an automobile in
which the wounded Emil Grelieu and his son are being carried to
Antwerp.Jeanne and a young physician are with them.Something
has broken down in the automobile and a soldier-chauffeur is
bustling about with a lantern trying to repair it.Langloi
stands near him._


DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

Well?CHAUFFEUR

_Examining._

I don't know yet.DOCTOR

Is it a serious break?CHAUFFEUR

No--I don't know.MAURICE

_From the automobile._

What is it, Doctor?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

We'll start!DOCTOR

I don't know.MAURICE

Shall we stay here long?DOCTOR

_To the chauffeur._

Shall we stay here long?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

How do I know?_Hands the lantern to the doctor._

MAURICE

Then I will come out.JEANNE

You had better stay here, Maurice.MAURICE

No, mother, I am careful._Jumps off and watches the chauffeur at work._

MAURICE

How unfortunate that we are stuck here!CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

A bridge!DOCTOR

Yes, it is unfortunate.MAURICE

_Shrugging his shoulders._

Father did not want to leave.Mamina, do
you think our people are already in Antwerp?JEANNE

Yes, I think so.EMIL GRELIEU

No.It is very pleasant to breathe the fresh air.DOCTOR

_To Maurice._

I think we are still in the region which--

MAURICE

Yes.DOCTOR

_Looking at his watch._

Twenty--a quarter of ten.MAURICE

Then it is a quarter of an hour since the bursting of the dams.Mamma, do you hear, it is a quarter of ten now!JEANNE

Yes, I hear.MAURICE

But it is strange that we haven't heard any explosions.DOCTOR

How can you say that, Monsieur Maurice?MAURICE

I thought that such explosions would be heard a hundred
kilometers away.Our house and our
garden will soon be flooded!I wonder how high the water will
rise.Do you think it will reach up to the second story?CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

I am working.Mamma, see how the searchlights are working.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne, lift me a little.JEANNE

My dear, I don't know whether I am allowed to do it.DOCTOR

You may lift him a little, if it isn't very painful.JEANNE

Do you feel any pain?EMIL GRELIEU

No.MAURICE

Father, they are flashing the searchlights across the sky like
madmen._A bluish light is flashed over them, faintly illuminating the
whole group._

MAURICE

Right into my eyes!EMIL GRELIEU

I suppose so.Either they have been warned, or the water is
reaching them by this time.JEANNE

Do you think so, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.It seems to me that I hear the sound of the water from that
side._All listen and look in the direction from which the noise came._

DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

How unpleasant this is!MAURICE

Father, it seems to me I hear voices.Listen--it sounds as
though they are crying there.Father, the
Prussians are crying._A distant, dull roaring of a crowd is heard.The searchlights are
swaying from side to side._

EMIL GRELIEU

It is they.DOCTOR

If we don't start in a quarter of an hour--

EMIL GRELIEU

In half an hour, Doctor.MAURICE

Father, how beautiful and how terrible it is!JEANNE

What is it?MAURICE

I want to kiss it.JEANNE

What a foolish little boy you are, Maurice.MAURICE

Monsieur Langloi said that in three days from now I may remove
my bandage.Just think of it, in three days I shall be able to
take up my gun again!...The
chauffeur and the doctor draw their revolvers.A figure appears
from the field, approaching from one of the ditches.A peasant,
wounded in the leg, comes up slowly, leaning upon a cane._

MAURICE

Who is there?PEASANT

Our own, our own.MAURICE

Yes, we're going to the city.Our car has broken down, we're
repairing it.PEASANT

What am I doing here?They also look at him
attentively, by the light of the lantern._

CHAUFFEUR

Give me the light!PEASANT

Are you carrying a wounded man?I
cannot walk, it is very hard.I lay there in the ditch and when I heard you
speak French I crawled out.DOCTOR

How were you wounded?PEASANT

I was walking in the field and they shot me.They must have
thought I was a rabbit._Laughs hoarsely._

They must have thought I was a rabbit.What is the news,
gentlemen?MAURICE

Don't you know?PEASANT

What can I know?I lay there and looked at the sky--that's all I
know.Just look at it, I have been watching
it all the time.What is that I see in the sky, eh?EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down near us.MAURICE

Listen, sit down here.They are
crying there--the Prussians!They must have learned of
it by this time.Listen, it is so far, and yet we can hear!_The peasant laughs hoarsely._

MAURICE

Sit down, right here, the automobile is large.CHAUFFEUR

_Muttering._

Sit down, sit down!DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

What is it?MAURICE

What an unfortunate mishap!JEANNE

_Agitated._

They shot you like a rabbit?Do you hear, Emil--they thought a
rabbit was running!_She laughs loudly, the peasant also laughs._

PEASANT

I look like a rabbit!JEANNE

Do you hear, Emil?_Laughs._

EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

It makes me laugh--it seems so comical to me that they mistake
us for rabbits.And now, what are we now--water rats?Emil, just
picture to yourself, water rats in an automobile!JEANNE

No, no, I am not laughing any more, Maurice!_Laughs._

And what else are we?PEASANT

_Laughs._

And now we must hide in the ground--

JEANNE

_In the same tone._

And they will remain on the ground?EMIL GRELIEU

My dear!MAURICE

_To the doctor._

Listen, you must do something.Mamma, we are starting directly, my dear!JEANNE

No, never mind, I am not laughing any more.Maurice, I simply felt like talking.I
was forever silent, but just now I felt like chattering.Emil,
I am not disturbing you with my talk, am I?Why is the water so
quiet, Emil?It was the King who said, "The water is silent,"
was it not?But I should like to see it roar, crash like
thunder.... No, I cannot, I cannot bear this silence!Ah, why is
it so quiet--I cannot bear it!MAURICE

_To the chauffeur._

My dear fellow, please hurry up!CHAUFFEUR

Yes, yes!JEANNE

_Suddenly cries, threatening._

But I cannot bear it!_Covers her mouth with her hands; sobs._

I cannot!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne.JEANNE

_Sobbing, but calming herself somewhat._

I cannot bear it!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne!I am suffering, but I know this, Jeanne!CHAUFFEUR

In a moment, in a moment.EMIL GRELIEU

_Faintly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

Yes, yes, I know.... Forgive me, forgive me, I will soon--

_A loud, somewhat hoarse voice of a girl comes from the dark._

GIRL

Tell me how I can find my way to Lonua!_Exclamations of surprise._

MAURICE

Who is that?JEANNE

Emil, it is that girl!_Laughs._

She is also like a rabbit!DOCTOR

_Grumbles._

What is it, what is it--Who?Her dress is torn, her eyes look
wild.The peasant is laughing._

PEASANT

She is here again?CHAUFFEUR

Let me have the light!GIRL

_Loudly._

How can I find my way to Lonua?EMIL GRELIEU

Maurice, you must stop her!Doctor, you--

CHAUFFEUR

Put down the lantern!GIRL

_Shouts._

Hands off!No, no, you will not dare--

MAURICE

You can't catch her--

_The girl runs away._

EMIL GRELIEU

Doctor, you must catch her!She will perish here, quick--

_She runs away.The doctor follows her in the dark._

PEASANT

She asked me, too, how to go to Lonua._The girl's voice resounds in the dark and then there is
silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

You must catch her!MAURICE

But how, father?Jeanne
breaks into muffled laughter._

MAURICE

_Mutters._

Now he is gone!CHAUFFEUR

_Triumphantly._

Take your seats!MAURICE

But the doctor isn't here.CHAUFFEUR

Let us call him._Maurice and the chauffeur call: "Doctor!"_

CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

I must deliver Monsieur Grelieu, and I will deliver him.MAURICE

_Shouts._

Langloi!_A faint echo in the distance._

Come!_The response is nearer._

PEASANT

He did not catch her.She asked me, too,
about the road to Lonua._Laughs._

There are many like her now.EMIL GRELIEU

_Imploringly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

But I cannot, Emil.I used
to understand, I used to understand, but now--Where is Pierre?_Firmly._

Where is Pierre?MAURICE

Oh, will he be here soon?Mother dear, we'll start in a moment!JEANNE

Yes, yes, we'll start in a moment!Why such a dream, why such a dream?_A mice from the darkness, quite near._

JEANNE

_Frightened._

Who is shouting?What a strange dream, what a terrible,
terrible, terrible dream._Lowering her voice._

I cannot--why are you torturing me?EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne!EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne.But I swear to you by God, Jeanne!--Belgium
will live.Weep, sob, you are a mother.I too am crying with
you--But I swear by God: Belgium will live!God has given me the
light to see, and I can see.A new Spring will come here, the trees will be covered with
blossoms--I swear to you, Jeanne, they will be covered with
blossoms!And mothers will caress their children, and the sun
will shine upon their heads, upon their golden-haired little
heads!I see my nation: Here it is advancing with palm
leaves to meet God who has come to earth again.Weep, Jeanne,
you are a mother!Weep, unfortunate mother--God weeps with you.But there will be happy mothers here again--I see a new world,
Jeanne, I see a new life!“If we weren’t out in the street, I believe I should kiss you, Tabitha,”
 said the girl.“You can’t begin to imagine how delightfully you have
behaved today!”




CHAPTER XVII.--TRACY HEARS STRANGE THINGS.REUBEN’S first impulse, when he found himself alone in the little shop
with his former pupil, was to say good-by and get out as soon as he
could.To the best of his recollection, he had never before been in a
store consecrated entirely to the fashions and finery of the opposite
sex, and he was oppressed by a sense of being an intruder upon an
exclusively feminine domain.The young girl, too, whom he had been
thinking of all this while as an unfortunate child whom he must watch
over and be good to, stood revealed before him as a self-controlled and
sophisticated woman, only a few years younger than himself in actual
age, and much wiser than himself in the matters of head-gear and
textures and colors which belonged to this place.He could have talked
freely to her in his law-office, with his familiar accessories of papers
and books about him.A background of bonnets was disconcerting.“How beautiful she is!” were Jessica’s first words, and they pleasurably
startled the lawyer from his embarrassed revery.“She is, indeed,” he answered, and somehow found himself hoping that the
conversation would cling to this subject a good while.“I had never met
her before, as you saw, but of course I have known her by sight a long
time.”

“I don’t think I ever saw her before to-day,” said Jessica.“How
wonderful it seems that she should have come, and then that you came,
too, and that you both should like the plan, and take it up so, and make
a success of it right at the start.”

Reuben smiled.“In your eagerness to keep up with the procession I fear
you are getting ahead of the band,” he said.“I wouldn’t quite call it
a success, at present.But, no doubt, it’s a great thing to have her
enlisted in it.I’m glad she likes you; her friendship will make all the
difference in the world to you, here in Thessaly.”

The girl did not immediately answer, and Tracy, looking at her as she
walked across to the showcase, was surprised to catch the glisten of
tears on her eyelashes.He had no idea what to say, but waited in pained
puzzlement for her to speak.“‘Friendship’ is not quite the word,” she said at last, looking up at
him and smiling with mournful softness through her tears.“I shall be
glad if she likes me--as you say, it will be a great thing if she helps
me--but we shall hardly be ‘friends,’ you know._She_ would never call
it that.oh, no!”

Her voice trembled audibly over these last words, and she began
hurriedly to re-arrange some of the articles in the showcase, with the
obvious design of masking her emotion.“You can do yourself no greater harm than by exaggerating that kind of
notion, my girl,” said Reuben Tracy, in his old gravely kind voice.“You
would put thoughts into her head that way which she had never dreamt of
otherwise; that is, if she weren’t a good and sensible person.Why, she
is a woman like yourself--”

“Oh, no, no!_Not_ like _me!_”

Tracy was infinitely touched by the pathos of this deprecating wail,
but he went on as if he had not heard it: “A woman like yourself, with
a heart turned in mercy and charity toward other women who are not so
strong to help themselves.Why on earth should you vex your soul with
fears that she will be unkind to you, when she showed you as plain
as the noonday sun her desire _to_ be kind?You mustn’t yield to such
fancies.”

“Kind, yes!But you don’t understand--you _can’t_ understand.I
shouldn’t have spoken as I did.It was a mere question of a word,
anyway.”

Jessica smiled again, to show that, though the tears were still there,
the grief behind them was to be regarded as gone, and added, “Yes, she
was kindness itself.”

“She is very rich in her own right, I believe, and if her interest
in your project is genuine--that is, of the kind that lasts--you will
hardly need any other assistance.Of course you must allow for the
chance of her dropping the idea as suddenly as she picked it up.Rich
women--rich people generally, for that matter--are often flighty about
such things.‘Put not your trust in princes,’ serves as a warning about
millionnaires as well as monarchs.The rest of us are forced to be
more or less continuous in what we think and do.We have to keep at the
things we’ve started, because a waste of time would be serious to us.We have to keep the friends and associates we’ve got, because others
are not to be had for the asking.But these favored people are more
free--their time doesn’t matter, and they can find new sets of friends
ready made whenever they weary of the others.Still, let us hope she
will be steadfast.She has a strong face, at all events.”

The girl had listened to this substantial dissertation with more or less
comprehension, but with unbounded respect.Anything that Reuben Tracy
said she felt must be good.Besides, his conclusion jumped with her
hopes.“I’m not afraid of her losing interest in the thing itself,” she
answered.“What worries me is--or, no--” She stopped herself with a
smile, and made haste to add, “I forgot.Tell me about her.”

“She owns a share of the works, I think.I don’t know how big a share,
or, in fact, much else about her.I’ve heard my partner, Horace Boyce,
talk lately a good deal--”

Tracy did not finish his sentence, for Jessica had sunk suddenly into
the chair behind the case, and was staring at him over the glass-bound
row of bonnets with wide-open, startled eyes.“_Your partner!_ Yours, did you say?That man?”

Her tone and manner very much surprised Reuben.“Why, yes, he’s my
partner,” he said, slowly and in wonderment.“Didn’t you know that?We’ve been together since December.”

She shook her head, and murmured something hastily about having been
very busy, and being cooped up on a back street.This did not explain her agitation, which more and more puzzled Reuben
as he thought upon it.He stood looking down upon her where she sat, and
noted that her face, though it was turned away from him now, was both
pale and excited.“Do you know him?” he asked finally.She shook her head again, and the lawyer fancied she was biting her
lips.He did not know well what else to say, and was speculating whether
it would not be best to say nothing, when all at once she burst forth
vehemently.“I _won’t_ lie to you!” she exclaimed.“I _did_ know him, very much to
my cost.Don’t you trust him, I say!He’s
not fit to be with you.Oh, my God!--_don’t_ I know Horace Boyce!”

Reuben stood silent, still looking down gravely into the girl’s flashing
eyes.What she had said annoyed and disturbed him, but what he thought
chiefly about was how to avoid bringing on an explanation which must
wound and humiliate her feelings.It was clear enough what she meant,
and he compassionately hoped she would not feel it necessary to add
anything.Above all things he felt that he wanted to spare her pain.“I understand,” he said at last, as the frankest way out of the dilemma.“Don’t say any more.” He pondered for a minute or so upon the propriety
of not saying anything more himself, and then with decision offered her
his hand across the showcase, and held hers in his expansive clasp with
what he took to be fatherly sympathy, as he said:

“I must go now.And I shall hear from you soon about the
project?” He smiled to reassure her, and added, still holding her hand,
“Now, don’t you let worry come inside these doors at all.You have made
a famous start, and everything will go well, believe me.”

Then he went out, and the shrill clamor of the bell hung to jangle
when the door was opened woke Jessica from her day-dream, just as the
sunbeams had begun to drive away the night.She rose with a start, and walked to the door to follow his
retiring figure through the glass.She stood there, lost in another
revery--vague, languorous, half-bright, half-hideous--until the door
from the back room was opened, and Samantha’s sharp voice fell on the
silence of the little shop.“I ain’t going to set in that poky old kitchen any longer for all
the bonnets in your whole place,” she remarked, with determination,
advancing to the mirror with the toque on her truculently poised head.“Besides, you said you’d call us when they were all gone.”

Lucinda stole up to her sister-employer, and murmured in a side-long
whisper: “I couldn’t keep her from listening a little.She heard what you said about that Boyce chap.”

The tidings angered Jessica even more than they alarmed her.With an
impulse equally illogical and natural, she frowned at Samantha, and
stiffened her fingers claw-wise, with a distinct itching to tear that
arrangement of bronze velvet and sage-green feathers from her perfidious
sister’s head.Curiously enough, it was the usually aggressive Lucinda who counselled
prudence.“If I was you, I’d ask her to stay to dinner,” she said,
in the same furtive undertone.“I’ve been talking to her, and I guess
she’ll be all right if we make it kind o’ pleasant for her when she
comes.But if you rub her the wrong way, she’ll scratch.”

Samantha was asked to dinner, and stayed, and later, being offered her
choice of three hat-pins with heads of ornamented jet, took two.*****

Reuben walked slowly back to the office, and then sat through a solitary
meal at a side-table in the Dearborn House dining-room, although his
customary seat was at the long table down the centre, in order that he
might think over what he had heard.It is not clear that the isolated fact disclosed to him in the
milliner’s shop would, in itself, have been sufficient to awaken in his
mind any serious distrust of his partner.As the sexes have different
trainings and different spheres, so they have different standards.Men
set up the bars, for instance, against a brother who cheats at cards, or
divulges what he has heard in his club, or borrows money which he cannot
repay, or pockets cigars at feasts when he does not himself smoke.But
their courts of ethics do not exercise jurisdiction over sentimental or
sexual offences, as a rule.These the male instinct vaguely refers to
some other tribunal, which may or may not be in session somewhere else.And this male instinct is not necessarily co-existent with immoral
tendencies, or blunted sensibilities, or even indifference: it is the
man’s way of looking at it--just as it is his way to cross a muddy
street on his toes, while his sisters perform the same feat on their
heels.Reuben Tracy was a good man, and one with keen aspirations toward
honorable and ennobling things; but still he was a man, and it may
be that this discovery, standing by itself, would not seriously have
affected his opinion of Horace.In an indefinite kind of way, he was conscious of being less attracted
by the wit and sparkling smalltalk of Horace than he had been at first.Somehow, the young man seemed to have exhausted his store; he began to
repeat himself, as if he had already made the circuit of the small ring
around which his mind travelled.Reuben confronted a suspicion that the
Boyce soil was shallow.This might not be necessarily an evil thing, he said to himself.Lawyers
quite often achieved notable successes before juries, who were not
deep or well-grounded men.Horace was versatile, and versatility was
a quality which Reuben distinctly lacked.From that point of view the
combination ought, therefore, to be of value.Versatility of that variety was not so
admirable.Reuben could count
on his fingers now six separate falsehoods that his partner had already
told him.They happened not to be upon vital or even important subjects,
but that did not render them the more palatable.He knew from other sources
that Horace had been intrusted with the papers left to Mr.Clarke’s
executors.The young man had taken them to his father’s house, and had
never mentioned so much as a syllable about them to his partner.No
doubt, Horace felt that he ought to have this as his personal business,
and upon the precedent Reuben himself had set with the railroad work,
this was fair enough.But there was something underhanded in his secrecy
about the matter.Reuben’s thoughts from this drifted to the Minsters themselves, and
centred reverently upon the luminous figure of that elder daughter
whom he had met an hour before.He did not dwell much upon her
beauty--perhaps he was a trifle dull about such things--but her
graciousness, her sweet interest in the charity, her womanly commingling
of softness and enthusiasm, seemed to shine about him as he mused.Thessaly unconsciously assumed a brighter and more wholesome aspect,
with much less need of reform than before, in his mind’s eye, now that
he thought of it as her home.The prosperous and respected lawyer was still a country boy
in his unformed speculations as to what that home might be like.The
Minster house was the most splendid mansion in Dearborn County, it was
said, but his experience with mansions was small.A hundred times it had
been said to him that he could go anywhere if he liked, and he gave the
statement credence enough.But somehow it happened that he had not gone.To “be in society,” as the phrase went, had not seemed important to him.Now, almost for the first time, he found himself regretting this.Then
he smiled somewhat scowlingly at his plate as the vagrant reflection
came up that his partner contributed social status as well as
versatility and mendacity to the outfit of the firm.Horace Boyce had a
swallowtail coat, and visited at the Minsters’.The reflection was not
altogether grateful to him.Reuben rose from the table, and stood for a few moments by the window
overlooking the veranda and the side street.The sunny warmth of the
thawing noon-day had made it possible to have the window open, and the
sound of voices close at hand showed that there were people already
anticipating pneumonia and the springtime by sitting on the porch
outside.These voices conveyed no distinct impression at first to Reuben’s mind,
busy as he was with his own reflections.But all at once there was a
scraping of feet and chair-legs on the floor, signifying that the party
had risen, and then he heard two remarks which made a sharp appeal to
his attention and interest.The first voice said: “Mind, I’m not going to let you put me into a
hole.What I do, I do only when it has been proved to me to be to my
own interest, and not at all because I’m afraid of you.Understand that
clearly!”

The other voice replied: “All that you need be afraid of is that you
will kick over your own bucket of milk.You’ve got the whole game in
your hands, if you only listen to me and don’t play it like a fool.Shall we go up to your house and put the thing into shape?We can be alone there.”

The voices ceased, and there was a sound of footsteps descending from
the porch to the sidewalk.The two men passed before the window,
ducking their heads for protection against the water dripping from the
overflowed eaves on the roof of the veranda, and thus missing sight of
the man who had overheard them.Reuben had known at once by the sound of the voice that the first
speaker was Horace Boyce.He recognized his companion now as Schuyler
Tenney, and the sight startled him.Just why it should have done so, he could not have explained.He had
seen this Schuyler Tenney almost every day for a good many years,
putting them all together, and had never before been troubled, much less
alarmed, by the spectacle.But coming now upon what Jessica had
told him, and what his own thoughts had evolved, and what he had
inadvertently overheard, the figure of the rising hardware merchant
loomed darkly in his perturbed fancy as an evil and threatening thing.A rustic client with a grievance sought Tracy out in the seclusion
of the dining-room, and dragged him back to his office and into the
intricacies of the law of trespass; but though he did his best to listen
and understand, the farmer went away feeling that his lawyer was a
considerably overrated man.For, strive as he might, Reuben could not get the sound of those words,
“you’ve got the whole game in your hands,” out of his ears, or restrain
his mind from wearying itself with the anxious puzzle of guessing what
that game could be.CHAPTER XVIII.--A SIMPLE BUSINESS TRANSACTION.Schuyler Tenney had never before been afforded an opportunity of
studying a young gentleman of fashion and culture in the intimacy of
his private apartments, and he looked about Horace’s room with lively
curiosity and interest, when the two conspirators had entered the
General’s house, gone up-stairs, and shut doors behind them.“It looks like a ninety-nine-cent store, for all the world,” was his
comment when he had examined the bric-à-brac on the walls and mantels,
“hefted” a bronze trifle or two on the table, and taken a comprehensive
survey of the furniture and hangings.“It’s rather bare than otherwise,” said Horace, carelessly.“I got
a tolerably decent lot of traps together when I had rooms in Jermyn
Street, but I had to let most of them go when I pulled up stakes to come
home.”

“German Street?I suppose that is in Germany?”

“No--London.”

“Oh!Sold ’em because you got hard up?”

“Not at all.But this damned tariff of yours--or ours--makes it cost too
much to bring decent things over here.”

“Protection to American industry, my boy,” said Mr.“We
couldn’t get on a fortnight without it.Just think what--”

“Oh, hang it all, man!We didn’t come here to talk tariff!” Horace broke
in, with a smile which was half annoyance.“No, that’s so,” assented Mr.Tenney, settling himself in the low,
deep-backed easy-chair, and putting the tips of his lean fingers
together.“No, we didn’t, for a fact.” He added, after a moment’s pause:
“I guess I’ll have to rig up a room like this myself, when the thing
comes off.” He smiled icily to himself at the thought.“Meanwhile, let us talk about the ‘thing,’ as you call it.Will you have
a drink?”

“Never touch it,” said Mr.Tenney, and he looked curiously on while
Horace poured out some brandy, and then opened a bottle of soda-water to
go with it.He was particularly impressed by the little wire frame-work
stand made to hold the round-bottomed bottle, and asked its cost, and
wondered if they wouldn’t be a good thing to keep in the store.“Now to business!” said Horace, dragging out from under a sofa the black
tin box which held the Minster papers, and throwing back its cover.“I’ve told you pretty well what there is in here.”

Mr.Tenney took from his pocket-book the tabular statement Horace had
made of the Minster property, and smoothed it out over his pointed knee.“It’s a very pretty table,” he said; “no bookkeeper could have done it
better.I know it by heart, but we’ll keep it here in sight while you
proceed.”

“There’s nothing for me to proceed with,” said Horace, lolling back
in his chair in turn.“I want to hear _you!_ Don’t let us waste time.Broadly, what do you propose?”

“Broadly, what does everybody propose?To get for himself what somebody
else has got.It’s every kind of nature, down to
the little chickens just hatched who start to chase the chap with the
worm in his mouth before they’ve fairly got their tails out of the
shell.”

“You ought to write a book, Schuyler,” said Horace, using this
familiar name for the first time: “‘Tenney on Dynamic Sociology’!What particular worm have you got in your
bill’s eye?”

“We are all worms, so the Bible says.I suppose even those scrumptious
ladies there come under that head, like we ordinary mortals.” Mr.Tenney
pointed his agreeable metaphor by touching the paper on his knee with
his joined finger-tips, and showed his small, sharpened teeth in a
momentary smile.“I follow you,” said Horace, tentatively.“Go on!”

“That’s a heap of money that you’ve ciphered out there, on that paper.”

“Yes.True, it isn’t ours, and we’ve got nothing to do with it.Go on!”

“A good deal of it can be ours, if you’ve got the pluck to go in with
me.”

Horace frowned.“Upon my word, Tenney,” he said, impatiently, “what do
you mean?”

“Jest what I said,” was the sententious and collected response.The younger man laughed with an uneasy assumption of scorn.“Is it
a burglary you do me the honor to propose, or only common or garden
robbery?Ought we to manage a little murder in the thing, or what do you
say to arson?Upon my word, man, I believe that you don’t realize that
what you’ve said is an insult!”

“No, I don’t.You’re right there,” said the hardware merchant, in no
wise ruffled.“But I do realize that you come pretty near being the
dod-blamedest fool in Dearborn County.”

“Much obliged for the qualification, I’m sure,” retorted Horace, who
felt the mists of his half-simulated, half-instinctive anger fading away
before the steady breath of the other man’s purpose.Pray go on.”

“There ain’t no question of dishonesty about the thing, not the
slightest.I ain’t that kind of a man!” Horace permitted himself a
shadowy smile, emphasized by a subdued little sniff, which Tenney caught
and was pleased to appear to resent, “Thessaly knows me!” he said, with
an air of pride.“They ain’t a living man--nor a dead one nuther--can
put his finger on me.I’ve lived aboveboard, sir, and owe no man a red
cent, and I defy anybody to so much as whisper a word about my
character.”

“‘Tenney on Faith Justified by Works,’” commented Horace, softly,
smiling as much as he dared, but in a less aggressive manner.“Works--yes!” said the hardware merchant, “the Minster iron-works, in
particular.” He seemed pleased with his little joke, and paused to dwell
upon it in his mind for an instant.Then he went on, sitting upright in
his chair now, and displaying a new earnestness:

“Dishonesty is wrong, and it is foolish.It gets a man disgraced, and
it gets him in jail.A smart
man can get money in a good many ways without giving anybody a chance
to call him dishonest.I have thought out several plans--some of
them strong at one point, others at another, but all pretty middlin’
good--how to feather our own nests out of this thing.”

“Well?” said Horace, interrogatively.Tenney did not smile any more, and he had done with digressions.“First of all,” he said, with his intent gray eyes fixed on the young
man’s face, “what guarantee have I that you won’t give me away?”

“What guarantee _can_ I give you?” replied Horace, also sitting up.“Perhaps you are right,” said Tenney, thinking in his own swift-working
mind that it would be easy enough to take care of this poor creature
later on.“Well, then, you’ve been appointed Mrs.Minster’s lawyer in
the interest of the Thessaly Manufacturing Company--this company
here marked ‘D,’ in which the family has one hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars.”

“I gathered as much.Perhaps you wouldn’t mind telling me what it is all
about.”

“I’m as transparent as plate-glass when I think a man is acting square
with me,” said the hardware merchant.Wendover and
me got hold of a little rolling-mill and nail-works at Cadmus, down on
the Southern Tier, a few years ago.Some silly people had put up the
money for it, and there was a sort of half-crazy inventor fellow running
it.They were making ducks and drakes of the whole thing, and I saw
a chance of getting into the concern--I used to buy a good deal of
hardware from them, and knew how they stood--and I spoke to Wendover,
and so we went in.”

“That means that the other people were put out, I suppose,” commented
Horace.“Well, no; but they kind o’ faded away like.I wouldn’t exactly say they
were put out, but after a while they didn’t seem to be able to stay in.The iron fields
around there had pretty well petered out, and we were way off the main
line of transportation.Business was fair enough; we made a straight ten
per cent, year in and year out, because the thing was managed carefully;
but that was in spite of a lot of drawbacks.So I got a scheme in my
head to move the whole concern up here to Thessaly, and hitch it up with
the Minster iron-works.We could save one dollar a ton, or forty-five
thousand dollars in all, in the mere matter of freight alone, if we
could use up their entire output.I may tell you, I didn’t appear in the
business at all.Minster don’t know to this day that I’m
a kind of partner of hers.It happened that Wendover used to know her
when she was a girl--they both come from down the Hudson somewhere--and
so he worked the thing with her, and we moved over from Cadmus, hook,
line, bob, and sinker, and we’re the Thessaly Manufacturing Company.Do
you see?”

“So far, yes.She and her daughters have one hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars cash in it.What is the rest of the company like?”

“It’s stocked at four hundred thousand dollars.We put in all our plant
and machinery and business and good-will and so on at one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars, and then we furnished seventy-five thousand
dollars cash.So we hold two hundred and twenty-five shares to their one
hundred and seventy-five.”

“Who are the ‘we’?”

“Well, Pete Wendover and me are about the only people you’re liable to
meet around the premises, I guess.There are some other names on the
books, but they don’t amount to much.We can wipe them off whenever we
like.”

“I notice that this company has paid no dividends since it was formed.”

“That’s because of the expense of building.And we ain’t got what you
may call fairly to work yet.There is big money in
it.”

“I daresay,” observed Horace.“But, if you will excuse the remark, I
seem to have missed that part of your statement which referred to _my_
making something out of the company.”

The hardware merchant allowed his cold eyes to twinkle for an instant.“You’ll be taken care of,” he said, confidentially.“Don’t fret your
gizzard about _that!_”

Horace smiled.It seemed to be easier to get on with Tenney than he had
thought.“But what am I to do; that is, if I decide to do anything?” he
asked.“I confess I don’t see your scheme.”

“Why, that’s curious,” said the other, with an air of candor.“And you
lawyers have the name of being so ’cute, too!”

“I don’t suppose we see through a stone wall much farther than other
people.Our chief advantage is in being able to recognize that it is a
wall.And this one of yours seems to be as thick and opaque as most, I’m
bound to say.”

“We don’t want you to do anything, just now,” Mr.“Things may turn up in which you can be of assistance, and then we want
to count on you, that’s all.”

This was a far less lucid explanation than Horace had looked for.Tenney
had been so anxious for a confidential talk, and had hinted of such
dazzling secrets, that this was a distinct disappointment.“What did you mean by saying that I had the whole game in my hands?”
 he demanded, not dissembling his annoyance.“Thus far, you haven’t even
dealt me any cards!”

Mr.Tenney lay back in his chair again, and surveyed Horace over his
finger-tips.“There is to be a game, young man, and you’ve been put in
a position to play in it when the time comes.But I should be a
particularly simple kind of goose to tell you about it beforehand; now,
wouldn’t I?”

Thus candidly appealed to, Horace could not but admit that his
companion’s caution was defensible.“Please yourself,” he said.“I daresay you’re right enough.I’ve got the
position, as you say.Perhaps it is through you that it came to me; I’ll
concede that, for argument’s sake.You are not a man who expects people
to act from gratitude alone.Therefore you don’t count upon my doing
things for you in this position, even though you put me there, unless
you first convince me that they will also benefit me.That is clear
enough, isn’t it?When the occasion
arises that you need me, you can tell me what it is, and what I am to
get out of it, and then we’ll talk business.”

Mr.Tenney had not lifted his eyes for a moment from his companion’s
face.Had his own countenance been one on which inner feelings were
easily reflected, it would just now have worn an expression of amused
contempt.“Well, this much I might as well tell you straight off,” he said.“A
part of my notion, if everything goes smoothly, is to have Mrs.Minster
put you into the Thessaly Manufacturing Company as her representative
and to pay you five thousand dollars a year for it, which might be fixed
so as to stand separate from the other work you do for her.Wendover
can arrange that with her.And then I am counting now on declaring
myself up at the Minster works, and putting in my time up there; so that
your father will be needed again in the store, and it might be so that
I could double his salary, and let him have back say a half interest
in the business, and put him on his feet.I say these things _might_ be
done.I don’t say I’ve settled on them, mind!”

“And you still think it best to keep me in the dark; not to tell me what
it is I’m to do?” Horace leant forward, and asked this question eagerly.“No-o--I’ll tell you this much.Your business will be to say ditto to
whatever me and Wendover say.”

A full minute’s pause ensued, during which Mr.Tenney gravely watched
Horace sip what remained of his drink.Do you go in with us?” he asked, at last.“I’d better think it over,” said Horace.“Give me, say, till
Monday--that’s five days.And of course, if I do say yes, it will
be understood that I am not to be bound to do anything of a shady
character.”

“Certainly; but you needn’t worry about that,” answered Tenney.“Everything will be as straight as a die.There will be nothing but a
simple business transaction.”

“What did you mean by saying that we should take some of the Minster
money away?That had a queer sound.”

“All business consists in getting other people’s money,” said the
hardware merchant, sententiously.“Where do you suppose Steve Minster
got his millions?Didn’t every dollar
pass through some other fellow’s pocket before it reached his?The
only difference was that when it got into his pocket it stuck there.Everybody is looking out to get rich; and when a man succeeds, it only
means that somebody else has got poor.That’s plain common-sense!”

The conversation practically ended here.Tenney devoted some quarter
of an hour to going severally over all the papers in the Minster box,
but glancing through only those few which referred to the Thessaly
Manufacturing Company.The proceeding seemed to Horace to be irregular,
but he could not well refuse, and Tenney was not interrupted.When
he had finished his task he shook hands with Horace with a novel
cordiality, and it was not difficult to guess that the result of his
search had pleased him.“You are sure those are all the papers Clarke left to be turned over?”
 he asked.Upon being assured in the affirmative his eyes emitted a
glance which was like a flash of light, and his lip lifted in a smile of
obvious elation.“There’s a fortune for both of us,” he said, jubilantly, as he unlocked
the door, and shook hands again.When he had gone, Horace poured out another drink and sat down to
meditate.CHAPTER XIX.--NO MESSAGE FOR MAMMA.Four days of anxious meditation did not help Horace Boyce to clear his
mind, and on the fifth he determined upon a somewhat desperate step, in
the hope that its issue would assist decision.Two ways of acquiring a
fortune lay before him.One was to marry Kate Minster; the other was
to join the plot against her property and that of her family, which the
subtile Tenney was darkly shaping.The misery of the situation was that he must decide at once which of
the ways he would choose.In his elation at being selected as the legal
adviser and agent of these millionnaire women, no such contingency as
this had been foreseen.He had assumed that abundant time would be at
his disposal, and he had said to himself that with time all things may
be accomplished with all women.But this precious element of time had been harshly cut out of his plans,
here at the very start.The few days reluctantly granted him had gone
by, one by one, with cruel swiftness, and to-morrow would be Monday--and
still his mind was not made up.If he could be assured that Miss Minster would marry him, or at least
admit him to the vantage-ground of _quasi-recognition_ as a suitor, the
difficulty would be solved at once.He would turn around and defend
her and her people against the machinations of Tenney.Just what the
machinations were he could not for the life of him puzzle out, but he
felt sure that, whatever their nature, he could defeat them, if only
he were given the right to do battle in the name of the family, as a
prospective member of it.On the other hand, it might be that he had no present chance with Miss
Minster as an eligible husband.What would happen if he relied on a
prospect which turned out not to exist?His own opportunity to share
in the profits of Tenney’s plan would be abruptly extinguished, and his
father would be thrown upon the world as a discredited bankrupt.Sometimes the distracted young man thought he caught glimpses of a safe
middle course.In these sanguine moments it seemed feasible to give in
his adhesion to Tenney’s scheme, and go along with him for a certain
time, say until the intentions of the conspirators were revealed.Then
he might suddenly revolt, throw himself into a virtuous attitude, and
win credit and gratitude at the hands of the family by protecting them
from their enemies.Then the game would be in his own hands, and no
mistake!But there were other times when this course did not present so many
attractions to his mind--when it was borne in upon him that Tenney would
be a dangerous kind of man to betray.He had seen merciless and terrible
depths in the gray eyes of the hardware merchant--depths which somehow
suggested bones stripped clean of their flesh, sucked bare of their
marrow, at the bottom of a gloomy sea.In these seasons of doubt, which
came mostly in the early morning when he first awoke, the mere thought
of Tenney’s hatred made him shudder.It was as if Hugo’s devil-fish had
crawled into his dreams.So Sunday afternoon came and found the young man still perplexed and
harassed.To do him justice, he had once or twice dwelt momentarily on
the plan of simply defying Tenney and doing his duty by the Minsters,
and taking his chances.The
case was too complicated for mere honesty.The days of martyrdom were
long since past.One needed to be smarter than one’s neighbors in these
later times.To eat others was the rule now, if one would save himself
from being devoured.It was at least clear to his mind that he must be
smart, and play his hand so as to get the odd trick even if honors were
held against him.Horace decided finally that the wisest thing he could do would be to
call upon the Minsters before nightfall, and trust to luck for some
opportunity of discovering Miss Kate’s state of mind toward him.He
was troubled more or less by fears that Sunday might not be regarded
in Thessaly as a proper day for calls, as he dressed himself for
the adventure.But when he got upon the street, the fresh air and
exhilaration oc exercise helped to reassure him.Before he reached the
Minster gate he had even grown to feel that the ladies had probably had
a dull day of it, and would welcome his advent as a diversion.He was shown into the stately parlor to the left of the wide hall--a
room he had not seen before--and left to sit there in solitude for some
minutes.This term of waiting he employed in looking over the portraits
on the wall and the photographs on the mantels and tables.Aside from
several pictures of the dissipated Minster boy who had died, he could
see no faces of young men anywhere, and he felt this to be a good sign
as he tiptoed his way back to his seat by the window.Fortune smiled at least upon the opening of his enterprise.It was Miss
Kate who came at last to receive him, and she came alone.The young
man’s cultured sense of beauty and breeding was caressed and captivated
as it had never been before--at least in America, he made mental
reservation--as she came across the room toward him, and held out her
hand.He felt himself unexpectedly at ease, as he returned her greeting
and looked with smiling warmth into her splendid eyes.He touched lightly upon his doubts
as to making calls on Sunday, and how they were overborne by the
unspeakable tedium of his own rooms.Then he spoke of the way the more
unconventional circles of London utilize the day, and of the contrasting
features of the Continental Sunday.Miss Kate seemed interested, and
besides explaining that her mother was writing letters and that her
sister was not very well, bore a courteous and affable part in the
exchange of small-talk.For a long time nothing was said which enabled Horace to feel that the
purpose of his visit had been or was likely to be served.Then, all at
once, through a most unlikely channel, the needed personal element was
introduced.“Mamma tells me,” she said, when a moment’s pause had sufficed to
dismiss some other subject, “that she has turned over to you such of
her business as poor old Mr.Clarke used to take care of, and that your
partner, Mr.Tracy, has nothing to do with that particular branch
of your work.I thought partners always shared
everything.”

“Oh, not at all,” replied Horace.Tracy, for example, has railroad
business which he keeps to himself.He is the attorney for this section
of the road, and of course that is a personal appointment.He couldn’t
share it with me, any more than the man in the story could make his wife
and children corporals because he had been made one himself.Tracy was expressly mentioned by your mother as not to be included
in the transfer of business.It was her notion.”

“Ah, indeed!” said that young woman, with a slight instantaneous lifting
of the black brows which Horace did not catch.Isn’t he nice?”

“Well, yes; he’s an extremely good fellow, in his way,” the partner
admitted, looking down at his glossy boots in well-simulated hesitation.“That little word ‘nice’ means so many things upon feminine lips,
you know,” he added with a smile.“Perhaps he wouldn’t answer your
definition of it all around.He’s very honest, and he is a prodigious
worker, but--well, to be frank, he’s farm bred, and I daresay your
mother suspected the existence of--what shall I say?--an uncouth side?Really, I don’t think that there was anything more than that in it.”

“So you furnish the polish, and he the honesty and industry?Is that
it?”

The words were distinctly unpleasant, and Horace looked up swiftly to
the speaker’s face, feeling that his own was flushed.But Miss Kate was
smiling at him, with a quizzical light dancing in her eyes, and this
reassured him on the instant.Evidently she felt herself on easy terms
with him, and this was merely a bit of playful chaff.“We don’t put it quite in that way,” he said, with an answering laugh.“It would be rather egotistical, on both sides.”

“Nowadays everybody resents that imputation as if it were a cardinal
sin.There was a time when self-esteem was taken for granted.I suppose
it went out with chain-armor and farthingales.” She spoke in a musing
tone, and added after a tiny pause, “That must have been a happy time,
at least for those who wore the armor and the brocades.”

Horace leaped with avidity at the opening.“Those were the days of
romance,” he said, with an effort at the cooing effect in his voice.“Perhaps they were not so altogether lovely as our fancy paints them;
but, all the same, it is very sweet to have the fancy.Whether it be
historically true or not, those who possess it are rich in their own
mind’s right.They can always escape from the grimy and commercial
conditions of this present work-a-day life.All one’s finer senses can
feed, for example, on a glowing account of an old-time tournament--with
the sun shining on the armor and burnished shields, and the waving
plumes and iron-clad horses and the heralds in tabards, and the rows of
fair ladies clustered about the throne--as it is impossible to do on the
report of a meeting of a board of directors, even when they declare you
an exceptionally large dividend.”

The young man kept a close watch upon this flow of words as it
proceeded, and felt satisfied with it.The young woman seemed to like it
too, for she had sunk back into her chair with an added air of ease, and
looked at him now with what he took to be a more sympathetic glance, as
she made answer:

“Why, you are positively romantic, Mr.Boyce!”

“Me?My dear Miss Minster, I am the most sentimental person alive,”
 Horace protested gayly.“Don’t you find that it interferes with your profession?” she asked,
with that sparkle of banter in her dark eyes which he began to find so
delicious.“I thought lawyers had to eschew sentiment.Or perhaps you
supply _that_, too, in this famous partnership of yours!”

Horace laughed with pleasure.“Would you like me the less if I admitted
it?” he queried.“How could I?” she replied on the instant, still with the smile which
kept him from shaping a harsh interpretation of her words.“But isn’t
Thessaly a rather incongruous place for sentimental people?We have no
tourney-field--only rolling-mills and button-factories and furnaces; and
there isn’t a knight, much less a herald in a tabard, left in the whole
village.Their places have been taken by moulders and puddlers.So what
will the minstrel do then, poor thing?”

“Let him come here sometimes,” said the young man, in the gravely ardent
tone which this sort of situation demanded.“Let him come here, and
forget that this is the nineteenth century; forget time and Thessaly
altogether.”

“Oh, but mamma wouldn’t like that at all; I mean about your forgetting
so much.She expects you particularly to remember both time _and_
Thessaly.No, decidedly; that would never do!”

The smile and the glance were intoxicating.The young man made his
plunge.“But _may_ I come?” His voice had become low and vibrant, and it went on
eagerly: “May I come if I promise to remember everything; if I swear
to remember nothing else save what you--and your mother--would have me
charge my memory with?”

“We are always glad to see our friends on Tuesdays, from two to five.”

“But I am not in the plural,” he urged, gently.“We are,” she made answer, still watching him with a smile, from where
she half-reclined in the easy-chair.Her face was in the shadow of the
heavier under-curtains; the mellow light gave it a uniform tint of ivory
washed with rose, and enriched the wonder of her eyes, and softened into
melting witchery the lines of lips and brows and of the raven diadem of
curls upon her forehead.“Yes; in that the graces and charms of a thousand perfect women are
centred here in one,” murmured Horace.It was in his heart as well as
his head to say more, but now she rose abruptly at this, with a laugh
which for the instant disconcerted him.“Oh, I foresee _such_ a future for this firm of yours,” she cried, with
high merriment alike in voice and face.As they both stood in the full light of the window, the young man
somehow seemed to miss that yielding softness in her face which had
lulled his sense and fired his senses in the misleading shadows of the
curtain.It was still a very beautiful face, but there was a great deal
of self-possession in it.Perhaps it would be as well just now to go no
further.“We must try to live up to your good opinion, and your kindly forecast,”
 he said, as he momentarily touched the hand she offered him.“You cannot
possibly imagine how glad I am to have braved the conventionalities in
calling, and to have found you at home.It has transformed the rural
Sunday from a burden into a beatitude.”

“How pretty, Mr.Is there any message for mamma?”

“Oh, why did you say that?” He ventured upon a tone of mock vexation.“I wanted so much to go away with the fancy that this was an enchanted
palace, and that you were shut up alone in it, waiting for--”

“Tuesdays, from two till five,” she broke in, with a bow, in the same
spirit of amiable raillery, and so he said good-by and made his way out.Horace took a long
walk before he finally turned his steps homeward, and pondered these
problems excitedly in his mind.On the whole, he concluded that he could
win her.That she was for herself better worth the winning than even for
her million, he said to himself over and over again with rapture.*****

Miss Kate went up-stairs and into the sitting-room common to the
sisters, in which Ethel lay on the sofa in front of the fire-place.She
knelt beside this sofa, and held her hands over the subdued flame of the
maple sticks on the hearth.“It is so cold down in the parlor,” she remarked, by way of explanation.“He stayed an unconscionable while,” said Ethel.“What could he have
talked about?I had almost a mind to waive my headache and come down to
find out.It was a full hour.”

“He wouldn’t have thanked you if you had, my little girl,” replied Kate
with a smile.“Does he dislike little girls of nineteen so much?How unique!”

“No; but he came to make love to the big girl; that is why.”

Ethel sat bolt upright.“You don’t mean it!” she said, with her hazel
eyes wide open.“_He_ did,” was the sententious reply.Kate was busy warming the backs
of her hands now.And I lay here all the while, and never had so much as a
premonition.Was it very,
_very_ funny?Make haste and tell me.”

“Well, it _was_ funny, after a fashion.At least, we both laughed a good
deal.”

“How touching!Well?”

“That is all.I laughed at him, and he laughed--I suppose it must have
been at me--and he paid me some quite thrilling compliments, and
I replied, ‘Tuesdays, from two to five,’ like an educated
jackdaw--and--that was all.”

“What a romance!How could you think of such a clever answer, right on
the spur of the moment, too?But I always said you were the bright
one of the family, Kate.Perhaps one’s mind works better in the cold,
anyway.But I think he _might_ have knelt down.You should have put him
close to the register.I daresay the cold stiffened his joints.”

“Will you ever be serious, child?”

Ethel took her sister’s head in her hands and turned it gently, so that
she might look into the other’s face.“Is it possible that _you_ are serious, Kate?” she asked, in tender
wonderment.The elder girl laughed, and lifted herself to sit on the sofa beside
Ethel.“No, no; of course it isn’t possible,” she said, and put her arm about
the invalid’s slender waist.“But he’s great fun to talk to.I chaffed
him to my heart’s content, and he saw what I meant, every time, and
didn’t mind in the least, and gave me as good as I sent.It’s such a
relief to find somebody you can say saucy things to, and be quite sure
they understand them.I began by disliking him--and he _is_ as conceited
as a popinjay--but then he comprehended everything so perfectly, and
talked so well, that positively I found myself enjoying it.And he knew
his own mind, too, and was resolved to say nice things to me, and said
them, whether I liked or not.”

“But _did_ you ‘like,’ Kate?”

“No-o, I think not,” the girl replied, musingly.“But, all the same,
there was a kind of satisfaction in hearing them, don’t you know.”

The younger girl drew her sister’s head down to her shoulder, and
caressed it with her thin, white fingers.“You are not going to let your mind drift into anything foolish, Kate?”
 she said, with a quaver of anxiety in her tone.“You don’t know the man.You told me so, even from what you saw of him
on the train coming from New York.You said he patronized everybody and
everything, and didn’t have a good word to say for any one.Don’t you
know you did?And those first impressions are always nearest the truth.”

This recalled something to Kate’s mind.“You are right, puss,” she said.“It _is_ a failing of his.He spoke to-day almost contemptuously of
his partner--that Mr.Tracy whom I met in the milliner’s shop; and that
annoyed me at the time, for I liked Mr.Tracy’s looks and talk very much
indeed, _I_ shouldn’t call him uncouth, at all.”

“That was that Boyce man’s word, was it?” commented Ethel.“Well, then,
I think that beside his partner, he is a pretentious, disagreeable
monkey--there!”

Kate smiled at her sister’s vehemence.“At least it is an unprejudiced
judgment,” she said.“You don’t know either of them.”

“But I’ve seen them both,” replied Ethel, conclusively.In the great field of armed politics in Europe, every now and again
there arises a situation which everybody agrees must inevitably result
in war.Yet just when the newspapers have reached their highest state
of excitement, and “sensational incidents” and “significant occurrences”
 are crowding one another in the hurly-burly of alarmist despatches with
utmost impressiveness, somehow the cloud passes away, and the sun comes
out again--and nothing has happened.The sun did not precisely shine for Horace Boyce in the weeks which now
ensued, but at least the crisis that had threatened to engulf him was
curiously delayed.Tenney did not even ask him, on that dreaded
Monday, what decision he had arrived at.A number of other Mondays went
by, and still no demand was made upon him to announce his choice.On the
few occasions when he met his father’s partner, it was the pleasure of
that gentleman to talk on other subjects.The young man began to regain his equanimity.The February term of Oyer
and Terminer had come and gone, and Horace was reasonably satisfied with
the forensic display he had made.It would have been much better, he
knew, if he had not been worried about the other thing; but, as it was,
he had won two of the four cases in which he appeared, had got on well
with the judge, who invited him to dinner at the Dearborn House, and
had been congratulated on his speeches by quite a number of lawyers.His
foothold in Thessaly was established.Matters about the office had not gone altogether to his liking, it was
true.For some reason, Reuben seemed all at once to have become more
distant and formal with him.Horace could not dream that this arose from
the discoveries his partner had made at the milliner’s shop, and so put
the changed demeanor down vaguely to Reuben’s jealousy of his success
in court.He was sorry that this was so, because he liked Reuben
personally, and the silly fellow ought to be glad that he had such a
showy and clever partner, instead of sulking.Horace began to harbor the
notion that a year of this partnership would probably be enough for him.The Citizens’ Club had held two meetings, and Horace felt that the
manner in which he had presided and directed the course of action at
these gatherings had increased his hold upon the town.Nearly fifty
men had now joined the club, and next month they were to discuss the
question of a permanent habitation.They all seemed to like him
as president, and nebulous thoughts about being the first mayor of
Thessaly, when the village should get its charter, now occasionally
floated across the young man’s mind.He had called at the Minster house on each Tuesday since that
conversation with Miss Kate, and now felt himself to be on terms almost
intimate with the whole household.He could not say, even to himself,
that his suit had progressed much; but Miss Kate seemed to like him, and
her mother, whom he also had seen at other times on matters of business,
was very friendly indeed.Thus affairs stood with the rising young lawyer at the beginning of
March, when he one day received a note sent across by hand from Mr.Tenney, asking him to come over at once to the Dearborn House, and meet
him in a certain room designated by number.Horace was conscious of some passing surprise that Tenney should make
appointments in private rooms of the local hotel, but as he crossed the
street to the old tavern and climbed the stairs to the apartment named,
it did not occur to him that the summons might signify that the crisis
which had darkened the first weeks of February was come again.He found Tenney awaiting him at the door, and after he had perfunctorily
shaken hands with him, discovered that there was another man inside,
seated at the table in the centre of the parlor, under the chandelier.This man was past middle-age, and both his hair and the thick, short
beard which covered his chin and throat were nearly white.Horace noted
first that his long upper lip was shaven, and this grated upon him
afresh as one of the least lovely of provincial American customs.Then
he observed that this man had eyes like Tenney’s in expression, though
they were blue instead of gray; and as this resemblance came to him,
Tenney spoke:

“Judge Wendover, this is the young man we’ve been talking about--Mr.Horace Boyce, son of my partner, the General, you know.”

The mysterious New Yorker had at last appeared on the scene, then.He
did not look very mysterious, or very metropolitan either, as he rose
slowly and reached his hand across the table for Horace to shake.It was
a fat and inert hand, and the Judge himself, now that he stood up, was
seen to be also fat and dumpy in figure, with a bald head, noticeably
high at the back of the skull, and a loose, badly fitted suit of
clothes.“Sit down,” he said to Horace, much as if that young man had been a
stenographer called in to report a conversation.Horace took the chair
indicated, not over pleased.“I haven’t got much time,” the Judge continued, speaking apparently to
the papers in front of him.“There’s a good deal to do, and I’ve got to
catch that 5.22 train.”

“New Yorkers generally do have to catch trains,” remarked Horace.“So
far as I could see, the few times I’ve been there of late years, that is
always the chief thing on their minds.”

Judge Wendover looked at the young man for the space of a second, and
then turned to Tenney and said abruptly:

“I suppose he knows how the Thessaly Mfg.How it’s
stocked?” He pronounced the three letters with a slurring swiftness,
as if to indicate that there was not time enough for the full word
“manufacturing.”

Horace himself answered the question: “Yes, I know.You represent two
hundred and twenty-five to my clients’ one hundred and seventy-five.”
 The young man held himself erect and alert in his chair, and spoke
curtly.The capital is four hundred thousand dollars--all paid up.Well, we need that much more to go on.”

“How ‘go on’?What do you mean?”

“There’s a new nail machine just out which makes our plant worthless.To
buy that, and make the changes, will cost a round four hundred thousand
dollars.Get hold of that machine, and we control the whole United
States market; fail to get it, we go under.That’s the long and short of
it.That’s why we sent for you.”

“I’m very sorry,” said Horace, “but I don’t happen to have four hundred
thousand dollars with me just at the moment.If you’d let me known
earlier, now.”

The Judge looked at him again, with the impersonal point-blank stare
of a very rich and pre-occupied old man.Evidently this young fellow
thought himself a joker.“Don’t fool,” he said, testily.“Business is business, time is money.We can’t increase our capital by law, but we can borrow.You haven’t got
any money, but the Minster women have.It’s to their interest to stand
by us.They’ve got almost as much in the concern as we have.I’ve seen
the widow and explained the situation to her.But
she won’t back our paper, because her husband on his death-bed made her
promise never to do that for anybody.Curious prejudice these countrymen
have about indorsing notes.Business would stagnate in a day without
indorsing.Let her issue four hundred
thousand dollars in bonds on the iron-works.That’s about a third what
they are worth.She’ll consent to that if you talk to her.”

“Oh, _that’s_ where I come in, is it?” said Horace.“Where else did you suppose?” asked the Judge, puffing for breath, as he
eyed the young man.No answer was forthcoming, and the New Yorker went on:

“The interest on those bonds will cost her twenty-four thousand dollars
per year for a year or two, but it will make her shares in the Mfg.Company a real property instead of a paper asset.Besides, I’ve shown
her a way to-day, by going into the big pig-iron trust that is being
formed, of making twice that amount in half the time.Now, she’s going
to talk with you about both these things.Your play is to advise her to
do what I’ve suggested.”

“Why should I?” Horace put the question bluntly.“I’ll tell you,” answered the Judge, who seemed to like this direct
way of dealing.“You can make a pot of money by it.Tenney and I are not fishing with pin-hooks and thread.We’ve got nets,
young man.You tie up to us, and we’ll take care of you.When you see a
big thing like this travelling your way, hitch on to it.That’s the way
fortunes are made.And you’ve got a chance that don’t come to one young
fellow in ten thousand.”

“I should think he had,” put in Mr.Tenney, who had been a silent but
attentive auditor.“What will happen if I decline?” asked Horace.“She will lose her one hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars and
a good deal more, and you will lose your business with her and with
everybody else.”

“And your father will lose the precious little he’s got left,” put in
Mr.“Upon my word, you are frank,” he said.“There’s no time to be anything else,” replied the Judge.“And why
shouldn’t we be?A great commercial
transaction, involving profits to everybody, is outlined before you.It happens that by my recommendation you are in a place where you can
embarrass its success, for a minute or two, if you have a mind to.But
why in God’s name you should have a mind to, or why you take up time by
pretending to be offish about it, is more than I can make out.Damn it,
sir, you’re not a woman, who wants to be asked a dozen times!You’re a
man, lucky enough to be associated with other men who have their heads
screwed on the right way, and so don’t waste any more time.”

“Oh, that reminds me,” said Horace, “I haven’t thanked you for
recommending me.”

“You needn’t,” replied the Judge, bluntly.“It was Tenney’s doing.I
didn’t know you from a side of sole-leather.But _he_ thought you were
the right man for the place.”

“I hope you are not disappointed,” Horace remarked, with a questioning
smile.“A minute will tell me whether I am or not,” the New York man exclaimed,
letting his fat hand fall upon the table.Are you with us, or against us?”

“At all events not against you, I should hope.”

“Damn the man!Hasn’t he got a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ in him?--Tenney, you’re to
blame for this,” snapped Wendover, pulling his watch from the fob in his
tightened waistband, and scowling at the dial.“I’ll have to run, as it
is.”

He rose again from his chair, and bent a sharp gaze upon Horace’s face.“Well, young man,” he demanded, “what is your answer?”

“I think I can see my way to obliging you,” said Horace, hesitatingly.“But, of course, I want to know just how I am to stand in the--”

“That Tenney will see to,” said the Judge, swiftly.He gathered up the
papers on the table, thrust them into a portfolio with a lock on it,
which he gave to Tenney, snatched his hat, and was gone, without a word
of adieu to anybody.“Great man of business, that!” remarked the hardware merchant, after a
moment of silence.Horace nodded assent, but his mind had not followed the waddling figure
of the financier.It was dwelling perplexedly upon the outcome of this
adventure upon which he seemed to be fully embarked, and trying to
establish a conviction that it would be easy to withdraw from it at
will, later on.“He can make millions where other men only see thousands, and they
beyond their reach,” pursued Tenney, in an abstracted voice.“When he’s
your friend, there isn’t anything you can’t do; and he’s as straight
as a string, too, so long as he likes a man.But he’s a terror to have
ag’in you.”

Horace sat closeted with Tenney for a long time, learning the details of
the two plans which had been presented to Mrs.Minster, and which he
was expected to support.The sharpest scrutiny could detect nothing
dishonest in them.Both involved mere questions of expediency--to loan
money in support of one’s stock, and to enter a trust which was to raise
the price of one’s wares--and it was not difficult for Horace to argue
himself into the belief that both promised to be beneficial to his
client.At the close of the interview Horace said plainly to his companion that
he saw no reason why he should not advise Mrs.Minster to adopt both of
the Judge’s recommendations.“They seem perfectly straightforward,” he
added.“Did you expect anything else, knowing me all this while?” asked Tenney,
reproachfully.CHAPTER XXI.--REUBEN’S MOMENTOUS FIRST VISIT.SOME ten days later, Reuben Tracy was vastly surprised one afternoon to
receive a note from Miss Minster.The office-boy said that the messenger
was waiting for an answer, and had been warned to hand the missive to no
one except him.The note ran thus:

Dear Sir: I hope very much that you can find time to call here at our
house during the afternoon.Pray ask for me, and do not mention_ to any
one_ that you are coming._It will not seem to you, I am sure, that I have taken a liberty either
in my request or my injunction, after you have heard the explanation.Sincerely yours,_

Kate Minster.Reuben sent back a written line to say that he would come within
an hour, and then tried to devote himself to the labor of finishing
promptly the task he had in hand.It was a very simple piece of
conveyancing--work he generally performed with facility--but to-day
he found himself spoiling sheet after sheet of “legal cap,” by stupid
omissions and unconscious inversions of the quaint legal phraseology.His thoughts would not be enticed away from the subject of the note--the
perfume of which was apparent upon the musty air of the office, even as
it lay in its envelope before him.There was nothing remarkable in
the fact that Miss Minster wanted to see him--of course, it was with
reference to Jessica’s plan for the factory-girls--but the admonition
to secrecy puzzled him a good deal.The word “explanation,” too, had a
portentous look.Minster had been closeted in the library with her lawyer, Mr.Horace Boyce, for fully two hours that forenoon, and afterward, in the
hearing of her daughters, had invited him to stay for luncheon.He
had pleaded pressure of business as an excuse for not accepting the
invitation, and had taken a hurried departure forthwith.Boyce had never been
asked before to the family table, and there was something pre-occupied,
almost brusque, in his manner of declining the exceptional honor and
hurrying off as he did.They noted, too, that their mother seemed
unwontedly excited about something, and experience told them that her
calm Knickerbocker nature was not to be stirred by trivial matters.So, while they lingered over the jellied dainties of the light noonday
meal, Kate made bold to put the question:

“Something is worrying you, mamma,” she said.“Is it anything that we
know about?”

“Mercy, no!” Mrs.Of course, I’m
not worried.What an idea!”

“I thought you acted as if there was something on your mind,” said Kate.“Well, you would act so, too, if--” There Mrs.“If what, mamma?” put in Ethel.“_We knew_ there was something.”

“He sticks to it that issuing bonds is not mortgaging, and, of course,
he ought to know; but I remember that when they bonded our town for the
Harlem road, father said it _was_ a mortgage,” answered the mother, not
over luminously.What mortgage?” Kate spoke with emphasis.“We have a right
to know, surely!”

“However, you can see for yourself,” pursued Mrs.Minster, “that the
interest must be more than made up by the extra price iron will bring
when the trust puts up prices.That is what trusts are for--to put up
prices.You can read that in the papers every day.”

“Mother, what have you done?”

Kate had pushed back her plate, and leaned over the table now, flashing
sharp inquiry into her mother’s face.“What have you done?” she repeated.“I insist upon knowing, and so does
Ethel.”

Mrs.Minster’s wise and resolute countenance never more thoroughly
belied the condition of her mind than at this moment.She felt that
she did not rightly know just what she had done, and vague fears as to
consequences rose to possess her soul.“If I had spoken to my mother in that way when I was your age, I should
have been sent from the room--big girl though I was.I’m sure I can’t
guess where you take your temper from.The Mauverensens were always----”

This was not satisfactory, and Kate broke into the discourse about her
maternal ancestors peremptorily:

“I don’t care about all that.But some business step has been taken, and
it must concern Ethel and me, and I wish you would tell us plainly what
it is.”

“The Thessaly Company found it necessary to buy the right of a new nail
machine, and they had to have money to do it with, and so some bonds are
to be issued to provide it.It is quite the customary thing, I assure
you, in business affairs.Only, what I maintained was that it _was_
the same as a mortgage, but Judge Wendover and Mr.Boyce insisted it
wasn’t.”

It is, perhaps, an interesting commentary upon the commercial education
of these two wealthy young ladies, that they themselves were unable to
form an opinion upon this debated point.“Bonds are something like stocks,” Ethel explained.But mortgages must be different, for they are kept
in the county clerk’s office.I know that, because Ella Dupont’s father
used to get paid fifty cents apiece for searching after them there.They must have been very careless to lose them so often.”

Mrs.Minster in some way regarded this as a defence of her action, and
took heart.“Well, then, I also signed an agreement which puts us into
the great combination they’re getting up--all the iron manufacturers
of Pennsylvania and Ohio and New York--called the Amalgamated Pig-Iron
Trust.I was very strongly advised to do that; and it stands to reason
that prices will go up, because trusts limit production.Surely, that is
plain enough.”

“You ought to have consulted us,” said Kate, not the less firmly because
her advice, she knew, would have been of no earthly value.“You have a
power-of-attorney to sign for us, but it was really for routine matters,
so that the property might act as a whole.In a great matter like this,
I think we should have known about it first.”

“But you don’t know anything about it now, even when I _have_ told you!”
 Mrs.Minster pointed out, not without justification for her triumphant
tone.“It is perfectly useless for us women to try and understand these
things.Our only safety is in being advised by men who do know, and in
whom we have perfect confidence.”

“But Mr.Boyce is a very young man, and you scarcely know him,” objected
Ethel.“He was strongly recommended to me by Judge Wendover,” replied the
mother.“And pray who recommended Judge Wendover?” asked Kate, with latent
sarcasm.“Why, he was bom in the same town with me!” said Mrs.Minster, as if
no answer could be more sufficient.“My grandfather Douw Mauverensen’s
sister married a Wendover.”

“But about the bonds,” pursued the eldest daughter.“What amount of
money do they represent?”

“Four hundred thousand dollars.”

The girls opened their eyes at this, and their mother hastened to add:
“But it really isn’t very important, when you come to look at it.It is
only what Judge Wendover calls making one hand wash the other.The money
raised on the bonds will put the Thessaly Company on its feet, and so
then that will pay dividends, and so we will get back the interest,
and more too.The bonds we can buy back whenever we choose._I_ managed
that, because when Judge Wendover said the bonds would be perfectly
good, I said, ‘If they are so good, why don’t you take them yourself?’
And he seemed struck with that and said he would.They didn’t get much
the best of me there!”

Somehow this did not seem very clear to Kate.“If he had the money to
take the bonds, what was the need of any bonds at all?” she asked.“Why
didn’t he buy this machinery himself?”

“It wouldn’t have been regular; there was some legal obstacle in the
way,” the mother replied.“He explained it to me, but I didn’t quite
catch it.At all events, there _had_ to be bonds.Even _he_ couldn’t see
any way ont of _that_.”

“Well, I hope it is all right,” said Kate, and the conversation lapsed.But upon reflection, in her own room, the matter seemed less and less
all right, and finally, after a long and not very helpful consultation
with her sister, Kate suddenly thought of Reuben Tracy.A second later
she had fully decided to ask his advice, and swift upon this rose the
resolve to summon him immediately.Thus it was that the perfumed note came to be sent.*****

Reuben took the seat in the drawing-room of the Minsters indicated by
the servant who had admitted him, and it did not occur to this member of
the firm of Tracy & Boyce to walk about and look at the pictures, much
less to wonder how many of them were of young men.Even in this dull light he could recognize, on the opposite wall, a
boyhood portrait of the Stephen Minster, Junior, whose early death had
dashed so many hopes, and pointed so many morals to the profit of godly
villagers.He thought about this worthless, brief career, as his eyes
rested on the bright, boyish face of the portrait, with the clear dark
eyes and the fresh-tinted cheeks, and his serious mind filled itself
with protests against the conditions which had made of this heir to
millions a rake and a fool.There was no visible reason why Stephen
Minster’s son should not have been clever and strong, a fit master of
the great part created for him by his father.There must be some blight,
some mysterious curse upon hereditary riches here in America, thought
Reuben, for all at once he found himself persuaded that this was the
rule with most rich men’s sons.Therein lay a terrible menace to the
Republic, he said to himself.Vague musings upon the possibility of
remedying this were beginning to float in his brain--the man could never
contemplate injustices, great or small, without longing to set them
right--when the door opened and the tall young elder daughter of the
Minsters entered.Reuben rose and felt himself making some such obeisance before her in
spirit as one lays at the feet of a queen.What he did in reality or
what he said, left no record on his memory.He had been seated again for some minutes, and had listened with the
professional side of his mind to most of what story she had to tell,
before he regained control of his perceptions and began to realize
that the most beautiful woman he had ever seen was confiding to him her
anxieties, as a friend even more than as a lawyer.The situation was so
wonderful that it needed all the control he had over his faculties to
grasp and hold it.Always afterward he thought of the moment in which
his confusion of mind vanished, and he, sitting on the sofa facing her
chair, was able to lean back a little and talk as if he had known her a
long time, as the turning-point in his whole life.What it was in her power to tell him about the transaction which had
frightened her did not convey a very clear idea to his mind.A mortgage
of four hundred thousand dollars had been placed upon the Minsters’
property to meet the alleged necessities of a company in which they were
large owners, and their own furnaces had been put under the control of
a big trust formed by other manufacturers, presumably for the benefit of
all its members.This was what he made out of her story.“On their face,” he said, “these things seem regular enough.The
doubtful point, of course, would be whether, in both transactions, your
interests and those of your family were perfectly safe-guarded.This is
something I can form no opinion about.Boyce must have looked
out for that and seen that you got ‘value received.’”

“Ah, Mr.That is just the question,” Kate answered, swiftly.“_Has_ he looked out for it?”

“Curiously enough he has never spoken with me, even indirectly, about
having taken charge of your mother’s business,” replied Reuben, slowly.“But he is a competent man, with a considerable talent for detail, and a
good knowledge of business, as well as of legal forms.I should say you
might be perfectly easy about his capacity to guard your interests; oh,
yes, entirely easy.”

“It isn’t his capacity that I was thinking about,” said the young woman,
hesitatingly.“I wanted to ask you about him himself--about the _man_.”

Reuben smiled in an involuntary effort to conceal his uneasiness.“They
say that no man is a hero to his valet, you know,” he made answer.“In
the same way business men ought not to be cross-examined on the opinions
which the community at large may have concerning their partners.Boyce
and I occupy, in a remote kind of way, the relations of husband and
wife.We maintain a public attitude toward each other of great respect
and admiration, and are bound to do so by the same rules which govern
the heads of a family.And we mustn’t talk about each other.You never
would go to one of a married couple for an opinion about the other.If
the opinion were all praise, you would set it down to prejudice; if it
were censure, the fact of its source would shock you.Oh, no, partners
mustn’t discuss each other.That would be letting all the bars down with
a vengeance.”

He had said all this with an effort at lightness, and ended, as he had
begun, with a smile.Kate, looking intently into his face, did not smile
in response.“Perhaps I was wrong to ask you,” she answered, after a little pause,
and in a colder tone.“You men do stand by each other so splendidly.It is why your sex possesses the earth,
and the fulness thereof.”

It was easier for Reuben to smile naturally this time.“But I
illustrated my position by an example of a still finer reticence,” he
said; “the finest one can imagine--that of husband and wife.”

“You are not married, I believe, Mr.Tracy,” was her comment, and its
edge was apparent.“No,” he said, and stopped short.No other words came to his tongue, and
his thoughts seemed to have gone away into somebody else’s mind, leaving
only a formless blank, over which hung, like a canopy of cloud, a
depressing uneasiness lest his visit should not, after all, turn out a
success.“Then you think I have needlessly worried myself,” she was saying when
he came back into mental life again.“Not altogether that, either,” he replied, moving in his seat, and
sitting upright like a man who has shaken himself out of a disposition
to doze.“So far as you have described them, the transactions may easily
be all right.The sum seems a large one to raise for the purchase of machinery, and
it might be well to inquire into the exact nature and validity of the
purchase.As for the terms upon which you lend the money to the company,
of course Mr.In the matter of the trust, I
cannot speak at all.All such
combinations excite my anger.But as a business operation it may
improve your property; always assuming that you are capably and fairly
represented in the control of the trust.Boyce has
attended to that.”

“But don’t you see,” broke in the girl, “it is all Mr.It is
to be assumed that he will do this, to be taken for granted he will
do that, to be hoped that he has done the other._That_ is what I am
anxious about._Will_ he do them?”

“And that, of course, is what I cannot tell you,” said Reuben.“How can
I know?”

“But you can find out.”

The lawyer knitted his ordinarily placid brows for a moment in thought.“I am afraid not,” he said, slowly.“I
should be very angry if the railroad people, for example, set him to
examining what I had done for them; angry with him, especially, for
accepting such a commission.”

“I am sorry, Mr.Tracy, if I seem to have proposed anything dishonorable
to you,” Miss Kate responded, with added formality in voice and manner.“I did not mean to.”

“How could I imagine such a thing?” said Reuben, more readily than was
his wont.“I only sought to make a peculiar situation clear to you, who
are not familiar with such things.If I asked him questions, or meddled
in the matter at all, he would resent it; and by usage he would be
justified in resenting it.That is how it stands.”

“Then you cannot help me, after all!” She spoke despondingly now, with
the low, rich vibration in her tone which Reuben had dwelt so often on
in memory since he first heard it.“And I had counted so much upon your
aid,” she added, with a sigh.“I would do a great deal to be of use to you,” the young man said,
earnestly, and looked her in the face with calm frankness; “a great
deal, Miss Minster, but--”

“Yes, but that ‘but’ means everything.I repeat, in this situation you
can do nothing.”

“I cannot take a brief against my partner.”

“I should not suggest that again, Mr.“I can see
that I was wrong there, and you were right.”

“Don’t put it in that way.I merely pointed out a condition of business relations which had not
occurred to you.”

“And there is no other way?”

Another way had dawned on Reuben’s mind, but it was so bold and
precipitous that he hesitated to consider it seriously at first.When
it did take form and force itself upon him, he said, half quaking at his
own audacity:

“No other way--while--he remains my partner.” Bright women discover many
obscure things by the use of that marvellous faculty we call intuition,
but they have by no means reduced its employment to an exact science.Sometimes their failure to discover more obvious things is equally
remarkable.At this moment, for example, Kate’s feminine wits did not
in the least help her to read the mind of the man before her, or the
meaning in his words.In truth, they misled her, for she heard only
an obstinate reiteration of an unpleasant statement, and set her teeth
together with impatience as she heard it.And had she even kept these teeth tight clinched, and said nothing, the
man might have gone on in self-explanation, and made clear to her her
mistake.But her vexation was too imperative for silence.“I am very sorry to have taken up your time, Mr.Tracy,” she said,
stiffly, and rose from her chair.“I am so little informed about these
matters, I really imagined you could help us.Pray forgive me.”

If Reuben could have realized, as he stood in momentary embarrassment,
that this beautiful lady before him had fairly bitten her tongue to
restrain it from adding that he might treat this as a professional call,
or in some other way suggesting that he would be paid for his time, he
might have been more embarrassed still, and angry as well.But it did not occur to him to feel annoyance--at least, toward her.He
really was sorry that no way of being of help to her seemed immediately
available, and he thought of this more in fact than he did of the
personal aspects of his failure to justify her invitation.He noted that
the faint perfume which her dress exhaled as she rose was identical with
that of the letter of invitation, and thought to himself that he would
preserve that letter, and then that it would not be quite warranted by
the circumstances, and so found himself standing silent before
her, sorely reluctant to go away, and conscious that there must be a
sympathetic light in his eyes which hers did not reflect.“I am truly grieved if you are disappointed,” he managed to say at last.“Oh, it is nothing, Mr.Tracy,” she said, politely, and moved toward
the door.“It was my ignorance of business rules.I am so sorry to have
troubled you.”

Reuben followed her through the hall to the outer door, wondering if she
would offer to shake hands with him, and putting both his stick and hat
in his left hand to free the other in case she did.On the doorstep she did give him her hand, and in that moment, ruled by
a flash of impulse, he heard himself saying to her:

“If anything happens, if you learn anything, if you need me, you _won’t_
fail to call me, will you?”

Then the door closed, and as Reuben walked away he did not seem able to
recall whether she had answered his appeal or not.In sober fact, it
had scarcely sounded like his appeal at all.The voice was certainly one
which had never been heard in the law-office down on Main Street or in
the trial-chamber of the Dearborn County Court-House over the way.It
had sounded more like the voice of an actor in the theatre--like a Romeo
murmuring up to the sweet girl in the balcony.Reuben walked straight to his office, and straight through to the little
inner apartment appropriated to his private uses.There were some people
in the large room talking with his partner, but he scarcely observed
their presence as he passed.He unlocked a tiny drawer in the top of
his desk, cleared out its contents brusquely, dusted the inside with his
hand kerchief, and then placed within it a perfumed note which he took
from his pocket.When he had turned the key upon this souvenir, he drew a long breath,
lighted a cigar, and sat down, with his feet on the table and his
thoughts among the stars.CHAPTER XXII.--“SAY THAT THERE IS NO ANSWER.”

 Reuben allowed his mind to drift at will in this novel, enchanted
channel for a long time, until the clients outside had taken their
departure, and his cigar had burned out, and his partner had sauntered
in to mark by some casual talk the fact that the day was done.What this mind shaped into dreams and desires and pictures in its
musings, it would not be an easy matter to detail.The sum of the
revery--or, rather, the central goal up to which every differing train
of thought somehow managed to lead him--was that Kate Minster was the
most beautiful, the cleverest, the dearest, the loveliest, the most to
be adored and longed for, of all mortal women.If he did not say to himself, in so many words, “I love her,” it was
because the phraseology was unfamiliar to him.That eternal triplet
of tender verb and soulful pronouns, which sings itself in our more
accustomed hearts to music set by the stress of our present senses--now
the gay carol of springtime, sure and confident; now the soft twilight
song, wherein the very weariness of bliss sighs forth a blessing;
now the vibrant, wooing ballad of a graver passion, with tears close
underlying rapture; now, alas!the dirge of hopeless loss, with wailing
chords which overwhelm like curses, smitten upon heartstrings strained
to the breaking--these three little words did not occur to him.But no
lover self-confessed could have dreamed more deliciously.He had spoken with her twice now--once when she was wrapped in furs and
wore a bonnet, and once in her own house, where she was dressed in
a creamy white gown, with a cord and tassels about the waist.These
details were tangible possessions in the treasure-house of his memory.The first time she had charmed and gratified his vague notions of what a
beautiful and generous woman should be; he had been unspeakably pleased
by the enthusiasm with which she threw herself into the plan for helping
the poor work-girls of the town.On this second occasion she had been
concerned only about the safety of her own money, and that of her
family, and yet his liking for her had flared up into something very
like a consuming flame.If there was a paradox here, the lawyer did not
see it.There floated across his mind now and again stray black motes of
recollection that she had not seemed altogether pleased with him on this
later occasion, but they passed away without staining the bright colors
of his meditation.It did not matter what she had thought or said.The
fact of his having been there with her, the existence of that little
perfumed letter tenderly locked up in the desk before him, the
breathing, smiling, dark-eyed picture of her which glowed in his
brain--these were enough.Once before--once only in his life--the personality of a woman had
seized command of his thoughts.Years ago, when he was still the
schoolteacher at the Burfield, he had felt himself in love with Annie
Fairchild, surely the sweetest flower that all the farm-lands of
Dearborn had ever produced.He had come very near revealing his
heart--doubtless the girl did know well enough of his devotion--but she
was in love with her cousin Seth, and Reuben had come to realize this,
and so had never spoken, but had gone away to New York instead.He could remember that for a time he was unhappy, and even so late as
last autumn, after nearly four years had gone by, the mere thought
that she commended her protégée, Jessica Lawton, to his kindness, had
thrilled him with something of the old feeling.But now she seemed all
at once to have faded away into indistinct remoteness, like the figure
of some little girl he had known in his boyhood and had never seen
since.Curiously enough, the apparition of Jessica Law-ton rose and took form
in his thoughts, as that of Annie Fairchild passed into the shadows of
long ago.She, at least, was not a schoolgirl any more, but a full-grown
woman.He could remember that the glance in her eyes when she looked at
him was maturely grave and searching.She had seemed very grateful
to him for calling upon her, and he liked to recall the delightful
expression of surprised satisfaction which lighted up her face when she
found that both Miss Minster and he would help her.They two were to work together to further and
fulfil this plan of Jessica’s!Now he came to think of it, the young lady had never said a word to-day
about Jessica and the plan--and, oddly enough, too, he had never once
remembered it either.But then Miss Minster had other matters on her
mind.She was frightened about the mortgages and the trust, and anxious
to have his help to set her fears at rest.Reuben began to wonder once more what there was really in those fears.As he pondered on this, all the latent distrust of his partner which
had been growing up for weeks in his mind suddenly swelled into a great
dislike.There came to him, all at once, the recollection of those
mysterious and sinister words he had overheard exchanged between his
partner and Tenney, and it dawned upon his slow-working consciousness
that that strange talk about a “game in his own hands” had never been
explained by events.Then, in an instant, he realized instinctively that
here _was_ the game.It was at this juncture that Horace strolled into the presence of his
partner.He had his hands in his trousers pockets, and a cigar between
his teeth.“Ferguson has been here again,” he said, nonchalantly, “and brought his
brother with him.He can’t make up his mind whether to appeal the case
or not.He’d like to try it, but the expense scares him.I told him at
last that I was tired of hearing about the thing, and didn’t give a damn
what he did, as long as he only shut up and gave me a rest.”

Reuben did not feel interested in the Fergusons.He looked his partner
keenly, almost sternly, in the eye, and said:

“You have never mentioned to me that Mrs.Minster had put her business
in your hands.”

Horace flushed a little, and returned the other’s gaze with one equally
truculent.“It didn’t seem to be necessary,” he replied, curtly.“It is private
business.”

“Nothing was said about your having private business when the firm was
established,” commented Reuben.“That may be,” retorted Horace.“But you have your railroad affairs--a
purely personal matter.Why shouldn’t I have an equal right?”

“I don’t say you haven’t.What I am thinking of is your secrecy in
the matter.I hate to have people act in that way, as if I couldn’t be
trusted.”

Horace had never heard Reuben speak in this tone before.The whole
Minster business had perplexed and harassed him into a state of nervous
irritability these last few weeks, and it was easy for him now to snap
at provocation.“At least _I_ may be trusted to mind my own affairs,” he said, with
cutting niceness of enunciation and a lowering scowl of the brows.There came a little pause, for Reuben saw himself face to face with
a quarrel, and shrank from precipitating it needlessly.Perhaps the
rupture would be necessary, but he would do nothing to hasten it out of
mere ill-temper.“That isn’t the point,” he said at last, looking up with more calmness
into the other’s face.“I simply commented on your having taken such
pains to keep the whole thing from me.Why on earth should you have
thought that essential?”

Horace answered with a question.“Who told you about it?” he asked, in a
surly tone.“Old ’Squire Gedney mentioned it first.Others have spoken of it
since.”

“Well, what am I to understand?Do you intend to object to my keeping
the business?I may tell you that it was by the special request of my
clients that I undertook it alone, and, as they laid so much stress on
that, it seemed to me best not to speak of it at all to you.”

“Why?”

“To be frank,” said Horace, with a cold gleam in his eye, “I didn’t
imagine that it would be particularly pleasant to you to learn that the
Minster ladies desired not to have you associated with their affairs.It
seemed one of those things best left unsaid.However, you have it now.”

Reuben felt the disagreeable intention of his partner’s words even
more than he did their bearing upon the dreams from which he had been
awakened.He had by this time perfectly made up his mind about Horace,
and realized that a break-up was inevitable.The conviction that this
young man was dishonest carried with it, however, the suggestion that it
would be wise to probe him and try to learn what he was at.“I wish you would sit down a minute or two,” he said.“I want to talk to
you.”

Horace took a chair, and turned the cigar restlessly around in his
teeth.He was conscious that his nerves were not quite what they should
be.“It seems to me,” pursued Reuben--“I’m speaking as an older lawyer
than you, and an older man--it seems to me that to put a four hundred
thousand dollar mortgage on the Minster property is a pretty big
undertaking for a young man to go into on his own hook, without
consulting anybody.Don’t think I wish to
meddle.Only it seems to me, if I had been in your place, I should have
moved very cautiously and taken advice.“I did take advice,” said Horace.The discovery that Reuben knew of this
mortgage filled him with uneasiness.Schuyler Tenney?” asked Reuben, speaking calmly enough, but
watching with all his eyes.Horace visibly flushed, and
then turned pale.“I decline to be catechised in this way,” he said, nervously shifting
his position on the chair, and then suddenly rising.“Gedney is a
damned, meddlesome, drunken old fool,” he added, with irrelevant
vehemence.“Yes, I’m afraid ‘Cal’ does drink too much,” answered Reuben, with
perfect amiability of tone.He evinced no desire to continue the
conversation, and Horace, after standing for an uncertain moment or
two in the doorway, went out and put on his overcoat.“Am I to take it that you object to my continuing to act as attorney for
these ladies?” he asked from the threshold of the outer room, his voice
shaking a little in spite of itself.“I don’t think I have said that,” replied Reuben.“No, you haven’t _said_ it,” commented the other.“To tell the truth, I haven’t quite cleared up in my own mind just what
I do object to, or how much,” said Reuben, relighting his cigar, and
contemplating his boots crossed on the desk-top.“We’ll talk of this
again.”

“As you like,” muttered young Mr.Then he turned, and went away
without saying good-night.Twilight began to close in upon the winter’s day, but Reuben still sat
in meditation.He had parted with his colleague in anger, and it was
evident enough that the office family was to be broken up; but he
gave scarcely a thought to these things.His mind, in fact, seemed by
preference to dwell chiefly upon the large twisted silken cord which
girdled the waist of that wonderful young woman, and the tasselled ends
of which hung against the white front of her gown like the beads of a
nun.Many variant thoughts about her affairs, about her future, rose in
his mind and pleasantly excited it, but they all in turn merged vaguely
into fancies circling around that glossy rope and weaving themselves
into its strands.It was very near tea-time, and darkness had established itself for the
night in the offices, before Reuben’s vagrant musings prompted him to
action.Upon the spur of the moment, he all at once put down his feet,
lighted the gas over his desk, took out the perfumed letter from its
consecrated resting-place, and began hurriedly to write a reply to it.He had suddenly realized that the memorable interview that afternoon had
been, from her point of view, inconclusive.Five times he worked his way down nearly to the bottom of the page,
and then tore up the sheet.At first he was too expansive; then
the contrasted fault of over-reticence jarred upon him.At last he
constructed this letter, which obtained a reluctant approval from his
critical sense, though it seemed to his heart a pitifully gagged and
blindfolded missive:

Dear Miss Minster: Unfortunately, I was unable this afternoon to see my
way to helping you upon the lines which you suggested.Matters have assumed a somewhat different aspect since our talk.By the
time that you have mastered the details of what you had on your mind, I
may be in a position to consult with you freely upon the whole subject.I want you to believe that I am very anxious to be of assistance to you,
in this as in all other things.Faithfully yours,

Reuben TRacy.Reuben locked up the keepsake note again, fondly entertaining the idea
as he did so that soon there might be others to bear it company.Then he
closed the offices, went down upon the street, and told the first idle
boy he met that he could earn fifty cents by carrying a letter at once
to the home of the Minsters.The money would be his when he returned to
the Dearborn House.“Will there be any answer?” asked the boy.This opened up a new idea to the lawyer.“You might wait and see,” he
said.But the messenger came back in a depressingly short space of time, with
the word that no answer was required.He had hurried both ways with a stem concentration of purpose, and now
he dashed off once more in an even more strenuous face against time
with the half-dollar clutched securely inside his mitten.The Great
Occidental Minstrel Combination was in town, and the boy leaped over
snowbanks, and slid furiously across slippery places, in the earnestness
of his intention not to miss one single joke.The big man whom he left went wearily up the stairs to his room, and
walked therein for aimless hours, and almost scowled as he shook his
head at the waitress who came up to remind him that he had had no
supper.*****

The two Minster sisters had read Reuben’s note together, in the
seclusion of their own sitting-room.They had previously discussed
the fact of his refusal to assist them--for so it translated itself
in Kate’s account of the interview--and had viewed it with almost
displeasure.Ethel was, however, disposed to relent when the letter came.“At least it might be well to write him a polite note,” she said,
“thanking him, and saying that circumstances might arise under which you
would be glad to--to avail yourself, and so on.”

“I don’t think I shall write at all,” Kate replied, glancing over the
lawyer’s missive again.“He took no interest in the thing whatever.And you see how even now he infers that ‘the lines I suggested’ were
dishonorable.”

“I didn’t see that, Kate.”

“Here it is.‘He was unable to see his way,’ and that sort of thing.And
he _said_ himself that the business all seemed regular enough, so far
as he could see.--Say that there is no answer,” she added to the maid at
the door.The two girls sat in silence for a moment in the soft, cosey light
between the fire-place and the lace-shaded lamp.Then Ethel spoke again:

“And you really didn’t like him, Kate?You know you were so enthusiastic
about him, that day you came back from the milliner’s shop.I never
heard you have so much to say about any other man before.”

“That was different,” mused the other.Her voice grew even less kindly,
and the words came swifter as she went on.“_Then_ it was a question of
helping the Lawton girl.He didn’t
hum and haw, and talk about ‘the lines suggested’ to him, then.He could
‘see his way’ very clearly indeed.And
I was childish enough to be taken in by it all.I am vexed with myself
when I think of it.”

“Are you sure you are being quite fair, Kate?” pale Ethel asked, putting
her hand caressingly on the sister’s knee.He _says_ he wants to help you; and he hints, too, that something has
happened, or is going to happen, to make him free in the matter.How can
we tell what that something is, or how he felt himself bound before?It seems to me that we oughtn’t to leap at the idea of his being
unfriendly.I am sure that you believed him to be a wholly good man
before.Why assume all at once now that he is not, just because--Men
don’t change from good to bad like that.”

“Ah, but _was_ he good before, or did we only think so?”

Ethel went on: “Surely, he knows more about business than we do.And if
he was unable to help you, it must have been for some real reason.”

“That is _it!_ I should like to be helped first, and let reasons come
afterward.” The girl’s dark eyes flashed with an imperious light.“What
kind of a hero is it who, when you cry for assistance, calmly says:
‘Upon the lines you suggest I do not see my way’?It is high time the
books about chivalry were burned, if ‘that’ is the modern man.”

“But you did not cry to a hero for assistance.You merely asked the
advice of a lawyer about a mortgage---if mamma is right about its being
a mortgage.”

“It is the same thing,” said Kate, pushing the hassock impatiently with
her foot.. “Whether the distressed maiden falls into the water or into
debt, the principle is precisely the same.”

“He couldn’t do what you asked, because it would be unfair to his
partner.Now, isn’t that it exactly?Now,
_be_ frank, Kate.”

“The partner would have gone into anything headlong, asking no
questions, raising no objections, if I had so much ais lifted my finger.He never would have given, partner a thought.”

Kate, confided this answer to the firelight.She was conscious of a
desire just now not to meet her sister’s glance.“And you like the man without scruples better than the man with them?”

“At least, he is more interesting,” the elder girl said, still with her
eyes on the burning logs.Ethel waited a little for some additional hint as to her sister’s state
of mind.When the silence had begun to make itself felt, she said:

“Kate Minster, you don’t mean one word of what you are saying.”

“Ah, but I do.”

“No; listen to me.Tracy very much
for his action to-day.”

“For being so much less eager to help me than he was to help the
milliner?”

“No; for not being willing to help even you by doing an unfair thing.”

“Well--if you like--respect, yes.But so one respects John Knox, and
Increase Mather, and St.Simon What’s-his-name on top of the pillar--all
the disagreeable people, in fact.But it isn’t respect that makes the
world go round.There is such a thing as caring too much for respect,
and too little for warmth of feeling, and generous impulses, and--and so
on.”

“You’re a queer girl, Kate,” was all Ethel could think to say.This time the silence maintained itself so long that the snapping
of sparks on the hearth, and even the rushing suction of air in the
lamp-flame, grew to be obvious noises.At last Ethel slid softly from
the couch to the carpet, and nestled her head against her sister’s
waist.Kate put her arm tenderly over the girl’s shoulder, and drew
her closer to her, and the silence had become vocal with affectionate
mur-murings to them both.It was the younger sister who finally spoke:

“You _won’t_ do anything rash, Kate?Nothing without talking it over
with me?” she pleaded, almost sadly.Kate bent over and kissed her twice, thrice, on the forehead, and
stroked the silken hair upon this forehead caressingly.Her own eyes
glistened with the beginnings of tears before she made answer, rising as
she spoke, and striving to import into her voice the accent of gayety:

“As if I ever dreamed of doing anything at all without asking you!And
please, puss, may I go to bed now?”




CHAPTER XXIII.--HORACE’S PATH BECOMES TORTUOUS.“Tracy has found out that I’m doing the Minster business, and he’s cut
up rough about it.I shouldn’t be surprised if the firm came a cropper
over the thing.”

Horace Boyce confided this information to Mr.Schuyler Tenney on the
forenoon following his scene with Reuben, and though the language in
which it was couched was in part unfamiliar, the hardware merchant had
no difficulty in grasping its meaning.He stopped his task of going
through the morning’s batch of business letters, and looked up keenly at
the young man.“Found out--how do you mean?I told you to tell him--told you the day
you came here to talk about the General’s affairs.”

“Well, I didn’t tell him.”

“And why?” Tenney demanded, sharply.“I should like to know why?”

“Because it didn’t suit me to do so,” replied the young man; “just as it
doesn’t suit me now to be bullied about it.”

Mr.Tenney looked for just a fleeting instant as if he were going to
respond in kind.Then he thought better of it, and began toying with one
of the envelopes before him.“You must have got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning,” he
said, smilingly.“Why, man alive, nobody dreamed of bullying you.Only,
of course, it would have been better if you’d told Tracy.And you say he
is mad about it?”

“Yes, he was deucedly offensive.I daresay it will come to an open row.I haven’t seen him yet to-day, but things looked very dickey indeed for
the partnership last night.”

“Then the firm hasn’t got any specified term to run?”

“No, it is terminable at pleasure of both parties, which of course means
either party.”

“Well, there, you can tell him to go to the old Harry, if you like.”

“Precisely what I mean to do--if--”

“If what?”

“If there is going to be enough in this Minster business to keep me
going in the mean while.I don’t think I could take much of his regular
office business away.I haven’t been there long enough, you know.”

“Enough?I Should think there _would_ be enough!You will have five
thousand dollars as her representative in the Thessaly Manufacturing
Company.I daresay you might charge something for acting as her agent in
the pig-iron trust, too, though I’d draw it pretty mild if I were you.Women get scared at bills for that sort of thing.A young fellow like
you ought to save money on half of five thousand dollars.It never cost
me fifteen hundred dollars yet to live, and live well, too.”

Horace smiled in turn, and the smile was felt by both to suffice,
without words.There was no need to express in terms the fact that
in matters of necessary expense a Boyce and a Tenney, were two widely
differentiated persons.Horace had more satisfaction out
of the thought than did his companion.“Oh, by the way,” he added, “I ought to tell you, Tracy knows in
some way that you are mixed up with me in the thing.He mentioned your
name--in that slow, ox-like way of his so that I couldn’t tell how much
he knew or suspected.”

Mr.Tenney was interested in this; and showed his concern by separating
the letters on his desk into little piles, as if he were preparing to
perform a card tricks:

“I guess it won’t matter, much,” he said at last.“Everybody’s going
to know it pretty soon, now.” He thought again for a little, and then
added: “Only, on second thought, you’d better stick in with him a while
longer, if you can.Make some sort of apology to him, if he needs one,
and keep in the firm.It will be better so.”

“Why should I, pray?” demanded the young man, curtly.Tenney again looked momentarily as if he were tempted to reply with
acerbity, and again the look vanished as swiftly as it came.He answered
in all mildness:

“Because I don’t want Tracy to be sniffing around, inquiring into
things, until we are fairly in the saddle.He might spoil everything.”

“But how will my remaining with him prevent that?”

“You don’t know your man,” replied Tenney.“He’s one of those fellows
who would feel in honor bound to keep his hands off, simply because you
_were_ with him.That’s the beauty of that kind of chap.”

This tribute to the moral value of his partner impressed Horace but
faintly.“Well, I’ll see how he talks to-day,” he said, doubtfully.“Perhaps we can manage to hit it off together a while longer.” Then a
thought crossed his mind, and he asked with abruptness:

“What are you afraid of his finding out, if he does ‘sniff around’ as
you call it?Everything is above board, isn’t
it?”

“Why, you know it is.Who should know it better than you?” Mr.Horace reasoned to himself as he walked away that there really was no
cause for apprehension.Tenney was smart, and evidently Wendover was
smart too, but if they tried to pull the wool over his eyes they would
find that he himself had not been born yesterday.He had done everything
they had suggested to him, but he felt that the independent and even
captious manner in which he had done it all must have shown the schemers
that he was not a man to be trifled with.Thus far he could see no
dishonesty in their plans.He had been very nervous about the first
steps, but his mind was almost easy now.He was in a position where he
could protect the Minsters if any harm threatened them.And very
soon now, he said confidently to himself, he would be in an even more
enviable position--that of a member of the family council, a prospective
son-in-law.It was clear to his perceptions that Kate liked him, and
that he had no rivals.It happened that Reuben did not refer again to the subject of
yesterday’s dispute, and while Horace acquiesced in the silence, he was
conscious of some disappointment over it.It annoyed him to even look at
his partner this morning, and he was sick and tired of the partnership.It required an effort to be passing civil with Reuben, and he said to
himself a hundred times during the day that he should be heartily glad
when the Thessaly Manufacturing Company got its new machinery in, and
began real operations, so that he could take up his position there
as the visible agent of the millions, and pitch his partner and the
pettifogging law business overboard altogether.In the course of the afternoon he went to the residence of the Minsters.The day was not Tuesday, but Horace regarded himself as emancipated from
formal conditions, and at the door asked for the ladies, and then made
his own way into the drawing-room, with entire self-possession.Minster came down, he had some trivial matter of business
ready as a pretext for his visit, but her manner was so gracious that
he felt pleasantly conscious of the futility of pretexts.He was on such
a footing in the Minster household that he would never need excuses any
more.The lady herself mentioned the plan of his attending the forthcoming
meeting of the directors of the pig-iron trust at Pittsburg, and told
him that she had instructed her bankers to deposit with his bankers a
lump sum for expenses chargeable against the estate, which he could
use at discretion.“You mustn’t be asked to use your own money on our
business,” she said, smilingly.It is only natural to warm toward people who have such nice things as
this to say, and Horace found himself assuming a very confidential,
almost filial, attitude toward Mrs.Her kindness to him was so
marked that he felt really moved by it, and in a gracefully indirect
way said so.He managed this by alluding to his own mother, who had died
when he was a little boy, and then dwelling, with a tender inflection
in his voice, upon the painful loneliness which young men feel who are
brought up in motherless homes.“It seems as if I had never known a home
at all,” he said, and sighed.“She was one of the Beekmans from Tyre, wasn’t she?I’ve heard Tabitha
speak of her often,” said Mrs.The words were not important,
but the look which accompanied them was distinctly sympathetic.Perhaps it was this glance that affected Horace.He made a little
gulping sound in his throat, clinched his hands together, and looked
fixedly down upon the pattern of the carpet.“We should both have been better men if she had lived’,” he murmured,
in a low voice.As no answer came, he was forced to look up after a time, and then
upon the instant he realized that his pathos had been wasted, for Mrs.Minster’s face did not betray the emotion he had anticipated.She seemed
to have been thinking of something else.“Have you seen any Bermuda potatoes in the market yet?” she asked.“It’s
about time for them, isn’t it?”

“I’ll ask my father,” Horace replied, determined not to be thrown off
the trail.“He has been in the West Indies a good deal, and he knows all
about their vegetables, and the seasons, and so on.It is about him that
I wish to speak, Mrs.Minster.”

The lady nodded her head, and drew down the comers of her mouth a
little.“I feel the homeless condition of the General very much,” Horace went
on.“The death of my mother was a terrible blow to him, one he has never
recovered from.”

Mrs.Minster had heard differently, but she nodded her head again in
sympathy with this new view.Horace had not been mistaken in believing
that filial affection was good in her eyes.“So he has lived all these years almost alone in the big house,” the son
proceeded, “and the solitary life has affected his spirits, weakened
his ambition, relaxed his regard for the part he ought to play in the
community.Since I have been back, he has brightened up a good deal.He
has been a most loving father to me always, and I would do anything in
the world to contribute to his happiness.It is borne in upon me more
and more that if I had a cheerful home to which he could turn for warmth
and sunshine, if I had a wife whom he could reverence and be fond of, if
there were grandchildren to greet him when he came and to play upon his
knee--he would feel once more as if there was something in life worth
living for.”

Horace awaited with deep anxiety the answer to this.The General was the
worst card in his hand, one which he was glad to be rid of at any risk.If it should turn out that it had actually taken a trick in the game,
then he would indeed be lucky.“If it is no offence, how old are you, Mr.“I shall be twenty-eight in April.”

Mrs.“I never have believed in
early marriages,” she said.“They make more than half the trouble there
is.The Mauverensens were never great hands for marrying early.My
grandfather, Major Douw, was almost thirty, and my father was past
that age.And, of course, people married then much earlier than they do
nowadays.”

“I hope you do not think twenty-eight too young,” Horace pleaded, with
alert eyes resting on her face.He paused only for an instant, and then,
just as the tremor arising in his heart had reached his tongue, added
earnestly, “For it is a Mauverensen I wish to marry.”

Mrs.Minster looked at him with no light of comprehension in her glance.“It can’t be our people,” she said, composedly, “for Anthony has no
daughters.It must be some of the Schenectady lot.We’re not related at
all.They try to make out that they are, but they’re not.”

“You are very closely and tenderly related to the young lady I have
learned to adore,” the young man said, leaning forward on his low chair
until one knee almost touched the carpet.“I called her a Mauverensen
because she is worthy of that historic blood, but it was her mother’s,
not her father’s name.Minster, I love your daughter Kate!”

“Goodness me!” was the astonished lady’s comment.She stared at the young man in suppliant attitude before her, in
very considerable confusion of thought, and for what seemed to him an
intolerable time.“I am afraid it wouldn’t do at all,” she said first, doubtingly.Then
she added, as if thinking aloud: “I might have known Kate was keeping
something from me.She hasn’t been herself at all these last few weeks.”

“But she has not been keeping _this_ from you, Mrs.Minster,” urged the
young man, in his softest voice.“It is my own secret--all my own--kept
locked in the inner tabernacle of my heart until this very moment, when
I revealed it to you.”

“You mean that Kate--my daughter--does not know of this?”

“She must know that I worship the ground she treads on--she would be
blind not to realize that--but I have never said a word to her about it.No, not a word!”

Mrs.Minster uttered the little monosyllable “oh!” with a hesitating,
long-drawn-out sound.It was evident that this revelation altered
matters in her mind, and Horace hurried on:

“No,” he said; “the relation between mother and child has always seemed
to pie the most sacred thing on earth--perhaps because my own mother
died so many, many years ago.I would rather stifle my own feelings than
let an act of mine desecrate or imperil that relation.It may be that
I am old-fashioned, Mrs.Minster,” the young man continued, with a
deprecatory smile, “but I like the old habit of the good families--that
of deferring to the parents.I say that to them the chief courtesy and
deference are due.I know it is out of date, but I have always felt that
way.I say to you with profound respect that
you have reared the loveliest and best of all the daughters of the sons
of men, and that if you will only entertain the idea of permitting me to
strive to win her love, I shall be the proudest and happiest mortal on
earth.”

Whatever might betide with the daughter, the conquest of the mother was
easy and complete.“I like your sentiments very much indeed,” she said, with evident
sincerity.Of course I
haven’t the least idea what Kate will say.”

“Oh, leave that to me!” said Horace, with ardent confidence.Then, after
this rapturous outburst, he went on more quietly: “I would beg of you
not to mention the subject to her.Your favor has allowed me to come and go here on pleasant terms of
friendship.I will not ask your daughter
to commit herself until she has had time and chance to know me through
and through.To pick a husband
is the one grand, irrevocable step in a young girl’s life.Its success
means bliss, content, sunshine; its failure means all that is the
reverse.Therefore, I say, she cannot have too much information, too
many advantages, to help her in her choice.”

Thus it came to be understood that Mrs.Minster was to say nothing, and
was not to seem to make more of Horace than she had previously done.Then he bowed over her hand and lightly kissed it, in a fashion which
the good lady fondly assumed to be European, and was gone.Minster spent the rest of the afternoon and evening in a semi-dazed
abstraction of mental power, from time to time fitfully remembering
some wealthy young man whom she had vaguely considered as a
possible son-in-law, and sighing impartially over each mustached
and shirt-fronted figure as she pushed it out into the limbo of the
might-have-been.She almost groaned once when she recalled that this
secret must be kept even from her friend Tabitha.As for Horace, he walked on air.The marvel of his great success
surrounded and lifted him, as angels bear the souls of the blessed
fleeting from earth in the artist’s dream.The young Bonaparte, home
from Italy and the reproduction of Hannibal’s storied feat, with Paris
on its knees before him and France resounding with his name, could not
have swung his shoulders more proudly, or gazed upon unfolding destiny
with a more exultant confidence.On his way homeward an instinctive desire to be alone with his joy led
him to choose unfrequented streets, and on one of these he passed a
milliner’s shop which he had never seen before.He would not have noted
it now, save that his eye was unconsciously caught by some stray
freak of color in the window where bonnets were displayed.Then, still
unconsciously, his vision embraced the glass door beside this window,
and there suddenly it was arrested and turned to a bewildered stare.In the dusk of the little shop nothing could be distinguished but two
figures which stood close by the door.The dying light from the western
sky, ruddily brilliant and penetrating in its final glow, fell full upon
the faces of these two as they were framed in profile by the door.One was the face of Kate Minster, the woman he was to wed.The other was
the face of Jessica Law-ton, the woman whose life he had despoiled.Horace realized nothing else so swiftly as that he had not been seen,
and, with an instinctive lowering of the head and a quickened step, he
passed on.It was not until he had got out of the street altogether that
he breathed a long breath and was able to think.Then he found himself
trembling with excitement, as if he had been through a battle or a
burning house.Reflection soon helped his nerves to quietude again.Evidently the girl
had opened a millinery shop, and evidently Miss Minster was buying a
bonnet of her.That was all there was of it, and surely there was no
earthly cause for perturbation in that.The young man had thought so
lightly of the Law-ton incident at Thanksgiving time that it had never
since occurred to him to ask Tracy about its sequel.It came to his mind now that Tracy had probably helped her to start the
shop.“Damn Tracy!” he said to himself.No, there was nothing to be uneasy about in the casual, commercial
meeting of these two women.He became quite clear on this point as he
strode along toward home.At his next meeting with Kate it might do no
harm to mention having seen her there in passing, and to drop a hint as
to the character of the girl whom she was dealing with.He would see
how the talk shaped itself, after the Law-ton woman’s name had been
mentioned.It was a great nuisance, her coming to Thessaly, anyway.He
didn’t wish her any special harm, but if she got in his way here she
should be crushed like an insect.it was silly to conceive
injury or embarrassment coming from her.So with a laugh he dismissed the subject from his thoughts, and went
home to dine with his father, and gladdened the General’s heart by
a more or less elaborated account of the day’s momentous event, in
complete forgetfulness of the shock he had had.In the dead of the night, however, he did think of it again with a
vengeance.He awoke screaming, and cold with frightened quakings, under
the spell of some hideous nightmare.When he thought upon them, the
terrors of his dream were purely fantastic and could not be shaped into
any kind of coherent form.But the profile of the Lawton girl seemed to
be a part of all these terrors, a twisted and elongated side-face, with
staring, empty eyes and lips down-drawn like those of the Medusa’s head,
and yet, strangely enough, with a certain shifting effect of beauty upon
it all under the warm light of a winter sunset.Horace lay a long time awake, deliberately striving to exorcise this
repellent countenance by fixing his thoughts upon the other face--the
strong, beautiful, queenly face of the girl who was to be his wife.But
he could not bring up before his mind’s eye this picture that he wanted,
and he could not drive the other away.Sleep came again somehow, and there were no more bad dreams to be
remembered.In the morning Horace did not even recall very distinctly
the episode of the nightmare, but he discovered some novel threads of
gray at his temple as he brushed his hair, and for the first time in his
life, too, he took a drink of spirits before breakfast.CHAPTER XXIV.--A VEHEMENT RESOLVE.The sloppy snow went away at last, and the reluctant frost was forced
to follow, yet not before it had wreaked its spite by softening all
the country roads into dismal swamps of mud, and heaving into painful
confusion of holes and hummocks the pavements on Thessaly’s main
streets.But in compensation the birds came back, and the crocus and
hyacinth showed themselves, and buds warmed to life again along the
tender silk-brown boughs and melted into the pale bright green of a
springs new foliage.Overcoats disappeared, and bare-legged boys with
poles and strings of fish dawned upon the vision.The air was laden with
the perfume of lilacs and talk about baseball.From this to midsummer seemed but a step.The factory workmen walked
more wearily up the hill in the heat to their noonday dinners;
lager-beer kegs advanced all at once to be the chief staple of freight
traffic at the railway dépôt.People who could afford to take travelling
vacations began to make their plans or to fulfil them, and those who
could not began musing pleasantly upon the charms of hop-picking in
September.it was autumn, and young men added with pride
another unit to the sum of their age, and their mothers and sisters
secretly subtracted such groups or fractions of units as were needful,
and felt no more compunction at thus hoodwinking Time than if he had
been a customs-officer.The village of Thessaly, which like a horizon encompassed most of the
individuals whom we know, could tell little more than this of the months
that had passed since Thanksgiving Day, now once again the holiday
closest at hand.The seasons of rest and open-air amusement lay behind
it, and in front was a vista made of toil.There had been many deaths,
and still more numerous births, and none in either class mattered much
save under the roof-tree actually blessed or afflicted.The year had
been fairly prosperous, and the legislature had passed the bill which at
New Year’s would enable the village to call itself a city.Of the people with whom this story is concerned, there is scarcely more
to record during this lapse of time.Jessica Lawton was perhaps the one most conscious of change.At the
very beginning of spring, indeed on the very day when Horace had his
momentary fright in passing the shop, Miss Minster had visited her, had
brought a reasonably comprehensive plan for the Girls’ Resting House, as
she wanted it called, and had given her a considerable sum of money to
carry out this plan.For a long time it puzzled Jessica a good deal that
Miss Minster never came again.The scheme took on tangible form; some
score of work-girls availed themselves of its privileges, and the
result thus far involved less friction and more substantial success
than Jessica had dared to expect.It seemed passing strange that Miss
Minster, who had been so deeply enthusiastic at first, should never have
cared to come and see the enterprise, now that it was in working order.Once or twice Miss Tabitha had dropped in, and professed to be greatly
pleased with everything, but even in her manner there was an indefinable
alteration which forbade questions about the younger lady.There were rumors about in the town which might have helped Jessica to
an explanation had they reached her.The village gossips did not fail
to note that the Minster family made a much longer sojourn this year at
Newport, and then at Brick Church, New Jersey, than they had ever done
before; and gradually the intelligence sifted about that young Horace
Boyce had spent a considerable portion of his summer vacation with them.Thessaly could put two and two together as well as any other community.The understanding little by little spread its way that Horace was going
to marry into the Minster millions.If there were repinings over this foreseen event, they were carefully
dissembled.People who knew the young man liked him well enough.His
professional record was good, and he had made a speech on the Fourth
of July which pleased everybody except ’Squire Gedney; but then, the
spiteful old “Cal” never liked anybody’s speeches save his own.Even
more satisfaction was felt, however, on the score of the General.His
son was a showy young fellow, smart and well-dressed, no doubt, but
perhaps a trifle too much given to patronizing folks who had not been to
Europe, and did not scrub themselves all over with cold water, and put
on a clean shirt with both collar and cuffs attached, every morning.But
for the General there was a genuine affection.It pleased Thessaly to
note that, since he had begun to visit at the home of the Minsters,
other signs of social rehabilitation had followed, and that he himself
drank less and led a more orderly life than of yore.When his intimates
jokingly congratulated him on the rumors of his son’s good fortune, the
General tacitly gave them confirmation by his smile.If Jessica had heard these reports, she might have traced at once to
its source Miss Minster’s sudden and inexplicable coolness.Not hearing
them, she felt grieved and perplexed for a time, and then schooled
herself into resignation as she recalled Reuben Tracy’s warning about
the way rich people took up whims and dropped them again, just as fancy
dictated.It was on the first day of November that the popular rumor as to
Horace’s prospects reached her, and this was a day memorable for vastly
more important occurrences in the history of industrial Thessaly.The return of cold weather had been marked, among other signs of the
season, by a renewed disposition on the part of Ben Lawton to drop in
to the millinery shop, and sit around by the fire in the inner room.Ben
came this day somewhat earlier than usual--the midday meal was in its
preliminary stages of preparation under Lucinda’s red hands--and it was
immediately evident that he was more excited over something that had
happened outside than by his expectation of getting a dinner.“There’s the very old Nick to pay down in the village!” he said, as he
put his feet on the stove-hearth.“Heard about it, any of you?”

Ben had scarcely ascended in the social scale during the scant year that
had passed, though the general average of whiteness in his paper collars
had somewhat risen, and his hair and straggling dry-mud- beard
were kept more duly under the subjection of shears.His clothes,
too, were whole and unworn, but they hung upon his slouching and
round-shouldered figure with “poor white” written in every misfitting
fold and on every bagging projection.Jessica had resigned all hope that
he would ever be anything but a canal boatman in mien or ambition, but
her affection for him had grown rather than diminished; and she was glad
that Lucinda, in whom there had been more marked personal improvements,
seemed also to like him better.No, Jessica said, she had heard nothing.“Well, the Minster furnaces was all shut down this morning, and so was
the work out at the ore-beds at Juno, and the men, boys, and girls in
the Thessaly Company’s mills all got word that wages was going to be
cut down.You can bet there’s a buzz around town, with them three things
coming all together, smack!”

“I suppose so,” answered Jessica, still bending over her work of
cleaning and picking out some plumes.“That looks bad for business this
winter, doesn’t it?”

Ben’s relations with business, or with industry generally, were of the
most remote and casual sort, but he had a lively objective interest in
the topic.“Why, it’s the worst thing that ever happened,” he said, with
conviction.“There’s seven hundred men thrown out already” (the figure
was really two hundred and twelve), “and more than a thousand more got
to git unless they’ll work for starvation wages.”

“It seems very hard,” the girl made reply.The idea came to her that
very possibly this would put an extra strain upon the facilities and
financial strength of the Resting House.“Hard!” her father exclaimed, stretching his hands over the stove-top;
“them rich people are harder than Pharaoh’s heart.What do them Minsters
care about poor folks, whether they starve or freeze to death, or
anything?”

“Oh, it is the Minsters, you say!” Jessica looked up now, with a new
interest.“Sure enough, they own the furnaces.How could they have done
such a thing, with winter right ahead of us?”

“It’s all to make more money,” put in Lucinda.“Them that don’t need
it’ll do anything to get it.That Kate Minster of
yours, for instance, she’ll wear her sealskin and eat pie just the same.What does it matter to her?”

“No; she has a good heart.I know she has,” said Jessica.“She wouldn’t
willingly do harm to any one.But perhaps she has nothing to do with
managing such things.Yes, that must be it.”

“I guess Schuyler Tenney and Hod Boyce about run the thing, from what I
hear,” commented the father.“Tenney’s been bossing around since summer
begun, and Boyce is the lawyer, so they say.”

Ben suddenly stopped, and looked first at Jessica, then at Lucinda.Catching the latter’s eye, he made furtive motions to her to leave the
room; but she either did not or would not understand them, and continued
stolidly at her work.“That Kate you spoke about,” he went on stum-blingly, nodding hints at
Lucinda to go away as he spoke, “she’s the tall girl, with the black
eyes and her chin up in the air, ain’t she?”

“Yes,” the two sisters answered, speaking together.“Well, as I was saying about Hod Boyce,” Ben said, and then stopped in
evident embarrassment.Finally he added, confusedly avoiding Jessica’s
glance, “‘Cindy, won’t you jest step outside for a minute?I want to
tell your sister something--something you don’t know about.”

“She knows about Horace Boyce, father,” said Jessica, flushing, but
speaking calmly.“There is no need of her going.”

Lucinda, however, wiped her hands on her apron, and went out into the
store, shutting the door behind her.Then Ben, ostentatiously regarding
the hands he held out over the stove, and turning them as if they
had been fowls on a spit, sought hesitatingly for words with which to
unbosom himself.“You see,” he began, “as I was a-saying, Hod Boyce is the lawyer, and
he’s pretty thick with Schuyler Tenney, his father’s partner, which,
of course, is only natural; and Tenney he kind of runs the whole
thing--and--and that’s it, don’t you see!”

“You didn’t send Lucinda out in order to tell me _that_, surely?”

“Well, no.But Hod being the lawyer, as I said, why, don’t you see, he
has a good deal to say for himself with the women-folks, and he’s been
off with them down to the sea-side, and so it’s come about that they
say--”

“They say what?” The girl had laid down her work altogether.“They say he’s going to marry the girl you call Kate--the big one with
the black eyes.”

The story was out.Jessica sat still under the revelation for a moment,
and held up a restraining hand when her father offered to speak further.Then she rose and walked to and fro across the little room, in front
of the stove where Ben sat, her hands hanging at her side and her brows
bent with thought.At last she stopped before him and said:

“Tell me all over again about the stopping of the works--all you know
about it.”

Ben Lawton complied, and re-stated, with as much detail as he could
command, the facts already exposed.The girl listened carefully, but with growing disappointment.Somehow the notion had arisen in her mind that there would be something
important in this story--something which it would be of use to
understand.But her brain could make nothing significant out of this
commonplace narrative of a lockout and a threatened dispute about wages.Gradually, as she thought, two things rose as certainties upon the
surface of her reflections.“That scoundrel is to blame for both things.He advised her to avoid me,
and he advised her to do this other mischief.”

“I thought you’d like to know,” Ben put in, deferentially.He felt a
very humble individual indeed when his eldest daughter paced up and down
and spoke in that tone.“Yes, I’m glad I know,” she said, swiftly.She eyed her father in an
abstracted way for an instant, and then added, as if thinking aloud:
“Well, then, my fine gentleman, you--simply--shall--_not_--marry Miss
Minster!”

Ben moved uneasily in his seat, as if this warning had been personally
addressed to him.“It _would_ be pretty rough, for a fact, wouldn’t it?”
 he said.“Well, it won’t _be_ at all!” she made emphatic answer.“I don’t know as you can do much to pervent it, Jess,” he ventured to
say._Cant_ I!” she exclaimed, with grim earnestness.“Wait and
see.”

Ben had waited all his life, and he proceeded now to take her at her
word, sitting very still, and fixing a ruminative gaze on the side
of the little stove.“All right,” he said, wrapped in silence and the
placidity of contented suspense.But Jessica was now all eagerness and energy.She opened the store door,
and called out to Lucinda with business-like decision of tone: “Come in
now, and hurry dinner up as fast as you can.I want to catch the 1.20
train for Tecumseh.”

The other two made no comment on this hasty resolve, but during the
brief and not over-inviting meal which followed, watched their kinswoman
with side-glances of uneasy surprise.The girl herself hastened through
her dinner without a word of conversation, and then disappeared within
the little chamber where she and Lucinda slept together.It was only when she came out again, with her hat and cloak on and a
little travelling-bag in her hand, that she felt impelled to throw some
light on her intention.She took from her purse a bank-note and gave it
to her sister.“Shut up the store at half-past four or five today,” she said; “and
there are two things I want you to do for me outside.Go around the
furniture stores, and get some kind of small sofa that will turn into a
bed at night, and whatever extra bed-clothes we need for it--as cheap as
you can.We’ve got a pillow to spare, haven’t we?You can put those two
chairs out in the Resting House; that will make a place for the bed in
this room.You must have it all ready when I get back to-morrow night.You needn’t say anything to the girls, except that I am away for a day.And then--or no: _you_ can do it better, father.”

The girl had spoken swiftly, but with ready precision.As she turned now
to the wondering Ben, she lost something of her collected demeanor, and
hesitated for a moment.“I want you--I want you to see Reuben Tracy, and ask him to come here at
six to-morrow,” she said.She deliberated upon this for an instant, and
held out her hand as if she had changed her mind.Then she nodded, and
said: “Or no: tell him I will come to his office, and at six sharp.It
will be better that way.”

When she had perfunctorily kissed them both, and gone, silence fell
upon the room.Ben took his pipe out of his pocket and looked at it with
tentative longing, and then at the stove.“You can go out in the yard and smoke, if you want to, but not in here,”
 said Lucinda, promptly.“You wouldn’t dare think of such a thing if she
were here,” she added, with reproach.Ben put back his pipe and seated himself again by the fire.“Mighty
queer girl, that, eh?” he said.“When she gets stirred up, she’s a
hustler, eh?”

“It must be she takes it from you,” said Lucinda, with a modified grin
of irony.“No,” said Ben, with quiet candor,
“she gets it from my father.He used to count on licking a lock-tender
somewhere along the canal every time he made a trip.I remember there
was one particular fellow on the Montezuma Ma’ash that he used to
whale for choice, but any of ’em would do on a pinch.He was jest
blue-mouldy for a fight all the while, your grandfather was.He was
Benjamin Franklin Lawton, the same as me, but somehow I never took
much to rassling round or fighting.It’s more in my line to take things
easy.”

Lucinda bore an armful of dishes out into the kitchen, without making
any reply, and Ben, presently wearying of solitude, followed to where
she bent over the sink, enveloped in soap-suds and steam.“I suppose you’ve got an idea what she’s gone for?” he propounded, with
caution.“It’s a ‘_who_’ she’s gone for,” said Lucinda.Pronouns were not Ben’s strong point, and he said, “Yes, I suppose it
is,” rather helplessly.He waited in patience for more information, and
by and by it came.“If I was her, I wouldn’t do it,” said Lucinda, slapping a plate
impatiently with the wet cloth.“No, I don’t suppose you would.In some ways you always had more sense
than people give you credit for, ‘Cindy,” remarked the father, with
guarded flattery.“Jess, now, she’s one of your hoity-toity kind--flare
up and whirl around like a wheel on a tree in the Fourth of July
fireworks.”

“She’s head and shoulders above all the other Lawtons there ever was or
ever will be, and don’t you forget it!” declared the loyal Lucinda, with
fervor.“That’s what I say always,” assented Ben.“Only--I thought you said you
didn’t think she was quite right in doing what she’s going to do.”

“It’s right enough; only she was happy here, and this’ll make her
miserable again--though, of course, she was always letting her mind run
on it, and perhaps she’ll enjoy having it with her--only the girls may
talk--and--”

Lucinda let her sentence die off unfinished in a rattle of knives and
spoons in the dish-pan.“Well, Cindy,” said Ben, in the frankness of despair, “I’m dot-rotted if
I know what you are talking about.” He grew pathetic as he went on: “I’m
your father and I’m her father, and there ain’t neither of you got a
better friend on earth than I be; but you never tell me anything, any
more’n as if I was a last year’s bird’s-nest.”

Lucinda’s reserve yielded to this appeal.“Well, dad,” she said, with
unwonted graciousness of tone, “Jess has gone to Tecumseh to bring
back--to bring her little boy.She hasn’t told me so, but I know it.”

The father nodded his head in comprehension, and said nothing.He had
vaguely known of the existence of the child, and he saw more or less
clearly the reason for this present step.The shame and sorrow which
were fastened upon his family through this grandson whom he had never
seen, and never spoken of above a whisper, seemed to rankle in his heart
with a new pain of mingled bitterness and compassion.He mechanically took out his pipe, filled it from loose tobacco in his
pocket, and struck a match to light it.objected to his smoking in the house, on account of the wares
in her shop, and let the flame burn itself out in the coal-scuttle.A
whimsical query as to whether this calamitous boy had also been named
Benjamin Franklin crossed his confused mind, and then it perversely
raised the question whether the child, if so named, would be a “hustler”
 or not.Ben leaned heavily against the door-sill, and surrendered
himself to humiliation.“What I don’t understand,” he heard Lucinda saying after a time, “is why
she took this spurt all of a sudden.”

“It’s all on account of that Gawd-damned Hod Boyce!” groaned Ben.“Yes; you told her something about him.What was it?”

“Only that they all say that he’s going to marry that big Minster
girl--the black-eyed one.”

Lucinda turned away from the sink, threw down her dish-cloth with a
thud, and put her arms akimbo and her shoulders well back.Watching her,
Ben felt that somehow this girl, too, took after her grandfather rather
than him.“Oh, _is_ he!” she said, her voice high-pitched and vehement.“I guess
_we’ll_ have something to say about _that_!”




CHAPTER XXV.--A VISITATION OF ANGELS.REUBEN Tracy waited in his office next day for the visit of the
milliner, but, to tell the truth, devoted very little thought to
wondering about her errand.The whole summer and autumn, as he sat now and smoked in meditation upon
them, seemed to have been an utterly wasted period in his life.Through all the interval which lay between this November day and that
afternoon in March, when he had been for the only time inside the
Minster house, one solitary set thought had possessed his mind.Long
ago it had formulated itself in his brain; found its way to the silent,
spiritual tongue with which we speak to ourselves.He loved Kate
Minster, and had had room for no other feeling all these months.At first, when this thought was still new to him, he had hugged it to
his heart with delight.Now the melancholy days indeed were come, and he
had only suffering and disquiet from it.She had never even answered his
letter proffering assistance.She was as far away from him, as coldly
unattainable, as the north star.It made him wretched to muse upon her
beauty and charm; his heart was weary with hopeless longing for her
friendship--yet he was powerless to command either mind or heart.They
clung to her with painful persistency; they kept her image before him,
whispered her name in his ear, filled all his dreams with her fair
presence, to make each wakening a fresh grief.In his revolt against this weakness, Reuben had burned the little
scented note for which so reverential a treasure-box had been made in
his desk.He could never enter that small
inner room where he now sat without glancing at the drawer which had
once been consecrated to the letter.It was humiliating that he should prove to have so little sense and
strength.He bit his cigar fiercely with annoyance when this aspect
of the case rose before him.If love meant anything, it meant a mutual
sentiment.By all the lights of philosophy, it was not possible to love
a person who did not return that love.This he said to himself over and
over again, but the argument was not helpful.Still his mind remained
perversely full of Kate Minster.During all this time he had taken no step to probe the business which
had formed the topic of that single disagreeable talk with his partner
in the preceding March.Miss Minster’s failure to answer his letter had
deeply wounded his pride, and had put it out of the question that he
should seem to meddle in her affairs.He had never mentioned the subject
again to Horace.The two young men had gone through the summer and
autumn under the same office roof, engaged very often upon the same
business, but with mutual formality and personal reserve.No controversy
had arisen between them, but Reuben was conscious now that they had
ceased to be friends, as men understand the term, for a long time.For his own part, his dislike for his partner had grown so deep and
strong that he felt doubly bound to guard himself against showing it.It
was apparent to the most superficial introspection that a good deal of
his aversion to Horace arose from the fact that he was on friendly terms
with the Minsters, and could see Miss Kate every day.He never looked
at his partner without remembering this, and extracting unhappiness from
the thought.But he realized that this was all the more reason why
he should not yield to his feelings.Both his pride and his sense of
fairness restrained him from quarrelling with Horace on grounds of that
sort.But the events of the last day or two had opened afresh the former
dilemma about a rupture over the Minster works business.Since Schuyler
Tenney had blossomed forth as the visible head of the rolling-mills,
Reuben had, in spite of his pique and of his resolution not to be
betrayed into meddling, kept a close watch upon events connected with
the two great iron manufacturing establishments.He had practically
learned next to nothing, but he was none the less convinced that a
swindle underlay what was going on.It was with this same conviction that he now strove to understand the
shutting-down of the furnaces and ore-fields owned by the Minsters, and
the threatened lockout in the Thessaly Manufacturing Company’s mills.But it was very difficult to see where dishonesty could come in.The
furnaces and ore-supply had been stopped by an order of the pig-iron
trust, but of course the owners would be amply compensated for that.The other company’s resolve to reduce wages meant, equally of course,
a desire to make up on the pay-list the loss entailed by the closing of
the furnaces, which compelled it to secure its raw material elsewhere.Taken by themselves, each transaction was intelligible.But considered
together, and as both advised by the same men, they seemed strangely in
conflict.What possible reason could the Thessaly Company, for example,
have for urging Mrs.Minster to enter a trust, the chief purpose of
which was to raise the price of pig-iron which they themselves bought
almost entirely?He racked his brain in
futile search for the missing clew to this financial paradox.Evidently
there was such a clew somewhere; an initial fact which would explain
the whole mystery, if only it could be got at.He had for his own
satisfaction collected some figures about the Minster business, partly
exact, partly estimated, and he had worked laboriously over these in the
effort to discover the false quantity which he felt sure was somewhere
concealed.But thus far his work had been in vain.Just now a strange idea for the moment fascinated his inclination.It
was nothing else than the thought of putting his pride in his pocket--of
going to Miss Minster and saying frankly: “I believe you are being
robbed.In Heaven’s name, give me a chance to find out, and to protect
you if I am right!I shall not even ask ever to
see you again, once the rescue is achieved.do not send me away
until then--I pray you that!”

While the wild project urged itself upon his mind the man himself
seemed able to stand apart and watch this battle of his own thoughts and
longings, like an outside observer.He realized that the passion he
had nursed so long in silence had affected his mental balance.He was
conscious of surprise, almost of a hysterical kind of amusement,
that Reuben Tracy should be so altered as to think twice about such a
proceeding.Then he fell to deploring and angrily reviling the change
that had come over him; and lo!all at once he found himself strangely
glad of the change, and was stretching forth his arms in a fantasy of
yearning toward a dream figure in creamy-white robes, girdled with a
silken cord, and was crying out in his soul, “I love you!”

The vision faded away in an instant as there came the sound of rapping
at the outer door.Reuben rose to his feet, his brain still bewildered
by the sun-like brilliancy of the picture which had been burned into
it, and confusedly collected his thoughts as he walked across the larger
room.His partner had been out of town some days, and he had sent the
office-boy home, in order that the Lawton girl might be able to talk
in freedom.The knocking; was that of a woman’s hand.Evidently it was
Jessica, who had come an hour or so earlier than she had appointed.He
wondered vaguely what her errand might be, as he opened the door.In the dingy hallway stood two figures instead of one, both thickly clad
and half veiled.The waning light of late afternoon did not enable him
to recognize his visitors with any certainty.The smaller lady of the
two might be Jessica--the the who stood farthest away.He had almost
resolved that it was, in this moment of mental dubiety, when the other,
putting out her gloved hand, said to him:

“I am afraid you don’t remember me, it is so long since we met.Tracy--Miss Ethel Minster.”

The door-knob creaked in Reuben’s hand as he pressed upon it for
support, and there were eccentric flashes of light before his eyes.“Oh, I am _so_ glad!” was what he said.“Do come in--do come in.” He
led the way into the office with a dazed sense of heading a triumphal
procession, and then stopped in the centre of the room, suddenly
remembering that he had not shaken hands.To give
himself time to think, he lighted the gas in both offices and closed all
the shutters.“Oh, I am _so_ glad!” he repeated, as he turned to the two ladies.The
radiant smile on his face bore out his words.“I am afraid the little
room--my own place--is full of cigar-smoke.Let me see about the fire
here.” He shook the grate vehemently, and poked down the coals through
one of the upper windows.“Perhaps it will be warm enough here.Let me
bring some chairs.” He bustled into the inner room, and pushed out his
own revolving desk-chair, and drew up two others from different ends of
the office.The easiest chair of all, which was at Horace’s table, he
did not touch.Then, when his two visitors had taken seats, he beamed
down upon them once more, and said for the third time:

“I really _am_ delighted!”

Miss Kate put up her short veil with a frank gesture.The unaffected
pleasure which shone in Reuben’s face and radiated from his manner was
something more exuberant than she had expected, but it was grateful to
her, and she and her sister both smiled in response.“I have an apology to make first of all, Mr.Tracy,” she said, and her
voice was the music of the seraphim to his senses.“I don’t think--I am
afraid I never answered your kind letter last spring.It is a bad habit
of mine; I am the worst correspondent in the world.And then we went
away so soon afterward.”

“I beg that you won’t mention it,” said Reuben; and indeed it seemed to
him to be a trivial thing now--not worth a thought, much less a word.He
had taken a chair also, and was at once intoxicated with the rapture of
looking Kate in the face thus again, and nervous lest the room was not
warm enough.“Won’t you loosen your wraps?” he asked, with solicitude.“I am afraid
you won’t feel them when you go out.” It was an old formula which he had
heard his mother use with callers at the farm, but which he himself
had never uttered before in his life.But then he had never before been
pervaded with such a tender anxiety for the small comforts of visitors.Miss Kate opened the throat of her fur coat.“We sha’n’t stay long,”
 she said.“We must be home to dinner.” She paused for a moment and then
asked: “Is there any likelihood of our seeing your partner, Mr.Boyce,
here to-day?”

Reuben’s face fell on the instant.Alas, poor fool, he thought, to
imagine there were angels’ visits for you!“No,” he answered, gloomily.He is out of town.”

“Oh, we didn’t want to see him,” put in Miss Ethel.“Quite the
contrary.”

Reuben’s countenance recovered all its luminous radiance.He stole a
glance at this younger girl’s face, and felt that he almost loved her
too.“No,” Miss Kate went on, “in fact, we took the opportunity of his being
away to come and try to see you alone.Tracy, about the way things are going on.”

The lawyer could not restrain a comprehending nod of the head, but he
did not speak.“We do not understand at all what is being done,” proceeded Kate.“There
is nobody to explain things to us except the men who are doing those
things, and it seems to us that they tell us just what they like.We
maybe doing them an injustice, but we are very nervous about a good many
matters.That is why we came to you.”

Reuben bowed again.There was an instant’s pause, and then he opened one
of the little mica doors in the stove.“I’m afraid this isn’t going
to burn up,” he said.“If you don’t mind smoke, the other room is much
warmer.”

It was not until he had safely bestowed his precious visitors in the
cosier room, and persuaded them to loosen all their furs, that his mind
was really at ease.“Now,” he remarked, with a smile of relief, “now go
ahead.Tell me everything.”

“We have this difficulty,” said Kate, hesitatingly; “when I spoke to you
before, you felt that you couldn’t act in the matter, or learn
things, or advise us, on account of the partnership.And as that still
exists--why--” She broke off with an inquiring sigh.“My dear Miss Minster,” Reuben answered, in a voice so firm and full
of force that it bore away in front of it all possibility of suspecting
that he was too bold, “when I left you I wanted to tell you, when I
wrote to you I tried to have you understand, that if there arose a
question of honestly helping you, of protecting you, and the partnership
stood between me and that act of honorable service, I would crush the
partnership like an eggshell, and put all my powers at your disposal.But I am afraid you did not understand.”

The two girls looked at each other, and then at the strong face before
them, with the focussed light of the argand burner upon it.“No,” said Kate, “I am afraid we didn’t.”

“And so I say to you now,” pursued Reuben, with a sense of exultation
in the resolute words as they sounded on his ear, “I will not allow any
professional chimeras to bind me to inactivity, to acquiescence, if
a wrong is being done to you.And more, I will do all that lies in my
power to help you understand the whole situation.And if, when it is
all mapped out before us, you need my assistance to set crooked things
straight, why, with all my heart you shall have it, and the partnership
shall go out of the window.”

“If you had said that at the beginning,” sighed Kate.“Ah, then I did not know what I know now!” answered Reuben, holding her
eyes with his, while the light on his face grew ruddier.“Well, then, this is what I can tell you,” said the elder girl, “and I
am to tell it to you as our lawyer, am I not--our lawyer in the sense
that Mr.Boyce is mamma’s lawyer?”

Reuben bowed, and settled himself in his chair to listen.It was a long
recital, broken now by suggestions from Ethel, now by questions from the
lawyer.From time to time he made notes on the blotter before him, and
when the narrative was finished he spent some moments in consulting
these, and combining them with figures from another paper, in new
columns.Then he said, speaking slowly and with deliberation:

“This I take to be the situation: You are millionnaires, and are in a
strait for money.When I say ‘you’ I speak of your mother and yourselves
as one.Your income, which formerly gave you a surplus of sixty thousand
or seventy thousand dollars a year for new investments, is all at once
not large enough to pay the interest on your debts, let alone your
household and personal expenses.It came from three sources--the furnaces, the telegraph stock, and a
group of minor properties.These furnaces and iron-mines, which were all
your own until you were persuaded to put a mortgage on them, have
been closed by the orders of outsiders with whom you were persuaded to
combine.Telegraph competition has
cut down your earnings from the Northern Union stock to next to nothing.No doubt we shall find that your income from the other properties has
been absorbed in salaries voted to themselves by the men into whose
hands you have fallen.That is a very old trick, and I shall be
surprised if it does not turn up here.In the second place, you are
heavily in debt.On the 1st of January next, you must borrow money,
apparently, to pay the interest on this debt.What makes it the harder
is that you have not, as far as I can discover, had any value received
whatever for this debt.In other words, you are being swindled out of
something like one hundred thousand dollars per year, and not even such
a property as your father left can stand _that_ very long.I should say
it was high time you came to somebody for advice.”

Before this terribly lucid statement the two girls sat aghast.It was Ethel who first found something to say.“We never dreamed of
this, Mr.Tracy,” she said, breathlessly.“Our idea in coming, what we
thought of most, was the poor people being thrown out of work in the
winter, like this, and it being in some way, _our_ fault!”

“People _think_ it is our fault,” interposed Kate.“Only to-day, as we
were driving here, there were some men standing on the corner, and one
of them called out a very cruel thing about us, as if we had personally
injured him.But what you tell me--is it really as bad as that?”

“I am afraid it is quite as bad as I have pictured it.”

“And what is to be done?There must be some way to stop it,” said Kate.“You will put these men in prison the first thing, won’t you, Mr.Who are the men who are robbing
us?”

Reuben smiled gravely, and ignored the latter question.“There are a
good many first things to do,” he said.“I must think it all over very
carefully before any step is taken.But the very beginning will be, I
think, for you both to revoke the power of attorney your mother holds
for you, and to obtain a statement of her management of the trusteeship
over your property.”

“She will refuse it plump!You don’t know mamma,” said Ethel.“She couldn’t refuse if the demand were made regularly, could she, Mr.He shook his head, and she went on: “But it seems
dreadful not to act _with_ mamma in the matter.Just think what a
situation it will be, to bring our lawyer up to fight her lawyer!It
sounds unnatural, doesn’t it?Tracy, if you were to
speak to her now--”

“No, that could hardly be, unless she asked me,” returned the lawyer.“Well, then, if I told her all you said, or you wrote it out for me to
show her.”

“No, nor that either,” said Reuben.“To speak frankly, Miss Minster,
your mother is perhaps the most difficult and dangerous element in the
whole problem.I hope you won’t be offended--but that any woman in
her senses could have done what she seems to have done, is almost
incredible.”

“Poor mamma!” commented Ethel.“She never would listen to advice.”

“Unfortunately, that is just what she has done,” broke in Kate.Tracy, tell me candidly, is it possible that the man who advised her
to do these things--or rather the two men, both lawyers, who advised
her--could have done so honestly?”

“I should say it was impossible,” answered Reuben, after a pause.Again the two girls exchanged glances, and then Kate, looking at her
watch, rose to her feet.Tracy,” she said,
offering him her hand, and unconsciously allowing him to hold it in
his own as she went on: “We are both deeply indebted to you.We want
you--oh, so much!--to help us.We will do everything you say; we will
put ourselves completely in your hands, won’t we, Ethel?”

The younger sister said “Yes, indeed!” and then smiled as she furtively
glanced up into Kate’s face and thence downward to her hand.Kate
herself with a flush and murmur of confusion withdrew the fingers which
the lawyer still held.“Then you must begin,” he said, not striving very hard to conceal the
delight he had had from that stolen custody of the gloved hand,
“by resolving not to say a word to anybody--least of all to your
mother--about having consulted me.You must realize that we have to
deal with criminals--it is a harsh word, I know, but there can be no
other--and that to give them warning before our plans are laid would be
a folly almost amounting to crime itself.If I may, Miss Kate”--there
was a little gulp in his throat as he safely passed this perilous first
use of the familiar name--“I will write to you to-morrow, outlining my
suggestions in detail, telling you what to do, perhaps something of
what I am going to do, and naming a time--subject, of course, to your
convenience--when we would better meet again.”

Thus, after some further words on the same lines, the interview ended.Reuben went to the door with them, and would have descended to the
street to bear them company, but they begged him not to expose himself
to the cold, and so, with gracious adieus, left him in his office and
went down, the narrow, unlighted staircase, picking their way.On the landing, where some faint reflection of the starlight and
gas-light outside filtered through the musty atmosphere, Kate paused
a moment to gather the weaker form of her sister protectingly close to
her.“Are you utterly tired out, pet?” she asked.“I’m afraid it’s been too
much for you.”

“Oh, no,” said Ethel.“Only--yes, I am tired of one thing--of your
slowness of perception.Tracy has been just
burning to take up our cause ever since he first saw you.You thought
he was indifferent, and all the while he was over head and ears in love
with you!I watched him every moment, and it was written all over his
face; and you never saw it!”

The answering voice fell with a caressing imitation of reproof upon the
darkness: “You silly puss, you think everybody is in love with me!” it
said.Then the two young ladies, furred and tippeted, emerged upon the
sidewalk, stepped into their carriage, and were whirled off homeward
under the starlight.A few seconds later, two other figures, a woman and a child, also
emerged from this same stairway, and, there being no coachman in waiting
for them, started on foot down the street.The woman was Jessica Lawton,
and she walked wearily with drooping head and shoulders, never once
looking at the little boy whose hand she held, and who followed her in
wondering patience.She had stood in the stairway, drawn up against the wall to let these
descending ladies pass.She had heard all they said, and had on the
instant recognized Kate Minster’s voice.For a moment, in this darkness
suddenly illumined by Ethel’s words, she had reflected.Then she, too,
had turned and come down the stairs again.It seemed best, under these
new circumstances, not to see Reuben Tracy just now.And as she slowly
walked home, she almost forgot the existence of the little boy, so
deeply was her mind engaged with what she had heard.As for Reuben, the roseate dreams had all come back.From the drear
mournfulness of chill November his heart had leaped, by a fairy
transition, straight into the bowers of June, where birds sang and
fountains plashed, and beauty and happiness were the only law.It would
be time enough to-morrow to think about this great struggle with cunning
scoundrels for the rescue of a princely fortune, which opened before
him.This evening his mind should dwell upon nothing but thoughts of
_her!_

And so it happened that an hour later, when he decided to lock up the
office and go over to supper, he had never once remembered that the
Lawton girl’s appointment remained unkept.CHAPTER XXVI.--OVERWHELMING DISCOMFITURE.Horace Boyce returned to Thessaly the next morning and drove at
once to his father’s house.There, after a longer and more luxurious
bath than usual, he breakfasted at his leisure, and then shaved and
dressed himself with great care.He had brought some new clothes from
New York, and as he put them on he did not regret the long detour to the
metropolis, both in going to and coming from Pittsburg, which had been
made in order to secure them.The frock coat was peculiarly to his
liking.No noble dandy in all the West End of London owed his tailor for
a more perfectly fitting garment.It was not easy to decide as to the
neckwear which should best set off the admirable upper lines of this
coat, but at last he settled on a lustreless, fine-ribbed tie of white
silk, into which he set a beautiful moonstone pin that Miss Kate had
once praised.Decidedly, the _ensemble_ left nothing to be desired.Horace, having completely satisfied himself, took off the coat again,
went down-stairs in his velveteen lounging-jacket, and sought out his
father in the library, which served as a smoking-room for the two men.The General sat in one chair, with his feet comfortably disposed on
another, and with a cup of coffee on still a third at his side.He was
reading that morning’s Thessaly _Banner_, through passing clouds of
cigar-smoke.“Hello, you’re back, are you?” was his greeting to his son.“I see the
whole crowd of workmen in your rolling-mills decided last night not to
submit to the new scale; unanimous, the paper says.Seen it?”

“No, but I guessed they would,” said Horace, nonchalantly.“They can all
be damned.”

The General turned over his paper.“There’s an editorial,” he went on,
“taking the workmen’s side, out and out.Says there’s something very
mysterious about the whole business.Winds up with a hint that
steps will be taken to test the legality of the trust, and probe
the conspiracy that underlies it.Those are the words--‘probe the
conspiracy.’ Evidently, you’re going to have John Fairchild in your
wool.He’s a good fighter, once you get him stirred up.”

“He can be damned, too,” said Horace, taking a chair and lighting a
cigar.“These free-trade editors make a lot of noise, but they don’t
do anything else.They’re merely blue-bottle flies on a window-pane--a
deuce of a nuisance to nervous people, that’s all.I’m not nervous,
myself.”

The General smiled with good-humored sarcasm at his offspring.“Seems
to me it wasn’t so long ago that you were tarred with the same brush
yourself,” he commented.“Most fellows are free-traders until it touches their own pockets, or
rather until they get something in their pockets to be touched.Then
they learn sense,” replied Horace.“You can count them by thousands,” said the General.“But what of the
other poor devils--the millions of consumers who pay through the nose,
in order to keep those pockets full, eh?They never seem to learn
sense.”

Horace smiled a little, and then stretched out his limbs in a
comprehensive yawn.“I can’t sleep on the cars as well as I used to,”
 he said, in explanation.“I almost wish now I’d gone to bed when I got
home.I don’t want to be sleepy _this_ afternoon, of all times.”

The General had returned to his paper.“I see there’s a story afloat
that you chaps mean to bring in French Canadian workmen, when the other
fellows are locked out.I thought there was a contract labor law against
that.”

Horace yawned again, and then, rising, poured out a little glassful of
spirits from a bottle on the mantel, and tossed it off.“No,” he said,
“it’s easy enough to get around that.Wendover is up to all those
dodges.Besides, I think they are already domiciled in Massachusetts.”

“Vane” Boyce laid down the paper and took off his eye-glasses.“I hope
these fellows haven’t got you into a scrape,” he remarked, eyeing his
son.“I don’t more than half like this whole business.”

“Don’t you worry,” was Horace’s easy response.“I’ll take good care of myself.If it comes to ‘dog eat dog,’ they’ll
find my teeth are filed down to a point quite as sharp as theirs are.”

“Maybe so,” said the father, doubtfully.“But that Tenney--he’s got eyes
in the back of his head.”

“My dear fellow,” said Horace, with a pleasant air of patronage, “he’s a
mere child compared with Wendover.But I’m not afraid of them both.I’m
going to play a card this afternoon that will take the wind out of both
their sails.When that is done, I’ll be in a position to lay down the
law to them, and read the riot act too, if necessary.”

The General looked inquiry, and Horace went on: “I want you to call for
me at the office at three, and then we’ll go together to the Minsters.I wouldn’t smoke after luncheon, if I were you.I’m not going down until
afternoon.I’ll explain to you what my idea is as we walk out there.You’ve got some ‘heavy father’ business to do.”

Horace lay at his ease for a couple of hours in the big chair his father
had vacated, and mused upon the splendor of his position.This afternoon
he was to ask Kate Minster to be his wife, and of the answer he had
no earthly doubt.His place thus made secure, he had some highly
interesting things to say to Wendover and Tenney.He had fathomed
their plans, he thought, and could at the right moment turn them to his
advantage.He had not paid this latest visit to the iron magnates of
Pennsylvania for nothing.He saw that Wendover had counted upon their
postponing all discussion of the compensation to be given the Minsters
for the closing of their furnaces until after January 1, in order that
when that date came, and Mrs.Minster had not the money to pay the
half-yearly twelve thousand dollars interest on the bonds, she would be
compelled to borrow still more from him, and thus tighten the hold which
he and Tenney had on the Minster property.It was a pretty scheme, but
Horace felt that he could block it.For one thing, he was certain that
he could induce the outside trust directors to pass upon the question
of compensation long before January.And even if this failed, he could
himself raise the money which Mrs.Then he would turn around and demand an accounting from these scoundrels
of the four hundred thousand dollars employed in buying the machinery
rights, and levy upon the plant of the Thessaly Manufacturing Company,
if necessary, to secure Mrs.It became all very
clear to his mind, now he thought it over, and he metaphorically snapped
his fingers at Wendover and Tenney as he went up-stairs and once more
carefully dressed himself.The young man stopped in the hall-way as he came down and enjoyed a
comprehensive view of himself in the large mirror which was framed
by the hat-rack.The frock coat and the white effect at the neck were
excellent.The heavy fur collar of the outer coat only heightened their
beauty, and the soft, fawn-tinted suède gloves were quite as charming
in the contrast they afforded under the cuffs of the same costly fur.Horace put his glossy hat just a trifle to one side, and was too happy
even to curse the climate which made rubbers over his patent-leather
shoes a necessity.He remembered that minute before the looking-glass, in the after-time,
as the culmination of his upward career.It was the proudest, most
perfectly contented moment of his adult life.*****

“There is something I want to say to you before you go.”

Reuben Tracy stood at the door of a small inner office, and looked
steadily at his partner as he uttered these words.There was little doing in the law in these few dead-and-alive weeks
between terms, and the exquisitely dressed Horace, having gone through
his letters and signed some few papers, still with one of his gloves
on, had decided not to wait for his father, but to call instead at the
hardware store.“I am in a bit of a hurry just now.” he said, drawing on the other
glove.“I may look in again before dinner.Won’t it keep till then?”

“It isn’t very long,” answered Reuben.“I’ve concluded that the
partnership was a mistake.It is open to either of us to terminate it at
will.I wish you would look around, and let me know as soon as you see
your way to--to--”

“To getting out,” interposed Horace.In his present mood the idea rather
pleased him than otherwise.“With the greatest pleasure in the world.You have not been alone in thinking that the partnership was a mistake,
I can assure you.”

“Then we understand each other?”

“Perfectly.”

“And you will be back, say at--”

“Say at half-past five.”

“Half-past five be it,” said Reuben, turning back again to his desk.Horace made his way across the muddy high street and found his father,
who smelt rather more of tobacco than could have been wished, but
otherwise was in complete readiness.“By the way,” remarked the young man, as the two walked briskly along,
“I’ve given Tracy notice that I’m going to leave the firm.I daresay we
shall separate almost immediately.The business hasn’t been by any means
up to my expectations, and, besides, I have too much already to do for
the Minster estate, and am by way, now, of having a good deal more.”

“I’m sorry, for all that,” said the General.“Tracy is a first-rate,
honest, straightforward fellow.It always did me good to feel that you
were with him.To tell you the truth, my boy,” he went on after a pause,
“I’m damnably uneasy about your being so thick with Tenney and that
gang, and separating yourself from Tracy.It has an unsafe look.”

“Tracy is a tiresome prig,” was Horace’s comment.“I’ve stood him quite
long enough.”

The conversation turned now upon the object of their expedition,
and when this had been explained to the General, and his part in it
outlined, he had forgotten his forebodings about his son’s future.That son himself, as he strode along, with his head well up and his
shoulders squared, was physically an object upon which the paternal eye
could look with entire pride.The General said to himself that he
was not only the best-dressed, but the handsomest young fellow in
all Dearborn County; and from this it was but a mental flash to the
recollection that the Boyces had always been handsome fellows, and the
old soldier recalled with satisfaction how well he himself had felt that
he looked when he rode away from Thessaly at the head of his regiment
after the firing on Fort Sumter.Minster came down alone to the drawingroom to receive her visitors,
and showed by her manner some surprise that the General accompanied his
son.“I rather wanted to talk with you about what you learned at Pittsburg,”
 she said, somewhat bluntly, to Horace, after conversation on ordinary
topics had begun to flag.“Pray let me go into the library for a time,
I beg of you,” he said, in his courtly, cheery manner.“I know the way,
and I can amuse myself there till you want me; that is,” he added, with
a twinkle in his eye, “if you decide that you want me at all.”

Mrs.She did not quite understand
what this stout, red-faced man meant by being wanted, and she was
extremely anxious to know all that her lawyer had to tell her about the
trust.What he had to tell her was eminently satisfactory.The directors
had postponed the question of how much money should be paid for the
shutting-down of the Minster furnaces, simply because it was taken
for granted that so opulent a concern could not be in a hurry about
a settlement.He was sure that he could have the affair all arranged
before December.As to other matters, he was equally confident.A year
hence she would be in vastly better condition, financially, than she
had ever been before.Then Horace began to introduce the subject nearest his heart.The family
had been excessively kind to him during the summer, he said.He had
been privileged to meet them on terms of almost intimacy, both here and
elsewhere.Every day of this delightful intercourse had but strengthened
his original desire.True to his word, he had never uttered a syllable
of what lay on his heart to Miss Kate, but he was not without confidence
that she looked upon him favorably.They had seemed always the best
of friends, and she had accepted from him attentions which must have
shadowed forth to her, at least vaguely, the state of his mind.He had
brought his father--in accordance with what he felt to be the courtesy
due from one old family to another--to formally speak with her upon the
subject, if she desired it, and then he himself, if she thought it best,
would beg for an interview with Miss Kate.Minster think it
preferable to leave this latter to the sweet arbitrament of chance?Horace looked so well in his new clothes, and talked with such fluency
of feeling, and moreover had brought such comforting intelligence
about the business troubles, that Mrs.Minster found herself at the end
smiling on him maternally, and murmuring some sort of acquiescence to
his remarks in general.“Then shall I bring in my father?” He asked the question eagerly, and
rising before she could reply, went swiftly to the door of the hall and
opened it.Then he stopped with abruptness, and held the door open with a hand that
began to tremble as the color left his face.A voice in the hall was speaking, and with such sharply defined
distinctness and high volume that each word reached even the mother
where she sat.“_You may tell your son, General Boyce,”_ said this voice, _“that I will
not see him.I am sorry to have to say it to you, who have always been
polite to me, but your son is not a good man or an honest man, and I
wish never to see him again.With all my heart I wish, too, that we
never had seen him, any of us._”

An indistinct sound of pained remonstrance arose outside as the echoes
of this first voice died away.Then followed a noise of footsteps
ascending the carpeted stairs, and Horace’s empty, staring eyes had a
momentary vision of a woman’s form passing rapidly upward, away from
him.Then he stood face to face with his father--a bleared, swollen,
indignant countenance it was that thrust itself close to his--and he
heard his father say, huskily:

“I am going.Let us get out of this house.”

Horace mechanically started to follow.Then he remembered that he had
left his hat behind, and went back into the drawing-room where Mrs.The absence of deep emotion on her statuesque face
momentarily restored his own presence of mind.“You have heard your daughter?” he said, his head hanging in spite of
himself, but his eyes keeping a strenuous scrutiny upon her face.“Yes: I don’t know what has come over Kate, lately,” remarked Mrs.Minster; “she always was the most curious girl.”

“Curious, indeed!” He choked down the sneer which tempted him, and went
on slowly: “You heard what she said--that I was dishonest, wicked.Where
she has suddenly got this new view of me, doesn’t matter--at least, just
at this moment.But I surely ought to ask if you--if you share it.Of
course, if I haven’t your confidence, why, I must lay down everything.”

“Oh, mercy, no!You mustn’t think of it,” the lady said, with animation.“I’m sure I don’t know in the least what it all means.It makes my head
ache sometimes wondering what they will do next--Kate, especially.No,
you mustn’t mind her.You really mustn’t.”

The young man’s manner had gradually taken on firmness, as if under
a coat of ice.Minster had a
novel glitter in it now.“Then I am to remain your lawyer, in spite of this, as if it hadn’t
happened?”

“Why, bless me, yes!You must see me through this
dreadful trust business, though, as you say, it must all be better in
the end than ever before.”

“Good-day, Mrs.I shall continue, then, to hold myself at your
service.”

He spoke with the same grave slowness, and bowed formally, as if to go.The lady rose, and of her own volition offered him her hand.“Perhaps
things will alter in her mind.I am so sorry!” she said.The young man permitted himself a ghostly half-smile.“It is only when I
have thought it all over that I shall know whether I am sorry or not,”
 he said, and bowing again he left her.Out by the gate, standing on the gravel-path wet with November rain and
strewn with damp, fallen leaves, the General waited for him.The air had
grown chill, and the sky was spreading a canopy for the night of gloomy
gray clouds.The two men, without a word, fell into step, and walked
down the street together.Horace, striding silently along with his teeth tight set, his head bowed
and full of fierce confusion of thought, and his eyes angrily fixed
on the nothing straight ahead, became, all at once, aware that his
office-boy was approaching on the sidewalk, whistling dolefully to suit
the weather, and carrying his hands in his pockets.“Where are you going, Robert?” the lawyer demanded, stopping the lad,
and speaking with the aggressive abruptness of a man longing to affront
all about him.Minster’s,” answered the boy, wondering what was up, and
confusedly taking his hands out of his pockets.“What for?” This second question was even more sharply put.Tracy.” The boy took a letter from the inside of
his coat, and then added: “I said Mrs.Minster, but the letter is for
her daughter.I’m to give it to her herself.”

“I’ll take charge of it myself,” said Horace, with swift decision,
stretching out his hand.But another hand was reached forth also, and grasped the young man’s
extended wrist with a vehement grip.you won’t!” swore the General, his face purpling with the
rush of angry blood, and his little gray eyes flashing.“No, sir, you
won’t!” he repeated; and then, bending a momentary glance upon the boy,
he snapped out: “Well, you!Go and do your
errand as you were told!”

The office-boy started with a run to obey his command, and did not
slacken his pace until he had turned a corner.He had never encountered
a real general in action before, and the experience impressed him.Father and son looked in silence into each other’s faces for an instant.Then the father said, with something between a curse and a groan:

“My God!You _are_ a damned scoundrel!”

“Well, however that may be,” replied Horace, frowning, “I’m not in the
mood just now to take any cheek, least of all from you!”

As the General stared at him with swelling rage in his fat face, and
quivering, inarticulate lips, his son went on in a bitter voice, from
between clinched teeth:

“I owe this to you!Everything I did was done to
lift you out of the gutter, to try and make a man of you again, to put
you back into decent society--to have the name of Boyce something else
once more besides a butt for bar-keepers and factory-girls.I had you
around my neck like a mill-stone, and you’ve pulled me down.I hope
you’re satisfied!”

For a moment it seemed as if the General would fall.His thick neck grew
scarlet, his eyes turned opaque and filled with tears, and he trembled
and almost tottered on his legs.Then the fit passed as suddenly as
it had come.He threw a sweeping glance up and down the figure of his
son--taking in the elegant line of the trousers, the costly fur, the
delicate, spotless gloves, the white jewelled neckwear, the shining
hat, the hardened and angry face beneath it--and then broke boisterously
forth into a loud guffaw of contemptuous laughter.When he had laughed his fill, he turned upon his heel without a word
and walked away, carrying himself with proud erectness, and thumping his
umbrella on the sidewalk with each step as he went.When Thessaly awoke one morning some fortnight later, and rubbed its
eyes, and, looking again, discovered in truth that everything outside
was white, the recognition of the familiar visitor was followed by a
sigh.The children still had a noisy friendliness of greeting for the
snow, and got out their sleds and bored anticipatory holes in their
boot-heels with a thrill of old-time enthusiasm; but even their delight
became subdued in its manifestations before noon had arrived--their
elders seemed to take the advent of winter so seriously.Villagers,
when they spoke to one another that morning, noted that the voice of
the community had suddenly grown graver in tone and lower in pitch.The
threat of the approaching season weighed with novel heaviness on the
general mind.For the first time since the place had begun its manufacturing career,
Thessaly was idle.The Minster furnaces had been closed for more than
two weeks; the mills of the Thessaly Manufacturing Company, for nearly
that length of time.Half the bread-winners in the town were out of work
and saw no prospect of present employment.Usage is most of all advantageous _in_ adversity; These artisans of
Thessaly lacked experience in enforced idleness and the trick of making
bricks without straw.Employment, regular and well requited, had become
so much a matter of course that its sudden cessation now bewildered
and angered them.Each day brought to their minds its fresh train of
calamitous consequences.Children needed shoes; the flour-barrel was
nearly empty; to lay in a pig for the winter might now be impossible.The question of rent quarter loomed black and menacing like a
thunder-cloud on the horizon; and there were those with mortgages
on their little homes, who already saw this cloud streaked with the
lightning of impending tempest.Anxious housewives began to retrench at
the grocer’s and butcher’s; but the saloons and tobacco shops had almost
doubled their average of receipts.Even on ordinary holidays the American workman, bitten as he is with the
eager habitude of labor, more often than not some time during the day
finds himself close to the place where at other times he is employed.There his thoughts are: thither his steps all unconsciously bend
themselves.So now, in this melancholy, indefinite holiday which
November had brought to Thessaly, the idlers instinctively hung about
the deserted works.The tall, smokeless chimneys, the locked gates,
the grimy windows--through which the huge dark forms of the motionless
machines showed dimly, like the fossils of extinct monsters in a
museum--the dreary stretches of cinder heaps and blackened waste
which surrounded the silent buildings--all these had a cruel kind of
fascination for the dispossessed toilers.They came each day and stood lazily about in groups: they smoked in
taciturnity, told sardonic stories, or discussed their grievance, each
according to his mood; but they kept their eyes on the furnaces and
mills whence wages came no more and where all was still.There was
something in it akin in pathos to the visits a mother pays to the
graveyard where her child lies hidden from sight under the grass and the
flowers.It was the tomb of their daily avocation that these men came to
look at.But, as time went on, there grew to be less and less of the pathetic
in what these men thought and said.The sense of having been wronged
swelled within them until there was room for nothing but wrath.In a
general way they understood that a trust had done this thing to them.But that was too vague and far-off an object for specific cursing.The
Minster women were nearer home, and it was quite clear that they were
the beneficiaries of the trust’s action.There were various stories told
about the vast sum which these greedy women had been paid by the trust
for shutting down their furnaces and stopping the output of iron ore
from their fields, and as days succeeded one another this sum steadily
magnified itself.The Thessaly Manufacturing Company, which concerned a much larger number
of workmen, stood on a somewhat different footing.Mechanics who knew
men who were friendly with Schuyler Tenney learned in a roundabout
fashion that he really had been forced into closing the mills by the
action of the Minster women.When you came to think of it, this seemed
very plausible.Then the understanding sifted about among the men that
the Minsters were, in reality, the chief owners of the Manufacturing
Company, and that Tenney was only a business manager and minor partner,
who had been overruled by these heartless women.All this did not make
friends for Tenney.The lounging workmen on the street comers eyed him
scowlingly when he went by, but their active hatred passed him over and
concentrated itself upon the widow and daughters of Stephen Minster.On
occasion now, when fresh rumors of the coming of French Canadian workmen
were in the air, very sinister things were muttered about these women.Before the lockout had been two days old, one of the State officers of a
labor association had visited Thessaly, had addressed a hastily convened
meeting of the ejected workmen, and had promised liberal assistance
from the central organization.He had gone away again, but two or three
subordinate officials of the body had appeared in town and were still
there.They professed to be preparing detailed information upon which
their chiefs could act intelligently.They had money in their pockets,
and displayed a quite metropolitan freedom about spending it over
the various bars.Some of the more conservative workmen thought these
emissaries put in altogether too much time at these bars, but they were
evidently popular with the great bulk of the men.They had a large fund
of encouraging reminiscence about the way bloated capitalists had been
beaten and humbled and brought down to their knees elsewhere in the
country, and they were evidently quite confident that the workers would
win this fight, too.Just how it was to be won no one mentioned, but
when the financial aid began to come in it would be time to talk about
that.And when the French Canadians came, too, it would be time--The
rest of this familiar sentence was always left unspoken, but lowering
brows and significant nods told how it should be finished.So completely did this great paralytic stroke to industry monopolize
attention, that events in the village, not immediately connected with
it, passed almost unnoticed.Nobody gave a second thought, for example,
to the dissolution of the law firm of Tracy & Boyce, much less dreamed
of linking it in any way with the grand industrial drama which engaged
public interest.Horace, at the same time, took rooms at the new brick hotel, the
Central, which had been built near the railroad depot, and opened an
office of his own a block or two lower down Main Street than the one he
had vacated.This did not attract any special comment, and when, on the
evening of the 16th of November, a meeting of the Thessaly Citizens’
Club was convened, fully half those who attended learned there for the
first time that the two young lawyers had separated.The club at last had secured a building for itself--or rather the
refusal of one--and this meeting was called to decide upon ratifying
the purchase.It was held in a large upper room of the building under
discussion, which had been the gymnasium of a German Turn Verein, and
still had stowed away in its comers some of the apparatus that the
athletes had used.When Horace, as president, called the gathering to order, there were
some forty men present, representing very fairly the business and
professional classes of the village.Schuyler Tenney was there as one
of the newer members; and Reuben Tracy, with John Fairchild, Dr.Lester,
Father Chance, and others of the founders, sat near one another farther
back in the hall.The president, with ready facility, laid before the meeting the business
at hand.The building they were in could be purchased, or rented on a
reasonably extended lease.It seemed to the committee better to take it
than to think of erecting one for themselves--at least for the present.So much money would be needed: so much for furniture, so much for
repairs, etc.; so much for heating and lighting, so much for service,
and so on--a very compact and lucid statement, indeed.A half hour was passed in more or less inconclusive discussion before
Reuben Tracy rose to his feet and began to speak.The story that he and
Boyce were no longer friends had gone the round of the room, and some
men turned their chairs to give him the closer attention with eye and
ear.Before long all were listening with deep interest to every word.Reuben started by saying that there was something even more important
than the question of the new building, and that was the question of what
the club itself meant.In its inception, the idea of creating machinery
for municipal improvement had been foremost.Certainly he and those
associated with him in projecting the original meeting had taken that
view of their work.That meeting had contented itself with an indefinite
expression of good intentions, but still had not dissented from the idea
that the club was to mean something and to do something.Now it became
necessary, before final steps were taken, to ask what that something
was to be.So far as he gathered, much thought had been given as to
the probable receipts and expenditure, as to where the card-room, the
billiard-room, the lunch-room, and so forth should be located, and as to
the adoption of all modern facilities for making themselves comfortable
in their new club-house.But about the original objects of the club
he had not heard a syllable.To him this attitude was profoundly
unsatisfactory.At the present moment, the village was laboring under
a heavy load of trouble and anxiety.Nearly if not quite a thousand
families were painfully affected by the abrupt stoppage of the
two largest works in the section.If actual want was not already
experienced, at least the vivid threat of it hung over their poorer
neighbors all about them.This fact, it seemed to him, must appeal to
them all much more than any conceivable suggestion about furnishing a
place in which they might sit about at their ease in leisure hours.He
put it to the citizens before him, that their way was made exceptionally
clear for them by this calamity which had overtaken their village.If
the club meant anything, it must mean an organization to help these poor
people who were suddenly, through no fault of their own, deprived of
incomes and employment.That was something vital, pressing, urgent;
easy-chairs and billiard-tables could wait, but the unemployed artisans
of Thessaly and their families could not.This in substance was what Reuben said; and when he had finished there
succeeded a curious instant of dead silence, and then a loud confusion
of comment.Half a dozen men were on their feet now, among them both
Tenney and John Fairchild.The hardware merchant spoke first, and what he said was not so prudent
as those who knew him best might have expected.The novel excitement of
speaking in public got into his head, and he not only used language
like a more illiterate man than he really was, but he attacked Tracy
personally for striving to foment trouble between capital and labor,
and thereby created an unfavorable impression upon the minds of his
listeners.Editor Fairchild had ready a motion that the building be taken on a
lease, but that a special committee be appointed by the meeting to
devise means for using it to assist the men of Thessaly now out of
employment, and that until the present labor crisis was over, all
questions of furnishing a club-house proper be laid on the table.He
spoke vigorously in support of this measure, and when he had finished
there was a significant round of applause.Horace rose when order had been restored, and speaking with some
hesitation, said that he would put the motion, and that if it were
carried he would appoint such a committee, but----

“I said ‘to be appointed by the meeting’!” called out John Fairchild,
sharply.The president did not finish his sentence, but sat down again, and
Tenney pushed forward and whispered in his ear.Two or three others
gathered sympathetically about, and then still others joined the group
formed about the president, and discussed eagerly in undertones this new
situation.“I must decline to put the motion.It is out of order,” answered Horace at last, as a result of this
faction conference.“Then I will put it myself,” cried Fairchild, rising.“But I beg
first to move that you leave the chair!” Horace looked with angered
uncertainty down upon the men who remained seated about Fairchild.They
were as thirty to his ten, or thereabouts.He could not stand up against
this majority.For a moment he had a fleeting notion of trying to
conciliate it, and steer a middle course, but Tenney’s presence had made
that impossible.He laid down his gavel, and, gathering up his hat and
coat, stepped off the platform to the floor.“There is no need of moving that,” he said.“I’ll go without it.So far
as I am concerned, the meeting is over, and the club doesn’t exist.”

He led the way out, followed by Tenney, Jones the match-manufacturer,
the Rev.One or two gentlemen rose
as if to join the procession, and then thinking better of it sat down
again.By general suggestion, John Fairchild took the chair thus vacated, but
beyond approving the outlines of his plan, and appointing a committee
with Tracy at its head to see what could be done to carry it out, the
meeting found very little to do.It was agreed that this committee
should also consider the question of funds, and should call a meeting
when it was ready to report, which should be at the earliest possible
date.Then the meeting broke up, and its members dispersed, not without
well-founded apprehensions that they had heard the last of the Thessaly
Citizens’ Club.CHAPTER XXVIII.--IN THE ROBBER’S CAVE.HORACE Boyce was too enraged to preserve a polite demeanor toward the
sympathizers who had followed him out of the hall, and who showed
a disposition to discuss the situation with him now the street was
reached.After a muttered word or two to Tenney, the young man abruptly
turned his back on the group, and walked with a hurried step down the
street toward his hotel.Entering the building, he made his way direct to the bar-room back of
the office--a place where he had rarely been before--and poured out for
himself a heavy portion of whiskey, which he drank off without noticing
the glass of iced water placed for him beside the bottle.He turned to
go, but came back again to the bar after he had reached the swinging
screen-doors, and said he would take a bottle of the liquor up to his
room.“I haven’t been sleeping well these last few nights,” he explained
to the bar-keeper.Once in his room, Horace put off his boots, got into easy coat and
slippers, raked down the fire, looked for an aimless minute or two at
the row of books on his shelf, and then threw himself into the arm-chair
beside the stove.The earlier suggestion of gray in his hair at the
temples had grown more marked these last few weeks, and there were new
lines of care on his clear-cut face, which gave it a haggard look now as
he bent his brows in rumination.An important interview with Tenney and Wendover was to take place in
this room a half hour later; but, besides a certain hard-drawn notion
that he would briskly hold his own with them, Horace did not try to form
plans for this or even to fasten his mind upon it.The fortnight or more that had passed since that terrible momentary
vision of Kate Minster running up the stairs to avoid him, had been to
the young man a period of unexampled gloominess and unrest, full of
deep wrath at the fate which had played upon him such a group of scurvy
tricks all at once, yet having room for sustained exasperation over the
minor discomforts of his new condition.The quarrel with his father had forced him to change his residence, and
this was a peculiarly annoying circumstance coming at just such a time.He realized now that he had been very comfortable in the paternal house,
and that his was a temperament extremely dependent upon well-ordered and
satisfactory surroundings.These new rooms of his, though they cost a
good deal of money, were not at all to his liking, and the service was
execrable.The sense of being at home was wholly lacking; he felt as
disconnected and out of touch with the life about him as if he had been
travelling in a foreign country which he did not like.The great humiliation and wrong--the fact that he had been rejected with
open contumely by the rich girl he had planned to marry--lay steadily
day and night upon the confines of his consciousness, like a huge black
morass with danger signals hung upon all its borders.His perverse mind
kept returning to view these menacing signals, and torturing him with
threats to disregard them and plunge into the forbidden darkness.The
constant strain to hold his thoughts back from this hateful abyss wore
upon him like an unremitting physical pain.The resolve which had chilled and stiffened him into self-possession
that afternoon in the drawingroom, and had even enabled him to speak
with cold distinctness to Mrs.Minster and to leave the house of insult
and defeat with dignity, had been as formless and unshaped as poor,
heart-torn, trembling Lear’s threat to his daughters before Gloster’s
gate.Revenge he would have--sweeping, complete, merciless, but by what
means he knew not.Two weeks were gone, and the revenge seemed measurably nearer, though
still its paths were all unmapped.It was clear enough to the young
man’s mind now that Tenney and Wendover were intent on nothing less than
plundering the whole Minster estate.Until that fatal afternoon in the
drawingroom, he had kept himself surrounded with an elaborate system of
self-deception.He had pretended to himself that the designs of these
associates of his were merely smart commercial plans, which needed only
to be watched with equal smartness.He knew the men to be villains, and openly rated them as such in his
thoughts.He had a stem satisfaction in the thought that their schemes were in
his hands.He would join them now, frankly and with all his heart,
only providing the condition that his share of the proceeds should
be safe-guarded.They should have his help to wreck this insolent,
purse-proud, newly rich family, to strip them remorselessly of their
wealth.His fellow brigands might keep the furnaces, might keep
everything in and about this stupid Thessaly.He would take his share in
hard coin, and shake the mud and slush of Dearborn County from off his
feet.He was only in the prime of his youth.Romance beckoned to him
from a hundred centres of summer civilization, where men knew how to
live, and girls added culture and dowries to beauty and artistic dress.The dream of a career in his native village had brought him delight only
so long as Kate Minster was its central figure.That vision now seemed
so clumsy and foolish that he laughed at it.He realized that he had
never liked the people here about him.Even the Minsters had been
provincial, only a gilded variation upon the rustic character of the
section.Nothing but the over-sanguine folly of youth could ever have
prompted him to think that he wanted to be mayor of Thessaly, or that it
would be good to link his fortunes with the dull, under-bred place.The two men for whom he had been waiting broke abruptly in upon his
revery by entering the room.They came in without even a show of
knocking on the door, and Horace frowned a little at their rudeness.Stout Judge Wendover panted heavily with the exertion of ascending the
stairs, and it seemed to have put him out of temper as well as breath.He threw off his overcoat with an impatient jerk, took a chair, and
gruffly grunted “How-de-do!” in the direction of his host, without
taking the trouble to even nod a salutation.Tenney also seated himself,
but he did not remove his overcoat.Even in the coldest seasons he
seemed to wear the same light, autumnal clothes, creaseless and gray,
and mouselike in effect.The two men looked silently at Horace, and he
felt that they disapproved his velveteen coat.“Well?” he asked, at last, leaning back in his chair and trying to equal
them in indifference.“What is new in New York, Judge?”

“Never mind New York!Thessaly is more in our line just now,” said
Wendover, sternly.“You’re welcome to my share
of the town, I’m sure,” he said; “I’m not very enthusiastic about it
myself.”

“How much has Reuben Tracy got to work on?How much have you blabbed
about our business to him?” asked the New Yorker.“I neither know nor care anything about Mr.Tracy,” said Horace, coldly.“As for what you elegantly describe as my ‘blabbing’ to him, I daresay
you understand what it means.I don’t.”

“It means that you have made a fool of us; got us into trouble; perhaps
ruined the whole business, by your God A’mighty stupidity!That’s
what it means!” said Wendover, with his little blue-bead eyes snapping
angrily in the lamplight.“I hope it won’t strike you as irrelevant if I suggest that this is my
room,” drawled Horace, “and that I have a distinct preference for civil
conversation in it.If you have any criticisms to offer upon my conduct,
as you seem to think that you have, I must beg that you couch them in
the language which gentlemen--”

“Gentlemen be damned!” broke in the Judge, sharply.“We’ve had too much
‘gentleman’ in this whole business!What
does Tracy mean by his applications?”

“I haven’t the remotest idea what you are talking about.I’ve already
told you that I know nothing of Mr.Tracy or his doings.”

Schuyler Tenney interposed, impassively: “He may not have heard of the
application, Judge.You must remember that, for the sake of appearances,
he then being in partnership, you were made Mrs.Minster’s attorney, in
both the agreements.That is how notices came to be served on you.”

The Judge had not taken his eyes off the young man in the velveteen
jacket.“Do you mean to tell me that you haven’t learned from Mrs.Minster that this man Tracy has made applications on behalf of the
daughters to upset the trust agreement, and to have a receiver appointed
to overhaul the books of the Mfg.Company?”

Horace sat up straight.“Good God, no!” he stammered.“I’ve heard
nothing of that.”

“You never do seem to hear about things.What did you suppose you were
here for, except to watch Mrs.Minster, and keep track of what was going
on?” demanded Wendover.“I may tell you,” answered Horace, speaking hesitatingly, “that
circumstances have arisen which render it somewhat difficult for me
to call upon Mrs.Minster at her house--for that matter, out of the
question.She has only been to my office office within the--the last
fortnight.”

Schuyler Tenney spoke again.“The ‘circumstances’ means, Judge, that
he--”

“Pardon me, Mr.Tenney,” said Horace, with decision: “what the
circumstances mean is neither your business nor that of your friend.That is something that we will not discuss, if you please.”

“Won’t we, though!” burst in Wendover, peremptorily.“You make a fool of
us.You go sneaking around one of the girls up there.You think you’ll
set yourself in a tub of butter, and let our schemes go to the devil.You get kicked out of the house
for your impudence.And then you sit here, dressed like an Italian
organ-grinder, by God, and tell me that we won’t discuss the subject!”

Horace rose to his feet, with all his veins tingling.“You may leave
this room, both of you,” he said, in a voice which he with difficulty
kept down.Judge Wendover rose, also, but it was not to obey Horace’s command.Instead, he pointed imperiously to the chair which the young man had
vacated.“Sit down there,” he shouted.I warn you, I’m in
no mood to be fooled with.You deserve to have your neck wrung for what
you’ve done already.If I have another word of cheek from you, by God,
it _shall_ be wrung!We’ll throw you on the dungheap as we would a dead
rat.”

Horace had begun to listen to these staccato sentences with his arms
folded, and lofty defiance in his glance.Somehow, as he looked into his
antagonist’s blazing eyes, his courage melted before their hot menace.The pudgy figure of the Judge visibly magnified itself under his gaze,
and the threat in that dry, husky voice set his nerves to quaking.“All right,” he said, in an altered voice.“I’m willing enough to talk,
only a man doesn’t like to be bullied in that way in his own house.”

“It’s a tarnation sight better than being bullied by a warder in Auburn
State’s prison,” said the Judge, as he too resumed his chair.“Take my
word for that.”

Schuyler Tenney crossed his legs nervously at this, and coughed.Horace
looked at them both in a mystified but uneasy silence.“You heard what I said?” queried Wendover, brusquely, after a moment’s
pause.“Undoubtedly I did,” answered Horace.“But--but its application escaped
me.”

“What I mean is”--the Judge hesitated for a moment to note Tenney’s mute
signal of dissuasion, and then went on: “We might as well not beat about
the bush--what I mean is that there’s a penitentiary job in this thing
for somebody, unless we all keep our heads, and have good luck to boot.You’ve done your best to get us all into a hole, with your confounded
airs and general foolishness.If worse comes to worst, perhaps we can
save ourselves, but there won’t be a ghost of a chance for you.I’ll see
to that myself.If we come to grief, you shall pay for it.”

“What do you mean?” asked Horace, in a subdued tone, after a period of
silent reflection.“Where does the penitentiary part come in?”

“I don’t agree with the Judge at all,” interposed Tenney, eagerly.“I
don’t think there’s any need of looking on the dark side of the thing.We don’t _know_ that Tracy knows anything.And then, why shouldn’t we be
able to get our own man appointed receiver?”

“This is the situation,” said Wendover, speaking deliberately.Minster to borrow four hundred thousand dollars for the
purchase of certain machinery patents, and you drew up the papers for
the operation.It happens that she already owned--or rather that the
Mfg.Company already owned--these identical rights and patents.They
were a part of the plant and business we put into the company at one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars when we moved over from Cadmus.But
nobody on her side, except old Clarke, knew just what it was that we put
in.He died in Florida, and it was arranged that his papers should
pass to you.There was no record that we had sold the right of the nail
machine.”

Horace gazed with bewilderment into the hard-drawn, serious faces of
the two men who sat across the little table from him.In the yellow
lamplight these countenances looked like masks, and he searched them in
vain for any sign of astonishment or emotion.The thing which was now
for the first time being put into words was strange, but as it shaped
itself in his mind he did not find himself startled.It was as if he had
always known about it, but had allowed it to lapse in his memory.These
men were thieves--and he was their associate!The room with its central
point of light where the three knaves were gathered, and its deepening
shadows round about, suggested vaguely to him a robber’s cave.Primary
instincts arose strong within him.Terror lest discovery should come
yielded precedence to a fierce resolve to have a share of the booty.It
seemed minutes to him before he spoke again.“Then she was persuaded to mortgage her property, to buy over again at
four times its value what she had already purchased?” he asked, with an
assumption of calmness.“That seems to be about what you managed to induce her to do,” said the
Judge, dryly.“Then you admit that it was I who did it--that you owe the success of
the thing to me!” The young man could not restrain his eagerness to
establish this point.He leaned over the table, and his eyes sparkled
with premature triumph.“No: I said ‘_seems_,’” answered Wendover._We_
know that from the start you have done nothing but swell around at our
expense, and create as many difficulties for us and our business
as possible.But the courts and the newspapers would look at it
differently._They_ would be sure to regard you as the one chiefly
responsible.”

“I should think we were pretty much in the same boat, my friend,” said
Horace, coldly.“I daresay,” replied the New Yorker, “only with this difference: we can
swim, and you can’t.By that I mean, we’ve got money, and you haven’t.See the point?”

Horace saw the point, and felt himself revolted at the naked selfishness
and brutality with which it was exposed.The disheartening fact that
these men would not hesitate for an instant to sacrifice him--that they
did not like him, and would not lift a finger to help him unless it was
necessary for their own salvation--rose gloomily before his mind.“Still, it would be better for all of us that the boat shouldn’t be
capsized at all,” he remarked.“That’s it--that’s the point,” put in Tenney, with animation; “that’s
what I said to the Judge.”

“This Tracy of yours,” said Wendover, “has got hold of the Minster
girls.He has been before Judge Waller with a
whole batch of applications.First, in chambers, he’s brought an action
to dissolve the trust, and asked for an order returnable at Supreme
Court chambers to show cause why, in the mean time, the furnaces
shouldn’t be opened.His grounds are, first, that the woman was
deceived; and second, that the trust is against public policy.Now,
it seems to me that our State courts can’t issue an order binding on
a board of directors at Pittsburg.Isn’t it a thing that belongs to a
United States court?How is that?”

“I’m sure I don’t know,” answered Horace.“It’s a new question to me.”

“Tenney told me you knew something as a lawyer,” was Wendover’s angry
comment.“I’d like to know where it comes in.”

The hardware merchant hastened to avert the threatened return to
personalities.“Tell him about the receiver motion,” he said.“Then Tracy, before the same judge, but in special term, has applied for
a receiver for the Thessaly Mfg.Company, on the ground of fraud.”

“That’s the meanest thing about the whole business,” commented Tenney.“Well, what do you advise doing?” asked Horace, despondently.“There are two things,” said Wendover.“First, to delay everything until
after New Year, when Mrs.Minster’s interest becomes due and can’t be
paid.That can be done by denying jurisdiction of the State court in the
trust business, and by asking for particulars in the receiver matter.The next thing is to make Thessaly too hot for those women, and for
Tracy, too, before New Year.If a mob should smash all the widow’s
windows for her, for instance, perhaps burn her stable, she’d be mighty
glad to get out of town, and out of the iron business, too.”

“But that wouldn’t shut Tracy up,” observed Tenney.“He sticks at things
like a bull-dog, once he gets a good hold.”

“I’m thinking about Tracy,” mused the Judge.Horace found himself regarding these two visitors of his with something
like admiration.The resourcefulness and resolution of their villainy
were really wonderful.Such
men would be sure to win, if victory were not absolutely impossible.At
least, there was nothing for it but to cordially throw in his lot with
them.“Whatever is decided upon, I’ll do my share,” he said, with decision.Upon reflection, he added: “But if I share the risks, I must be clearly
understood to also share the profits.”

Judge Wendover looked at the young man sternly, and breathed hard as he
looked.“Upon my word,” he growled at last, “you’re the cheekiest young
cub I’ve seen since before the war!”

Horace stood to his guns.“However that may be,” he said, “you see what
I mean.This is a highly opportune time, it strikes me, to discover just
how I stand in this matter.”

“You’ll stand where you’re put, or it will be the worse for you!”

“Surely,” Schuyler Tenney interposed, “you ought to have confidence that
we will do the fair thing.”

“My bosom may be simply overflowing with confidence in you both”--Horace
ventured upon a suggestion of irony in his intonation--“but experience
seems to indicate the additional desirability of an understanding.If you will think it over, I daresay you will gather the force of my
remark.”

The New Yorker seemed not to have heard the remark, much less to have
understood it.He addressed the middle space between Horace and Tenney
in a meditative way: “Those two speech-making fellows who are here from
the Amalgamated Confederation of Labor, or whatever it is, can both be
had to kick up a row whenever we like.They
notified me that they were coming here ten days ago.We can tell them
to keep their hands off the Canadians when they come next week, and
lead their crowd instead up to the Minster house.We’ll go over that
together, Tenney, later on.But about Tracy--perhaps these fellows
might--”

Wendover followed up the train of this thought in silence, with a
ruminative eye on vacancy.“What I was saying,” insisted Horace, “was that I wanted to know just
how I stand.”

“I suppose it’s out of the question to square Tracy,” pursued Wendover,
thinking aloud, “and that Judge Waller that he’s applied to, he’s just
another such an impracticable cuss.There’s no security for business at
all, when such fellows have the power to muddle and interfere with it.Tenney, _you_ know this Tracy.Why can’t you think of something?”

“As I remarked before,” Horace interposed once more, “what am I to get
out of this thing?”

This time the New Yorker heard him.He slowly turned his round,
white-framed face toward the speaker, and fixed upon him a penetrating
glance of wrath, suspicion, and dislike.“Oh, _that_ is what you want to know, is it?” he said, abruptly, after a
momentary silence.“Well, sir, if you had your deserts, you’d get
about seven years’ hard labor.As it is, you’ve had over seven thousand
dollars out of the concern, and you’ve done seven hundred thousand
dollars’ worth of damage.If you can make a speech before Judge Waller
this week that will stave off all these things until after New Year’s,
perhaps I may forgive you some of the annoyance and loss your infernal
idiocy and self-conceit have caused us.When you’ve done that, it will
be time enough to talk to me about giving you another chance to keep
your salary.You never made a bigger mistake
in your life than in thinking you could dictate terms to Peter Wendover,
now or any other time!Why, you poor empty-headed creature, who do you
suppose _you_ could frighten?You’re as helpless as a June-bug in a
cistern with the curb shut down.”

The Judge had risen while speaking, and put on his overcoat.He took his
hat now, and glanced to note that Tenney was also on his feet.Then he
added these further words to the young man, whose head was drooping in
spite of himself, and whose figure had sunk into a crouching posture in
the easy-chair:

“Let me give you some advice.Take precious good care not to annoy me
any more while this business is on.It was Tenney who picked you out, and who thought you could be useful.I didn’t believe in you from the start.Now that I’ve summered and
wintered you, I stand amazed, by God!that I could ever have let you get
mixed up in my affairs.But here you are, and it will be easier for us
to put up with you, and carry you along, than throw you out.Besides,
you may be able to do some good, if what I’ve said puts any sense into
your head.But don’t run away with the idea that you are necessary to
us, or that you are going to share anything, as you call it, or that you
can so much as lift your finger against us without first of all crushing
yourself.This is plain talk, and it may help you to size yourself up as
you really are.According to your own notion of yourself, God Almighty’s
overcoat would have about made you a vest.My idee of you is different,
you see, and I’m a good deal nearer right than you are.I’ll send the
papers over to you to-morrow, and let us see what you will do with
them.”

The New York magnate turned on his heel at this, and, without any word
of adieu, he and Tenney left the room.Horace sat until long after midnight in his chair, with the bottle
before him, half-dazed and overwhelmed amidst the shapeless ruins of his
ambition.CHAPTER XXIX.--THE MISTS CLEARING AWAY.REUBEN Tracy rose at an unwontedly early hour next morning, under the
spur of consciousness that he had a very busy day before him.While he
was still at his breakfast in the hotel dining-room, John Fairchild came
to keep an appointment made the previous evening, and the two men were
out on the streets together before Thessaly seemed wholly awake.Their first visit was to the owner of the building which the Citizens’
Club had thought of hiring, and their business here was promptly
despatched; thence they made their way to the house of a boss-carpenter,
and within the hour they had called upon a plumber, a painter, and one
or two other master artisans.By ten o’clock those of this number with
whom arrangements had been made had put in an appearance at the building
in question, and Tracy and Fairchild explained to them the plans which
they were to carry out.The discussion and settlement of these consumed
the time until noon, when the lawyer and the editor separated, and
Reuben went to his office.Here, as had been arranged, he found old ’Squire Gedney waiting
for him.A long interview behind the closed door of the inner office
followed, and when the two men came out the justice of the peace was
putting a roll of bills into his pocket.“This is Tuesday,” he said to Tracy.“I daresay I can be back by
Thursday.The bother about it is that Cadmus is such an out-of-the-way
place to get at.”

“At all events, I’ll count on seeing you Friday morning,” answered
Reuben.“Then, if you’ve got what I expect, we can go before the county
judge and get our warrants by Saturday, and that will be in plenty of
time for the grand jury next week.”

“If they don’t all eat their Christmas dinner in Auburn prison, call me
a Dutchman!” was Gedney’s confident remark, as he took his departure.Reuben, thus left alone, walked up and down the larger room in
pleased excitement, his hands in his pockets and his eyes aglow with
satisfaction.So all-pervasive was his delight that it impelled him
to song, and he hummed to himself as he paced the floor a faulty
recollection of a tune his mother had been fond of, many years before.Reuben had no memory for music, and knew neither the words nor the air,
but no winged outburst of exultation from a triumphant Viking in the
opera could have reflected a more jubilant mood.He had unearthed the conspiracy, seized upon its avenues of escape,
laboriously traced all its subterranean burrowings.Even without the
proof which it was to be hoped that Gedney could bring from Cadmus,
Reuben believed he had information enough to justify criminal
proceedings.Nothing could be clearer than guilty collusion between this
New Yorker, Wendover, and some of the heads of the pig-iron trust to rob
Mrs.At almost every turn and corner in the
ramification of the huge swindle, Tenney and Boyce also appeared.Reuben Tracy was the softest-hearted of men, but
it did not occur to him to relent when he thought of his late partner.To the contrary, there was a decided pleasure in the reflection that
nothing could avert well-merited punishment from this particular young
man.The triumph had its splendid public side, moreover.Great and lasting
good must follow such an exposure as he would make of the economic and
social evils underlying the system of trusts.A staggering blow would be
dealt to the system, and to the sentiment back of it that rich men might
do what they liked in America.With pardonable pride he thrilled at the
thought that his arm was to strike this blow.The effect would be felt
all over the country.It could not but affect public opinion, too, on
the subject of the tariff--that bomb-proof cover under which these
men had conducted their knavish operations.Reuben sang with increased
fervor as this passed through his mind.On his way back from luncheon--which he still thought of as
dinner--Reuben Tracy stopped for a few moments at the building he and
Fairchild had rented.The carpenters were already at work, ripping down
the partitions on the ground floor, in a choking and clamorous confusion
of dust and sound of hammering.The visible energy of these workmen and
the noise they made were like a sympathetic continuation of his song of
success.He would have enjoyed staying for hours, watching and listening
to these proofs that he at last was doing something to help move the
world around.When he came out upon the street again, it was to turn his steps to the
house of the Minsters.He had not been there since his visit in March,
and there was a certain embarrassment about his going now.Minster’s house, and he had been put in the position of acting
against her, as counsel for her daughters.It was therefore a somewhat
delicate business.But Miss Kate had asked him to come, and he would
be sincerely glad of the opportunity of telling Mrs.Minster the whole
truth, if she would listen to it.Just what form this opportunity might
take he could not foresee; but his duty was so clear, and his arguments
must carry such absolute conviction, that he approached the ordeal with
a light heart.Miss Kate came down into the drawing-room to receive him, and Reuben
noted with a deep joy that she again wore the loose robe of creamy
cloth, girdled by that same enchanted rope of shining white silk.Something made him feel, too, that she observed the pleased glance of
recognition he bestowed upon her garments, and understood it, and
was not vexed.Their relations had been distinctly cordial--even
confidential--for the past fortnight; but the reappearance of this
sanctified and symbolical gown--this mystical robe which he had
enshrined in his heart with incense and candles and solemn veneration,
as does the Latin devotee with the jewelled dress of the Bambino--seemed
of itself to establish a far more tender intimacy between them.He
became conscious, all at once, that she knew of his love.“I have asked mamma to see you,” she said, when they were seated, “and
I think she will.Since it was first suggested to her, she has wavered a
good deal, sometimes consenting, sometimes not.The poor lady is almost
distracted with the trouble in which we have all become involved, and
that makes it all the more difficult for her to see things in their
proper connection.I hope you may be able to show her just how matters
stand, and who her real friends are.”

The girl left at this, and in a few moments reappeared with her mother,
to whom she formally presented Mr.Minster had suffered great mental anguish since the troubles
came on, her countenance gave no hint of the fact.It was as regular and
imperturbable and deceptively impressive as ever, and she bore herself
with perfect self-possession, bowing with frosty precision, and seating
herself in silence.Reuben himself began the talk by explaining that the steps which he had
felt himself compelled to take in the interest of the daughters implied
not the slightest hostility to the mother.They had had, in fact, the
ultimate aim of helping her as well.He had satisfied himself that she
was in the clutch of a criminal conspiracy to despoil her estate
and that of her daughters.It was absolutely necessary to act
with promptness, and, as he was not her lawyer, to temporarily and
technically separate the interest of her daughters from her own, for
legal purposes.All that had been done was, however, quite as much to
her advantage as to that of her daughters, and when he had explained to
her the entire situation he felt sure she would be willing to allow him
to represent her as well as her daughters in the effort to protect the
property and defeat the conspiracy.Minster offered no comment upon this expression of confidence, and
Reuben went on to lay before her the whole history of the case.He
did this with great clearness--as if he had been talking to a
child--pointing out to her how the scheme of plunder originated, where
its first operations revealed themselves, and what part in turn each of
the three conspirators had played.She listened to it all with an expressionless face, and though she must
have been startled and shocked by a good deal of it, Reuben could gather
no indication from her manner of her feelings or her opinions.When he
had finished, and his continued silence rendered it clear that he was
not going to say any more, she made her first remark.“I’m much obliged to you, I’m sure,” she said, with no sign of emotion.“It was very kind of you to explain it to me.But of course _they_
explain it quite differently.”

“No doubt,” answered Reuben.“That is just what they would do.The
difference is that they have lied to you, and that I have told you what
the books, what the proofs, really show.”

“I have known Peter Wendover since we were children together,” she said,
after a momentary pause, “and _he_ never would have advised my daughters
to sue their own mother!”

Reuben suppressed a groan.Minster; least
of all, your daughters,” he tried to explain.“The actions I have
brought--that is, including the applications--are directed against the
men who have combined to swindle you, not at all against you.They might
just as well have been brought in your name also, only that I had no
power to act for you.”

“It is the same as suing me.Judge Wendover said so,” was her reply.“What I seek to have you realize is that Judge Wendover purposely
misleads you.He is the head and front of the conspiracy to rob you.I am going to have him indicted for it.The proofs are as plain as a
pikestaff.How, then, can you continue to believe what he tells you?”

“I quite believe that you mean well, Mr.“But
lawyers, you know, always take opposite sides.One lawyer tells you one
thing; then the other swears to precisely the contrary.Don’t think I
blame them.But you know what I mean.”

A little more of this hopeless conversation ensued, and then Mrs.“Don’t let me drive you away, Mr.Tracy,” she said, as
he too got upon his feet.“But if you will excuse me--I’ve had so much
worry lately--and these headaches come on every afternoon now.”

As Reuben walked beside her to open the door, he ventured to say: “It
is a very dear wish of mine, Mrs.Minster, to remove all this cause for
worry, and to get you back control over your property, and to rid you
of these scoundrels, root and branch.For your own sake and that of your
daughters, let me beg of you to take no step that will embarrass me in
the fight.There is nothing that you could do now to specially help me,
except to do nothing at all.”

“If you mean for me not to sue my daughters,” she said, as he opened the
door, “you may rest easy.Nothing would tempt me to do _that!_ The very
idea of such a thing is too dreadful.Good-day, sir.”

Reuben this time did not repress the groan, after he had closed the door
upon Mrs.He realized that he had made no more impression on
her mind than ordnance practice makes on a sandbank.He did not attempt
to conceal his dejection as he returned to where Kate sat, and resumed
his chair in front of her.The daughter’s smiling face, however,
partially reassured him, “That’s mamma all over,” she said.“Isn’t it
wonderful how those old race types reappear, even in our day?She is
as Dutch as any lady of Haarlem that Franz Hals ever painted.Her mind
works sidewise, like a crab.I’m _so_ glad you told her everything!”

“If I could only feel that it had had any result,” said Reuben.“Oh, but it will have!” the girl insisted confidently.“I’m sure she
liked you very much.”

“That reminds me--” the lawyer spoke musingly--“I think I was told
once that she didn’t like me; that she stipulated that I was not to be
consulted about her business by--by my then partner.Do you know?”

“I have an idea,” said Kate.Then she stopped, and a delicate shadowy
flush passed over her face.“But it was nothing,” she added, hastily,
after a long pause.She could not bring herself to mention that year-old
foolish gossip about the Lawton girl.Reuben did not press for an answer, but began telling her about the work
he and Fairchild had inaugurated that morning.“We are not going to wait
for the committee,” he said.“The place can be in some sort of
shape within a week, I hope, and then we are going to open it as a
reading-room first of all, where every man of the village who behaves
himself can be free to come.There will be tea and coffee at low prices;
and if the lockout continues, I’ve got plans for something else--a kind
of soup-kitchen.We sha’n’t attempt to put the thing on a business basis
at all until the men have got to work again.Then we will leave it to
them, as to how they will support it, and what shall be done with the
other rooms.By the way, I haven’t seen much lately of the Lawton girl’s
project.I’ve heard vaguely that a start had been made, and that it
seemed to work well.Are you pleased with it?”

Kate answered in a low voice: “I have never been there but once since we
met there last winter.I did what I promised, in the way of assistance,
but I did not go again.I too have heard vaguely that it was a success.”

Reuben looked such obvious inquiry that that young lady felt impelled to
explain: “The very next day after I went there last with the money and
the plan, I heard some very painful things about the girl--about her
present life, I mean--from a friend, or rather from one whom I took then
to be a friend; and what he said prejudiced me, I suppose--”

A swift intuition helped Reuben to say: “By a friend’ you mean Horace
Boyce!”

Kate nodded her head in assent.As for Reuben, he rose abruptly from his
seat, motioning to his companion to keep her chair.He thrust his hands
into his pockets, and began pacing up and down along the edge of the
sofa at her side, frowning at the carpet.“Miss Kate,” he said at last, in a voice full of strong feeling, “there
is no possibility of my telling you what an infernal blackguard that man
is.”

“Yes, he has behaved very badly,” she said.“I suppose I am to blame for
having listened to him at all.But he had seen me there at her place,
through the glass door, and he seemed so anxious to keep me from being
imposed upon, and possibly compromised, that--”

“My dear young lady,” broke in Reuben, “you have no earthly idea of the
cruelty and meanness of what he did by saying that to you.I can’t--or
yes, why shouldn’t I?The fact is that that poor girl--and when she was
at my school she was as honest and good and clever a child as I ever saw
in my life--owed her whole misery and wretchedness to Horace Boyce.I
never dreamed of it, either at the time or later; in fact, until the
very day I met you at the milliner’s shop.Somehow I mentioned that he
was my partner, and then she told me.And then, knowing that, I had
to sit still all summer and see him coming here every day, on intimate
terms with you and your sister and mother.” Reuben stopped himself with
the timely recollection that this was an unauthorized emotion, and
added hurriedly: “But I never could have imagined such baseness, to
deliberately slander her to you!”

Kate did not at once reply, and when she did speak it was to turn the
talk away from Horace Boyce.“I will go and see her to-morrow,” she
said.“I am very glad to hear you say that,” was Reuben’s comment.“It is like
you to say it,” he went on, with brightening eyes.“It is a benediction
to be the friend of a young woman like you, who has no impulses that are
not generous, and whose only notion of power is to help others.”

“I shall not like you if you begin to flatter,” she replied, with mock
austerity, and an answering light in her eyes.“I am really a very
perverse and wrong-headed girl, distinguished only for having never done
any good at all.And anybody who says otherwise is not a friend, but a
flatterer, and I am weary of false tongues.”

Miss Ethel came in while Reuben was still turning over in his mind the
unexpressed meanings of these words, and with her entrance the talk
became general once more.The lawyer described to the two sisters the legal steps he had taken,
and their respective significance, and then spoke of his intention to
make a criminal complaint as soon as some additional proof, now being
sought, should come to hand.“And Horace Boyce will go to prison, then?” she
asked, eagerly.“There is a strong case against him,” answered Reuben.The graveness of his tone affected the girl’s spirits, and led her to
say in an altered voice: “I don’t want to be unkind, and I daresay I
shall be silly enough to cry in private if the thing really happens; but
when I think of the trouble and wickedness he has been responsible for,
and of the far more terrible mischief he might have wrought in this
family if I--that is, if we had not come to you as we did, I simply
_hate_ him.”

“Don’t let us talk about him any more, puss,” said Kate, soberly, rising
as she spoke.CHAPTER XXX.--JESSICA’S GREAT DESPAIR.It was on the following day that a less important member of society
than Miss Minster resolved to also pay a visit to the milliner’s shop.Ben Lawton’s second wife--for she herself scarcely thought of “Mrs.Lawton” as a title appertaining to her condition of ill-requited
servitude--had become possessed of some new clothes.Their monetary
value was not large, but they were warm and respectable, with bugle
trimming on the cloak, and a feather rising out of real velvet on the
bonnet; and they were new all together at the same time, a fact which
impressed her mind by its novelty even more than did the inherent charm
of acquisition.To go out in this splendid apparel was an obvious duty.The notion of going shopping loomed in the background of
Mrs.Lawton’s thoughts for a while, but in a formless and indistinct
way, and then disappeared again.Her mind was not civilized enough to
assimilate the idea of loitering around among the stores when she had no
money with which to buy anything.Gradually the conception of a visit to her step-Jessica took shape in
her imagination.Perhaps the fact that she owed her new clothes to the bounty of this
girl helped forward this decision.There was also a certain curiosity to
see the child who was Ben’s grandson, and so indirectly related to her,
and for whose anomalous existence there was more than one precedent in
her own family, and who might turn out to resemble her own little lost
Alonzo.But the consideration which primarily dictated her choice was
that there was no other place to go to.Her reception by Jessica, when she finally found her way by Samantha’s
complicated directions to the shop, was satisfactorily cordial.She was
allowed to linger for a time in the show-room, and satiate bewilderment
over the rich plumes, and multi- velvets and ribbons there
displayed; then she was taken into the domestic part of the building,
where she was asked like a real visitor to take off her cloak and
bonnet, and sat down to enjoy the unheard-of luxury of seeing somebody
else getting a “meal of victuals” ready.The child was playing by
himself back of the stove with some blocks.He seemed to take no
interest in his new relation, and Mrs.Lawton saw that if Alonzo
had lived he would not have looked like this boy, who was blonde
and delicate, with serious eyes and flaxen curls, and a high, rather
protuberant forehead.The brevet grandmother heard with surprise from Lucinda that this
five-year-old child already knew most of his letters.She stole furtive
glances at him after this, from time to time, and as soon as Jessica had
gone out into the store and closed the door she asked:

“Don’t his head look to you like water on the brain?”

Lucinda shook her head emphatically: “He’s healthy enough,” she said.“And his name’s Horace, you say?”

“Yes, that’s what I said,” replied the girl.Lawton burned to ask what other name the lad bore, but the
peremptory tones of her daughter warned her off.Instead she remarked:
“And so he’s been livin’ in Tecumseh all this while?They seem to have
brung him up pretty good--teachin’ him his A B C’s and curlin’ his
hair.”

“He had a good home.Jess paid high, and the people took a liking to
him,” said Lucinda.“I s’pose they died or broke up housekeepin’,” tentatively suggested
Mrs.“No: Jess wanted him here, or thought she did.” Lucinda’s loyalty to her
sister prompted her to stop the explanation at this.But she herself
had been sorely puzzled and tried by the change which had come over
the little household since the night of the boy’s arrival, and the
temptation to put something of this into words was too strong to be
mastered.“I wish myself he hadn’t come at all,” she continued from the table
where she was at work.“Not but that he’s a good enough young-one, and
lots of company for us both, but Jess ain’t been herself at all since
she brought him here.It ain’t his fault--poor little chap--but she
fetched him from Tecumseh on account of something special; and then
that something didn’t seem to come off, and she’s as blue as a whetstone
about it, and that makes everything blue.And there we are!”

Lucinda finished in a sigh, and proceeded to rub grease on the inside of
her cake tins with a gloomy air.*****

In the outer shop, Jessica found herself standing surprised and silent
before the sudden apparition of a visitor whom she had least of all
expected--Miss Kate Minster.The bell which formerly jangled when the street door opened had been
taken off because it interfered with the child’s mid-day sleep, and
Jessica herself had been so deeply lost in a brown study where she sat
sewing behind the counter that she had not noted the entrance of the
young lady until she stood almost within touch.Then she rose hurriedly,
and stood confused and tongue-tied, her work in hand.She dropped this
impediment when Miss Minster offered to shake hands with her, but even
this friendly greeting did not serve to restore her self-command or
induce a smile.“I have a thousand apologies to make for leaving you alone all this
while,” said Kate.“But--we have been so troubled of late--and, selfish
like, I have forgotten everything else.Or no--I won’t say that--for I
have thought a great deal about you and your work.And now you must tell
me all about both.”

Miss Minster had seated herself as she spoke, and loosened the boa
about her throat, but Jessica remained standing.She idly noted that no
equipage and coachman were in waiting outside, and let the comment drift
to her tongue.“You walked, I see,” she said.“It isn’t pleasant to take out the horses now.The
streets are full of men out of work, and they blame us for it, and to
see us drive about seems to make them angry.I suppose it’s a natural
enough feeling; but the boys pelted our coachman with snowballs the
other day, while my sister and I were driving, and the men on the corner
all laughed and encouraged them.But if I walk nobody molests me.”

The young lady, as she said this with an air of modest courage, had
never looked so beautiful before in Jessica’s eyes, or appealed so
powerfully to her liking and admiration.But the milliner was conscious
of an invasion of other and rival feelings which kept her face smileless
and hardened the tone of her voice.“Yes, the men feel very bitterly,” she said.“I know that from the
girls.A good many of them--pretty nearly all, for that matter--have
stopped coming here, since the lockout, because _your_ money furnished
the Resting House.That shows how strong the feeling is.”

“You amaze me!”

There was no pretence in Miss Kate’s emotion.She looked at Jessica with
wide-open eyes, and the astonishment in the gaze visibly softened and
saddened into genuine pain.“Oh, I _am_ so sorry!” she said.“I never
thought of _that_.How can we get that cruel
notion out of their heads?I did so _truly_ want to help the girls.Surely there must be some way of making them realize this.The closing
of the works, that is a business matter with which I had nothing to do,
and which I didn’t approve; but this plan of yours, _that_ was really
a pet of mine.It is only by a stupid accident that I did not come here
often, and get to know the girls, and show them how interested I was in
everything.Tracy spoke of you yesterday, I resolved to come at
once, and tell you how ashamed I was.”

Jessica’s heart was deeply stirred by this speech, and filled with
yearnings of tenderness toward the beautiful and good patrician.But
some strange, undefined force in her mind held all this softness in
subjection.“The girls are gone,” she said, almost coldly.“They will not come
back--at least for a long time, until all this trouble is forgotten.”

“They hate me too much,” groaned Kate, in grieved self-abasement.“They don’t know _you!_ What they think of is that it is the Minster
money; that is what they hate.To take away from the men with a shovel,
and give back to the girls with a spoon--they won’t stand that!” The
latent class-feeling of a factory town flamed up in Jessica’s bosom,
intolerant and vengeful, as she listened to her own words.“I would
feel like that myself, if I were in their place,” she said, in curt
conclusion.The daughter of the millions sat for a little in pained irresolution.She was conscious of impulses toward anger at the coldness, almost the
rudeness, of this girl whom she had gone far out of and beneath her way
to assist.Her own class-feeling, too, subtly prompted her to dismiss
with contempt the thought of these thick-fingered, uncouth factory-girls
who were rejecting her well-meant bounty.But kindlier feelings strove
within her mind, too, and kept her for the moment undecided.She looked up at Jessica, as if in search for help, and her woman’s
heart suddenly told her that the changes in the girl’s face, vaguely
apparent to her before, were the badges of grief and unrest.All the
annoyance she had been nursing fled on the instant.Her eyes moistened,
and she laid her hand softly on the other’s arm.“_You_ at least mustn’t think harshly of me,” she said with a smile.“That would be _too_ sad.I would give a great deal if the furnaces
could be opened to-morrow--if they had never been shut.Not even the
girls whose people are out of work feel more deeply about the thing
than I do.But--after all, time must soon set that right.Is there nothing I can do for you?”

An answering moisture came into Jessica’s eyes as she met the other’s
look.She shook her head, and withdrew her wrist from the kindly
pressure of Kate’s hand.“I spoke of you at length with Mr.Tracy,” Kate went on, gently.“_Do_
believe that we are both anxious to do all we can for you, in whatever
form you like.You have never spoken about more money for the Resting
House.If it is, don’t hesitate for a
moment to let me know.And mayn’t I go and see the house, now that I am
here?You know I have never been inside it once since you took it.”

For a second or two Jessica hesitated.It cost her a great deal
to maintain the unfriendly attitude she had taken up, and she was
hopelessly at sea as to why she was paying this price for unalloyed
unhappiness.Yet still she persisted doggedly, and as it were in spite
of herself.“It’s a good deal run down just now,” she said.“Since the trouble came,
Lucinda and I haven’t kept it up.You’d like better to see it some time
when it was in order; that is, if I--if it isn’t given up altogether!”

The despairing intonation of these closing words was not lost upon Kate.“Why do you speak like that?” she said.Oh, I hope it isn’t as bad as that!”

“I’m thinking a good deal of going away.You and Miss Wilcox can put
somebody else here, and keep open the house.My
heart isn’t in it any more.”

The girl forced herself through these words with a mournful effort.The
hot tears came to her eyes before she had finished, and she turned away
abruptly, walking behind the counter to the front of the shop.“There is something you are not
telling me, my child,” she urged with tender earnestness._Let_ me help you!”

“There is nothing--nothing at all,” Jessica made answer.“Only I am not
happy here.And there are--other things--that
were a mistake, too.”

“Why not confide in me, dear?Why not let me help you?”

“How could _you_ help me?” The girl spoke with momentary impatience.“There are things that _money_ can’t help.”

The rich young lady drew herself up instinctively, and tightened the fur
about her neck.The words affected her almost like an affront.“I’m very sorry,” she said, with an obvious cooling of manner.“I did
not mean money alone.I had hoped you felt I was your friend.And I
still want to be, if occasion arises.I shall be very much grieved,
indeed, if you do not let me know, at any and all times, when I can be
of use to you.”

She held out her hand, evidently as an indication that she was going.Jessica saw the hand through a mist of smarting tears, and took it, not
daring to look up.She was filled with longings to kiss this hand, to
cry out for forgiveness, to cast herself upon the soft shelter of this
sweet friendship, so sweetly proffered.But there was some strange spell
which held her back, and, still through the aching film of tears, she
saw the gloved hand withdrawn.A soft “good-by” spread its pathos upon
the silence about her, and then Miss Minster was gone.Jessica stood for a time, looking blankly into the street.Then she
turned and walked with unconscious directness, as in a dream, through
the back rooms and across the yard to the Resting House.She had passed
her stepmother, her sister, and her child without bestowing a glance
upon them, and she wandered now through the silent building aimlessly,
without power to think of what she saw.Although the furniture was
still of the most primitive and unpretentious sort, there were many
little appliances for the comfort of the girls, in which she had had
much innocent delight.The bath-rooms on the upper floor, the willow
rocking-chairs in the sitting-room, the neat row of cups and saucers
in the glassfaced cupboard, the magazines and pattern books on the
table--all these it had given her pleasure to contemplate only a
fortnight ago.She noted that the fire in
the base-burner had gone out, though the reservoir still seemed full of
coal.She was conscious of a vague sense of fitness in its having gone
out.The fire that had burned within her heart was in ashes, too.She
put her apron to her eyes and wept vehemently, here in solitude.Lucinda came out, nearly an hour later, to find her sister sitting
disconsolate by the fireless stove, shivering with the cold, and staring
into vacancy.She put her broad arm with maternal kindness around Jessica’s waist, and
led her unresisting toward the door.“Never mind, sis,” she murmured,
with clumsy sympathy.“Come in and play with Horace.”

Jessica, shuddering again with the chill, buried her face on her
sister’s shoulder, and wept supinely.There was not an atom of courage
remaining in her heart.“You are low down and miserable,” pursued Lucinda, compassionately.“I’ll make you up some boneset tea.It’ll be lucky if you haven’t caught
your death a-cold out here so long.” She had taken a shawl, which hung
in the hallway, and wrapped it about her sister’s shoulders.“I half wish I had,” sobbed Jessica.“There’s no fight left in me any
more.”

“What’s the matter, anyway?”

“If I knew myself,” the girl groaned in answer, “perhaps I could do
something; but I don’t.I can’t think, I can’t eat or sleep or work.what is the matter with me?”




CHAPTER XXXI.--A STRANGE ENCOUNTER.A SOMBRE excitement reigned in Thessaly next day, when it became known
that the French-Cana-dian workmen whom the rolling-mill people were
importing would arrive in the village within the next few hours.They
were coming through from Massachusetts, and watchful eyes at Troy had
noted their temporary halt there and the time of the train they took
westward.The telegraph sped forward the warning, and fully a thousand
idle men in Thessaly gathered about the dépôt, both inside and on the
street without, to witness the unwelcome advent.Some indefinite rumors of the sensation reached the secluded milliner’s
shop on the back street, during the day.Ben Lawton drifted in to warm
himself during the late forenoon, and told of the stirring scenes that
were expected.He was quick to observe that Jessica was not looking
well, and adjured her to be careful about the heavy cold which she said
she had taken.The claims upon him of the excitement outside were too
strong to be resisted, but he promised to look in during the afternoon
and tell them the news.The daylight of the November afternoon was beginning imperceptibly
to wane before any further tidings of the one topic of great public
interest reached the sisters.One of the better class of factory-girls
came in to gossip with Lucinda, and she brought with her a veritable
budget of information.The French Canadians had arrived, and with them
came some Pinkerton detectives, or whatever they were called, who were
said to be armed to the teeth.The crowd had fiercely hooted these
newcomers and their guards, and there had been a good deal of angry
hustling.For awhile it looked as if a fight must ensue; but, somehow,
it did not come off.The Canadians, in a body, had gone with their
escort to the row of new cottages which the company had hired for them,
followed by a diminishing throng of hostile men and boys.There were
numerous personal incidents to relate, and the two sisters listened with
deep interest to the whole recital.When it was finished the girl still sat about, evidently with something
on her mind.At last, with a blunt “Can I speak to you for a moment?”
 she led Jessica out into the shop.There, in a whisper, with repeated
affirmations and much detail, she imparted the confidential portion of
her intelligence.The effect of this information upon Jessica was marked and immediate.As soon as the girl had gone she hastened to the living-room, and began
hurriedly putting on her boots.The effort of stooping to button them
made her feverish head ache, and she was forced to call the amazed
Lucinda to her assistance.“You’re crazy to think of going out such a day as this,” protested the
girl, “and you with such a cold, too.”

“It’s got to be done,” said Jessica, her eyes burning with eagerness,
and her cheeks flushed.“If it killed me, it would have to be done.But
I’ll bundle up warm.I’ll be all right.” Refusing
to listen to further dissuasion she hastily put on her hat and cloak,
and then with nervous rapidity wrote a note, sealed it up tightly with
an envelope, and marked on it, with great plainness, the address: “Miss
Kate Minster.”

“Give this to father when he comes,” she cried, “and tell him--”

Ben Lawton’s appearance at the door interrupted the directions.He was
too excited about the events of the day to be surprised at seeing the
daughter he had left an invalid now dressed for the street; but she
curtly stopped the narrative which he began.“We’ve heard all about it,” she said.“I want you to come with me now.”

Lucinda watched the dominant sister drag on and button her gloves with
apprehension and solicitude written all over her honest face.“Now, do
be careful,” she repeated more than once.As Jessica said “I’m ready now,” and turned to join her father, the
little boy came into the shop through the open door of the living-room.A swift instinct prompted the mother to go to him and stoop to kiss him
on the forehead.The child smiled at her; and when she was out in
the street, walking so hurriedly that her father found the gait
unprecedented in his languid experience, she still dwelt curiously in
her mind upon the sweetness of that infantile smile.And this, by some strange process, suddenly brought clearness and order
to her thoughts.Under the stress of this nervous tension, perhaps
because of the illness which she felt in every bone, yet which seemed to
clarify her senses, her mind was all at once working without confusion.She saw now that what had depressed her, overthrown her self-control,
impelled her to reject the kindness of Miss Minster, had been the
humanization, so to speak, of her ideal, Reuben Tracy.The bare thought
of his marrying and giving in marriage--of his being in love with the
rich girl--this it was that had so strangely disturbed her.Looking at
it now, it was the most foolish thing in the world.What on earth had
she to do with Reuben Tracy?There could never conceivably have entered
her head even the most vagrant and transient notion that he--no, she
would not put _that_ thought into form, even in her own mind.And were
there two young people in all the world who had more claim to her good
wishes than Reuben and Kate?She answered this heartily in the negative,
and said to herself that she truly was glad that they loved each other.She bit her lips, and insisted on repeating this to
her own thoughts.But why, then, had the discovery of this so unnerved her?It must have been because the idea of their
happiness made the isolation of her own life so miserably clear; because
she felt that they had forgotten her and her work in their new-found
concern for each other.She was all over
that weak folly now.She had it in her power to help them, and dim,
half-formed wishes that she might give life itself to their service
flitted across her mind.She had spoken never a word to her father all this while, and had seemed
to take no note either of direction or of what and whom she passed; but
she stopped now in front of the doorway in Main Street which bore the
law-sign of Reuben Tracy.“Wait for me here,” she said to Ben, and
disappeared up the staircase.Jessica made her way with some difficulty up the second flight.Her head
burned with the exertion, and there was a novel numbness in her limbs;
but she gave this only a passing thought.On the panel was tacked a white
half-sheet of paper.It was not easy to decipher the inscription in the
failing light, but she finally made it out to be:

“_Called away until noon to-morrow (Friday)_.”

The girl leaned against the door-sill for support.In the first moment
or two it seemed to her that she was going to swoon.Then resolution
came back to her, and with it a new store of strength, and she went down
the stairs again slowly and in terrible doubt as to what should now be
done.The memory suddenly came to her of the one other time she had been in
this stairway, when she had stood in the darkness with her little boy,
gathered up against the wall to allow the two Minster ladies to pass.Upon the heels of this chased the recollection--with such lack of
sequence do our thoughts follow one another--of the singularly sweet
smile her little boy had bestowed upon her, half an hour since, when she
kissed him.The smile had lingered in her mind as a beautiful picture.Walking down
the stairs now, in the deepening shadows, the revelation dawned upon her
all at once--it was his father’s smile!Yes, yes--hurriedly the fancy
reared itself in her thoughts--thus the lover of her young girlhood had
looked upon her.The delicate, clever face; the prettily arched lips;
the soft, light curls upon the forehead; the tenderly beaming blue
eyes--all were the same.very often--this resemblance had forced itself upon her
consciousness before.But now, lighted up by that chance babyish smile,
it came to her in the guise of a novelty, and with a certain fascination
in it.Her head seemed to have ceased to ache, now that this almost
pleasant thought had entered it.It was passing strange, she felt, that
any sense of comfort should exist for her in memories which had fed
her soul upon bitterness for so long a time.Yet it was already on the
instant apparent to her that when she should next have time to think,
that old episode would assume less hateful aspects than it had always
presented before.At the street door she found her father leaning against a shutter and
discussing the events of the day with the village lamplighter, who
carried a ladder on his shoulder, and reported great popular agitation
to exist.Jessica beckoned Ben summarily aside, and put into his hands the letter
she had written at the shop.“I want you to take this at once to Miss
Minster, at her house,” she said, hurriedly.“See to it that she gets it
herself.Don’t say a word to any living
soul.I’ve said you can be depended
upon.If you show yourself a man, it may make your fortune.Now, hurry;
and I do hope you will do me credit!”

Under the spur of this surprising exhortation, Ben walked away with
unexampled rapidity, until he had overtaken the lamplighter, from whom
he borrowed some chewing tobacco.The girl, left to herself, began walking irresolutely down Main Street.The flaring lights in the store windows seemed to add to the confusion
of her mind.It had appeared to be important to send her father away at
once, but now she began to regret that she had not kept him to help her
in her search.For Reuben Tracy must be found at all hazards.How to go to work to trace him she did not know.She had no notion
whatever as to who his intimate friends were.The best device she could
think of would be to ask about him at the various law-offices; for she
had heard that however much lawyers might pretend to fight one another
in court, they were all on very good terms outside.Some little distance down the street she came upon the door of another
stairway which bore a number of lawyers’ signs.The windows all up the
front of this building were lighted, and without further examination she
ascended the first flight of stairs.The landing was almost completely
dark, but an obscured gleam came from the dusty transoms over three or
four doors close about her.She knocked on one of these at random, and
in response to an inarticulate vocal sound from within, opened the door
and entered.It was a square, medium-sized room in which she found herself, with
a long, paper-littered table in the centre, and tall columns of light
leather-covered books rising along the walls.At the opposite end of the
chamber a man sat at a desk, his back turned to her, his elbows on the
desk, and his head in his hands.The shaded light in front of him made a
mellow golden fringe around the outline of his hair.A sudden bewildering tumult burst forth in the girl’s breast as she
looked at this figure.Then, as suddenly, the recurring mental echoes of
the voice which had bidden her enter rose above this tumult and stilled
it.A gentle and comforting warmth stole through her veins.This was
Horace Boyce who sat there before her--and she did not hate him!During that instant in which she stood by the door, a whole flood of
self-illumination flashed its rays into every recess of her mind.This,
then, was the strange, formless opposing impulse which had warred with
the other in her heart for this last miserable fortnight, and dragged
her nearly to distraction.The bringing home of her boy had revived for her, by occult and subtle
processes, the old romance in which his father had been framed, as might
a hero be by sunlit clouds.She hugged the thought to her heart, and
stood looking at’ him motionless and mute.What is wanted?” he called out, querulously, without
changing his posture.It was as if a magic voice drew her
forward in a dream--herself all rapt and dumb.Irritably impressed by the continued silence, Horace lifted his head,
and swung abruptly around in his chair.His own shadow obscured the
features of his visitor.He saw only that it was a lady, and rose
hesitatingly to his feet.“Excuse me,” he mumbled, “I was busy with my thoughts, and did not know
who it was.”

“Do you know now?” Jessica heard herself ask, as in a trance.The balmy
warmth in her own heart told her that she was smiling.Horace took a step or two obliquely forward, so that the light fell on
her face.He peered with a confounded gaze at her for a moment, then let
his arms fall limp at his sides.“In the name of the dev--” he began, confusedly, and then bit the word
short, and stared at her again.“Is it really you?” he asked at last,
reassured in part by her smile.“Are you sorry to see me?” she asked in turn.Her mind could frame
nothing but these soft little meaningless queries.The young man seemed in doubt how best to answer this question.He
turned around and looked abstractedly at his desk; then with a slight
detour he walked past her, opened the door, and glanced up and down the
dark stairway.When he had closed the door once more, he turned the key
in the lock, and then, after momentary reflection, concluded to unlock
it again.“Why, no; why should I be?” he said in a more natural voice, as he
returned and stood beside her.Evidently her amiability was a more
difficult surprise for him to master than her original advent, and he
studied her face with increasing directness of gaze to make sure of it.“Come and sit down here,” he said, after a few moments of this puzzled
inspection, and resumed his own chair.“I want a good look at you,” he
explained, as he lifted the shade from the lamp.Jessica felt that she was blushing under this new radiance, and it
required an effort to return his glance.But, when she did so, the
changes in his face and expression which it revealed drove everything
else from her mind.She rose from her chair upon a sudden impulse,
and bent over him at a diffident distance.As she did so, she had the
feeling that this bitterness in which she had encased herself for years
had dropped from her on the instant like a discarded garment.“Why, Horace, your hair is quite gray!” she said, as if the fact
contained the sublimation of pathos.“There’s been trouble enough to turn it white twenty times over!You
don’t know what I’ve been through, my girl,” he said, sadly.The
novel sensation of being sympathized with, welcome as it was, greatly
accentuated his sense of deserving compassion.“I am very sorry,” she said, softly.She had seated herself again, and
was gradually recovering her self-possession.The whole situation was
so remarkable, not to say startling, that she found herself regarding it
from the outside, as if she were not a component part of it.Her pulses
were no longer strongly stirred by its personal phases.Most clear of
all things in her mind was that she was now perfectly independent of
this or any other man.She was her own master, and need ask favors from
nobody.Therefore, if it pleased her to call bygones bygones and make a
friend of Horace--or even to put a bandage across her eyes and cull from
those bygones only the rose leaves and violet blossoms, and make for her
weary soul a bed of these--what or who was to prevent her?Some inexplicable, unforeseen revulsion of feeling had made him pleasant
in her sight again.There was no doubt about it--she had genuine
satisfaction in sitting here opposite him and looking at him.Had she
so many pleasures, then, that she should throw this unlooked-for boon
deliberately away?Moreover--and here the new voices called most loudly in her heart--he
was worn and unhappy.The iron had palpably entered his soul too.He
looked years older than he had any chronological right to look.There
were heavy lines of anxiety on his face, and his blonde hair was
powdered thick with silver.“Yes, I am truly sorry,” she said again.“Is it business that has gone
wrong with you?”

“Business--family--health--sleep--everything!” he groaned, bitterly.“It
is literally a hell that I have been living in this last--these last few
months!”

“I had no idea of that,” she said, simply.Of course it would be
ridiculous to ask if there was anything she could do, but she had
comfort from the thought that he must realize what was in her mind.“So help me God, Jess!” he burst out vehemently, under the incentive of
her sympathy, “I’m coming to believe that every man is a scoundrel, and
every woman a fool!”

“There was a long time when _I_ thought that,” she said with a sigh.He looked quickly at her from under his brows, and then as swiftly
turned his glance away.“Yes, I know,” he answered uneasily, tapping
with his fingers on the desk.“But we won’t talk of that,” she urged, with a little tremor of anxiety
in her tone.“We needn’t talk of that at all.It was merely by accident
that I came here, Horace.I wanted to ask a question, and nothing was
further from my head than finding you here.”

“Let’s see--Mart Jocelyn had this place up to a couple of months ago.I didn’t know you knew him.”

“No, you foolish boy!” she said, with a smile which had a ground tone
of sadness.It was simply any lawyer I was
looking for.But what I wanted to say was that I am not angry with you
any more.I’ve learned a host of bitter lessons since we were--young
together, and I’m too much alone in the world to want to keep you an
enemy.You don’t seem so very happy yourself, Horace.Why shouldn’t
we two be friends again?I’m not talking of anything else,
Horace--understand me.But it appeals to me very strongly, this idea of
our being friends again.”

Horace looked meditatively at her, with softening eyes.“You’re the best
of the lot, dear old Jess,” he said at last, smiling candidly.“Truly
I’m glad you came--gladder than I can tell you.I was in the very slough
of despond when you entered; and now--well, at least I’m going to play
that I am out of it.”

Jessica rose with a beaming countenance, and laid her hand frankly on
his shoulder.“I’m glad I came, too,” she said.“And very soon I want to
see you again--when you are quite free--and have a long, quiet talk.”

“All right, my girl,” he answered, rising as well.The prospect seemed
entirely attractive to him.He took her hand in his, and said again:
“All right.And must you go now?”

“Oh, mercy, yes!” she exclaimed, with sudden recollection.“I had no
business to stay so long!Perhaps you can tell me--or no--” She vaguely
put together in her mind the facts that Tracy and Horace had been
partners, and seemed to be so no longer.“No, you wouldn’t know.”

“Have I so poor a legal reputation as all that?” he said, lightly
smiling.One’s friends, at least, ought to dissemble their
bad opinions.”

“No, it wasn’t about law,” she explained, stum-blingly.“It’s of no
importance.Good-by for the time.”

He would have drawn her to him and kissed her at this, but she gently
prevented the caress, and released herself from his hands.“Not that,” she said, with a smile in which still some sadness lingered.And--good-by, Horace, for the
time.”

He went with her to the door, lighting the hall gas that she might
see her way down the stairs.When she had disappeared, he walked for
a little up and down the room, whistling softly to himself.It was
undeniable that the world seemed vastly brighter to him than it had only
a half-hour before.Mere contact with somebody who liked him for himself
was a refreshing novelty.“A damned decent sort of girl--considering everything!” he mused aloud,
as he locked up his desk for the day.CHAPTER XXXII.--THE ALARM AT THE FARMHOUSE.To come upon the street again was like the confused awakening from a
dream.With the first few steps Jessica found herself shivering in an
extremity of cold, yet still uncomfortably warm.A sudden passing spasm
of giddiness, too, made her head swim so that for the instant she feared
to fall.Then, with an added sense of weakness, she went on, wearily and
desponding.The recollection of this novel and curious happiness upon which she
had stumbled only a few moments before took on now the character of
self-reproach.The burning headache had returned, and with it came a
pained consciousness that it had been little less than criminal in
her to weakly dally in Horace’s office when such urgent responsibility
rested upon her outside.If the burden of this responsibility appeared
too great for her to bear, now that her strength seemed to be so
strangely leaving her, there was all the more reason for her to set her
teeth together, and press forward, even if she staggered as she went.The search had been made cruelly
hopeless by that shameful delay; and she blamed herself with fierceness
for it, as she racked her brain for some new plan, wondering whether she
ought to have asked Horace or gone into some of the other offices.There were groups of men standing here and there on the comers--a little
away from the full light of the street-lamps, as if unwilling to court
observation.These knots of workmen had a sinister significance to her
feverish mind.She had the clew to the terrible mischief which some of
them intended--which no doubt even now they were canvassing in furtive
whispers--and only Tracy could stop it, and she was powerless to find
him!There came slouching along the sidewalk, as she grappled with this
anguish of irresolution, a slight and shabby figure which somehow
arrested her attention.It was a familiar enough figure--that of old
“Cal” Gedney; and there was nothing unusual or worthy of comment in
the fact that he was walking unsteadily by himself, with his gaze fixed
intently on the sidewalk.He had passed again out of the range of her
cursory glance before she suddenly remembered that he was a lawyer, and
even some kind of a judge.She turned swiftly and almost ran after him, clutching his sleeve as she
came up to him, and breathing so hard with weakness and excitement that
for the moment she could not speak.The ’squire looked up, and angrily shook his arm out of her grasp.“Leave me alone, you hussy,” he snarled, “or I’ll lock you up!”

His misconstruction of her purpose cleared her mind.“Don’t be foolish,”
 she said, hurriedly.“It’s a question of perhaps life and death!Do you
know where Reuben Tracy is?Or can you tell me where I can find out?”

“He don’t want to be bothered with _you_, wherever he is,” was the surly
response.“Be off with you!”

“I told you it was a matter of life and death,” she insisted, earnestly.“He’ll never forgive you--you’ll never forgive yourself--if you know and
won’t tell me.”

The sincerity of the girl’s tone impressed the old man.It was not easy
for him to stand erect and unaided without swaying, but his mind was
evidently clear enough.“What do you want with him?” he asked, in a less unfriendly voice.Then
he added, in a reflective undertone: “Cur’ous’t I sh’d want see Tracy,
too.”

“Then you do know where he is?”

“He’s drove out to ’s mother’s farm.Seems word come old woman’s sick.You’re one of that Lawton tribe, aren’t you?”

“If I get a cutter, will you drive out there with me?” She asked the
question with swift directness.She added in explanation, as he stared
vacantly at her: “I ask that because you said you wanted to see him,
that’s all.I shall go alone if you won’t come.He’s _got_ to be back
here this evening, or God only knows what’ll happen!I mean what I say!”

“Do you know the road?” the ’squire asked, catching something of her
own eager spirit.I was bom half a mile from where his mother lives.”

“But you won’t tell me what your business is?”

“I’ll tell you this much,” she whispered, hastily.“There is going to
be a mob at the Minster house to-night.A girl who knows one of the men
told--”

The old ’squire cut short the revelation by grasping her arm with
fierce energy.“Come on--come on!” he said, hoarsely.“Don’t waste a minute.We’ll gallop the horses both ways.” He muttered to himself with
excitement as he dragged her along.Jessica waited outside the livery stable for what seemed an interminable
period, while old “Cal” was getting the horses--walking up and down the
path in a state of mental torment which precluded all sense of bodily
suffering.When she conjured up before her frightened mind the
terrible consequences which delay might entail, every minute became an
intolerable hour of torture.There was even the evil chance that the old
man had been refused the horses because he had been drinking.Finally, however, there came the welcome sound of mailed hoofs on the
plank roadway inside, and the reverberating jingle of bells; and then
the ’squire, with a spacious double-seated sleigh containing plenty of
robes, drew up in front of a cutting in the snow.She took the front seat without hesitation, and gathered the lines into
her own hands.“Let me drive,” she said, clucking the horses into a
rapid trot.“I _should_ be home in bed.I’m too ill to sit up, unless
I’m doing something that keeps me from giving up.”

*****

Reuben Tracy felt the evening in the sitting-room of the old farmhouse
to be the most trying ordeal of his adult life.Ordinarily he rather enjoyed than otherwise the company of his brother
Ezra--a large, powerfully built, heavily bearded man, who sat now beside
him in a rocking-chair in front of the wood stove, his stockinged feet
on the hearth, and a last week’s agricultural paper on his knee.Ezra
was a worthy and hard-working citizen, with an original way of looking
at things, and considerable powers of expression.As a rule, the
lawyer liked to talk with him, and felt that he profited in ideas and
suggestions from the talk.But to-night he found his brother insufferably dull, and the task of
keeping down the “fidgets” one of incredible difficulty.His mother--on
whose account he had been summoned--was so much better that Ezra’s wife
had felt warranted in herself going off to bed, to get some much-needed
rest.Ezra had argued for a while, rather perversely, about the tariff
duty on wool, and now was nodding in his chair, although the dim-faced
old wooden clock showed it to be barely eight o’clock.The kerosene lamp
on the table gave forth only a feeble, reddened light through its smoky
chimney, but diffused a most powerful odor upon the stuffy air of the
over-heated room.A ragged and strong-smelling old farm dog groaned
offensively from time to time in his sleep behind the stove.Even the
draught which roared through the lower apertures in front of the stove
and up the pipe toward the chimney was irritating by the very futility
of its vehemence, for the place was too hot already.Reuben mused in silence upon the chances which had led him so far
away from this drowsy, unfruitful life, and smiled as he found himself
wondering if it would be in the least possible for him to return to it.The bright boys, the restless boys, the boys
of energy, of ambition, of yearning for culture or conquest or the mere
sensation of living where it was really life--all went away, leaving
none but the Ezras behind.Some succeeded; some failed; but none of them
ever came back.And the Ezras who remained on the farms--they seemed to
shut and bolt the doors of their minds against all idea of making their
own lot less sterile and barren and uninviting.The mere mental necessity for a great contrast brought up suddenly
in Reuben’s thoughts a picture of the drawing-room in the home of the
Minsters.It seemed as if the whole vast swing of the mind’s pendulum
separated that luxurious abode of cultured wealth from this dingy and
barren farmhouse room.And he, who had been born and reared in this
latter, now found himself at a loss how to spend so much as a single
evening in its environment, so completely had familiarity with the other
remoulded and changed his habits, his point of view, his very character.Curious slaves of habit--creatures of their surroundings--men were!A loud, peremptory knocking at the door aroused Reuben abruptly from his
revery, and Ezra, too, opened his eyes with a start, and sitting upright
rubbed them confusedly.“Now I think of it, I heard a sleigh stop,” said Reuben, rising.“It
can’t be the doctor this time of night, can it?”

“It ’ud be jest like him,” commented Ezra, captiously.“He’s a great
hand to keep dropping in, sort of casual-like, when there’s sickness in
the house.It all goes down in his bill.”

The farmer brother had also risen, and now, lamp in hand, walked
heavily in his stocking feet to the door, and opened it half way.Some
indistinct words passed, and then, shading the flickering flame with his
huge hairy hand, Ezra turned his head.“Somebody to see you, Rube,” he said.On second thought he added to the
visitor in a tone of formal politeness: “Won’t you step in, ma’am?”

Jessica Lawton almost pushed her host aside in her impulsive response to
his invitation.But when she had crossed the threshold the sudden change
into a heated atmosphere seemed to go to her brain like chloroform.She
stood silent, staring at Reuben, with parted lips and hands nervously
twitching.Even as he, in his complete surprise, recognized his visitor,
she trembled violently from head to foot, made a forward step, tottered,
and fell inertly into Ezra’s big, protecting arm.“I guessed she was going to do it,” said the farmer, not dissembling his
pride at the alert way in which the strange woman had been caught, and
holding up the lamp with his other hand in triumph.“Hannah keeled over
in that same identical way when Suky run her finger through the cogs of
the wringing-machine, and I ketched her, too!”

Reuben had hurriedly come to his brother’s assistance.The two men
placed the fainting girl in the rocking-chair, and the lawyer began
with anxious fumbling to loosen the neck of her cloak and draw off her
gloves.Her fingers were like ice, and her brow, though it felt now
almost equally cold, was covered with perspiration.Reuben rubbed her
hands between his broad palms in a crudely informed belief that it was
the right thing to do, while Ezra rummaged in the adjoining pantry for
the household bottle of brandy.Jessica came out of her swoon with the first touch of the pungent spirit
upon her whitened lips.She looked with weak blankness at the unfamiliar
scene about her, until her gaze fell upon the face of the lawyer.Then
she smiled faintly and closed her eyes again.“She is an old friend of mine,” whispered Reuben to his brother, as he
pressed the brandy once more upon her.“She’ll come to in a minute.It
must be something serious that brought her out here.”

The girl languidly opened her eyes.“‘Cal’ Ged-ney’s asleep in the
sleigh,” she murmured.“You’d better bring him in.He’ll tell you.”

It was with an obvious effort that she said this much; and now, while
Ezra hastily pulled on his boots, her eyes closed again, and her
head sank with utter weariness sideways upon the high back of the
old-fashioned chair.Reuben stood looking at her in pained anxiety--once or twice holding
the lamp close to her pale face, in dread of he knew not what--until
his brother returned.Ezra had brought the horses up into the yard, and
remained outside now to blanket them, while the old ’squire, benumbed
and drowsy, found his way into the house.It was evident enough to the
young lawyer’s first glance that Gedney had been drinking heavily.“Well, what does this all mean?” he demanded, with vexed asperity.“You’ve got to get on your things and race back with us, helly-to-hoot!”
 said the ’squire.“Quick--there ain’t a minute to lose!” The old man
almost gasped in his eagerness.“In Heaven’s name, what’s up?Have you been to Cadmus?”

“Yes, and got my pocket full of affidavits.We can send all three of
them to prison fast enough.But that’ll do to-morrow; for to-night
there’s a mob up at the Minster place._Look there!_”

The old man had gone to the window and swept the stiff curtain aside.He
held it now with a trembling hand, so that Reuben could look out.The whole southern sky overhanging Thessaly was crimson with the
reflection of a fire.it’s the rolling mill,” ejaculated Reuben, breathlessly.“Quite as likely it’s the Minster house; it’s the same direction, only
farther off, and fires are deceptive,” said Gedney, his excitement
rising under the stimulus of the spectacle.Reuben had kicked off his slippers, and was now dragging on his shoes.“Tell me about it,” he said, working furiously at the laces.’Squire Gedney helped himself generously to the brandy on the table as
he unfolded, in somewhat incoherent fashion, his narrative.The Lawton
girl had somehow found out that a hostile demonstration against the
Minsters was intended for the evening, and had started out to find
Tracy.By accident she had met him (Gedney), and they had come off in
the sleigh together.She had insisted upon driving, and as his long
journey from Cadmus had greatly fatigued him, he had got over into the
back seat and gone to sleep under the buffalo robes.He knew nothing
more until Ezra had roused him from his slumber in the sled, now at a
standstill on the road outside, and he had awakened to discover Jessica
gone, the horses wet and shivering in a cloud of steam, and the sky
behind them all ablaze.Looks as if the whole town was burning,” said Ezra,
coming in as this recital was concluded.“Them horses would a-got their
death out there in another ten minutes.Guess I’d better put ’em in
the barn, eh?”

“No, no!I’ve got to drive them back faster than
they came,” said Reuben, who had on his overcoat and hat.“Hurry, and
get me some thick gloves to drive in.We
won’t wake mother up.I’ll get you to run in to-morrow, if you will, and
let me know how she is.Tell her I _had_ to go.”

When Ezra had found the gloves and brought them, the two men for the
first time bent an instinctive joint glance at the recumbent figure of
the girl in the rocking-chair.“I’ll get Hannah up,” said the farmer, “and she can have your room.I
guess she’s too sick to try to go back with you.If she’s well enough,
I’ll bring her in in the morning.I was going to take in some apples,
anyway.”

To their surprise Jessica opened her eyes and even lifted her head at
these words.“No,” she said; “I feel better now--much better.I really must.” She rose to her feet as she spoke, and, though
she was conscious of great dizziness and languor, succeeded by her smile
in imposing upon her unskilled companions.Perhaps if Hannah had been
“got up” she would have seen through the weak pretence of strength, and
insisted on having matters ordered otherwise.But the men offered no
dissent.Jessica was persuaded to drink another glass of brandy, and
’Squire Gedney took one without being specially urged; and then Reuben
impatiently led the way out to the sleigh, which Ezra had turned around.“No; I’d rather be in front with you,” the girl said, when Reuben had
spread the robes for her to sit in the back seat.“Let the Judge sit
there; he wants to sleep.I’m not tired now, and I want to keep awake.”

Thus it was arranged, and Reuben, with a strong hand on the tight reins,
started the horses on their homeward rush toward the flaming horizon.CHAPTER XXXIII.--PACING TOWARD THE REDDENED SKY.For some time there was no conversation in the sleigh.The horses sped
evenly forward, with their heads well in the air, as if they too were
excited by the unnatural glare in the sky ahead.Before long there was
added to the hurried regular beating of their hoofs upon the hard-packed
track another sound--the snoring of the ’squire on the seat behind.There was a sense of melting in the air.Save where the intense glow
of the conflagration lit up the sky with a fan-like spread of ruddy
luminance--fierce orange at the central base, and then through an
expanse of vermilion, rose, and cherry to deepening crimsons and dull
reddish purples--the heavens hung black with snow-laden clouds.A
pleasant, moist night-breeze came softly across the valley, bearing ever
and again a solitary flake of snow.The effect of this mild wind was so
grateful to Jessica’s face, now once more burning with an inner heat,
that she gave no thought to a curious difficulty in breathing which was
growing upon her.“The scoundrels shall pay dear for this,” Reuben said to her, between
set teeth, when there came a place in the road where the horses must be
allowed to walk up hill.“I’m sure I hope so,” she said, quite in his spirit.The husky note in her voice caught his attention.“Are you sure you
are bundled up warm enough?” he asked with solicitude, pulling the robe
higher about her.I caught a heavy cold yesterday,” she
answered.“But it will be nothing, if only we can get there in time.”

It struck her as strange when Reuben presently replied, putting the whip
once more to the horses: “God only knows what can be done when I do
get there!” It had seemed to her a matter of course that Tracy would be
equal to any emergency--even an armed riot.There was something almost
disheartening in this confession of self-doubt.“But at any rate they shall pay for it to-morrow,” he broke out,
angrily, a moment later.“Down to the last pennyweight we will have our
pound of flesh!My girl,” he added, turning to look into her face, and
speaking with deep earnestness, “I never knew what it was before to feel
wholly merciless--absolutely without bowels of compassion.But I will
not abate so much as the fraction of a hair with these villains.I swear
that!”

By an odd contradiction, his words raised a vague spirit of compunction
within her.“They feel very bitterly,” she ventured to suggest.“It is
terrible to be turned out of work in the winter, and with families
dependent on that work for bare existence.And then the bringing in of
these strange workmen.I suppose that is what--”

Reuben interrupted her with an abrupt laugh.“I’m not thinking of them,”
 he said.“Poor foolish fellows, I don’t wish them any harm.I only
pray God they haven’t done too much harm to themselves.No: it’s the
swindling scoundrels who are responsible for the mischief--_they_ are
the ones I’ll put the clamps onto to-morrow.”

The words conveyed no meaning to her, and she kept silent until he spoke
further: “I don’t know whether he told you, but Gedney has brought me
to-night the last links needed for a chain of proof which must send all
three of these ruffians to State prison.I haven’t had time to
examine the papers yet, but he says he’s got them in his pocket
there--affidavits from the original inventor of certain machinery, about
its original sale, and from others who were a party to it--which makes
the whole fraud absolutely clear.I’ll go over them to-night, when we’ve
seen this thing through”--pointing vaguely with his whip toward the
reddened sky--“and if tomorrow I don’t lay all three of them by the
heels, you can have my head for a foot-ball!”

“I don’t understand these things very well,” said Jessica.“Who is it
you mean?” It was growing still harder for her to breathe, and sharp
pain came in her breast now with almost every respiration.Her head
ached, too, so violently that she cared very little indeed who it was
that should go to prison tomorrow.“There are three of them in the scheme,” said the lawyer; “as
cold-blooded and deliberate a piece of robbery as ever was planned.First, there’s a New York man named Wendover--they call him a Judge--a
smart, subtle, slippery scoundrel if ever there was one.Then there’s
Schuyler Tenney--perhaps you know who he is--he’s a big hardware
merchant here; and with him in the swindle was--Good heavens!Why, I
never thought of it before!”

Reuben had stopped short in his surprise.He began whipping the horses
now with a seeming air of exultation, and stole a momentary smile-lit
glance toward his companion.“It’s just occurred to me,” he said.“Curious--I hadn’t given it a
thought.Why, my girl, it’s like a special providence.You, too, will
have your full revenge--such revenge as you never dreamt of.The third
man is Horace Boyce!”

A great wave of cold stupor engulfed the girl’s reason as she took in
these words, and her head swam and roared as if in truth she had been
plunged headlong into unknown depths of icy water.When she came to the surface of consciousness again, the horses were
still rhythmically racing along the hill-side road overlooking the
village.The firelight in the sky had faded down now to a dull pinkish
effect like the northern lights.Reuben was chewing an unlighted cigar,
and the ’squire was steadily snoring behind them.“You will send them all to prison--surely?” she was able to ask.“As surely as God made little apples!” was the sententious response.The girl was cowering under the buffalo-robe in an anguish of mind so
terribly intense that her physical pains were all forgotten.Only her
throbbing head seemed full of thick blood, and there was such an
awful need that she should think clearly!She bit her lips in tortured
silence, striving through a myriad of wandering, crowding ideas to lay
hold upon something which should be of help.They had begun to descend the hill--a steep, uneven road full of drifts,
beyond which stretched a level mile of highway leading into the village
itself--when suddenly a bold thought came to her, which on the instant
had shot up, powerful and commanding, into a very tower of resolution.She laid her hand on Reuben’s arm.“If you don’t mind, I’ll change into the back seat,” she said, in a
voice which all her efforts could not keep from shaking.“I’m feeling
very ill.It’ll be easier for me there.”

Reuben at once drew up the horses, and the girl, summoning all her
strength, managed without his help to get around the side of the sleigh,
and under the robe, into the rear seat.The ’squire was sunk in such a
profound sleep that she had to push him bodily over into his own half of
the space, and the discovery that this did not waken him filled her
with so great a delight that all her strength and self-control seemed
miraculously to have returned to her.She had need of them both for the task which she had imposed upon
herself, and which now, with infinite caution and trepidation, she set
herself about.This was nothing less than to secure the papers which
the old ’squire had brought from Cadmus, and which, from something she
remembered his having said, must be in the inner pocket of one of his
coats.Slowly and deftly she opened button after button of his overcoat,
and gently pushed aside the cloth until her hand might have free
passage to and from the pocket, where, after careful soundings, she had
discovered a bundle of thick papers to be resting.Then whole minutes
seemed to pass before, having taken off her glove, she was able to draw
this packet out.Once during this operation Reuben half turned to speak
to her, and her fright was very great.But she had had the presence of
mind to draw the robe high about her, and answer collectedly, and he had
palpably suspected nothing.As for Gedney, he never once stirred in his
drunken sleep.The larceny was complete, and Jessica had been able to wrap the old man
up again, to button the parcel of papers under her own cloak, and to
draw on and fasten her glove once more, before the panting horses had
gained the outskirts of the village.She herself was breathing almost
as heavily as the animals after their gallop, and, now that the deed was
done, lay back wearily in her seat, with pain racking her every joint
and muscle, and a sickening dread in her mind lest there should be
neither strength nor courage forthcoming for what remained to do.For a considerable distance down the street no person was visible from
whom the eager Tracy could get news of what had happened.At last,
however, when the sleigh was within a couple of blocks of what seemed
in the distance to be a centre of interest, a man came along who shouted
from the sidewalk, in response to Reuben’s questions, sundry leading
facts of importance.A fire had started--probably incendiary--in the basement of the office
of the Minster furnaces, some hour or so ago, and had pretty well gutted
the building.The firemen were still playing on the ruins.An immense
crowd had witnessed the fire, and it was the drunkenest crowd he had
ever seen in Thessaly.Where the money came from to buy so much drink,
was what puzzled him.The crowd had pretty well cleared off now; some
said they had gone up to the Minster house to give its occupants a
“horning.” He himself had got his feet wet, and was afraid of the
rheumatics if he stayed out any longer.Probably he would get them, as
it was.Everybody said that the building was insured, and some folks
hinted that the company had it set on fire themselves.Reuben impatiently whipped up the jaded team at this, with a curt “Much
obliged,” and drove at a spanking pace down the street to the scene of
the conflagration.The outer walls
of the office building were still gloomily erect, but within nothing
was left but a glowing mass of embers about level with the ground.Some firemen were inside the yard, but more were congregated about the
water-soaked space where the engine still noisily throbbed, and where
hot coffee was being passed around to them.Here, too, there was a
report that the crowd had gone up to the Minster house.The horses tugged vehemently to drag the sleigh over the impedimenta of
hose stretched along the street, and over the considerable area of bare
stones where the snow had been melted by the heat or washed away by the
streams from the hydrants.Then Reuben half rose in his seat to lash
them into a last furious gallop, and, snorting with rebellion, they tore
onward toward the seminary road.At the corner, three doors from the home of the Minster ladies, Reuben
deemed it prudent to draw up.There was evidently a considerable throng
in the road in front of the house, and that still others were on the
lawn within the gates was obvious from the confused murmur which came
therefrom.Some boys were blowing spasmodically on fish-horns, and
rough jeers and loud boisterous talk rose and fell throughout the dimly
visible assemblage.The air had become thick with large wet snowflakes.Reuben sprang from the sleigh, and, stepping backward, vigorously shook
old Gedney into a state of semi-wakefulness.“Hold these lines,” he said, “and wait here for me.--Or,” he turned to
Jessica with the sudden thought, “would you rather he drove you home?”

The girl had been in a half-insensible condition of mind and body.At
the question she roused herself and shook her head.“No: let me stay
here,” she said, wearily.But when Reuben, squaring his broad shoulders and shaking himself to
free his muscles after the long ride, had disappeared with an energetic
stride in the direction of the crowd, Jessica forced herself to sit
upright, and then to rise to her feet.“You’d better put the blankets on the horses, if he doesn’t come back
right off,” she said to the ’squire.“Where are you going?” Gedney asked, still stupid with sleep.“I’ll walk up and down,” she answered, clambering with difficulty out of
the sleigh.“I’m tired of sitting still.”

Once on the sidewalk, she grew suddenly faint, and grasped a
fence-picket for support.The hand which she instinctively raised to her
heart touched the hard surface of the packet of papers, and the thought
which this inspired put new courage into her veins.With bowed head and a hurried, faltering step, she turned her back upon
the Minster house and stole off into the snowy darkness.CHAPTER XXXIV.--THE CONQUEST OF THE MOB.Even before he reached the gates of the carriage-drive opening upon
the Minster lawn, Reuben Tracy encountered some men whom he knew, and
gathered that the people in the street outside were in the main peaceful
on-lookers, who did not understand very clearly what was going on, and
disapproved of the proceedings as far as they comprehended them.There
was a crowd inside the grounds, he was told, made up in part of men who
were out of work, but composed still more largely, it seemed, of boys
and young hoodlums generally, who were improving the pretext to indulge
in horseplay.There was a report that some sort of deputation had gone
up on the doorstep and rung the bell, with a view to making some remarks
to the occupants of the house; but that they had failed to get any
answer, and certainly the whole front of the residence was black as
night.Reuben easily obtained the consent of several of these citizens to
follow him, and, as they went on, the number swelled to ten or a dozen.Doubtless many more could have been incorporated in the impromptu
procession had it not been so hopelessly dark.The lawyer led his friends through the gate, and began pushing his
way up the gravelled path through the crowd.No special opposition was
offered to his progress, for the air was so full of snow now that only
those immediately affected knew anything about it.Although the path
was fairly thronged, nobody seemed to have any idea why he was standing
there.Those who spoke appeared in the main to regard the matter as a
joke, the point of which was growing more and more obscure.Except for
some sporadic horn-blowing and hooting nearer to the house, the activity
of the assemblage was confined to a handful of boys, who mustered
among them two or three kerosene oil torches treasured from the last
Presidential campaign, and a grotesque jack-o’-lantem made of a pumpkin
and elevated on a broom-stick.These urchins were running about among
the little groups of bystanders, knocking off one another’s caps,
shouting prodigiously, and having a good time.As Reuben and those accompanying him approached the house, some of
these lads raised the cry of “Here’s the coppers!” and the crowd at
this seemed to close up with a simultaneous movement, while a murmur ran
across its surface like the wind over a field of corn.This sound was
one less of menace or even excitement than of gratification that at last
something was going to happen.One of the boys with a torch, in the true spirit of his generation,
placed himself in front of Reuben and marched with mock gravity at the
head of the advancing group.This, drolly enough, lent the movement a
semblance of authority, or at least of significance, before which the
men more readily than ever gave way.At this the other boys with
the torches and jack-o’-lantem fell into line at the rear of Tracy’s
immediate supporters, and they in turn were followed by the throng
generally.Thus whimsically escorted, Reuben reached the front steps of
the mansion.A more compact and apparently homogeneous cluster of men stood here,
some of them even on the steps, and dark and indistinct as everything
was, Reuben leaped to the conclusion that these were the men at least
visibly responsible for this strange gathering.Presumably they were
taken by surprise at his appearance with such a following.At any
rate, they, too, offered no concerted resistance, and he mounted to the
platform of the steps without difficulty.Then he turned and whispered
to a friend to have the boys with the torches also come up.This was
a suggestion gladly obeyed, not least of all by the boy with the
low-comedy pumpkin, whose illumination created a good-natured laugh.Tracy stood now, bareheaded in the falling snow, facing the throng.The
gathering of the lights about him indicated to everybody in the grounds
that the aimless demonstration had finally assumed some kind of form.Then there were
admonitory shouts here and there, under the influence of which the
horn-blowing gradually ceased, and Tracy’s name was passed from mouth to
mouth until its mention took on almost the character of a personal cheer
on the outskirts of the crowd.In answer to this two or three hostile
interrogations or comments were bawled out, but the throng did not favor
these, and so there fell a silence which invited Reuben to speak.“My friends,” he began, and then stopped because he had not pitched his
voice high enough, and a whole semicircle of cries of “louder!” rose
from the darkness of the central lawn.“He’s afraid of waking the fine ladies,” called out an anonymous voice.“Shut up, Tracy, and let the pumpkin talk,” was another shout.“Begorrah, it’s the pumpkin that _is_ talkin’ now!” cried a shrill third
voice, and at this there was a ripple of laughter.“My friends,” began Reuben, in a louder tone, this time without
immediate interruption, “although I don’t know precisely why you have
gathered here at so much discomfort to yourselves, I have some things to
say to you which I think you will regard as important.I have not seen
the persons who live in this house since Tuesday, but while I can easily
understand that your coming here to-night might otherwise cause them
some anxiety, I am sure that they, when they come to understand it,
will be as glad as I am that you _are_ here, and that I am given this
opportunity of speaking for them to you.If you had not taken this
notion of coming here tonight, I should have, in a day or two, asked you
to meet me somewhere else, in a more convenient place, to talk matters
over.“First of all let me tell you that the works are going to be opened
promptly, certainly the furnaces, and unless I am very much mistaken
about the law, the rolling mills too.I give you my word for that, as
the legal representative of two of these women.”

“Yes; they’ll be opened with the Frenchmen!” came a swift answering
shout.“Or will you get Chinamen?” cried another, amid derisive laughter.Reuben responded in his clearest tones: “No man who belongs to Thessaly
shall be crowded out by a newcomer.I give you my word for that, too.”

Some scattered cheers broke out at this announcement, which promised
for the instant to become general, and then were hushed down by the
prevalent anxiety to hear more.In this momentary interval Reuben caught
the sound of a window being cautiously raised immediately above the
front door, and guessed with a little flutter of the heart who this new
auditor might be.“Secondly,” he went on, “you ought to be told the truth about the
shutting down of the furnaces and the lockout.These women were not at
all responsible for either action.I know of my own knowledge that both
things caused them genuine grief, and that they were shocked beyond
measure at the proposal to bring outside workmen into the town to
undersell and drive away their own neighbors and fellow-townsmen.I
want you to realize this, because otherwise you would do a wrong in your
minds to these good women who belong to Thessaly, who are as fond of our
village and its people as any other soul within its borders, and who,
for their own sake as well as that of Stephen Minster’s memory, deserve
respect and liking at your hands.“I may tell you frankly that they were misled and deceived by agents, in
whom, mistakenly enough, they trusted, into temporarily giving power
to these unworthy men.The result was a series of steps which they
deplored, but did not know how to stop.A few days ago I was called
into the case to see what could be done toward undoing the mischief from
which they, and you, and the townspeople generally, suffer.Since then I
have been hard at work both in court and out of it, and I believe I can
say with authority that the attempt to plunder the Minster estate and to
impoverish you will be beaten all along the line.”

This time the outburst of cheering was spontaneous and prolonged.When
it died away, some voice called out, “Three cheers for the ladies!” and
these were given, too, not without laughter at the jack-o’-lantem boy,
who waved his pumpkin vigorously.“One word more,” called out Tracy, “and I hope you will take in good
part what I am going to say.When I made my way up through the grounds,
I was struck by the fact that nobody seemed to know just why he had come
here.I gather now that word was passed around during the day that there
would be a crowd here, and that something, nobody understood just what,
would be done after they got here.I do not know who started the idea,
or who circulated the word.It might be worth your while to find out.Meanwhile, don’t you agree with me that it is an unsatisfactory and
uncivil way of going at the thing?This is a free country, but just
because it _is_ free, we ought to feel the more bound to respect one
another’s rights.There are countries in which, I dare say, if I were a
citizen, or rather a subject, I might feel it my duty to head a mob or
join a riot.But here there ought to be no mob; there should be no room
for even thought of a riot.Our very strength lies in the idea that we
are our own policemen--our own soldiery.I say this not because one in
a hundred of you meant any special harm in coming here, but because the
notion of coming itself was not American.Beware of men who suggest that
kind of thing.Beware of men who preach the theory that because you are
puddlers or moulders or firemen, therefore you are different from the
rest of your fellow-citizens.I, for one, resent the idea that because I
am a lawyer, and you, for example, are a blacksmith, therefore we belong
to different classes.I wish with all my heart that everybody resented
it, and that that abominable word ‘classes’ could be wiped out of the
English language as it is spoken in America.I am glad if
you feel easier in your minds than you did when you came.If you do,
I guess there’s been no harm done by your coming which isn’t more than
balanced by the good that has come out of it.Only next time, if you
don’t mind, we’ll have our meeting somewhere else, where it will be
easier to speak than it is in a snowstorm, and where we won’t keep our
neighbors awake.And now good-night, everybody.”

Out of the satisfied and amiable murmur which spread through the crowd
at this, there rose a sharp, querulous voice:

“Give us the names of the men who, you say, _were_ responsible.”

“No, I can’t do that to-night.But if you read the next list of
indictments found by the grand jury of Dearborn County, my word as a
lawyer you’ll find them all there.”

The loudest cheer of the evening burst upon the air at this, and there
was a sustained roar when Tracy’s name was shouted out above the tumult.Some few men crowded up to the steps to shake hands with him, and many
others called out to him a personal “good-night.” The last of those to
shake the accumulated snow from their collars and hats, and turn their
steps homeward, noted that the whole front of the Minster house had
suddenly become illuminated.Thus Reuben’s simple and highly fortuitous conquest of what had been
planned to be a mob was accomplished.It is remembered to this day as
the best thing any man ever did single-handed in Thessaly, and it is
always spoken of as the foundation of his present political eminence.But he himself would say now, upon reflection, that he succeeded
because the better sense of his auditors, from the outset, wanted him
to succeed, and because he was lucky enough to impress a very decent and
bright-witted lot of men with the idea that he wasn’t a humbug.*****

At the moment he was in no mood to analyze his success.His hair was
streaming with melted snow, his throat was painfully hoarse and sore,
and the fatigue from speaking so loud, and the reaction from his great
excitement, combined to make him feel a very weak brother indeed.So utterly wearied was he that when the door of the now lighted hallway
opened behind him, and Miss Kate herself, standing in front of the
servant on the threshold, said: “We want you to come in, Mr.Tracy,” he
turned mechanically and went in, thinking more of a drink of some sort
and a chance to sit down beside her, than of all the possible results of
his speech to the crowd.The effect of warmth and welcome inside the mansion was grateful to
all his senses.He parted with his hat and overcoat, took the glass of
claret which was offered him, and allowed himself to be led into the
drawing-room and given a seat, all in a happy daze, which was, in truth,
so very happy, that he was dimly conscious of the beginnings of tears
in his eyes.It seemed now that the strain upon his mind and heart--the
anger, and fright, and terrible anxiety--had lasted for whole weary
years.Trial by soul-torture was new to him, and this ordeal through
which he had passed left him curiously flabby and tremulous.He lay back in the easy-chair in an ecstasy of physical lassitude and
mental content, surrendering himself to the delight of watching the
beautiful girl before him, and of listening to the music of her voice.The liquid depths of brown eyes into which he looked, and the soft tones
which wooed his hearing, produced upon him vaguely the sensation of
shining white robes and celestial harps--an indefinitely glorious
recompense for the travail that lay behind in the valley of the shadow
of death.Nothing was further from him than the temptation to break this bright
spell by speech.“We heard almost every word of what you said,” Kate was saying.“When
you began we were in this room, crouched there by the window--that is,
Ethel and I were, for mamma refused to even pretend to listen--and at
first we thought it was one of the mob, and then Ethel recognized your
voice.That almost annoyed me, for it seemed as if _I_ should have
been---at least, equally quick to know it--that is, I mean, I’ve heard
you speak so much more than she has.And then we both hurried up-stairs,
and lifted the window--and oh!“And from the moment we knew it was you--that you were here--we felt
perfectly safe.It doesn’t seem now that we were very much afraid, even
before that, although probably we were.There was a lot of hooting, and
that dreadful blowing on horns, and all that, and once somebody rang the
door-bell; but, beyond throwing snowballs, nothing else was done.So
I daresay they only wanted to scare us.Of course it was the fire that
made us really nervous.We got that brave girl’s warning about the mob’s
coming here just a little while before the sky began to redden with the
blaze; and that sight, coming on the heels of her letter--”

“What girl?“Here it is,” answered Kate, drawing a crumpled sheet of paper from her
bosom, and reading aloud:

“Dear Miss Minster:

“I have just heard that a crowd of men are coming to your house to-night
to do violent things.I am starting out to try and bring you help.Meanwhile, I send you my father, who will do whatever you tell him to
do.“Gratefully yours,

“Jessica Lawton.”

Reuben had risen abruptly to his feet before the signature was reached.“I am ashamed of myself,” he said; “I’ve left her out there all this
while.There was so much else that really she
escaped my memory altogether.”

He had made his way out into the hall and taken up his hat and coat.“You will come back, won’t you?” Kate asked.“There are so many things
to talk over, with all of us.And--and bring her too, if--if she will
come.”

With a sign of acquiescence and comprehension.Reuben darted down the
steps and into the darkness.In a very few minutes he returned,
disappointment written all over his face.Gedney, the man I left with the sleigh, says she went off
as soon as I had got out of sight.I had offered to have him drive her
home, but she refused.She’s a curiously independent girl.”

“I am very sorry,” said Kate.“But I will go over the first thing in the
morning and thank her.”

“You don’t as yet know the half of what you have to thank her for,”
 put in the lawyer.“I don’t mean that it was so great a thing--my
coming--but she drove all the way out to my mother’s farm to bring me
here to-night, and fainted when she got there.If
her father is still here, I think he’d better go at once to her place,
and see about her.”

The suggestion seemed a good one, and was instantly acted upon.Ben
Lawton had been in the kitchen, immensely proud of his position as
the responsible garrison of a beleaguered house, and came out into the
hallway now with a full stomach and a satisfied expression on his lank
face.He assented with readiness to Reuben’s idea, when it was explained to
him.“So she druv out to your mother’s place for you, did she?” he commented,
admiringly.“That girl’s a genuwine chip of the old block.I mean,” he
added, with an apologetic smile, “of the old, old block.I ain’t got so
much git-up-and-git about me, that I know of, but her grandfather was a
regular snorter!”

“We shall not forget how much we are obliged to you, Mr.Lawton,” said
Kate, pleasantly, offering him her hand.“Be sure that you tell your
daughter, too, how grateful we all are.”

Ben took the delicate hand thus amazingly extended to him, and shook it
with formal awkwardness.“I didn’t seem to do much,” he said, deprecatingly, “and perhaps I
wouldn’t have amounted to much, neether, if it had a-come to fightin’
and gougin’ and wras’lin’ round generally.But you can bet your boots,
ma’am, that I’d a-done what I could!”

With this chivalrous assurance Ben withdrew, and marched down the steps
with a carriage more nearly erect than Thessaly had ever seen him assume
before.The heavy front door swung to, and Reuben realized, with a new rush of
charmed emotion, that heaven had opened for him once more.A servant came and whispered something to Miss Kate.The latter nodded,
and then turned to Reuben with a smile full of light and softness.“If you will give me your arm,” she said, in a delicious murmur, “we
will go into the dining-room.My mother and sister are waiting for us
there.We are not supper-people as a rule, but it seemed right to have
one to-night.”




CHAPTER XXXV.--THE SHINING REWARD.The scene which opened upon Reuben’s eyes was like a vista of
fairyland.The dark panelled room, with its dim suggestions of gold
frames and heavy curtains, and its background of palms and oleanders,
contributed with the reticence of richness to the glowing splendor of
the table in its centre.Here all light was concentrated--light which
fell from beneath ruby shades at the summits of tall candles, and
softened the dazzling whiteness of the linen, mellowed the burnished
gleam of the silver plate, reflected itself in tender, prismatic hues
from the facets of the cut-glass decanters.There were flowers here
which gave forth still the blended fragrance of their hot-house home,
and fragile, painted china, and all the nameless things of luxury which
can make the breaking of bread a poem.Reuben had seen something dimly resembling this in New York once or
twice at semi-public dinners.The thought that this higher marvel was
in his honor intoxicated his reason.The other thought--that conceivably
his future might lie all in this flower-strewn, daintily lighted
path--was too heady, too full of threatened delirium, to be even
entertained.With an anxious hold upon himself, he felt his way forward
to self-possession.It came sooner than he had imagined it would, and
thereafter everything belonged to a dream of delight.The ladies were all dressed more elaborately than he had observed them
to be on any previous occasion, and, at the outset, there was something
disconcerting in this.Speedily enough, though, there came the
reflection that his clothes were those in which he had raced
breathlessly from the farm, in which he had faced and won the crowd
outside, and then, all at once, he was at perfect ease.He told them--addressing his talk chiefly to Mrs.Minster, who sat at
the head of the table, to his left--the story of Jessica’s ride, of her
fainting on her arrival, and of the furious homeward drive.From this
he drifted to the final proofs which had been procured at Cadmus--he
had sent Gedney home with the horses, and was to see him early in the
morning--and then to the steps toward a criminal prosecution which he
would summarily take.“So far as I can see, Mrs.Minster,” he concluded, when the servant
had again left the room, “no real loss will result from this whole
imbroglio.It may even show a net gain, when everything is cleared
up; for your big loan must really give you control of the Thessaly
Manufacturing Company, in law.These fellows staked their majority
interest in that concern to win your whole property in the game.They have lost, and the proceeds must go to you.Of course, it is not
entirely clear how the matter will shape itself; but my notion is that
you will come out winner.”

Mrs.“My daughters thought that I knew
nothing about business!” she said, with an air of easy triumph.The daughters displayed great eagerness to leave this branch of the
matter undiscussed.“And will it really be necessary to prosecute these men?” asked Ethel,
from Reuben’s right.The lawyer realized, even before he spoke, that not a little of his
bitterness had evaporated.“Men ought to be punished for such a crime as
they committed,” he said.“If only as a duty to the public, they should
be prosecuted.”

He was looking at Kate as he spoke, and in her glance, as their eyes
met, he read something which prompted him hastily to add:

“Of course, I am in your hands in the matter.I have committed myself
with the crowd outside to the statement that they should be punished.I
was full, then, of angry feelings; and I still think that they ought to
be punished.But it is really your question, not mine.And I may even
tell you that there would probably be a considerable financial advantage
in settling the thing with them, instead of taking it before the grand
jury.”

“That is a consideration which we won’t discuss,” said Kate.“If my mind
were clear as to the necessity of a prosecution, I would not alter the
decision for any amount of money.But my sister and I have been talking
a great deal about this matter, and we feel--You know that Mr.Boyce
was, for a time, on quite a friendly footing in this house.”

“Yes; I know.” Reuben bowed his head gravely.“Well, you yourself said that if one was prosecuted, they all must be.”

“No doubt.Wendover and Tenney were smart enough to put the credulous
youngster in the very forefront of everything.Until these affidavits
came to hand to-day, it would have been far easier to convict him than
them.”

“Precisely,” urged Kate.“Credulous is just the word.He was weak,
foolish, vain--whatever you like.But I
don’t believe that at the outset, or, indeed, till very recently, he had
any idea of being a party to a plan to plunder us.There are reasons,”
 the girl blushed a little, and hesitated, “to be frank, there are
reasons for my thinking so.”

Reuben, noting the faint flush of embarrassment, catching the doubtful
inflection of the words, felt that he comprehended everything, and
mirrored that feeling in his glance.“I quite follow you,” he said.“It is my notion that he was deceived, at
the beginning.”

“Others deceived him, and still more he deceived himself,” responded
Kate.“And that is why,” put in Ethel, “we feel like asking you not to take
the matter into the courts--I mean so as to put him in prison.It would
be too dreadful to think of--to take a man who had dined at your house,
and been boating with you, and had driven with you all over the Orange
Mountains, picking wild-flowers for you and all that, and put him into
prison, where he would have his hair shaved off, and tramp up and down
on a treadmill.No; we mustn’t do that, Mr.Tracy.”

Kate added musingly: “He has lost so much, we can afford to be generous,
can we not?”

Then Reuben felt that there could be no answer possible except “yes.”
 His heart pleaded with his brain for a lover’s interpretation of this
speech; and his tongue, to evade the issue, framed some halting words
about allowing him to go over the whole case to-morrow, and postponing a
final decision until that had been done.The consent of silence was accorded to this, and everybody at the
table knew that there would be no prosecutions.Upon the instant the
atmosphere grew lighter.“And now for the real thing,” said Kate, gayly.“I am commissioned on
behalf of the entire family to formally thank you for coming to our
rescue tonight.Mamma did not hear your speech--she resolutely sat in
the library, pretending to read, during the whole rumpus, and we were
in such a hurry to get up-stairs that we didn’t tell her when you
began--but she couldn’t help hearing the horns, and she is as much
obliged to you as we are; and that is very, very, very much indeed!”

“Yes, indeed,” assented Mrs.“I don’t know where the police
were, at all.”

“The police could have done next to nothing, if they had been
here,” said Reuben.“The visit of the crowd was annoying enough, and
discreditable in its way, but I don’t really imagine there was ever any
actual danger.The men felt disagreeable about the closing of the works
and the importation of the French Canadians, and I don’t blame them;
but as a body they never had any idea of molesting you.My own notion is
that the mob was organized by outsiders--by men who had an end to serve
in frightening you--and that after the crowd got here it didn’t know
what to do with itself.The truth is, that the mob isn’t an American
institution.Its component parts are too civilized, too open to appeals
to reason.As soon as I told these people the facts in the case, they
were quite ready to go, and they even cheered for you before they went.”

“Ethel tells me that you promised them the furnaces should be opened
promptly,” said the mother, with her calm, inquiring glance, which might
mean sarcasm, anger, approval, or nothing at all.Reuben answered resolutely: “Yes, Mrs.And so they must
be opened, on Monday.It is my dearest
wish that I should be able to act for you all in this whole business.But I have gone too far now, the interests involved are too great, to
make a pause here possible.The very essence of the situation is that we
should defy the trust, and throw upon it the _onus_ of stopping us if it
can.We have such a grip upon the men who led you into that trust, and
who can influence the decisions of its directors, that they will not
dare to show fight.The force of circumstances has made me the custodian
of your interests quite as much as of your daughters’.I am very proud
and happy that it is so.It is true that I have not your warrant for
acting in your behalf; but if you will permit me to say so, that cannot
now be allowed to make the slightest difference in my action.”

“Yes, mamma, you are to be rescued in spite of yourself,” said Ethel,
merrily.The young people were all smiling at one another, and to their
considerable relief Mrs.Nobody attempted to analyze the mental processes by which she had been
brought around.It was enough that she had come to accept the situation.The black shadow of discord, which had overhung the household so long,
was gone, and mother and daughters joined in a sigh of grateful relief.It must have been nearly midnight when Reuben rose finally to go.There
had been so much to talk about, and time had flown so softly, buoyantly
along, that the evening seemed to him only to have begun, and he felt
that he fain would have had it go on forever.These delicious hours that
were past had been one sweet sustained conspiracy to do him honor, to
minister to his pleasure.No word or smile or deferential glance of
attention had been wanting to make complete the homage with which the
family had chosen to envelop him.The sense of tender domestic intimacy
had surcharged the very air he breathed.It had not even been necessary
to keep the ball of talk in motion: so well and truly did they know one
another, that silences had come as natural rests--silences more eloquent
than spoken words could be of mutual liking and trust.The outside world
had shrunk to nothingness.Here within this charmed circle of softened
light was home.All that the whole universe contained for him of beauty,
of romance, of reverential desire, of happiness, here within touch it
was centred.The farewells that found their way into phrases left scarcely a mark
upon his memory.There had been cordial, softly significant words of
smiling leave-taking with Ethel and her mother, and then, divinely
prompted by the spirit which ruled this blessed hour, they had gone
away, and he stood alone in the hallway with the woman he worshipped.He
held her hand in his, and there was no need for speech.Slowly, devoutly, he bowed his head over this white hand, and pressed
his lips upon it.There were tears in his eyes when he stood erect
again, and through them he saw with dim rapture the marvel of an angel’s
face, pale, yet glowing in the half light, lovely beyond all mortal
dreams; and on this face there shone a smile, tender, languorous,
trembling with the supreme ecstasy of a soul.Reuben could hardly have told as he walked away down
the path to the street.bless you!” was what the song-birds
carolled in his brain; but whether the music was an echo of what he had
said, did not make itself clear.He was scarcely conscious of the physical element of walking in his
progress.Rather it seemed to him that his whole being was afloat in the
ether, wafted forward by the halcyon winds of a beneficent destiny.Was
there ever such unthinkable bliss before in all the vast span of the
universe?The snowfall had long since ceased, and the clouds were gone.The air
was colder, and the broad sky was brilliant with the clear starlight of
winter.To the lover’s eyes, the great planets were nearer, strangely
nearer, than they had ever been before, and the undying fire with which
they burned was the same that glowed in his own heart.His senses linked
themselves to the grand procession of the skies.The triumphant onward
glide of the earth itself within this colossal scheme of movement was
apparent to him, and seemed but a part of his own resistless, glorified
onward sweep.Oh, this--_this_ was life!*****

At the same hour a heavy and lumpish man made his way homeward by a
neighboring street, tramping with difficulty through the hardening snow
which lay thick upon the walks.There was nothing buoyant in his stride,
and he never once lifted his eyes to observe the luminous panorama
spread overhead.With his hands plunged deep into his pockets, and his
cane under his arm, he trudged moodily along, his shoulders rounded and
his brows bent in a frown.An acquaintance going in the other direction called out cheerily as he
passed, “Hello, General!Pretty tough walking, isn’t it?” and had only
an inarticulate grunt for an answer.There were evil hints abroad in the village below, this night--stories
of impending revelations of fraud, hints of coming prosecutions--and
General Boyce had heard enough of these to grow sick at heart.That
Horace had been deeply mixed up in something scoundrelly, seemed only
too evident.Since this foolish, ungrateful boy had left the paternal
roof, his father had surrendered himself more than ever to drink; but
indulgence now, instead of the old brightening merriment of song and
quip and pleasantly reminiscent camp-fire sparkle, seemed to swing him
like a pendulum between the extremes of sullen wrath and almost tearful
weakness.Something of both these moods weighted his mind to-night, and
to their burden was added a crushingly gloomy apprehension that naked
disgrace was coming as well.Precisely what it was, he knew not; but
winks and nods and unnatural efforts to shift the conversation when
he came in had been in the air about him all the evening.The very
vagueness of the fear lent it fresh terror.His own gate was reached at last, and he turned wearily into the path
which encircled the small yard to reach the front door.He cursorily
noted the existence of some partially obliterated footprints in the
snow, and took it for granted that one of the servants had been out
late.He had begun fumbling in his pocket for the key, and had his foot on the
lower step, before he discovered in the dim light something which
gave even his martial nerves a start.The dark-clad figure of a woman,
obviously well dressed, apparently young, lay before him, the head and
arms bent under against his very door.The General was a man of swift decision and ready resource.In an
instant he had lifted the figure up out of the snow which half enveloped
it, and sustained it in one arm, while with the other he sent the
reverberating clamor of the door-bell pealing through the house.Then,
unlocking the door, he bore his burden lightly into the hall, turned up
the gas, and disposed the inanimate form on a chair.He did not know the woman, but it was evident that she was very
ill--perhaps dying.When the servant came down, he bade her run with all possible haste for
Dr.Lester, who lived only a block or so away.CHAPTER XXXVI.--“I TELL YOU I HAVE LIVED IT DOWN!”

 Instead of snow and cold and the black terror of being overwhelmed
by stormy night, here were light and warmth and a curiously sleepy yet
volatile sense of comfort.Jessica’s eyes for a long time rested tranquilly upon what seemed a
gigantic rose hanging directly over her head.Her brain received no
impression whatever as to why it was there, and there was not the
slightest impulse to wonder or to think about it at all.Even when it
finally began to descend nearer, and to expand and unfold pale pink
leaves, still it was satisfying not to have to make any effort toward
understanding it.The transformation went on with infinite slowness
before her vacantly contented vision.Upon all sides the outer leaves
gradually, little by little, stretched themselves downward, still
downward, until they enveloped her as in the bell of some huge inverted
lily.Indefinite spaces of time intervened, and then it became vaguely
apparent that faint designs of other, smaller flowers were scattered
over these large environing leaves, and that a soft, ruddy light came
through them.With measured deliberation, as if all eternity were at
its disposal, this vast floral cone revealed itself at last to her
dim consciousness as being made of some thin, figured cloth.It seemed
weeks--months--before she further comprehended that the rose above her
was the embroidered centre of a canopy, and that the leaves depending
from it in long, graceful curves about her were bed-curtains.After a time she found herself lifting her hand upright and looking at
it.It was wan and white like wax, as if it did not belong to her at
all.From the wrist there was turned back the delicately quilted cuff of
a man’s silk night-shirt.She raised the arm in its novel silken sleeve,
and thrust it forward with some unformed notion that it would prove not
to be hers.The action pushed aside the curtains, and a glare of light
flashed in, under which she shut her eyes and gasped.When she looked again, an elderly, broad-figured man with a florid face
was standing close beside the bed, gazing with anxiety upon her.She
knew that it was General Boyce, and for a long time was not surprised
that he should be there.The capacity for wondering, for thinking about
things, seemed not to exist in her brain.She looked at him calmly and
did not dream of speaking.“Are you better?” she heard him eagerly whisper.“Are you in pain?”

The complex difficulty of two questions which required separate answers
troubled her remotely.She made some faint nodding motion of her head
and eyes, and then lay perfectly still again.She could hear the sound
of her own breathing--a hoarse, sighing sound, as if of blowing through
a comb--and, now that it was suggested to her, there was a deadened
heavy ache in her breast.Still placidly surveying the General, she began to be conscious of
remembering things.The pictures came slowly, taking form with a
fantastic absence of consecutive meaning, but they gradually produced
the effect of a recollection upon her mind.The starting point--and
everything else that went before that terrible sinking, despairing
struggle through the wet snow--was missing.She recalled most vividly
of all being seized with a sudden crisis of swimming giddiness
and choking--her throat and chest all afire with the tortures of
suffocation.It was under a lamp-post, she remembered; and when the
vehement coughing was over, her mouth was full of blood, and there were
terrifying crimson spatters on the snow.She had stood aghast at this,
and then fallen to weeping piteously to herself with fright.How strange
it was--in the anguish of that moment she had moaned out, “O mother,
mother!” and yet she had never seen that parent, and had scarcely
thought of her memory even for many, many years.Then she had blindly staggered on, sinking more than once from sheer
exhaustion, but still forcing herself forward, her wet feet weighing
like leaden balls, and fierce agonies clutching her very heart.She had
fallen in the snow at the very end of her journey; had dragged herself
laboriously, painfully, up on to the steps, and had beaten feebly on the
panels of the door with her numbed hands, making an inarticulate moan
which not all her desperate last effort could lift into a cry; and then
there had come, with a great downward swoop of skies and storm, utter
blackness and collapse.She closed her eyes now in the weariness which this effort at
recollection had caused.Her senses wandered off, unbidden, unguided,
to a dream of the buzzing of a bee upon a window-pane, which was somehow
like the stertorous sound of her own breathing.The bee--a big, loud, foolish fellow, with yellow fur upon his broad
back and thighs--had flown into the schoolroom, and had not wit enough
to go out again.Some of the children were giggling over this, but
she would not join them because Mr.Tracy, the schoolmaster upon the
platform, did not wish it.Already
she delighted in the hope that he liked her better than he did some of
the other girls--scornful girls who came from wealthy homes, and wore
better dresses than any of the despised Lawton brood could ever hope to
have.Silk dresses, opened boldly at the throat, and with long trains
tricked out with imitation garlands.They were worn now by older
girls--hard-faced, jealous, cruel creatures--and these sat in a room
with lace curtains and luxurious furniture.And some laughed with a ring
like brass in their voices, and some wept furtively in comers, and some
cursed their God and all living things; and there was the odor of wine
and the uproar of the piano, and over all a great, ceaseless shame and
terror.Escape from this should be made at all hazards; and the long, incredibly
fearful flight, with pursuit always pressing hot upon her, the evil
fangs of the wolf-pack snapping in the air all about her frightened
ears, led to a peaceful, soft-carpeted forest, where the low setting
sun spread a red light among the big tree-trunks.Against this deep,
far-distant sky there was the figure of a man coming.For him she waited
with a song in her heart.It was Reuben Tracy, and
he was too gentle and good not to see her when he passed.She would call
out to him--and lo!Horace was with her, and held her hand; and they both gazed with
terrified longing after Tracy, and could not cry out to him for the
awful dumbness that was on them.And when he, refusing to see them,
spread out his arms in anger, the whole great forest began to sway and
circle dizzily, and huge trees toppled, rocks crashed downward, gaunt
giant reptiles rose from yawning caves with hideous slimy eyes in a
lurid ring about her.And she would save Horace with her life, and
fought like mad, bleeding and maimed and frenzied, until the weight
of mountains piled upon her breast held her down in helpless, choking
horror.Then only came the power to scream, and--

Out of the roar of confusion and darkness came suddenly a hush and the
return of light.She was lying in the curtained bed, and a tender hand
was pressing soft cool linen to her lips.Opening her eyes in tranquil weakness, she saw two men standing at her
bedside.He who held the cloth in his hand was Dr.Lester, whom she
remembered very well.The other--he whose head was bowed, and whose eyes
were fastened upon hers with a pained and affrighted gaze--was Horace
Boyce.In her soul she smiled at him, but no answering softness came to his
harrowed face.“I told your father everything,” she heard the doctor say in a low tone.I happened to have attended her, by
the merest chance, when her child was born.”

“Her child?” the other asked, in the same low, far-away voice.He is in Thessaly now, a boy nearly six years
old.”

“Good God!I never knew--”

“You seem to have taken precious good care not to know,” said the
doctor, with grave dislike.“This is the time and place to speak plainly
to you, Boyce.This poor girl has come to her death through the effort
to save you from disgrace.She supposed you lived here, and dragged
herself here to help you.” Jessica heard the sentence of doom without
even a passing thought.Every energy left in her feebly fluttering
brain was concentrated upon the question, _Is_ he saved?Vaguely the
circumstances of the papers, of the threats against Horace, of her
desires and actions, seemed to come back to her memory.She waited in
dazed suspense to hear what Horace would say; but he only hung his head
the lower, and left the doctor to go on.“She raved for hours last night,” he said, “after the women had got her
to bed, and we had raised her out of the comatose state, about saving
you from State prison.First she would plead with Tracy, then she would
appeal to you to fly, and so backwards and forwards, until she wore
herself out.The papers she had got hold of--they must have slipped out
of Gedney’s pocket into the sleigh.I suppose you know that I took them
back to Tracy this morning?”

Still Horace made no answer, but bent that crushed and vacant gaze
upon her face.She marvelled that he could not see she was awake and
conscious, and still more that the strength and will to speak were
withheld from her.The dreadful pressure upon her breast was making
itself felt again, and the painful sound of the labored breathing took
on the sombre rhythm of a distant death-chant.No: still the doctor went on:

“Tracy will be here in a few minutes.He’s terribly upset by the thing,
and has gone first to tell the news at the Minsters’.Do you want to see
him when he comes?”

“I don’t know what I want,” said Horace, gloomily.“If I were you, I would go straight to him and say frankly, ‘I have been
a damned fool, and a still damneder hypocrite, and I throw myself on
your mercy.’ He’s the tenderest-hearted man alive, and this sight here
will move him.Upon my word, I can hardly keep the tears out of my eyes
myself.”

Jessica saw as through a mist that these two men’s faces, turned upon
her, were softened with a deep compassion.Then suddenly the power to
speak came to her.It was a puny and unnatural voice which fell upon her
ears--low and hoarsely grating, and the product of much pain.“Go away--doctor,” she murmured.“Leave him here.”

Horace sat softly upon the edge of the bed, and gathered her two hands
tenderly in his.He did not attempt to keep back the tears which welled
to his eyes, nor did he try to talk.Thus they were together for what
seemed a long time, surrounded by a silence which was full of voices
to them both.A wan smile settled upon her face as she held him in her
intent gaze.“Take the boy,” she whispered at last; “he is Horace, too.Don’t let him
lie--ever--to any girl.”

The young man groaned in spite of himself, and for answer gently pressed
her hands.“I promise you that, Jess,” he said, after a time, in a
broken voice.He bent over and kissed her on the forehead.The damp
roughness of the skin chilled and terrified him, but the radiance on her
face deepened.“It hurts--to breathe,” she said, after a time with a glance of
affectionate apology in her smile.Subdued noises were faintly heard now in the hallway outside, and
presently the door was opened cautiously, and a tall new figure entered
the room.After a moment’s hesitation Reuben Tracy tiptoed his way to
the bedside, and stood gravely behind and above his former partner.“Is she conscious?” he asked of Boyce, in a tremulous whisper; and
Horace, bending his head still lower, murmured between choking sobs: “It
is Mr.Tracy, Jess, come to say--to see you.”

Her eyes brightened with intelligence.“Good--good,” she said, slowly,
as if musing to herself.The gaze which she fastened upon Reuben’s face
was strangely full of intense meaning, and he felt it piercing his
very heart.Minutes went by under the strain of this deep, half-wild,
appealing look.At last she spoke, with a greater effort at distinctness
than before, and in a momentarily clearer tone.“You were always kind,” she said.“Don’t hurt--my boy.Shake hands with
him--for my sake.”

The two young men obeyed mechanically, after an instant’s pause, and
without looking at each other.Neither had eyes save for the white face
on the pillows in front of them, and for the gladdened, restful light
which spread softly over it as their hands touched in amity before her
vision.In the languor of peace which had come to possess her, even the sense of
pain in breathing was gone.There were shadowy figures on the retina of
her brain, but they conveyed no idea save of general beatitude to her
mind.The space in which her senses floated was radiant and warm and
full of formless beauty.Various individuals--types of her loosening
ties to life--came and went almost unheeded in this daze.Lucinda, vehemently weeping, and holding the little fair-haired,
wondering boy over the bed for her final kiss, passed away like a
dissolving mist.Her father’s face, too, dawned upon this dream,
tear-stained and woful, and faded again into nothingness.Other flitting
apparitions there were, even more vague and brief, melting noiselessly
into the darkened hush.The unclouded calm of this lethargy grew troubled presently when there
fell upon her dulled ear the low tones of a remembered woman’s voice.Enough of consciousness flickered up to tell her whose it was.She
strained her eyes in the gathering shadows to see Kate Minster, and
began restlessly to roll her head upon the pillow.“Where--where--_her?_” she moaned, striving to stretch forth her hand.It was lifted and held softly in a tender grasp, and she felt as well
a compassionate stroking touch laid upon her forehead.The gentle
magnetism of these helped the dying girl to bring into momentary being
the image of a countenance close above hers--a dark, beautiful face, all
melting now with affection and grief.She smiled faintly into this face,
and lay still again for a long time.The breathing grew terribly shorter
and more labored, the light faded.T. conveyed the intimation that the
women students might go to any of the classes--and a benison on them!The faction fight, like many another in the brave days of old,
roared and clattered down the paved causeways of Glasgow.T., in
his gate-house, must have wished his petticoat foes many times away
and above the pass.If he, or any of the obstructionists of that day
survive, we know that they belong to a sect that needs no repentance.They may, however, note with self-complacency that their action trained
on a generation skilled in the contest of fighting for democratic
rights in the realm of knowledge.It is a birthright to enter into that
gateway, and the keys are given to all who possess the understanding
mind and reverent attitude towards all truth.1891._

 ‘Those old wretches, the Infirmary Managers, have reared their heads
 again, and now have decided that we are not to go to mixed classes,
 and we have been tearing all over the wards seeing all sorts of people
 about it.K.’s this morning--all right.Crossing the
 quadrangle, a porter rushed at me and said, “Dr.T. wants to see
 all the lady students at the gate-house.” I remarked to Miss M.,
 “I am certainly not going to trot after Dr.He can put up a notice if he wants me.” We were going
 upstairs to Dr.R. when another porter ran up and said, “Dr.He would be much obliged if you would speak to him.”
 So we laughed, and said that was more polite anyhow, and went into
 the office.So he hummed and hawed, looked everywhere except at
 us, and then said the Infirmary Managers said we were not to go to
 mixed classes.So I promptly said, “Then I shall come for my fees
 to-morrow,” and walked out of the room.K., who said he was awfuly sorry and angry, and he would
 see Dr.T., but he was afraid he could do nothing.But you see we cannot be beat here, for
 the same reason that we cannot beat them in Edinburgh.Were the
 managers, managers a hundred times over, they cannot turn Mr.‘The _Glasgow Herald_ had an article the other day, saying there
 was a radical change in the country, and that no one was taking any
 notice of it, and no one knew where it was to land us.This was the
 draft ordinance of the Commissioners which actually put the education
 of women on the same footing as that of men, and, worse still,
 seemed to countenance mixed classes.H._ seems to think this
 is the beginning of the end, and will necessarily lead to woman’s
 suffrage, and it will probably land them in the pulpit; because if
 they are ordinary University students they may compete for any of the
 bursaries, and many bursaries can only be held on condition that the
 holder means to enter the Church!You never read such an article, and
 it was not the least a joke but sober earnest.The chief reason I tried to get that
 prize was to pay for those things and not worry you about them.I want
 to pass awfully well, as it tells all one’s life through, and I _mean_
 to be very successful!B. has the most absurd way of agreeing with everything you say.He asked me what I would do with a finger.I thought it was past
 all mending and said, “Amputate it.” “Quite so, quite so,” he said
 solemnly, “but we’ll dress it to-day with such and such a thing.”
 There were two or three other cases in which I recommended desperate
 measures, in which he agreed, but did not follow.B. what he would do with a swelling.I said,
 “Open it.” Whereupon he went off into fits of laughter, and proclaimed
 to the whole room my prescriptions, and said I would make a first-rate
 surgeon for I was afraid of nothing.‘It is one thing to recommend treatment to another person and another
 to do it yourself.‘Queen Margaret is to be taken into the University, not affiliated,
 but made an integral part of the University and the lecturers
 appointed again by the Senators.That means that the Glasgow degrees
 in everything are to be given from October, Arts, Medicine, Science,
 and _Theology_.The “decrees of the primordial protoplasm,” that Sir
 James Crichton-Browne knows all about, are being reversed right and
 left, and not only by the Senatus Academicus of St.Andrews!’

The remaining letters are filled with all the hopes and fears of the
examined.MacEwan tells her she will pass ‘with one hand,’ and
Elsie has the usual moan over a defective memory, and the certainties
that she will be asked all the questions to which she has no answering
key.The evidences of hard and conscientious study abound, and, after
she had counted the days and rejoined her father, she found she had
passed through the heavy ordeal with great success, and, having thus
qualified, could pass on to yet unconquered realms of experience and
service.CHAPTER V

LONDON

THE NEW HOSPITAL FOR WOMEN

DUBLIN

THE ROTUNDA

1892-1894

    ‘We take up the task eternal and the burden and the lesson,
    Pioneers, O Pioneers.’--WALT WHITMAN.After completing her clinical work in Glasgow, and passing the
examination for the Triple Qualification in 1892, it was decided that
Elsie should go to London and work as house-surgeon in the new Hospital
for Women in the Euston Road.In 1916 that hospital kept its jubilee
year, and when Elsie went to work there it had been established for
nearly thirty years.Its story contains the record of the leading names
among women doctors.In the commemorative prayer of Bishop Paget, an
especial thanksgiving was made ‘for the good example of those now at
rest, Elizabeth Blackwell, and Sophia Jex Blake, of good work done
by women doctors throughout the whole world, and now especially of
the high trust and great responsibility committed to women doctors in
this hour of need.’ The hearts of many present went over the washing
seas, to the lands wasted by fire and sword, and to the leader of
the Scottish Women’s Hospitals, who had gained her earliest surgical
experience in the wards of the first hospital founded by the first
woman doctor, and standing for the new principle that women can
practise the healing art.Elsie Inglis took up her work with keen energy and a happy power
of combining work with varied interests.In the active months of
her residence she resolutely ‘tramped’ London, attended most of the
outstanding churches, and was a great sermon taster of ministers
ranging from Boyd Carpenter to Father Maturin.Innumerable relatives
and friends tempted her to lawn tennis and the theatres.She had a keen
eye to all the humours of the staff, and formed her own opinions on
patients and doctors with her usual independence of judgment.Elsie’s letters to her father were detailed and written daily.Only a
very small selection can be quoted, but every one of them is instinct
with a buoyant outlook, and they are full of the joy of service.It is interesting to read in these letters her descriptions of the work
of Dr.Garrett Anderson, and then to read Dr.Louisa Garrett Anderson’s
speech on her mother at the jubilee of the hospital.‘I shall never
forget her at Victoria Station on the day when the Women’s Hospital
Corps was leaving England for France, early in September 1914.She was
quite an old woman, her life’s work done, but the light of battle was
in her eyes, and she said, “Had I been twenty years younger I would
have been taking you myself.” Just twenty-one years before the war
broke down the last of the barriers against women’s work as doctors,
Elsie Inglis entered the New Hospital for Women, to learn with that
staff of women doctors who had achieved so much under conditions so
full of difficulties and discouragements.‘NEW HOSPITAL FOR WOMEN,
      ‘EUSTON RD., 1892-3.‘MY OWN DEAREST PAPA,--Here we begin another long series of letters.The people in the carriage were very quiet, so I slept all right.Of
 course they shut up all the windows, so I opened all the ventilators,
 and I also opened the window two or three times.I had breakfast at
 once, and then a bath, and then came in for a big operation by Mrs.de la
 Cherois were up too--both of them visiting doctors.I have been all
 round the wards and got a sort of idea of the cases in my head, but
 I shall have to get them all up properly.The visiting physicians
 seem to call all over the day, from nine o’clock in the morning till
 three in the afternoon.Some of the students from the School of
 Medicine are dressers and clerks.I believe I have to drill them,
 but of course they are only very senior students, because their real
 hospital is the Royal Free.There are four wards, two of them round,
 with two fireplaces back to back in the middle.The other two wards
 are oblong, and they are all prettily painted, and bright.Then there
 are two small wards for serious cases.I have not arranged my room
 yet, as I have not had a minute.I am going out to post this and get
 a stethescope.de la Cherois has been here; she is a nice old
 lady, and awfully particular.I would much rather work with people
 like that than people who are anyhow.Scharlieb is about forty,
 very dark and solemn.The nurses seem nice, but they don’t have any
 special uniform, which I think is a pity; so they are pinks and greys
 and blues, and twenty different patterns of caps.I think I shall
 like being here very much.I only hope I shall get on with all my
 mistresses!And, I _hope_ I shall always remember what to do.It was very sad, and very
 provoking, for she really was doing well, but she had not vitality
 enough to stand the shock.That was the case whose doctor told her and
 her husband that she was suffering from _hysteria_.And that man, you
 know, can be a fellow of the colleges, and member of any society he
 likes to apply to, while Mrs.G. Anderson said she was going to speak to Mrs.M‘Call about my
 having one of her maternity posts.I shall come home first, however,
 my own dearest Papa.G. A. said she thought I should have a good
 deal more of that kind of work if I was going to set up in a lonely
 place like Edinburgh, as I ought _never_ to have to call in a man to
 help me out of a hole!G. Anderson is going to take me to a Cinderella dance to-night
 in aid of the hospital.M.’s ward, and turned
 up 9.30, Mrs.Then Miss C. came in on the top to consult
 about two of her cases.Into the bargain, A. slept late, and did not
 arrive till near ten, so, by the time they had all left, I had a
 lovely medley of treatment in my head.My fan has arrived, and will
 come in for to-night.G. Anderson will be a nice chaperone
 and introduce one properly.I am to go early, and her son is to look
 out for me, and begin the introducing till she comes.Miss Garrett has
 been to-day painting the hall for the Chicago Exhibition.She is going
 to the dance to-night.Fawcett got some more money out
 of the English Commissioners in a lovely way.These Commissioners have
 spent £17,000 in building themselves a kiosk in the ground, and they
 allowed Mrs.Fawcett £500 to represent women’s work in England.Fawcett has managed to get an
 extra £500.She wrote, and said that if she did not get any more she
 could not mount all the photographs and drawings, but would put up a
 notice that “the English Commission was too poor to allow for mounting
 and framing.” This, with the kiosk in the ground!‘One of the patients here was once upon a time a servant at the
 Baroness Burdett Coutts’.She certainly was most awfully kind to
 her, sent her £10 to pay her rent, and has now paid to send her to
 the Cottage.Miss B. is in hopes she may get her interested in the
 hospital now, but it seems she does not approve of women doctors and
 such things.Perhaps, as the old housemaid did so well here, she may
 change her mind.I shall send them to some of
 the doctors in Edinburgh.Robertson left £1000 in
 memory of his wife to the hospital, and that is how that bed comes to
 be called the “Caroline Croom Robertson bed.”

 ‘We had two big operations to-day.We had the usual round in the
 morning, and then we had to prepare.This
 morning, I pointed out to Mrs.Scharlieb with indignation that our
 galvanic battery had run out.I said that it really was disgraceful
 of C., for it had only been used once for a quarter of an hour since
 the last time he had charged it.S. agreed, and said she would go
 in and speak to him and tell him to send her battery, which was with
 him being charged.We wanted a battery for the galvanic cautery.Scharlieb’s battery arrived.I tried it, and found it would not
 heat the cautery properly.So I was very angry, and I sat down and
 wrote C. a peppery letter.I told him to send some competent person
 _at once_ to look at the battery, and to be prepared to lend us one,
 if this competent person saw it was necessary.M. flew off, and in
 twenty minutes a man from C. arrived, very humble.I turned on the
 batteries, and showed him that they would not heat up properly.Sister
 said I talked to him like a mother.He departed very humbly to bring
 another battery.In about half an hour Sister whistled up, C.’s man
 would like to see me.He looked at me with a twinkle in
 his eye.“You had not taken the resistance off, Miss,” and held one of
 the cautery red-hot attached to our own battery.And the amount of nervous energy I had wasted on
 that battery!‘We began to-day with a big operation.The chloroform was given by a Dr.B., some special friend of the
 patient, so, I hoped there would be no hitch, and there was none.He
 had the cheek afterwards to say to Dr.S., that no one could have done
 it better!S. seemed rather pleased, but I thought it awfully
 patronising, was it not?S. and Miss Walker were talking the other
 morning of the time when they would make this a qualifying hospital?Miss C. said it would certainly come some day, and of course, to make
 it a qualifying hospital, they must have men’s beds, and that will
 mean a mixed staff.Then, we will
 show the old-fashioned hospitals, with their retrograde managers,
 etc., _how_ a mixed staff can work.I wonder if they will have mixed
 classes too!‘I enjoyed _King Lear_ very much.King
 Lear was not a bit kingly, but just a weak, old man.I suppose that
 was what he was meant to be.I shivered in my seat when the wind whistled.The last scene--the French camp on the cliffs on Dover--was really
 beautiful.‘Yesterday, I did a lovely thing--slept like a top till almost nine.I suppose I was tired after the exciting cases.Janet burst into my
 room with “Mrs.S. will be here in a very few minutes, Miss.” So, out
 I tumbled, and tore downstairs to meet Mrs.I tried to
 look as if I had had breakfast _hours_ before, and I don’t think she
 suspected that was my first appearance.She did her visit, and then I
 went to breakfast.G. Anderson chose that
 morning of all others to show a friend of hers round the hospital.She
 marched calmly into the board-room to find me grubbing.I saw the only
 thing to do was to be quite cool, so I got up and shook hands, and
 remarked, “I am rather late this morning,” and she only laughed.It
 was about 10.30, a nice time for an H.S.‘I did not go to hear Father Maturin after all yesterday.I have been
 very busy; we have had another big operation, doing all right so
 far.She is an artist’s wife; she has had an unhappy time for four
 years, because she has been very ill, and their doctor said it was
 hysteria, and told her husband not to give in to the nonsense.Really,
 some of these general practitioners are _grand_.They send some of
 the patients in with the most outrageous diagnoses you can imagine.One woman was told her life was not worth a year’s purchase, and she
 must have a big operation.We pummelled her all over,
 and could not find the grounds of his diagnosis, and finally treated
 for something quite different, and she went out well in six weeks.Her doctor came to see her, and said, “Well, madam, I could not have
 believed it.” It is better they should err in that direction than in
 the direction of calling real illness “hysteria.”

 ‘I mean to have a hospital of my own in Edinburgh some day.‘A patient with a well-balanced nervous system will get well in just
 half the time that one of these hysterical women will.There is one
 plucky little woman in just now.She has had a bad operation, but
 nothing has ever disturbed her equilibrium.She smiles away in the
 pluckiest way, and gets well more quickly than anybody.I agree with
 Kingsley: one of the necessities of the world is to teach girls to be
 brave, and not whine over everything, and the first step for that is
 to teach them to play games!‘Fancy who has been here this evening--Bailie Walcot.He has come
 up to London on Parliamentary business.He investigated every hole
 and corner of the hospital.Littlejohn’s class with Jex’s girls at Surgery Hall.It is wonderful
 how these men who would do nothing at first are beginning to see it
 pays to be neutral now.‘We have a lot to be grateful to J. B. for; Bailie W. told me the
 Leith managers have approached the Edinburgh managers, saying, “If
 you will undertake no more women students, we will undertake to take
 both schools, and to build immediately.” Bailie Walcot said he and Mr.George’s were the _only_ two who opposed this.If they
 send us down to Leith we must make the best of it, and really try to
 make it a good school, but it will be a great pity.G. Anderson is a capital chaperone.I managed to go off without my ticket, and the damsel at the door was
 very severe, and said I must wait till Mrs.I
 waited quietly a minute or two, and was just going to ask her to send
 in to see if Mrs.Anderson had come, then a man marched in, and said
 in a lovely manner, “I have forgotten my ticket,” and she merely said,
 “You must give me your name, sir,” and let him pass.After that I gave
 my name and passed too!I found I might have waited till doomsday, for
 Mrs.I danced every dance; it was a lovely floor and
 lovely music, and you may make up your mind, papa dear, that I go to
 all the balls in Edinburgh after this.They had two odd dances called
 Barn-door.I thought it would be a kind of Sir Roger, but it was the
 oddest kind of hop, skip and dance I ever saw.G. A. it
 was something like a Schottische, only not a quarter so pretty.She
 said it was pretty when nicely danced, but people have not learnt it
 yet.G. A. that I could get some tea from the
 night nurse when I got home (because I wanted to dance the extras),
 but she was horrified at tea just before going to sleep, and swept me
 into the refreshment-room and made me drink soup by the gallon.We had an operation this morning, so you see
 dances don’t interfere with the serious business of life.Scharlieb came in here the other day, and declared I was
 qualifying for acute bronchitis; but I told her nobody could have
 acute bronchitis who had a cold bath every morning, and had been
 brought up to open windows.This is the third sit down to your letter.Talk of women at home never being able to do anything without being
 interrupted every few minutes!I think you have only to be house
 surgeon to know what being interrupted means.They not only knock
 and march in at the door, but they also whistle up the tube--most
 frightfully startling it used to be at first, to hear a sort of shrill
 fog-horn in the room.There are three high temperatures, and the
 results are sent up to me whenever they are taken.We are sponging
 them, and may have to put them into cold baths, but I hope not.G. A. told me to do it without waiting for the chief, if I thought it
 necessary, whereupon Mrs.B. remarked, “I think Miss Inglis ought to
 be warned the patient may die.”

 ‘Lovely weather here.I have been prescribing sunshine, sunshine,
 sunshine for all the patients.There are only two balconies on each
 floor, and nurse Rose is reported to have said that she supposed I
 wanted the patients hung out over the railings, for otherwise there
 would not be room.Miss W. came this morning, to Sister’s indignation.“Does not she think she can trust me for one day?” So I said it was
 only that she was so delighted at having a ward; and that I was sure
 I would do the same.“Oh,” said Sister, “I am thankful you have not a
 ward.You would bring a box with sandwiches and sit there all day.”
 I am always having former H.S.’s thrown at my head who came round
 exactly to the minute, twice a day, whereas they say I am never out
 of the wards, at least they never know when I am coming.I tell them
 I don’t want them to trot round after me with an ink-bottle.Miss R.
 says I have no idea of discipline!I make one grand round a day, with
 the ink-bottle, and then I don’t want the nurses to take any more
 notice of me.I think that is far more sensible than having fixed
 times.I quite agree the ink-bottle round ought to be at a fixed time,
 but I cannot help other things turning up to be done.‘I had to toddle off and ask for Mrs.K. She is the one who is
 appointed to give anæsthetics in the hospital.They are all most
 frightfully nervous about anæsthetics here, in all the hospitals,
 and have regular anæsthetists.In Edinburgh and Glasgow the students
 give it, under the house surgeons of course.I never saw any death,
 or anything that was very frightening.One real reason is, I believe,
 that they watch the wrong organ, viz.In Scotland they
 hardly think of the heart, and simply watch the breathing.The
 Hydrabad Commission settled conclusively that it was the breathing
 gave out first; but having made up their minds that it does not, all
 the Commissions in the world won’t convince them to the contrary.In the meantime they do their operations in fear and trembling,
 continually asking if the patient is all right.‘You never saw such a splendid out-patient department as they have
 here--a perfectly lovely, comfortable waiting-room, and pretty
 receiving waiting-room.The patients have to pay a small sum, yet they
 had over 20,000 visits this year up to November--that is about half
 the size of the Glasgow Royal, one of the biggest out-patients in the
 kingdom, and general.‘This morning I started off, meaning to go to Dr.Sister C. told me I ought to be early, and of course
 I was as late as I could be.As I was running downstairs Nurse Helen
 asked me if I had ever heard Stopford Brooke.I had heard his name,
 but I could not remember anything about him.Nurse H. said he was an
 awful heretic, and had got into trouble for his opinions.As a general
 rule men who get into trouble for their opinions are worth listening
 to--at least they _have_ opinions.Vaughan, and went off
 to Mr.He gave a capital sermon with nothing heterodox in
 it, about loving our fellow-men.I liked him, and would go to-night to
 hear his lecture on “In Memoriam,” but Sister C. is going out.‘You know you must not aim at a separate but at a mixed school in
 Edinburgh.I am sure this is best, and all the women here think so
 too.G. Anderson asked me to come and help her with a small operation
 in an hotel.She gave me a half-guinea fee for so doing.We drove
 there in a hansom, and drove back in her carriage.She was most jovial
 and talkative.We went into the Deanery, Westminster Abbey, on our way
 back to leave cards on somebody.You suddenly seem to get out of the
 noise and rush of London when you turn in there.All sorts of men were wandering about in red gowns and black
 gowns.Scharlieb was awfully nice and kind.She said she hoped I would
 get on always as well as I had here.I said I
 hoped I would do much better, for I thought I had made an awful lot of
 mistakes since I came here.The worst of being a doctor is that one’s mistakes matter so much.In
 everything else you just throw away what you have messed and begin
 again, but you cannot do that as a doctor.‘She said she expects to be called in as my consultant when I am a
 surgeon.Won’t my patients have to pay fees to get her up from London!‘Miss C. has been trying to get on to some of the medical societies,
 and has failed.I shall not demean myself by asking to get on--shall
 wait till they beseech the honour of adding my name.‘As to women doctors here having an assured position, I rather like
 the pioneer work, I think!I mean to make friends with all the nice
 doctors, and vanquish all the horrid selfish ones, and end by being a
 Missionary Professor.‘If I don’t get into the Infirmary in Edinburgh, I mean to build a
 hospital for myself, like this one.Indeed I don’t know that I should
 not like the hospital to myself better!I’ll build it where the Cattle
 Market is, at the head of Lady Lawson Street.That would be convenient
 for all the women in Fountainbridge, and the Grassmarket and Cowgate,
 and it would be comparatively high.To begin with, I mean to rent
 Eva’s hall from her for a dispensary.You see it is all arranged!’

The next course Elsie decided on taking was one of three months in
Midwifery in the Rotunda, Dublin.There was a greater equality of
teaching there in mixed classes, and also she thought the position of
the whole hospital staff was on lines which would enable her to gain
the most experience in this branch, where she ultimately achieved so
much for her fellow-citizens in Edinburgh.‘COSTIGAN’S HOTEL, UPPER SACKVILLE ST.,
      ‘DUBLIN, _Nov.‘I went over to the Rotunda and saw Dr.I am “clerk” on Mondays and Thursdays.The only other person here is
 a native from the Nizam’s Dominions.At breakfast this morning he
 told me about his children, who are quite fair “like their mother.”
 How fond he was of London, and how he would not live in India now for
 anything; he finds the climate enervating!I told him I thought India
 a first-rate place to live in, and that I should like to go back.‘By the way, fancy the franchise for the Parish Councils being
 carried.The first thing I saw when I landed was defeat of the
 Government!The _Independent_ here is jubilant, partly because the
 point of woman’s suffrage is carried, partly because the Government is
 beaten.‘So the strike has ended, and the men go back to work on their old
 wages till February.I expect both sides are sick of it, but I am glad
 the men have carried it so far.C. evidently thinks I am quite mad, for I have asked for a cold
 bath in my room.it’s not cold entoirely
 ye’ll be meaning.”

 ‘I went to see the D.’s.The first thing I was told was that a
 Miss D. sat in their church, an M.B.A very
 clever girl, she has just taken a travelling bursary and is going to
 Vienna.“But we don’t know her, they are Home Rulers!” Mrs.D. went
 on to say both she and her father were Home Rulers, but that she for
 one would not mind if they did not obtrude their politics.So, I
 thought, “Well, I won’t obtrude mine.” Then Mrs.D. said, “You must
 take a side, you know, and say distinctly what side you are on when
 you are asked.” So I thought, “Well, I’ll wait till I am asked,” and
 I have got through to-day without being asked.But, positively, they
 used the word “boycott” about those D.’s.They have been boycotted
 by the congregation.It must be rather hard to be a Home Ruler and
 a Presbyterian just now in Ireland.Positively, they frightened me
 so, I nearly squirmed under the table.However, when I looked round
 the congregation I thought I should not mind much being boycotted by
 them.D. has
 given me a standing invitation to come to dinner on Sunday.What will
 happen when I am suddenly asked to take my side, I don’t know.In the
 meantime I will let things slide!D. asked me if the Costigans
 were Catholics, and said she thought Mrs.C. looked so nice she could
 not be one.’

      ‘_Dec.1893._

 ‘I have done nothing but race after cases to-day.B., whom she said she had known before he
 was born.B. could not go, so I went.“Hech,” she said, “I came
 for a _doctor_.” “Well, I’m the doctor.Come along.” “Deed no,” she
 said; “ye’re no a doctor--ye’re just a wumman.” I did laugh, and
 marched her off.She was grandly tipsy when I left the home, so I am
 going back to see how the patient has got on, in spite of the nursing.‘I had a second polite speech made to me last night.I was introduced
 into a house by the person who came for me as the doctor.When I
 had been in about two minutes, a small man of four years old, said
 suddenly in a clear voice “That is _not_ a doctor, it’s a girl!” I
 told him he was behind the age not to know that one could be both.‘We had a chloroform scare this morning.S.’s coolness
 immensely.He finished tying his stitches quietly while two doctors
 were skipping round like a pair of frightened girls.They don’t know how to give chloroform anywhere out of
 Scotland.D. declared she was going to write to you that she had found
 I had gone out without my breakfast.I was
 out last night, and was not up when they rang over for me.So, before
 having my breakfast I just ran over to see what they wanted me for,
 and finding it would keep I came back for my breakfast to find Mrs.I am not such an idiot as to miss my meals, Papa, dearest.I always have a glass of milk and a biscuit
 when I go out at night.I know you
 cannot do work with blunt instruments, and this instrument blunts very
 easily without food and exercise.1, 1894._

 ‘I have been round all my patients to-day, and had to drink glasses
 of very questionable wine in each house.It is really very trying to
 a practical teetotaller like me.Literally, I could hardly see them
 when I left the last house!There was simply no getting off it, and I
 did not want to hurt their feelings.When they catch hold of your hand
 and say “Now, doctor dear, or doctor jewel, ye’ll just be takin’ a wee
 glass, deed an ye will,” what are you to do?‘Do you think this “Famasha” with the French in Africa is going to
 be the beginning of the big war?But, it would be the English-speaking
 peoples, Australia, the States, and Canada.‘I have made a convert to the ranks of women’s rights.B. and I had had an awful argument.I never mentioned
 the subject again, for it is no good arguing with a man who has made
 up his mind (and is a North of Ireland man, who will die in the last
 ditch into the bargain).However, in the middle of the operation, he
 suddenly said, “By the way, you are right about the suffrage, Miss
 Inglis.” Then I found he had come over about the whole question.As
 a convert is always the most violent supporter, I hope he’ll do some
 good.5, 1894._

 ‘After three months you have learnt all the Rotunda can teach.If you
 were a man, it would be worth while to stay, because senior students,
 if they are men, get a lot of the C.C.’s work to do.But they never
 think of letting you do it if you are a woman.It is not deliberate
 unfairness, but they never think of it.If one stays six months they
 examine one, and give a degree, L.M., Licentiate of Midwifery.If I
 could I would rather spend three months in Paris with Pozzi.I have
 learnt a tremendous lot here, and feel very happy about my work in
 this special line.If you can
 really afford to give me another three months it would be wiser to go
 to Paris.There are three men who are quite in the front rank there,
 Pozzi, Apostoli, and Péon.’

      ‘COSTIGAN’S, UPPER SACKVILLE STREET,
      ‘DUBLIN, _Feb.10, 1894._

 ‘I got your letter at eleven when I came down to breakfast.I shall
 never get into regular order for home again.No one blames one for
 lying in bed here or being late, for no one knows how late you have
 been up the night before, or how many cases you have been at before
 you get to the lecture.It is partly that, and partly their casual
 Irish ways.I have had a letter from Miss MacGregor this morning,
 asking what I should say to our starting together in Edinburgh.It is quite true, as she says,
 that two women are much more comfortable working together.They can
 give chloroform for one another and so on, and consult together.On
 the other hand, we could do that just as well if we simply started
 separately, and were friends.‘Miss MacGregor was one of the J.-B.lot, and she and I had awful
 rows over that question.But we certainly got on very well before
 that, and, as she says, that was not a personal question.I am quite
 sure Miss MacGregor is Scotch enough not to propose any arrangement
 which won’t be to her own advantage.Probably, I know a good many more
 people than she does.The question for me is whether it will be for my
 advantage.Miss MacGregor is
 a splendid pathologist.Nowadays one ought to do a lot of that work
 with one’s cases, and I have been puzzling over how one could, and yet
 keep aseptic.If we could make some arrangement by which we could work
 into one another’s hands in that way, I think it would be for both our
 advantages.There is one thing in favour of it, if Miss MacGregor and
 I are definitely working together, no one can be astonished at our not
 calling in other people.Miss MacGregor, apart from everything else,
 is distinctly one of our best women, and it would be nice working with
 her.What do you think of it, Papa, dear?Of course I should live at
 home in any case.My consulting rooms anyhow would have to be outside,
 for the old ladies would not climb up the stair!‘DUBLIN, _Feb.‘I do thank you so much for having let me come here.But it was
 awfully good of you to let me come.I am sure it will make a
 difference all my life.I really feel on my feet in this subject now.The more I think of it, the more I think it would be wise to start
 with Miss MacGregor.we will
 start the dispensary, and we’ll end by having a hospital like the
 Rotunda, where students shall live on the premises--female students
 only.Not that these boys are not very nice and good-natured, only
 they are out of place in the Rotunda.’

This was nearly the last letter written by Elsie to her father.In most
of her letters during the preceding months it was obvious Mr.Inglis’
health was causing her anxiety, and the inquiries and suggestions
for his well-being grew more urgent as the shadow of death fell
increasingly dark on the written pages.Elsie returned to receive his eager welcome, but even her eyes were
blinded to the rapidly approaching parting.On the 15th of March 1894,
she wrote to her brother Ernest in India, telling all the story of Mr.Inglis’ passing on the 13th of that month.There was much suffering
borne with quiet patience, ‘He never once complained: I never saw such
a patient.’ At the end, he turned towards the window, and then a bright
look came into his eyes.He said, ‘Pull down the blind.’ Then the
chivalrous, knightly soul passed into the light that never was on sea
or land.‘It was a splendid life he led,’ writes Elsie to her brother; ‘his old
 Indian friends write now and say how “the name of John Inglis always
 represented everything that was upright and straightforward and high
 principled in the character of a Christian gentleman.” He always said
 that he did not believe that death was the stopping place, but that
 one would go on growing and learning through all eternity.We had made such plans, and now it does not seem worth while to go on
 working at all.I said it would be such a joke to see Dr.Saturday afternoons were to be his, and he was to come over
 in my trap.‘He never thought of himself at all.Even when he was very ill at
 the end, he always looked up when one went in, and said, “Well, my
 darling.” I am glad I knew about nursing, for we did not need to have
 any stranger about him.He would have hated that.’




CHAPTER VI

POLITICAL ENFRANCHISEMENT AND NATIONAL POLITICS

    ‘Well done, New Zealand!I expect I shall live to have a vote.’--E.
    M. I., 1891.‘I envy not in any mood
      The captive void of noble rage,
      The linnet born within the cage,
    That never knew the summer woods.’

    ‘So the vote has come!Fancy its having taken the
    war to show them how ready we were to work!Or even to show that
    that work was necessary.Where do they think the world would have
    been without women’s work all these ages?’--E. M. I., Reni, Russia,
    June 1917.David Inglis, writing to his son on his marriage in 1845, says:--

 ‘I cannot express the deep interest, or the ardent hopes with which
 my bosom is filled on the occasion, or the earnest though humble
 prayer to the Giver of all good which it has uttered that He may shed
 abundantly upon you _both_ the rich mercies of His grace: with those
 feelings I take each of you to my heart, and give you my parental
 love and blessing.You have told me enough of the object of your fond
 choice to make her henceforth dear to me, to all of us, on her own
 account, as well as yours.‘And here, my beloved David, I would turn for a moment more
 immediately to yourself, as being now in a situation very different
 from that in which you have hitherto been placed.As a husband, then,
 it will now behove you to remember that you are not your own exclusive
 property--that for a single moment you must never forget; the tender
 love and affectionate respect and consideration which are due from you
 to the amiable individual who has bestowed on you her hand and heart,
 it will, I assure myself, be your pleasing duty to prove, by unceasing
 attention to, and solicitude for, her every wish how dearly you
 appreciate her worth, as well as _gift_; and that her future comfort
 and happiness will invariably possess an estimation in your view
 paramount to every feeling that can more immediately or personally
 affect yourself.Let such be manifest in your every act, as connected
 with every object in which _she_ is concerned.Her love and affection
 for you will then be reciprocal and pure and lasting, and thus will
 you become to each other what, under God’s blessing, you are meant to
 be--a mutual comfort and an abiding stay.Make her the confidential
 friend of your bosom, to whom its every thought must unreservedly
 be imparted--the soother of all its cares, its anxieties, and
 disappointments, when they chance to arise; the fond participator in
 all your happiness and joys, from whatever source they may spring--you
 will thus be discharging a duty which your sacred obligations at the
 altar have entailed upon you.’

This letter has been quoted with its phrasing of seventy years ago,
because it shows an advanced outlook on the position of husband and
wife, and the setting forth of their equality and the respect paid to
their several positions.Inglis’ views, both
in his perfect relations with his wife and the sympathetic liberty of
thought and action which he encouraged in his own family.This chapter is devoted to the political and public life of Elsie
Inglis.The ‘common cause’
to which she gave so much of her life has now been won.The tumult
and the turmoil are now hushed in peace and security.The age which
began in John Stuart Mill’s ‘Subjection of Women’ has ended in the
Representation of the People’s Bill.It is possible to review the
political period of the generation which produced Elsie Inglis, and her
comrades in the struggle against the disqualification of sex, without
raising any fresh controversy.Inglis was one of the finest types of
women produced by the ideals and inspiring purposes of the generation
to which she belonged.She was born when a woman was the reigning
Sovereign, and when her influence and power were at its height.Four years after her birth the Reform Bill of 1868 was to make the
first claim for women as citizens in the British Parliament.The
Married Woman’s Property Act, and the laws affecting Divorce, had
recognised them as something else than the goods and chattels or
the playthings and bondwomen of the ‘predominant partner.’ Mary
Somerville had convinced the world that a woman could have a brain.Timidly, and yet resolutely, women were claiming a higher education,
and Universities were slamming to their doors, with a petty horde
of maxims claimed to be based on divine authority.Women pioneers
mounted platforms and asserted ‘Rights,’ and qualified for jealously
closed professions--always, from the first, upheld and companied by
‘Greathearts,’ men few but chosen, who, like John Inglis, recognised
that no community was the stronger for keeping its people, be they
black or white, male or female, in any form of ignorance or bonded
serfdom.As Elsie grew up, she found herself walking in the new age.Doors
were set ajar, if not fully opened.The first wave of ridicule and of
conscientious objections had spent its force.A girl’s school might
play games decorously and not lose all genteel deportment.Girls might
show a love of knowledge, and no longer be hooted as blue-stockings.The use of the globes and cross-stitch gave place to learning which
might fit them to be educated, and useful members of the community.Ill-health ceased to be considered part of the curse of Eve, to
be borne with swooning resignation on the wide sofas of the early
Victorian Age.Ignorance and innocence were not recognised as twin
sisters, and women, having eaten of the tree of knowledge, looked round
a world which prided itself on giving equal justice to all men, and
discovered that very often that axiom covered a multitude of sins of
injustice against all womankind.It was through Elsie’s professional life that she learnt to know how
often the law was against the woman’s best interests, and it was always
in connection with some reform that she longed to initiate, that she
expressed a desire for the Vote._To her Father_

      ‘GLASGOW, 1891.‘Many thanks for your letter about women’s rights.You are ahead of
 all the world in everything, and they gradually come up into line with
 you--the Westminster Confession and everything except Home Rule!The
 amusing thing about women preaching is that they do it, but as it is
 not in the churches it is not supposed to be in opposition to Paul.They are having lots of meetings in the hall downstairs; every single
 one of them is addressed by a woman.But, of course, they could not
 give the same address in a church and with men listening!At Queen
 Margaret’s here, they are having a course of lectures on the Old
 Testament from the lecturer on that subject in the University, but
 then, of course it is not “Divinity.”’

The opponents to Woman’s Franchise admittedly occupied an illogical
position, and Elsie’s abounding sense of humour never failed to make
use of all the opportunities of laughter which the many absurdities of
the long fight evoked.No one with that sense as highly developed could
ever turn cynical or bitter.It was only when cruelty and injustice
came under her ken that a fine scorn dominated her thought and speech.She gives to her father some of these instances:--

 ‘I got a paper to sign to thank the M.P.’s who voted for Sir A.
 Rollitt’s Woman’s Suffrage Bill.I got it filled up in half a minute.There is no question among women
 who have to work for themselves about wanting the suffrage.It is the
 women who are safe and sound in their own drawing-rooms who don’t see
 what on earth they want it for.A.
 took down her case, and thought she would have to have an operation.Then her husband arrived, and calmly said she was to go home, because
 he could not look after the children.So I said that if she went she
 went on her own responsibility, for I would not give my consent.I said, “Well, take it to a hospital.” Then it
 turned out it was not ill, but had cried last night.I said I saw very
 well what it was, that he had had a bad night, and had just determined
 that his wife should have the bad night to-night, even though she was
 ill, instead of him.He did look ashamed of himself, selfish cad!Helpless creature, he could not even arrange for some one to come in
 and take charge of those children unless his wife went home to do it.She had got some one yesterday, but he had had a row with her.I gave
 him my mind pretty clearly, but I went in just now to find she had
 gone.So one woman said, “It was not ’er fault,
 Miss; ’e would have it.”

 ‘I wonder when married women will learn they have any other duty
 in the world than to obey their husbands.They were not even her
 children--they were step-children.You don’t know what trouble we
 have here with the husbands.They will come in the day before the
 operation, after the woman has been screwed up to it, and worry them
 with all sorts of outside things, and want them home when they are
 half dying.Any idea that anybody is to be thought of but themselves
 never enters their lordly minds, and the worst of it is these stupid
 idiots of women don’t seem to think so either: “’E wants it, Miss,”
 settles the question.I always say--“It does not matter one fig what
 he wants.The question is what you want.” They don’t seem to think
 they have any right to any individual existence.Well, I feel better
 now, but I wish I could have scragged that beast.I have to go to the
 wards now!‘We had another row with a tyrannical husband.I did not know whether
 to be most angry with him or his fool of a wife.She had one of the
 most painful things anybody can have, an abscess in her breast.It was
 so bad Miss Webb would not do anything for it in the out-patients’,
 but said she was to come in at once.The woman said she would go and
 arrange for somebody to look after her baby and come back at six.“_I_ cannot let my wife come in,
 as the baby is not old enough to be left with anybody else.” Did you
 ever hear anything so monstrous?That one human being is to settle
 for another human being whether she is to be cured or not.I asked
 him whether he knew how painful it was, and if he had to bear the
 pain.Miss Webb appealed to him, that he _was_ responsible for his
 wife’s health, for he seemed to assume he was not.Both grounds were
 far above his intellect, either his responsibility or his wife’s
 rights.He just stood there like an obstinate mule.We told him it
 was positively brutal, and that he was to go _at once_ and get a good
 doctor home with him if he would not let her in.‘What a fool the woman must have been to have educated him up to that.There really was no necessity for her to stay out because he said she
 was to--poor thing.Miss Webb and I have struck up a great friendship
 as the result.After we had both fumed about for some time, I said,
 “Well, the only way to educate that kind of man, or that kind of
 woman, is to get the franchise.” Miss Webb said, “Bravo, bravo,” then
 I found she was a great franchise woman, and has been having terrible
 difficulties with her L.W.A.here.’

The writer may add one more to these instances.Suffrage meetings
were of a necessity much alike, and the round of argument was much
the same.Spade-work had to be done among men and women who had the
mental outlook of these patients and the overlords of their destiny.Meetings were rarely enthusiastic or crowded, and it was often like
speaking into the heart of a pincushion.Inglis came by train straight from her practice.In memory’s halls all
meetings are alike, but one stands out, where Dr.Inglis illustrated
her argument by a fact in her day’s experience.The law does not permit
an operation on a married woman without her husband’s consent.That day
the consent had been refused, and the woman was to be left to lingering
suffering from which only death could release her.The voice and the
thrill which pervaded speaker and audience as Dr.Inglis told the tale
and pointed the moral, remains an abiding memory.Her politics were Liberal, and, what was more remarkable, she was
a convinced Home Ruler.Those who believe that women in politics
naturally take the line of the home, may find here a very strong
instance of the independent mind, producing no rift within the lute
that sounded such a perfect note of unison between her and the
prevailing influence of her youth.Inglis had done his work in
India, and his politics were of an Imperialist rather than that of a
‘Home Ruler All Round.’ When Mr.Gladstone introduced his Home Rule
Bill of 1893, Elsie complains of the obstructive talk in Parliament.Inglis gently says she seems to wish it passed without discussion.Elsie replies on the points she thinks salient and likely to work, and
wonders why they should not commend themselves to sense and not words.The family have recollections of long and not acrimonious debates well
sustained on either side.She was a member of the W.L.F., and was always impatient of the way
Party was placed before the Franchise.‘I was sorry to see how the Suffrage question was pushed into the
 background by Lady Aberdeen.However, I shall stick to the Federation,
 and bring them to their senses on that point as far as my influence
 goes.It is simply sham Liberalism that will not recognise that it is
 a real Liberal question (1893).‘That is a capital letter of Miss M‘Laren’s.It is quite true, and
 women are awful fools to truckle to their party, instead of putting
 their foot down, about the Franchise.You would certainly hear more
 about wife murders than you do at present, if the women had a vote.‘Do you know what they said at the Liberal Club the other day in
 answer to some deputation, or appeal, or rather it was said, in the
 discussion, that the Liberal Party would do all they could to remedy
 abuses and give women justice, but the vote they would not give,
 because they would put a power into women’s hand which could never be
 taken away.‘Did I tell you that I have to speak at a drawing-room meeting on
 Woman’s Suffrage?I had just refused to write
 a paper for her on the present state of medical education in the
 country, for I thought that would be too great cheek in a house
 surgeon, so I did not like to refuse the other.‘The drawing-room meeting yesterday was very good.I got there late,
 and found a fearfully and awfully fashionable audience being harangued
 by a very smart-looking man, who spoke uncommonly well, and was saying
 everything I meant to say.Elmy smiled and nodded away to me, and suddenly it flashed on
 me that I was to second the motion this man was speaking to.I was
 in such an awful funk that I got cool, and got up and told them that
 I did not think Mr.Wilkins had left any single thing for me to say;
 however, as things struck people in different ways I should simply
 tell them how it struck me, and then went ahead with what I meant to
 say when I got in.Elmy was quite pleased, and several people
 came up afterwards, and said I had got on all right.Elmy said,
 I had not repeated Mr.He was such a fluent
 speaker, he scared me awfully.’

The decade that saw the controversy of Home Rule for Ireland, was the
first that brought women prominently into political organisations.Many
women’s associations were formed, and the religious aspect as between
Ulster and the South interested many very deeply.Elsie was not a
Liberal-Unionist, and, as she states her case to her father, there is
much that shows that she was thinking the matter out for herself, on
lines which were then fresher than they are to-day.From Glasgow, in 1891, she writes:--

 ‘I have spent a wicked Sunday.I read all the morning, and then went
 up to the Infirmary to bandage with Dr.T. says I am quite
 sure to be plucked, after such worldliness.I have discovered he is
 an Australian from Victoria.D. is an Aberdeen man and a great
 admirer of George Smith.Never mind about
 the agricultural labourer, Papa dear!I am afraid Gladstone’s majority
 won’t be a working one, and we shall have the whole row over again in
 six months.D. says every available voter has been seized by the
 scruff of his neck and made to vote this time.And, six months hence
 there’ll be no fresh light on the situation, and we’ll be where we
 are now.I should not wonder if the whole thing makes us devise some
 plan for one Imperial Parliament and local government for Ireland,
 Scotland, and the Colonies, ending in making the integrity of the
 Empire “and unity of the English speaking race” more apparent than it
 is now, _and_ with the Irish contented and managing their own affairs
 in their own mad way.Gladstone has been so engrossed with his H.R.measure that he
 does not seem to have noticed these other questions that have been
 quickly growing, and he has made two big blunders about Woman’s
 Suffrage and the Labour question.I have no doubt these men are
 talking a lot of nonsense, and are trying for impossibilities, but
 there is a great deal of sense in what they say.It is no good
 shutting our eyes to the facts they bring forward.D., I am very much afraid you would not agree with him.The only point in which he agrees with you is
 that he would make everybody do what he thinks right.Only his ideas
 of right are very different from yours.He believes in an eight-hour
 day, local option, and State-owned mines.His chief amusement at
 present is arguing with me.He generally gets angry, and says, “I
 argue like a woman,” but he always pluckily begins again.He was a
 tradesman, and gave it up because he says you cannot be an honest
 tradesman nowadays.He is studying medicine; the last day I worked
 at “brains” he rampaged about the room arguing about the unearned
 increment.I tell him he must come and argue in Edinburgh--I have not
 time at present.‘I will tell you what I think of the Home Rule Bill to-morrow--that is
 to say, if I have time to read it.It is really a case of officers and
 men here just now.I can’t say “go on” instead of “come on.” I cannot
 order cold spongings and hot fomentations by the dozen and then sit in
 my room and read the newspapers, can I?’

      ‘GLASGOW, _May 1892_.‘What do you think of Lord Salisbury’s speech, inciting to rebellion
 and civil war?Now, don’t think of it as Lord Salisbury and Ulster,
 but think of it as advice given by Mr.Gladstone to the rest of
 Ireland.If you like to take the lead into your own hands and march on
 Dublin; I don’t know that any Government would care to use the forces
 of the Crown against you.You will be quite justified because the
 Government of your country is in the hands of your hereditary foes.There is only one good point in Lord Salisbury’s speech, and that is
 that he does not sham that the Ulster men are Irishmen.He calls them
 a colony from this country.Lord S. must have been feeling desperate
 before he made that speech.’

      ‘_1894_.Chamberlain’s speech was very clever.It was this special
 Home Rule Bill he pulled to pieces, and one could not help feeling
 that that would have been the result whatever the Bill had been, if
 it had been introduced by anybody but Mr.C. His argument seemed to
 be in favour of Imperial Federation, as far as I could make out.I
 have no doubt the Bill can be very much improved in committee, but
 the groundwork of it is all right.The two Houses and the gradual
 giving over of the police and land, when they have had time to find
 their feet.As to the retaining the Irish members in Parliament being
 totally illogical, there is nothing in that; we always make illogical
 things work.I expect he hates the
 Irish Party as much as any man, but he spoke up for them all the
 same.If he had not, I don’t believe Mr.Chamberlain and some of the
 others would have spoken as they did.The Conservative Party was quite
 inclined to laugh at the paid stipendiaries until Mr.‘I have been reading up the Bishop of Chester’s scheme and the Direct
 Veto Bill.It would be very nice to turn
 all the pubs into coffee-houses, but a big company over whom the
 ratepayers have no control would be just as likely to do what would
 pay best, as the tramway companies now, who work their men seventeen
 hours and their horses three, at a stretch.It would be quite a
 different thing to put the pubs under the Town and County Councils.As
 to this Bill it is not to stop people drinking, but simply to shut up
 pubs.A man can still buy his whisky and get drunk in his own house,
 but a community says, “We won’t have the nuisance of a pub at every
 corner,” and I am not sure that they have not that right, just as much
 as the private individual has to get drunk if he chooses.A great
 many men would keep straight if the temptation were not thrown in
 their faces.The system of licences was instituted for the good of the
 public, not the good of the publican.‘The Elections will be three weeks after my exam.Dearest Papa!--There
 is as much chance of Mr.Gladstone being beaten in Midlothian as there
 is of a Conservative majority.’

Another friend writes:--

 ‘I should like to send you a recollection of her in the early
 Nineties.Jessie MacGregor, wrote to my home in
 Rothesay, asking us to put up Dr.Inglis, who was to give an address
 at a Sanitary Congress to be held there.It was, I believe, her first
 public appearance, and she did do well.One woman alone on a platform
 filled with well-known doctors from all parts!Her subject was
 advocating women as sanitary inspectors.She was one of the pioneers
 in that movement also.I can well remember her, a slim little girl in
 black, fearless as ever, doing her part.After she had finished, there
 was a running criticism of her subject.Many against her view, few for
 the cause on which she was speaking.One well-known doctor asked us to picture
 his dear friend Elsie Inglis carrying out a six-foot smallpox patient.‘I think she was the first lady medical to speak at a Congress.It was
 such a pleasure to entertain her, she was so quiet and unobtrusive,
 and yet so humorous.I never met her again, but I could never forget
 her, though we were just like ships that pass in the night.’

One of her Suffrage organisers, Miss Bury, gives a vivid picture of her
work in the Suffrage cause:--

 ‘It was Dr.Elsie Inglis who brought me to Scotland, and sent me to
 organise Suffrage societies in the Highlands.I speak of her as I knew
 her, the best of chiefs, so kind and encouraging and appreciative of
 one’s efforts, even when they were not always crowned with success.I remember saying I was disappointed because the hall was only about
 three-quarters full, and her reply was, “My dear, I was not counting
 the people, I was thinking of the efforts which had brought those who
 were there.”

 ‘Her letters were an inspiration.She gave one the full responsibility
 of one’s position, and always expected the best.Resolutely direct,
 and straightforward in her dealings with me as a subordinate worker,
 she never failed to tell me of any word of appreciation that reached
 her, as she also told me candidly if she heard of any criticism.She had such a big, generous mind, even condescending to give an
 opportunity for argument when there was any difference of opinion, and
 absolutely tolerant and kind when one did not agree with her.‘She was always considerate of one’s health, and insisted that the
 hours laid down for work were not to be exceeded, or, if this was
 unavoidable, that the time must be taken off as soon as possible
 afterwards.She only saw difficulties to conquer them, and I well
 remember in one of her letters from Lazaravatz, she wrote so
 characteristically--“the work is most interesting, bristling with
 difficulties.”

 ‘My happiest recollection is of a visit to the Highlands, to speak at
 some Suffrage meetings I had arranged for her.In the train she was
 always busy writing, in that beautiful clear characteristic hand, like
 herself, triumphing over the jolting of the Highland Railway, as she
 did later in Serbia.In the early morning she had to catch a train at
 Inverness, and we went by motor from Nairn.For once the writing was
 laid aside, and she gave herself up to the enjoyment of the sunrise,
 and the beautiful lights on the Ross-shire hills, as we travelled
 along the shores of the Moray Firth.When the car broke down, out came
 the despatch case again, while the chauffeur and I put on the Stepney.There was no complaining about the lost train, a wire was sent to the
 committee apologising for her absence, and then she immediately turned
 her attention to other business.’

One who first came under her influence as a patient, and became a warm
friend, gives some reminiscences.Her greeting to the elect at the
beginning of the year was, ‘A good new year, and the Vote _this_ year.’

 ‘I remember once, as we descended the steps of St.Giles’ after
 attending a service at which the Edinburgh Town Council was present,
 she spoke joyfully of the time coming when we, the women of Edinburgh
 and of Scotland, would “help to build the New Jerusalem, with the
 weapon ready to our hand--the Vote.”’

The year 1906 brought the Liberals into political power, and with
the great wave of democratic enthusiasm which gave the Government of
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman an enormous majority there came other
expressions of the people’s will.The Franchise for women had hitherto been of academic interest in the
community: a crank, many thought it, like total abstinence or Christian
Science.The claims of women were frequently brought before Parliament
by private members, and if the Bill was not ‘talked out,’ it was talked
round, as one of the best jests of a Parliamentary holiday.The women
who advocated it were treated with tolerance, their public advocacy
was deemed a _tour de force_, and their portraits were always of the
nature of caricatures, except those in _Punch_, where the opponent was
caricatured, and the women immortalised.The Liberal party found its right wing mainly composed of Labour, and
Socialist members were returned to Parliament.From that section of
thought sprang the militant movement, and the whole question of the
enfranchisement of women took on a different aspect.This chapter does not attempt to give a history of the ‘common cause,’
or the reasons for the rapid way it came to the front, and ranked with
Ireland as among the questions which, left unsettled, became a thorn in
the side of any Government that attempted to govern against, or leaving
outside the expressed will of the people.This is no place to examine the causes which, along with the militant
movement, but always separated from them, poured such fresh life and
vigour into the old constitutional and law-abiding effort to procure
the free rights of citizenship for women.The pace quickened to an extent which was bewildering.Where a dozen
meetings a year had been the portion of many speakers, they were
multiplied by the tens and scores.A
fighting fund collected, meetings arranged, debates were held all over
the country and among all classes.A press, which had never written up
the subject while its advocates were law-abiding, tumbled over each
other to advertise every movement of all sections of suffragists.It must be admitted the militants gave them plenty of copy, and the
constitutionalists had an uneasy sense that their stable companions
would kick over the traces in some embarrassing and unexpected way on
every new occasion.Still the tide flowed steadily for the principle,
and those who had its guidance in Parliament and the country had to
use all the strength of the movement in getting it well organised and
carefully worked.Societies were federated, and the greatly growing
numbers co-ordinated into a machine which could bring the best pressure
to bear on Parliament.The well-planned Federation of Scottish
Suffrage Societies owed much to Dr.Inglis’ gift of organisation and
of taking opportunity by the hand.She was Honorary Secretary to the
Scottish Federation, and in those fighting years between 1906 and
1914 she impressed herself much on its policy.In the early years of
her professional life, she used gaily to forecast for herself a large
and paying practice.Her patients never suffered, but she sacrificed
her professional prospects in a large measure for her work for the
Franchise.She gave her time freely, and she raised money at critical
times by parting with what was of value and in her power to give.Perhaps, the writer may here again give her own reminiscences.Inglis was all too rarely social; they met almost
entirely in their suffrage work.Inglis at all was to know
her well.The transparent sincerity and simplicity of her manner left
nothing to be discovered.One felt instinctively she was a comrade
one could ‘go tiger-hunting with,’ and to be in her company was to be
sustained by a true helpmate.Invited
by the elect, and sometimes by the opponents to enjoy hospitality, Dr.Inglis was rarely able to come in time for the baked meats before we
ascended the platform, and uttered our platitudes to rooms often empty
woodyards, stuck about with a remnant of those who would be saved.She
usually met us on the platform, having arrived by the last train, and
obliged to leave by the first.There was always the smile at the last set-back, the ready joke at our
opponents, the subtle sense that she was out to win, the compelling
force of sustained effort that made at least one of her yoke-fellows
ashamed of the faint heart that could never hope to win through.Sometimes we travelled back together; more often we would meet next day
in St.Giles’ after the daily service, and our walk home was always
a cheer.‘Never mind’ the note to discouragement.‘Remember this or
that in our favour; our next move must be in this direction.’ And the
thought was always there (if her unselfconsciousness prevented it being
spoken--as one wishes to-day it had been)--‘The meeting went, because
you were there and set your whole soul on “willing” it through.’

She had no sympathy with militantism.There was no better fighter
with legitimate weapons, but she saw how closely the claim to do wrong
that good might come was related to anarchy, and her sense of true
citizenship was outraged by law-breaking which, to her clear judgment,
could only <DW44> the ultimate triumph of a cause rooted in all that
was just and righteous.She was not confused by any cross-currents
of admiration for individual courage and self-sacrifice, and her one
desire was to see that the Federation was ‘purged’ of all those who
belonged to the forces of disintegration.She had the fruit of her political sagacity, and her fearless pursuit
after integrity in deed and in word.When the moment came when she was
to go to the battle fronts of the world, a succourer of many, she went
in the strength of the Suffrage women of Scotland.They were her shield
and buckler, and their loyal support of her work and its ideals was
her exceeding great reward.Without their organised strength she could
never have called into existence those units and their equipment which
have justly earned the praises of nations allied in arms.With the rise of the militant movement, the whole Suffrage cause
passed through a cloud of opprobrium and almost universal objurgation.Women were all tarred with the same stick, and fell under one
condemnation.It is now of little moment to recall this, except in as
much as it affected Elsie Inglis.The Scottish Suffrage societies, who
gave their organisation and their workers to start the Scottish Women’s
Hospitals, found that the community desired to forget the unpopular
Suffrage, and to remember only the Scottish Hospitals.Inglis was doing were asked to avoid ‘the common cause.’
No one who knew her would consent to deny by implication one of the
deepest mainsprings of her work.The Churches were equally timid in
aught that gave comfort or consolation to those who were loyal to their
Christian social ideal for women.No organised society owes more to the
administrative work of women than does the Christian Church throughout
the world.No body of administrators have been slower to perceive that
women in responsible positions would be a strength to the Church than
have been the clergy of the Church.The writer of _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_
puts into the mouth of the clerical type of that day the argument
that the Old Testament gave an historic basis for the enslavement of
races, and St.The
spirit of Christianity has raised women from a ‘low estate,’ and women
owe everything to the results of Christianity; but the ecclesiastical
mind has never shaken off the belief that they are under a special
curse from the days of Eden, and that St.Paul’s outlook on women
in his day was the last revelation as to their future position in a
jealously-guarded corporation.Which of us, acquainted with the Church
history of our day, but remembers the General Assembly when the women
missionaries were first invited to stand by their fellow-workers and be
addressed by the Moderator on their labours and sufferings in a common
cause?It was a great shock to the fathers and brethren that their sex
should not disqualify them from standing in the Assembly, which would
have more democratic weight in the visible Church on earth if some of
its elected lay members were women serving in the courts of the Church.In this matter and in many others concerning women, the Church is not
yet triumphant over its prejudices bedded in the geological structure
of Genesis.In all periods of the enfranchisement struggle there were individual
clergy who aided women with their warm advocacy and the helpful
direction of thought.Elsie Inglis was a leader of this movement in its
connection with a high Christian ideal of the citizenship of women.Margaret’s, the church of Parliament in
history, to commemorate all her works begun and ended as a member of
Christ’s Church here on earth, it was fitting that Bishop Gore, who had
so consistently upheld the cause, should speak of her work as one who
had helped to win the equality of women in a democratic, self-governing
State.This memoir would utterly fail to reproduce a picture of Dr.Inglis if
it did not emphasise how her spirit was led and disciplined, tempered
and steeled, through this long and fiery trial to the goal of a leading
ideal.The contest trained her for her splendid achievements in
overcoming all obstacles in ministering to the sufferings of nations,
‘rightly struggling to be free.’ Her friend, Miss Wright, says:--

 ‘We did not always agree.Many were the arguments we had with her, but
 she was always willing to understand another point of view and willing
 to allow for difference of opinion.She was very fair-minded and
 reasonable, and deplored the excesses of the militant suffragettes.She was in no sense a man-hater; to her the world was composed of men
 and women, and she thought it a mistake to exalt the one unduly over
 the other.She was never embittered by her struggle for the position
 of women.She loved the fight, and the endeavour, and to arrive at any
 point just meant a fresh setting forward to another further goal.‘From her girlhood onward, her effort was to free and broaden life for
 other women, to make the world a better place to live in.‘I had a letter this week from Annie Wilson, Elsie’s great friend.She says, “It seems to me Elsie’s whole life was full of championship
 of the weak, and she was so strong in maintaining what was right.I remember once saying in connection
 with some work I was going to begin, ‘I wonder if I shall be able,’
 and Elsie saying in her bright way, ‘What man has done man can do.’
 I am so glad that she had the opportunity of showing her great
 administrative capacity, and that her power is known and acknowledged.I cannot tell you what it will be not to have
 her welcome to look forward to when I come home.”

 ‘Elsie had in many respects what is, perhaps wrongly, called a man’s
 mind.She was an Imperialist in the very best sense, and had high
 ideals for her country and people.She was a very womanly woman,
 never affecting mannish ways as a pose.If she seemed a strong-minded
 woman it was because she had strenuous work to do.She was never “a
 lone woman.” She was always one of a family, and in the heart of the
 family.Elsie always had the _lovingest_ appreciation and backing from
 her nearest and dearest, and that a wide and varied circle.So, also,
 she did not need to fight for her position; it has been said of her,
 “Whenever she began to speak her pleasant well-bred accent and manner
 gained her a hearing.” She was ever a fighter, but it was because she
 wanted those out in the cold and darkness to come into the love and
 light which she herself experienced and sought after always more fully.‘We looked forward to more frequent meetings when working days were
 done.Now she has gone forward to the great work beyond:

    ‘“Somewhere, surely, afar
    In the sounding labour home vast
    Of being, is practised that strength--
    Zealous, beneficent, firm.”’




CHAPTER VII

THE PROFESSION AND THE FAITH

    ‘Run the straight race through God’s good grace,
    Lift up thine eyes and seek His face;
    Life with its way before us lies,
    Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.’

    ‘Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.’


Elsie Inglis took up practice in Edinburgh, and worked in a happy
partnership with the late Dr.Jessie MacGregor, until the latter left
Scotland for work in America.When the University of Edinburgh admitted women to the examinations for
degrees in medicine, Dr.Inglis graduated M.B., C.M.From that
date onwards her practice, her political and suffrage work, and the
founding of the Hospice in the High Street of Edinburgh, as a nursing
home and maternity centre staffed by medical women, occupied a life
which grew and strengthened amid so many and varied experiences.Her father’s death deprived her of what had been the very centre and
mainspring of her existence.As she records the story of his passing
on, she says that she cannot imagine life without him, and that he had
been so glad to see her begin her professional career.She was not one
to lose her place in the stream of life from any morbid inaction or
useless repining.She shared the spirit of the race from which she had
sprung, a reaching forward to obtain the prize of life fulfilled with
service, and she had inherited the childlike faith and confidence which
inspired their belief in the Father of Spirits.Elsie lost in her father the one who had made her the centre of his
thoughts and of his most loving watchfulness.From the day that her
home with him was left unto her desolate, she was to become a centre to
many of her father’s wide household, and, even as she had learnt from
him, she became a stay and support to many of his children’s children.The two doctors started practice in Atholl Place, and later on they
moved into 8 Walker Street, an abode which will always be associated
with the name of Dr.M‘Laren says:--

 ‘My impressions of their joint house are all pleasant ones.They got
 on wonderfully together, and in every thing seemed to appreciate one
 another’s good qualities.They were very different, and had in many
 ways a different outlook.I remember Jessie saying once, “Elsie is so
 exceptionally generous in her attitude of mind, it would be difficult
 not to get on with her!” They both held their own opinions on various
 subjects without the difference of opinion really coming between them.Elsie said once about the arrangement, “It has all the advantages of
 marriage without any of its disabilities.” We used always to think
 they did each other worlds of good.I know how I always enjoyed a
 visit to them if it was only for an afternoon or some weeks.There was
 such an air of freedom in the whole house.You did what you liked,
 thought what you liked, without any fear of criticism or of being
 misunderstood.‘I do not know much about her practice, as medicine never interested
 me, but I believe at one time, before the Suffrage work engrossed her
 so much, she was making quite a large income.’

Professionally she suffered under two disabilities: the restricted
opportunities for clinical work in the days when she was studying her
profession, combined with the constant interruptions which the struggle
against the medical obstructionists necessitated; secondly, the
various stages in the political fight incident to obtaining that wider
enfranchisement which aimed at freeing women from all those lesser
disabilities which made them the helots of every recognised profession
and industry.When in the Scottish Women’s Hospitals abroad, Dr.Inglis rapidly
acquired a surgical skill, under the tremendous pressure of work, which
often kept her for days at the operating-table, which showed what a
great surgeon she might have been, given equal advantages in the days
of her peace practice.Inglis lost no opportunity of enlarging her knowledge.She was
a lecturer on Gynecology in the Medical College for Women which had
been started later than Dr.Jex Blake’s school, and was on slightly
broader lines.After she had started practice she went to study German
clinics; she travelled to Vienna, and later on spent two months in
America studying the work and methods of the best surgeons in New York,
Chicago, and Rochester.She advocated, at home and abroad, equal opportunities for work
and study in the laboratories for both men and women students.She
maintained that the lectures for women only were not as good as those
provided for the men, and that the women did not get the opportunity
of thorough laboratory practice before taking their exams.She thus
came into conflict with the University authorities, who refused to
accept women medical students within the University, or to recognise
extra-mural mixed classes in certain subjects.‘With a great price’ she might truly say
she had purchased her freedom, and nothing would turn her aside.If
one avenue was closed, try another.If one Principal was adamant,
his day could not last for ever; prepare the way for his successor.Indomitable, unbeaten, unsoured, Dr.Inglis, with the smiling, fearless
brow, trod the years till the influence of the ‘red planet Mars’ opened
to her and others the gate of opportunity.She had achieved many
things, and was far away from her city and its hard-earned practice
when at length, in 1916, the University, under a new ‘open-minded,
generous-hearted Head,’ opened its doors to women medical students.There were other things, besides her practice, which Dr.Inglis
subordinated in these years to the political enfranchisement of women.It has been shown in a previous chapter how keen were her political
beliefs.She joined the Central Edinburgh Women’s Liberal Association
in its earliest organised years.She acted as Vice-President in it for
sixteen years, and was one of its most active members.Gulland, the Liberal Whip, knew the value of her work, and must
have had reason to respect the order in which she placed her political
creed--first the citizenship of women, then the party organisation.He speaks of her fearless partisanship and aloof attitude towards all
local political difficulties.An obstacle to her was a thing to be
overcome, not to be sat down before.Any one in politics who sees what
is right, and cannot understand any reason why the action should not
be straight, rather than compromising, is a help to party agents at
rare intervals; normally such minds cause anxiety.Her secretary, Miss
Cunningham, says about her place in the Liberal organisation:--

 ‘Not only as a speaker--though as that she was invaluable--but as one
 who mixed freely with all our members, with her sympathy, in fact, her
 enthusiasm for everything affecting the good of women, she won respect
 and liking on every side.It was not until she became convinced that
 she could help forward the great cause for women better by being
 unattached to any party organisation that she severed her connection
 with the Liberal Party.Regretted as that severance was by all, we
 understood her point of view so well that we recognised there was no
 other course open to her.Her firm grasp of and clear insight into
 matters political made her a most valued colleague, especially in
 times of difficulty, when her advice was always to be relied upon.’

In 1901 she was a member of the Women’s Liberal League, a branch of
the W.L.A.which split off at the time of the Boer War, in opposition
to the ‘Little Englanders.’ Dr.Inglis was on its first committee, and
lent her drawing-room for meetings, addressing other meetings on the
Imperialist doctrines born in that war.When that phase of politics
ended, the League became an educational body and worked on social and
factory legislation.Among her other enterprises was the founding of the Muir Hall of
Residence for Women Students at the University.Many came up from the
country, and, like herself in former days in Glasgow, had to find
suitable, and in many cases uncomfortable, lodgings.Principal Muir’s old Indian friendship with Mr.Inglis had been most
helpful in former years, and now Lady Muir and other friends of the
women students started a Residence in George Square for them, and
Miss Robertson was appointed its first warden.Secretary to the Muir Hall till she died, and from its start was a
moving spirit in all that stood for the comfort of the students.She
attended them when they were ill, and was always ready to help them
in their difficulties with her keen, understanding advice.The child
of her love, amid all other works, was her Maternity Hospice.Of this
work Miss Mair, who was indeed ‘a nursing mother’ to so many of the
undertakings of women in the healing profession, writes of Dr.Inglis’
feeling with perfect understanding:--

 ‘To Dr.Inglis’ clear vision, even in her early years of student life,
 there shone through the mists of opposition and misunderstandings a
 future scene in which a welcome recognition would be made of women’s
 services for humanity, and with a strong, glad heart she joined with
 other pioneers in treading “the stony way” that leads to most reforms.Once landed on the firm rock of professional recognition, Dr.Inglis
 set about the philanthropic task of bringing succour and helpful
 advice to mothers and young babies and expectant mothers in the
 crowded homes in and about the High Street.There, with the help of a
 few friends, she founded the useful little Hospice that we trust now
 to see so developed and extended by an appreciative public, that it
 will merit the honoured name “The Dr.Elsie Inglis Memorial Hospice.”

 ‘This little Hospice lay very near the heart of its founder--she loved
 it--and with her always sensitive realisation of the needs of the
 future, she was convinced that this was a bit of work on the right
 lines for recognition in years to come.Some of us can recall the
 kindling eye, the inspiring tones, that gave animation to her whole
 being when talking of her loved Hospice.She saw in it a possible
 future that might effect much, not only for its patients, but for
 generations of medical women.’

With Dr.Elsie one idea always started another, and ‘a felt want’ in
any department of life always meant an instantly conceived scheme of
supplying the need.Those who ‘came after’ sometimes felt a breathless
wonder how ways and means could be found to establish and settle the
new idea which had been evolved from the fertile brain.The Hospice
grew out of the establishment of a nursing home for working women,
where they could be cared for near their own homes.Barbour, a house was secured at a nominal rent in
George Square, and opened in 1901.That sphere of usefulness could be
extended if a maternity home could be started in a poorer district.Thus the Hospice in the High Street was opened in 1904.Inglis
devoted herself to the work.An operating theatre and eight beds
were provided.The midwifery department grew so rapidly that after a
few years the Hospice became a centre, one of five in Scotland, for
training nurses for the C.M.B.Inglis looked forward to a greater future for it in infant welfare
work, and she always justified the device of the site as being close
to where the people lived, and in air to which they were accustomed.Trained district nurses visited the people in their own homes, and
in 1910 there were more cases than nurses to overtake them.In that
year the Hospice was amalgamated with Bruntsfield Hospital; medical,
surgical, and gynecological cases were treated there, while the Hospice
was devoted entirely to maternity and infant welfare cases.Inglis’ ‘vision’ was nearly accomplished when she had a small ward
of five beds for malnutrition cases, a baby clinic, a milk depot,
health centres, and the knowledge that the Hospice has the distinction
of being the only maternity centre run by women in Scotland.This
affords women students opportunities denied to them in other maternity
hospitals.A probationer in that Hospice says:--

 ‘Dr.Inglis’ idea was that everything, as far as possible, should
 be made subservient to the comfort of the patients.This was always
 considered when planning the routine.She disapproved of the system
 prevalent in so many hospitals of rousing the patients out of sleep
 in the small hours of the morning in order to get through the work of
 the wards.She would not have them awakened before 6 A.M., and she
 instituted a cup of tea before anything else was done.To her nurses
 she was very just and appreciative of good work, and, if complaints
 were made against any one, the wrongdoing had to be absolutely proved
 before she would take action.She also insisted on the nurses having
 adequate time off, and that it should not be infringed upon.’

These, in outline, are the interests which filled the years after Dr.Of her work among the people living round
her Hospice, it is best told in the words of those who watched for
her coming, and blessed the sound of her feet on their thresholds.Freely she gave them of her best, and freely they gave her the love and
confidence of their loyal hearts.Inglis’ patient for twenty years, and she had
also attended her mother and grandmother.Of several children one
was called Elsie Maud Inglis, and the child was christened in the
Dean Church by Dr.The whole family seem to have been her charge, for when Mrs.B.’s husband returned from the South African War, Dr.Inglis fought
the War Office for nine months to secure him a set of teeth, and,
needless to say, after taking all the trouble entailed by a War Office
correspondence, she was successful.A son fought in the present war,
and when Dr.Inglis saw the death of a Private B., she sent a telegram
to the War Office to make sure it was not the son of Mrs.B. She would
never take any fees from this family.B. gave her
some feathers he had brought home from Africa.She had them put in a
new hat she had got for a wedding, and came round before she went to
the festival to show them to the donor.Her cheery ways ‘helped them
all,’ and when a child of the family broke its leg, and was not mending
all round in the Infirmary, Dr.Inglis was asked to go and see her, and
the child from then ‘went forrit.’

In another family there was some stomach weakness, and three infants
died.Inglis tried hard to save the life of the third, a little
boy, who was evidently getting no nourishment.So anxious was she,
that she asked a sister who had recently had a baby, to try if she
could nurse the child.This was done, the foster mother going every day
to the house, but they could not save the infant.When the next one
arrived, Dr.Inglis was so determined the child should live, she came
every day, whatever were her engagements, to sterilise the milk.The
child throve under her care, and grew up in health.Another of these patients of her care ‘could not control her feelings’
when speaking of the good physician.It was evident the family had
lost their best friend.Inglis’
kindness to them.She would come round, after she had finished her
other work at night, to bath the baby.When another child was ill, she
told the mother not to open the door even if the King himself wished
to come in.The husband said she was so bright one felt the better
for her visit, ‘though her orders had to be obeyed and no mistake,
and she would tell you off at once if you did not carry them out.’ If
they offered payment, she would say, ‘Now, go and buy a nice chop for
yourself.’

Another family had this story.G.: ‘That woman has done more
for the folk living between Morrison Street and the High Street than
all the ministers in Edinburgh and Scotland itself ever did for any
one.She gave her house, her
property, her practice, her money to help others.’ Mrs.G. fell ill
after the birth of one of her children.Elsie came in one night,
made her a cup of tea and some toast, and, as she failed to get well,
she raised money to keep her in a sanatorium for six months.After she
had been there one child, in charge of a friend, fell ill, and finally
died, Dr.Inglis doing all she could to spare the absent mother and
save the child.When it died, she wrote:--

 ‘MY DEAR MRS.G.,--You will have got the news by now.I cannot tell
 you how sorry I am for you, my dear.But you will believe, won’t you,
 that we all did everything we could for your dear little boy.H. and I saw him three times a day
 between us, and yesterday we saw him four times.When I sent you the
 card I hoped the high temperature was due to his teeth, because his
 pulse seemed good.H. telephoned that she was
 afraid that his pulse was flagging, and he died suddenly about one.G. has just been here; you must get well, my dear, for his sake,
 and for the sake of all the other little children.Poor little Johnnie
 has had a great many troubles in his little life has he not?But he
 is over them all now, dear little man.And the God in whose _safe_
 keeping he is, comfort you, dear Mrs.G.--Ever your sincere friend,

      ‘ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

The caretaker of the dispensary in St.Cuthbert’s Mission in Morrison
Street speaks of Dr.Inglis as the true friend of all who needed her.She gave an hour three mornings in the week, and if she could not
overtake all the cases in the time, she would occasionally come back
later in the day.Another of her patients was the mother of twelve children; six of
them were ‘brought home’ by Dr.She was a friend to them all,
and never minded what trouble she took.If they did not send for her,
wishing to spare her, she scolded them for thinking of herself and not
of their need for her services.All the children loved her, and they
would watch from the window on her dispensary days for her, and she
would wave to them across the street.She would often stop them in
the street to ask after their mother, and even after she had been to
Serbia and returned to Edinburgh, she remembered about them and their
home affairs.She always made them understand that her orders must be
carried out.The eldest girl was washing the floor, and Dr.Inglis told her to
go for some medicine.The girl continued to finish the work she was at.Inglis, ‘don’t you know that when I say a thing I
mean it?’ Another time she had told Mrs.C. to remain in her bed till
she came.C. rose to wash the
dishes.Do not touch another dish.’ And she herself helped Mrs.Later on two of the children got scarlet fever, and Dr.Inglis told the
mother she was proud of her, as, through her care, the infection did
not spread in the family or outside it.The people in Morrison Street showed their gratitude by collecting
a little sum of money to buy an electric lamp to light their doctor
friend up the dark staircase of the house.These were the true mourners
who stood round St.Giles’ with the bairns she had ‘brought home’ on
the day when her earthly presence passed from their sight.These were
they who had fitted her for her strenuous enterprises in the day when
the battle was set in array, and these were the people who knew her
best, and never doubted that when called from their midst she would go
forth strong in that spirit which is given to the weak things of the
earth, and that it would be her part to strengthen the peoples that had
no might.The Little Sisters of the Poor had a dispensary of St.Elsie had it in her charge from 1903 to 1913, and the Sister Superior
speaks of the affection of the people and the good work done among them.‘“How often,” writes one in charge of the servant department of the
 Y.W.C.A., “her deliberate tread has brought confidence to me when
 getting heartless over some of these poor creatures who would not
 rouse themselves, judging the world was against them.Many a time
 the patient fighting with circumstances needed a sisterly word of
 cheer which Dr.Inglis supplied, and sent the individual heartened
 and refreshed.The expression on her face, _I mean business_, had
 a wonderful uplift, while her acuteness in exactly describing the
 symptoms to those who were in constant contact gave a confidence which
 made her a power amongst us.”’

A patient has allowed some of her written prescriptions to be quoted.They were not of a kind to be made up by a chemist:--

 ‘I want you never to miss or delay meals.I want you to go to bed at
 a reasonable time and go to sleep early.I want you to do your work
 regularly, and to take an interest in outside things--such as your
 church and suffrage.’

 ‘We should not let these Things (with a capital T) affect us so much.Our cause is too righteous for it to be really affected by them--if we
 don’t weaken.’

 ‘My dear, the potter’s wheel isn’t a pleasant instrument.’

 ‘Go home and say your prayers.’

 ‘Realise what you are, a free born child of the Universe.Perfection
 your Polar Star.’

These stories of her healing of mind and body might be endlessly
multiplied.Sorrow and disease are much the same whether they come to
the rich or the poor, and poverty is not always the worst trial of
many a sad tale.Elsie’s power of sympathy and understanding was
as much called upon in her paying practice as among the very poor.She
made no distinction in what she gave; her friendship was as ready as
her trained skill.There was one patient whose sufferings were largely
due to her own lack of will power.Elsie, after prescribing, bent down
and kissed her.It awoke in the individual the sense that she was not
‘altogether bad,’ and from that day forward there was a newness of life.From what sources of inner strength did she increasingly minister
in that sphere in which she moved?‘Thy touch has still its ancient
power,’ and no one who knew this unresting, unhasting, well-balanced
life, but felt it had drawn its spiritual strength from the deep wells
of Salvation.In these years the kindred points of heaven and home were always
in the background of her life.Her sisters’ homes were near her in
Edinburgh, and when her brother Ernest died in India, in 1910, his
widow and her three daughters came back to her house.Her friendship
and understanding of all the large circle that called her aunt was a
very beautiful tie.The elder ones were near enough to her own age
to be companions to her from her girlhood.Miss Simson says that she
was more like an elder sister to them when she stayed with the family
on their arrival from Tasmania.‘The next thing I remember about her
was when she went to school in Paris, she promised to bring us home
Paris dolls.She asked us how we wanted them dressed, and when she
returned we each received a beautiful one dressed in the manner chosen.Aunt Elsie was always most careful in the choice of presents for each
individual.One always felt that she had thought of and got something
that she knew you wanted.While on her way to Russia she sent me a
cheque because she had not been able to see anything while at home.She
wrote, “This is to spend on something frivolous that you want, and not
on stockings or anything like that.”’

‘It is not her great gifts that I remember now,’ says another of that
young circle, ‘it is that she was always such a darling.’

These nieces were often the companions of Dr.She
had her own ideas as to how these should be spent.She always had
September as her month of recreation.She used to go away, first of
all, for a fortnight quite alone to some out-of-the-way place, when
not even her letters were sent after her.She would book to a station,
get out, and bicycle round the neighbourhood till she found a place
she liked.She wanted scenery and housing accommodation according to
her mind.Her first requirement was hot water for ‘baths.’ If that was
found in abundance she was suited; if it could not be requisitioned,
she went elsewhere.Her paintbox went with her, and when she returned
to rejoin or fetch away her family she brought many impressions of what
she had seen.The holidays were restful because always well planned.She loved enjoyment and happiness, and she sought them in the spirit
of real relaxation and recreation.If weather or circumstances turned
out adverse, she was amused in finding some way out, and if nothing
else could be done she had a power of seeing the ludicrous under all
conditions, which in itself turned the rain-clouds of life into bursts
of sunlight.Inglis gives a happy picture of the life in 8 Walker Street, when
she was the guest of Dr.Her love for the three nieces, the one
in particular who bore her name, and in whose medical education she
deeply interested herself, was great.She used to return from a long day’s work, often late, but with a mind
at leisure from itself for the talk of the young people.However late
she was, a hot bath preluded a dinner-party full of fun and laughter,
the account of all the day’s doings, and then a game of bridge or some
other amusement.Often she would be anxious over some case, but she
used to say, ‘I have done all I know, I can only sleep over it,’ and
to bed and to sleep she went, always using her will-power to do what
was best in the situation.Those who were with her in the ‘retreats’
in Serbia or Russia saw the same quality of self-command.If transport
broke down, then the interval had better be used for rest, in the best
fashion in which it could be obtained.Her Sundays, as far as her profession permitted, were days of rest and
social intercourse with her family and friends.After evening church
she went always to supper in the Simson family, often detained late by
pacings to and fro with her friends, Dr.Wallace Williamson,
engaged in some outpouring of the vital interests which were absorbing
her.One of the members of her household says:--

 ‘We all used to look forward to hearing all her doings in the past
 week, and of all that lay before her in the next.Sunday evening felt
 quite wrong and flat when she was called out to a case and could not
 come to us.Her visit in
 September was the best bit of the holidays to us.She laid herself out
 to be with us in our bathing and golfing and picnics.’

The house was ‘well run.’ Those who know what is the highest meaning
of service, have always good servants, and Dr.Her cooks were all engaged under one stipulation, ‘Hot
water for any number of baths at any time of the day or night,’ and
the hot water never failed under the most exacting conditions.Her
guests were made very comfortable, and there was only one rigid rule
in the house.However late she came downstairs after any night-work,
there was always family prayers before breakfast.The book she used
was _Euchologion_, and when in Russia asked that a copy should be
sent her.Her consulting-room was lined with bookshelves containing
all her father’s books, and of these she never lost sight.Any guest
might borrow anything else in her house and forget to return it, but if
ever one of those books were borrowed, it had to be returned, for the
quest after it was pertinacious.In her dress she became increasingly
particular, but only as the adornment, not of herself, but of the cause
of women as citizens or as doctors.When a uniform became part of her
equipment for work, she must have welcomed it with great enthusiasm.It
is in the hodden grey with the tartan shoulder straps, and the thistles
of Scotland that she will be clothed upon, in the memory of most of
those who recall her presence.It is difficult to write of the things that belong to the Spirit,
and Dr.Elsie’s own reserve on these matters was not often broken.She had been reared in a God-fearing household, and surrounded from
her earliest years with the atmosphere of an intensely devout home.That she tried all things, and approved them to her own conscience,
was natural to her character.Certain doctrines and formulas found no
acceptance with her.Man was created in God’s image, and the Almighty
did not desire that His creatures should despise or underrate the work
of His Hand.The attitude of regarding the world as a desert, and human
beings as miserable sinners incapable of rendering the highest service,
never commended itself to her eminently just mind.Such difficulties of
belief as she may have experienced in early years lay in the relations
of the created to the Creator of all that is divine in man.Till she
had convinced herself that a reasonable service was asked for and would
be accepted, her mind was not completely at rest.In her correspondence
with her father, both in Glasgow and London, her interest was always
living and vital in the things which belonged to the kingdom of heaven
within.She wandered from church to church in both places.Oblivious
of all distinctions she would take her prayer book and go for ‘music’
to the Episcopal Church, or attend the undenominational meetings
connected with the Y.W.C.A.Often she found herself most interested
in the ministry of the Rev.Hunter, who subsequently left Glasgow
for London.There are many shrewd comments on other ministers, on the
‘Declaratory Acts,’ then agitating the Free Church.She thought the
Westminster Confession should either be accepted or rejected, and that
the position was made no simpler by ‘declarations.’ In London she
attended the English Church almost exclusively, listening to the many
remarkable teachers who in the Nineties occupied the pulpits of the
Anglican Church.It was not till after her father’s death that she came
to rest entirely in the ministry of the Church of Scotland, and found
in the teaching and friendship of Dr.Wallace Williamson that which
gave her the vital faith which inspired her life and work, and carried
her at last triumphantly through the swellings of Jordan.Giles’ lay in the centre of her healing mission, and her
alert active figure was a familiar sight, as the little congregation
gathered for the daily service.When the kirk skailed in the fading
light of the short days, the westering sun on the windows would often
fall on the fair hair and bright face of her whose day had been spent
in ministering work.On these occasions she never talked of her work.If she was joined by a friend, Dr.Elsie waited to see what was the
pressing thought in the mind of her companion, and into that she at
once poured her whole sympathy.Few ever walked west with her to
her home without feeling in an atmosphere of high and chivalrous
enterprise.Thus in an ordered round passed the days and years, drawing
ever nearer to the unknown destiny, when that which was to try the
reins and the hearts of many nations was to come upon the world.When
that storm burst, Elsie Inglis was among those whose lamp was burning,
and whose heart was steadfast and prepared for the things which were
coming on the earth.ELSIE INGLIS, 1916]




CHAPTER VIII

WAR AND THE SCOTTISH WOMEN

    ‘God the all-terrible King, Who ordainest
      Great winds Thy clarion, the lightnings Thy sword,
    Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest,
      Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.God the All-wise, by the fire of Thy chastening
      Earth shall to freedom and truth be restored,
    Through the thick darkness Thy kingdom is hastening,
      Thou wilt give peace in Thy time, O Lord.’


The year of the war coincided with that period in the life of Dr.Inglis when she was fully qualified for the great part she was to play
among the armies of the Allied nations.It is now admitted that this country was unprepared for war, and
incredulous as to the German menace.The services of women have now
attained so high a value in the State that it is difficult to recast
their condition in 1914.In politics there had been a succession of efforts to obtain
their enfranchisement.Each effort had been marked by a stronger
manifestation in their favour in the country, and the growing force
of the movement, coupled with the unrest in Ireland, had kept all
political organisations in a high state of tension.It has been shown how fully organised were all the Women Suffrage
societies.Committees, organisers, adherents, and speakers were at
work, and in the highest state of efficiency.Women linked by a common
cause had learnt how to work together.The best brains in their midst
were put at the service of the Suffrage, and they had watched in the
political arena where to expect support, and who could be trusted among
the leaders of all parties.No shrewder or more experienced body of
politicians were to be found in the country than those women drawn from
all classes, in all social, professional, and industrial spheres, who
acknowledged Mrs.Fawcett as their leader, and trusted no one party,
sect, or politician in the year 1914.When the war caused a truce to be pronounced in all questions of acute
political difference, the unenfranchised people realised that this
might mean the failure of their hopes for an indefinite time.They
never foresaw that, for the second time within a century, emancipation
was to be bought by the life blood of a generation.The truce made no difference to any section of the Suffrage party.War found both men and women
unprepared, but the path of glory was clear for the men.A great army
must be formed in defence of national liberty.It would have been well had the strength of the women been mobilised in
the same hour.Their long claim for the rights of citizenship made them
keenly alive and responsive to the call of national service.War and its consequences had for many years been uppermost in their
thoughts.In the struggle for emancipation, the great argument they
had had to face among the rapidly decreasing anti-party, was the one
that women could take no part in war, and, as all Government rested
ultimately on brute force, women could not fight, and therefore must
not vote.In countering this outlook, women had watched what war meant all over
the world, wherever it took place.With the use of scientific weapons
of destruction, with the development of scientific methods of healing,
with all that went to the maintenance of armies in the field, and the
support of populations at home, women had some vision in what manner
they would be needed if war ever came to this country.The misfortune of such a controversy as that of the ‘Rights of Women’
is that it necessarily means the opposition has to prove a negative
proposition--a most sterilising process.Political parties were so
anxious to prove that women were incapable of citizenship, that the
whole community got into a pernicious habit of mind.Women were
underrated in every sphere of industry or scientific knowledge.Their
sense of incapacity and irresponsibility was encouraged, and when they
turned militant under such treatment, they were only voted a nuisance
which it was impossible to totally exterminate.Those who watched the gathering war clouds, and the decline of their
Parliamentary hopes, did not realise that, in the overruling providence
of God, the devastating war among nations was to open a new era for
women.They were no longer to be held cheap, as irresponsibles--mere
clogs on the machinery of the State.They were to be called on to
take the place of men who were dying by the thousand for their homes,
fighting against the doctrine that military force is the only true
Government in a Christian world.After mobilisation, military authorities had to make provision for the
wounded.We can remember the early sensation of seeing buildings raised
for other purposes taken over for hospitals.Since the Crimea, women as
nurses at the base were institutions understood of all men.In the vast
camps which sprang up at the commencement of the war, women modestly
thought they might be usefully employed as cooks.The idea shocked the
War Office till it rocked to its foundations.A few adventurous women
started laundries for officers, and others for the men.They did it on
their own, and in peril of their beneficent soap suds, being ordered to
a region where they would be out of sight, and out of any seasonable
service, to the vermin-ridden camps.The Suffrage organisations, staffed and equipped with able practical
women Jacks of all trades, in their midst, put themselves at the call
of national service, but were headed back from all enterprises.It
had been ordained that women could not fight, and therefore they were
of no use in war time.A few persisted in trying to find openings for
service.It is one thing to offer to be
useful without any particular qualification; it is another to have
professional knowledge to give, and the medical women were strong in
the conviction that they had their hard-won science and skill to offer.Those who have read the preceding pages will realise that Dr.Inglis
carried into this offer a perfect knowledge how women doctors were
regarded by the community, and she knew political departments too well
to believe that the War Office would have a more enlightened outlook.In the past she had said in choosing her profession that she liked
‘pioneer work,’ and she was to be the pioneer woman doctor who, with
the aid of Suffrage societies, founded and led the Scottish Women’s
Hospitals to the healing of many races.Inglis to this point, it is easy
to imagine the working of her fertile brain, and her sense of vital
energy, in the opening weeks of the war.What material for instant
action she had at hand, she used.She had helped to form a detachment
of the V.A.D.when the idea of this once despised and now greatly
desired body began to take shape.Before the war men spoke slightingly
of its object, and it was much depreciated.Inglis saw all the
possibilities which lay in the voluntary aid offer.Inglis was in
Edinburgh at the commencement of the war, and the 6th Edinburgh V.A.D.,
of which she was commandant, was at once mobilised.For several weeks
she worked hard at their training.She gave up the principal rooms in
her house for a depot for the outfit of Cargilfield as an auxiliary
hospital.Inglis
put in charge of it, the wider work of her life might never have had
its fulfilment.Inglis from the first advocated that the V.A.D.should be used as probationers in military hospitals, and the orderlies
who served in her units were chiefly drawn from this body.In September she went to London to put her views before the National
Union and the War Office, and to offer the services of herself
and women colleagues.Miss Mair expresses the thoughts which were
dominating her mind.‘To her it seemed wicked that women with power
to wield the surgeon’s knife in the mitigation of suffering and with
knowledge to diagnose and cure, should be withheld from serving the
sick and wounded.’

Her love for the wounded and suffering gave her a clear vision as
to what lay before the armies of the Allies.‘At the root of all her
strenuous work of the last three years,’ says her sister, ‘was the
impelling force of her sympathy with the wounded men.This feeling
amounted at times to almost agony.Only once did she allow herself to
show this innermost feeling.This was at the root of her passionate
yearning to get with her unit to Mesopotamia during the early months
of 1916.“I cannot bear to think of them, _our Boys_.” To the woman’s
heart within her the wounded men of all nations made the same
irresistible appeal.’

In that spirit she approached a departmental chief.Official reserve at
last gave way, and the historic sentence was uttered--‘My good lady, go
home and sit still.’ In that utterance lay the germ of that inspiration
which was to carry the Red Cross and the Scottish women among many
nations, kindreds, and tongues.The overworked red-tape-bound
official: the little figure of the woman with the smile, and the ready
answer, before him.There is a story that, while a town in Serbia was
under bombardment, Dr.Inglis was also in it with some of her hospital
work.She sought an official in his quarters, as she desired certain
things for her hospital.The noise of the firing was loud, and shells
were flying around.Inglis seemed oblivious of any sound save her
own voice, and she requested of an under officer an interview with his
chief.The official had at last to confess that his superior was hiding
in the cellar till the calamity of shell-fire was overpast.In much
the same condition was the local War Office official when confronted
with Dr.No doubt she saw it was
useless to continue her offers of service.Fawcett says:

 ‘Nearly all the memorial notices of her have recorded the fact that at
 the beginning of her work in 1914 the War Office refused her official
 recognition.The recognition so stupidly refused by her own country
 was joyfully and gratefully given by the French and later the Serbian
 A.M.S.and Red Cross.’

She went home to her family, who so often had inspired her to good
work, and as she sat and talked over the war and her plans with one of
her nieces, she suddenly said, ‘I know what we will do!We will have a
unit of our own.’

The ‘We’ referred to that close-knit body of women with whom she had
worked for a common cause, and she knew at once that ‘We’ would work
with her and in her for the accomplishment of this ideal which so
rapidly took shape in her teeming brain.She was never left alone in any part of her life’s work.Her
personality knit not only her family to her in the closest bonds of
love, but she had devoted friends among those who did not see eye
to eye with her in the common cause.She never loved them the less
for disagreeing with her, and though their indifference to her views
might at times obscure her belief in their mental calibre, it never
interfered with the mutual affections of all.She did not leave these
friends out of her scheme when it began to take shape.The Edinburgh Suffrage offices, no longer needed for propaganda and
organisation work, became the headquarters of the Scottish Women’s
Hospitals, and the enlarged committee, chiefly of Dr.Inglis’ personal
friends, began its work under the steam-hammer of her energy.‘Well do I recall the first suggestion that passed between us on the
 subject of directing the energies of our Suffrage Societies to the
 starting of a hospital.Let us gather a few hundred pounds, and then
 appeal to the public, was the decision of our ever courageous Dr.Elsie, and from that moment she never swerved in her purpose.Some of
 us gasped when she announced that the sum of £50,000 must speedily
 be advertised for.Some timid souls advised the naming of a smaller
 amount as our goal.With unerring perception, our leader refused to
 lower the standard, and abundantly has she been proved right!Not
 £50,000, but over £200,000 have rewarded her faith and her hope.‘This quick perception was one of the greatest of her gifts, and it
 was with perfect simplicity she stated to me once that when on rare
 occasions she had yielded her own conviction to pressure from others,
 the result had been unfortunate.There was not an ounce of vanity in
 her composition.She saw the object aimed at, and she marched
 straight on.If, on the road, some obstacles had to be not exactly
 ruthlessly, but very firmly brushed aside, her strength of purpose
 was in the end a blessing to all concerned.Strength combined with
 sweetness--with a wholesome dash of humour thrown in--in my mind sums
 up her character.What that strength did for agonised Serbia only the
 grateful Serbs can fully tell.’

A letter written in October of this year to Mrs.Fawcett tells of the
rapid formation of the hospital idea.‘8 WALKER STREET,
      ‘_Oct.FAWCETT,--I wrote to you from the office this morning,
 but I want to point out a little more fully what the Committee felt
 about the name of the hospitals.We felt that our original scheme
 was growing very quickly into something very big--much bigger than
 anything we had thought of at the beginning--and we felt that if the
 hospitals were called by a non-committal name it would be much easier
 to get all men and women to help.The scheme is _of course_ a National
 Union scheme, and that fact the Scottish Federation will never lose
 sight of, or attempt to disguise.The National Union will be at the
 head of all our appeals, and press notices, and paper.‘But--if you could reverse the position, and imagine for a moment
 that the Anti-Suffrage Society had thought of organising all these
 skilled women for service, you can quite see that many more neutrals,
 and a great many suffragists would have been ready to help if they
 sent their subscriptions to the “Scottish Women’s Hospital for Foreign
 Service,” than if they had to send to the Anti-Suffrage League
 Hospital.‘We were convinced that the more women we could get to help, the
 greater would be the gain to the woman’s movement.‘For we have hit upon a really splendid scheme.Laurie and
 I went to see Sir George Beatson--the head of the Scottish Red Cross,
 in Glasgow--he said at once: “Our War Office will have nothing to say
 to you,” and then he added, “yet there is no knowing what they may do
 before the end of the war.”

 ‘You see, we get these expert women doctors, nurses, and ambulance
 workers organised.Once
 these units are out, the work is bound to grow.The need is there,
 and too terrible to allow any haggling about who does the work.If
 we have a thoroughly good organisation here, we can send out more
 and more units, or strengthen those already out.We can add motor
 ambulances, organise rest stations on the lines of communication, and
 so on.It will all depend on how well we are supplied with funds and
 brains at our base.Each unit ought to be carefully chosen, and the
 very best women doctors must go out with them.I wrote this morning to
 the Registered Medical Women’s Association in London, and asked them
 to help us, and offered to address a meeting when I come up for your
 meeting.Next week a special meeting of the Scottish Medical Women’s
 Association is being called to discuss the question.‘From the very beginning we must make it clear that our hospitals are
 as well-equipped and well-manned as any in the field, more economical
 (easy!‘I cannot think of anything more calculated to bring home to men the
 fact that women _can help_ intelligently in any kind of work.So much
 of our work is done where they cannot see it.They’ll see every bit of
 this.‘The fates seem to be fighting for us!Sometimes schemes do float off
 with the most extraordinary ease.The Belgian Consul here is Professor
 Sarolea--the editor of _Everyman_.He grasped at the help we offered,
 and has written off to several influential people.And then yesterday
 morning he wrote saying that his brother Dr.Leon Sarolea, would come
 and “work under” us.He is an M.P., a man of considerable influence.So you can see the Belgian Hospital will have everything in its favour.Seton Watson, who has devoted his life to the Balkan States,
 has taken up the Servian Unit.He puts himself “entirely at our
 service.” He knows all the powers that be in Servia.‘Two people in the Press have offered to help.It must not be wasted, but we must have
 lots.‘And as the work grows do let’s keep it _together_, so that, however
 many hospitals we send out, they all shall be run on the same lines,
 and wherever people see the Union Jack with the red, white and green
 flag below it, they’ll know it means efficiency and kindness and
 intelligence.‘I wanted the Executive, for this reason, to call the hospitals
 “British Women’s Hospitals for Foreign Service,” but of course it was
 their own idea, and one understood the desire to call it “Scottish”;
 but if there is a splendid response from England and from other
 federations, that will have to be reconsidered, _I_ think.The great
 thing is to do the thing well, and do it as _one_ scheme.‘I do hope you’ll approve of all this.I am marking this letter
 “Private,” because it isn’t an official letter, but just what I
 think--to you, my Chief.But you can show it to anybody you like--as
 that.‘I can think of nothing except these “Units” just now!And when one
 hears of the awful need, one can hardly sit still till they are ready.Professor Sarolea simply made one’s heart bleed.He said, “You talk of distress from the war here.You simply
 know nothing about it.”--Ever yours sincerely,

      ‘ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

In October 1914 the scheme was finally adopted by the Scottish
Federation, and the name of Scottish Women’s Hospitals was chosen.At the same meeting the committee decided to send Dr.Inglis to London
to explain the plan to the National Union, and to speak at a meeting
in the Kingsway Hall, on ‘What women could do to help in the war.’ At
that meeting she was authorised to speak on the plans of the S.W.H.The N.U.W.S.S.adopted the plan of campaign on 15th October, and the
London society was soon taking up the work of procuring money to start
new units, and to send Dr.Inglis out on her last enterprise, with a
unit fully equipped to work with the Serbian army, then fighting on the
Bulgarian front.The use she made of individuals is well illustrated by Miss Burke.She
was ‘found’ by Dr.Inglis in the office of the London Society, and sent
forth to speak and fill the Treasury chest of the S.W.H.It is written
in the records of that work how wonderfully Miss Burke influenced her
countrymen in America, and how nobly, through her efforts, they have
aided ‘the great adventure.’

      ‘U.S.M.S.Paul_,
      ‘_Saturday, February 9th_.‘DEAR LADY FRANCES,--Certainly I am one of Dr.It
 was largely due to her intuition and clear judgment of character that
 my feet were placed in the path which led to my reaching my maximum
 efficiency as a hospital worker and a member of the Scottish Women’s
 Hospitals.Elsie after I had been the Secretary of the
 London Committee for about a month.There was no question of meeting a
 “stranger”; her kindly eyes smiled straight into mine.Well, the best way to encourage me was to
 give me responsibility.‘“Do you speak French?”

 ‘“Yes.”

 ‘“Very well, go and write me a letter to General de Torcy, telling him
 we accept the building he has offered at Troyes.”

 ‘Some one hazarded the suggestion that the letter should be passed on.‘“Nonsense,” replied Dr.Elsie, “I know the type.If she says she speaks French, she does.”

 ‘She practically signed the letter I wrote her without reading it.Doubtless all the time I was with her I was under her keen scrutiny,
 and when finally, after arranging a meeting for her at Oxford, which
 she found impossible to take, owing to her sudden decision to leave
 for Serbia, she had already judged me, and without hesitation she told
 me to go to Oxford and speak myself.I have wondered often whether any
 one else would have sent a young and unknown speaker--it needed Dr.Elsie’s knowledge of human character and rapid energetic method of
 making decisions.‘It would be difficult for we young ones of the Scottish Women’s
 Hospitals to analyse our feelings towards Dr.A wave of her
 hand in passing meant much to us.’

Space utterly forbids our following the fortunes of the Scottish
Women’s Hospitals as they went forth one by one to France, to Belgium,
to Serbia, to Corsica, and Russia.That history will have some day to
be written.It is only possible in this memoir to speak of their work
in relation to their founder and leader.‘Not I, but my unit,’ was
her dying watchword, and when the work of her unit is reviewed, it is
obvious how they carried with them, as an oriflamme, the inspiration of
unselfish devotion set them by Dr.Besides going into all the detailed work of the hospital equipment, Dr.Inglis found time to continue her work of speaking for the cause of the
hospitals.We find her addressing her old friends:

 ‘I have the happiest recollection of Dr.I. addressing a small meeting
 of the W. L. Association here.It was one of her first meetings to
 raise money.She told us how she wanted to go to Serbia.She was so
 convincing, but with all my faith in her, I never thought she _would_
 get there!That, and much more she did--a lesson in faith.‘She looked round the little gathering in the Good Templar Hall and
 said, “I suppose nobody here could lend me a yacht?” She did get her
 ship there.’

To one of her workers in this time, she said, ‘My dear, we shall live
all our lives in the shadow of war.’ The one to whom she spoke says, ‘A
cold chill struck my heart.Did she feel it, and know that never again
would things be as they were?’

At the close of 1914 Dr.Inglis went to France to see the Scottish
Women’s Hospital established and working under the French Red Cross at
Royaumont.It was probably on her way back that she went to Paris on
business connected with Royaumont.She went into Notre Dame, and chose
a seat in a part of the cathedral where she could feel alone.She there
had an experience which she afterwards told to Mrs.As she
sat there she had a strong feeling that some one was behind her.She
resisted the impulse to turn round, thinking it was some one who like
herself wanted to be quiet!The feeling grew so strong at last, that
she involuntarily turned round.There was no one near her, but for the
first time she realised she was sitting in front of a statue of Joan of
Arc.To her it appeared as if the statue was instinct with life.She
added: ‘Wasn’t it curious?’ Then later she said, ‘I would like to know
what Joan was wanting to say to me!’ I often think of the natural way
which she told me of the experience, and the _practical_ conclusion
of wishing to know what Joan wanted.Once again she referred to the
incident, before going to Russia.I see her expression now, just for a
moment forgetting everything else, keen, concentrated, and her humorous
smile, as she said, ‘You know I would like awfully to know what Joan
was trying to say to me.’

Elsie Inglis was not the first, nor will she be the last woman who has
found help in the story of the Maid of Orleans, when the causes dear to
the hearts of nations are at stake.It is easy to hear the words that
would pass between these two leaders in the time of their country’s
warfare.The graven figure of Joan was instinct with life, from the
undying love of race and country, which flowed back to her from the
woman who was as ready to dedicate to her country her self-forgetting
devotion, as Jeanne d’Arc had been in her day.Both, in their day and
generation, had heard--

    ‘The quick alarming drum--
    Saying, Come,
    Freemen, come,
    Ere your heritage be wasted, said the quick alarming drum.’

      ‘ABBAYE DE ROYAUMONT,
      ‘_Dec.‘DEAREST AMY,--Many, many happy Christmases to you, dear, and to
 all the others.Everything is splendid here now, and if the General
 from headquarters would only come and inspect us, we could begin.I only wish you could see them with their
 red bedcovers, and little tables.There are four wards, and we have
 called them Blanche of Castille (the woman who really started the
 building of this place, the mother of Louis IX., the Founder, as he
 is called), Queen Margaret of Scotland, Joan of Arc, and Millicent
 Fawcett.Now, don’t you think that is rather nice!The Abbaye itself
 is a wonderful place.It has beautiful architecture, and is placed in
 delightful woods.One wants to spend hours exploring it, instead of
 which we have all been working like galley slaves getting the hospital
 in order.There are
 no thermometers and no sandbags.Yesterday,
 I was told there were no tooth-brushes and no nail-brushes, but they
 appeared.After all the fuss, you can imagine our feelings when the
 “Director,” an official of the French Red Cross, who has to live here
 with us, told us French soldiers don’t want tooth-brushes!‘Our first visitors were three French officers, whom we took for the
 inspecting general, and treated with grovelling deference, till we
 found they knew nothing about it, and were much more interested in the
 tapestry in the proprietor’s house than in our instruments.However,
 they were very nice, and said we were _bien meublé_.‘Once we had all been on tenterhooks all day about the inspection.Suddenly, a man poked his head round the door of the doctor’s
 sitting-room and said, “The General.” In one flash every doctor was
 out of the room and into her bedroom for her uniform coat, and I was
 left sitting.I got up, and wandered downstairs, when an excited
 orderly dashed past, singing, “Nothing but two British officers!”
 Another time we were routed out from breakfast by the cry of “The
 General,” but this time it turned out to be a French regiment, whose
 officers had been moved by curiosity to come round by here.‘We have had to get a new boiler in the kitchen, new taps and
 lavatories, and electric light, an absolute necessity in this huge
 place, and all the theatre sinks.We certainly are no longer a
 _mobile_ hospital, but as we are twelve miles from the point from
 which the wounded are distributed (I am getting very discreet about
 names since a telegram of mine was censored), we shall probably be as
 useful here as anywhere.They even think we may get English Tommies.‘You have no idea of the conditions to which the units came out, and
 they have behaved like perfect bricks.The place was like an ice hole:
 there were no fires, no hot water, no furniture, not even blankets,
 and the equipment did not arrive for five days.They have scrubbed the
 whole place out themselves, as if they were born housemaids; put up
 the beds, stuffed the mattresses, and done everything.They stick at absolutely nothing, and when Madame came,
 she said, “What it is to belong to a practical nation!”

 ‘We had a service in the ward on Sunday.We are going to see if they
 will let us use the little St.There are two other
 chapels, one in use, that we hope the soldiers will go to, and a
 beautiful chapel the same style of architecture as the chapel at Mont
 St.It is a perfect joy to walk through it to meals.The
 village curé has been to tea with us.‘Will you believe it, that General hasn’t arrived _yet_!--Your loving

      ELSIE.’

Mr.Seton Watson has permitted his article in the December number of
the _New Europe_ (1917) to be reprinted here.His complete knowledge
of Serbia enables him to describe both the work and Dr.Inglis who
undertook the great task set before her.‘Elsie Inglis was one of the heroic figures of the war, one whose
 memory her many friends will cherish with pride and confidence--pride
 at having been privileged to work with her, confidence in the race
 which breeds such women.This is not the place to tell the full story
 of her devotion to many a good cause at home, but the _New Europe_
 owes her a debt of special interest and affection.For in her own
 person she stood for that spirit of sympathy and comprehension upon
 which intercourse between the nations must be founded, if the ideal of
 a New Europe is ever to become a reality.‘Though her lifework had hitherto lain in utterly different fields,
 she saw in a flash the needs of a tragic situation; and when war came
 offered all her indomitable spirit and tireless energy to a cause
 till recently unknown and even frowned upon in our country.Like
 the Douglas of old, she flung herself where the battle raged most
 fiercely--always claiming and at last obtaining permission to set up
 her hospitals where the obstacles were greatest and the dangers most
 acute.But absorbed as she was in her noble task of healing, she saw
 beyond it the high national ideal that inspired the Serbs to endure
 sufferings unexampled even in this war, and became an enthusiastic
 convert to the cause of Southern Slav unity.To her, as to all true
 Europeans, the principle of nationality is not, indeed, the end of
 all human wisdom, but the sure foundation upon which a new and saner
 internationalism is to be built, and an inalienable right to which
 great and small alike are entitled.Perhaps the fact that she herself
 came of a small nation which, like Serbia, has known how to celebrate
 its defeats, was not without its share in determining her sympathies.‘The full political meaning of her work has not yet been brought home
 to her countrymen, and yet what she has done will live after her.Her
 achievement in Serbia itself in 1915 was sufficiently remarkable, but
 even that was a mere prelude to her achievement on the Eastern front.The Serbian Division in Southern Russia, which the Scottish Women’s
 Hospitals went out to help, was not Serbian at all in the _ordinary_
 sense of the word.Its proper name is the Jugoslav Division, for
 it was composed entirely of volunteers drawn from among the Serbs,
 Croats, and Slovenes of Austria-Hungary who had been taken prisoners
 by the Russian army.Thousands of these men enrolled themselves on the
 side of the Entente and in the service of Serbia, in order to fight
 for the realisation of Southern Slav independence and unity under the
 national dynasty of Kara George.Beyond the ordinary risks of war
 they acted in full knowledge that capture by the enemy would mean the
 same fate as Austria meted out to the heroic Italian deputy, Cesare
 Battisti; and some of them, left wounded on the battle-field after
 a retreat, shot each other to avoid being taken alive.Throughout
 the Dobrudja campaign they fought with the most desperate gallantry
 against impossible odds, and, owing to inadequate support during the
 retreat, their main body was reduced from 15,000 to 4000.Latterly the
 other divisions had been withdrawn to recruit at Odessa, after sharing
 the defence of the Rumanian southern front.‘To these men in the summer of 1916 Serbia had sent a certain number
 of higher officers, but, for equipment and medical help, they were
 dependent upon what the Russians could spare from their own almost
 unlimited needs.Inglis and her unit came to the
 help of the Jugoslavs, shared their privations and misfortunes, and
 spared no effort in their cause.‘History will record the name of Elsie Inglis, like that of Lady
 Paget, as pre-eminent among that band of women who have redeemed for
 all time the honour of Britain in the Balkans.Among the Serbs it is
 already assuming an almost legendary quality.To us it will serve to
 remind us that Florence Nightingale will never be without successors
 among us.And in particular, every true Scotsman will cherish her
 memory, every believer in the cause for which she gave her life will
 gain fresh courage from her example.R. W. SETON-WATSON.CHAPTER IX

SERBIA

    ‘Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great
    waters, from the hand of strange children.’

    ‘And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.For in those
    days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the
    creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.’

    ‘On either side of the river, was there the tree of life: And the
    leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.’


Dr.Inglis remained at home directing the many operations necessary
to ensure the proper equipment of the units, and the difficult task of
getting them conveyed overseas.From the beginning, till her return
with her unit serving with the Serbian army in Russia, she had the
sustaining co-operation both of the Admiralty and the Foreign Office.In the many complications surrounding the history of the hospitals
with the Allied armies, the Scottish women owed very much to both
Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, and very particularly to Lord
Robert Cecil in his department of the Foreign Office.It was not easy to get the scheme of hospitals staffed entirely by
women, serving abroad with armies fighting the common and unscrupulous
foe, accepted by those in authority.The Foreign Office was responsible
for the safety of these British outpost hospitals, and they knew well
the dangers and privations to which the devoted pioneer band of women
would be exposed.Inglis, which
she accepted, and abided by as long as her work was not hindered.No
care or diplomatic work was spared, and if at the end of their service
in Russia the safety of the unit was a matter of grave anxiety to
the Foreign Office, it had never cause to be ashamed of the way this
country’s honour and good faith was upheld by the hospitals under the
British flag, amid the chaotic sufferings of the Russian people.Eleanor Soltau, who was in charge of the
First Serbian Unit, became ill with diphtheria in the midst of the
typhus epidemic which was devastating the Serbian people.The Serbian
Minister writes of that time:--

 ‘They were the first to go to the help of Serbia when the Austrians,
 after they were defeated, besides 60,000 prisoners, also left behind
 them epidemics in all the districts which they had invaded.The
 Scottish women turned up their sleeves, so to speak, at the railways
 station itself, and went straight to typhus and typhoid-stricken
 patients, who were pitifully dying in the crowded hospitals.’

Colonel Hunter, A.M.S., wrote after her death: ‘It was my privilege
and happiness to see much of her work in Serbia when I was officer in
charge of the corps of R.A.M.C.officers sent out by the W.O.to deal
with the raging epidemic of typhus and famine fevers then devastating
the land.I have never met with any one who gave me so deep an
impression of singlemindedness, gentleheartedness, clear and purposeful
vision, wise judgment, and absolutely fearless disposition.... No more
lovable personality than hers, or more devoted and courageous body of
women, ever set out to help effectively a people in dire distress than
the S.W.H.,’ which she organised and sent out, and afterwards took
personal charge of in Serbia in 1915.Amidst the most trying conditions
she, or they, never faltered in courage or endurance.Under her wise
and gentle leadership difficulties seemed only to stir to further
endeavour, more extended work, and greater endurance of hardship.Captain Ralph Glyn writes from France:--

 ‘I see you went to the funeral of that wonderful person, Dr.I shall never forget arriving where that S.W.unit was in the
 midst of the typhus in Serbia, and finding her and all her people so
 “clean” and obviously ready for anything.’

The Serbian nation lost no time in commemorating her services to them.At Mladenovatz they built a beautiful fountain close to the camp
hospital.On 7th October 1915 it was formally opened with a religious
service according to the rites of the Greek Church.Inglis turned
on the water, which was to flow through the coming years in grateful
memory of the good work done by the Scottish Women’s Hospitals.ELSIE INGLIS

 (Obiit Nov.At Mladenovatz still the fountain sings
      Raised by the Serbs to you their angel friend,
      Who fought the hunger-typhus to its end;
    A nobler fountain from your memory springs,
    A fountain-head where Faith renews its wings
      --Faith in the powers of womanhood to bend
      War’s curse to blessing, and to make amend
    By Love, for Hate’s unutterable things.Wherefore, when cannon-voices cease to roar,
      A louder voice shall echo in our ears
        --Voice of three peoples joined in one accord,
    Telling that, gentle to your brave heart’s core,
      You faced unwavering all that woman fears,
        And clear of vision followed Christ the Lord.[NOTE.--Two years ago the Serbians dedicated a simple fountain in
 ‘Mladenovatz’ to the grateful memory of one they spoke of as ‘the
 angel of their people.’ The Rumanian and Russian refugees in the
 Dobrudja will never forget her.]_The Englishwoman_, April and June 1916, has two articles written by
Dr.Inglis, under the title ‘The Tragedy of Serbia.’ The literary power
of her narrative makes one regret that she did not live to give a
consecutive account of all she passed through in the countries in which
she suffered with the peoples:--

 ‘When we reached Serbia in May 1915, she was lying in sunshine.Two
 storms had raged over her during the preceding months--the Austrian
 invasion and the terrific typhus epidemic.In our safe little island
 we can hardly realise what either meant.At the end of 1914, the
 Austrian Empire hurled its “punitive expedition” across the Danube--a
 punitive expedition that ended in the condign punishment of the
 invader.They left behind them a worse foe than themselves, and the
 typhus, which began in the hospitals they left so scandalously filthy
 and overcrowded, swept over the land.’

Dr.Inglis describes ‘the long peaceful summer,’ with its hopes of
an advance to their aid on the part of the Allies.The Serbs were
conscious the ‘Great Powers’ owed them much, for how often we heard the
words, ‘We are the only one, as yet, who has beaten our enemy.’

‘Not till September did any real sense of danger trouble them.Then the
clouds rolled up black and threatening on the horizon--Bulgaria arming,
and a hundred thousand Germans massing on the northern frontier.They
began to draw off the main part of their army from the Danube towards
the east, to meet their old enemies.The Powers refused to let them
attack, and they waited till the Bulgarian mobilisation was complete.The Allies discounted the attack from the north; aeroplanes had been
out, and “there are no Germans there.” There are no signs whatever of
any military movements, so said the wiseacres.The only troops there
are untrained Austrian levies, which the Serbs ought to be able to deal
with themselves, if they are up to their form last year.The 100,000 Germans appeared on the northern
frontier.The Bulgars invaded from the east, the Greeks did not come
in, and the Austrians poured in from the west.The Serbian army
shortened the enormous line they had to defend, but they could not
stand against the long-distance German guns, and so began the retreat.‘“What is coming to Serbia?” said a Serb to me, “we cannot think.”
And then, hopefully, “But God is great and powerful, and our Allies
are great and powerful too.” Strong men could hardly speak of the
disaster without breaking down.“When
are your men coming up?They must come soon.” “We must give our people
two months,” the experts among us answered, “to bring up the heavy
artillery.We thought the Serbs would be able to hold the West Morava
Valley.” “It is too hilly for the German artillery to be of any use,”
they said.’

Dr.Inglis goes on to relate how all the calculations were wrong, how
the Austrian force came down that very valley.The Serbs were caught
in a trap, and that 160,000 of their gallant little army escaped was
a wonderful feat.‘That they are already keen to take the field again
is but one more proof of the extraordinary recuperative power of the
nation.’

Dr.Elsie gives an account of the typhus epidemic.Soltau, in 1914, was able at Kragujevatz to do excellent
work for the Serbian army after its victories, and it was only
evacuated owing to the retreat in October 1915.The unit had only
been a fortnight out when the committee got from it a telegram, ‘dire
necessity’ for more doctors and nurses.The word _dire_ was used,
hoping it would pass unnoticed by the censor, for the authorities did
not wish the state of Serbia from typhus to be generally known.We
shall never know what the death-rate was during the epidemic; but of
the 425 Serbian doctors, 125 died of the disease, and two-thirds of the
remainder had it.The Scottish Committee hastened out supplies and staff.‘For three months the epidemic raged, and all women may ever be proud
 of the way those women worked.It was like a long-drawn-out battle,
 and not one of them played the coward.Not one of them asked to come
 away.There were three deaths and nine cases of illness among the
 unit; and may we not truly claim that those three women who died gave
 their lives for the great cause for which our country stands to-day as
 much as any man in the trenches.’

Dr.Inglis speaks of the full share of work taken by other British
units--Lady Paget’s Hospital at Skopio, ‘magnificently organised’; The
Red Cross under Dr.Banks ‘took more than its share of the burden’; and
how Dr.Ryan of the American hospital asserted that Serbia would have
been wiped out but for the work of the Foreign Missions.Miss Holme tells of some of her experiences with her leader:--

      ‘KRAGUJEVATZ.Elsie Inglis took me out shopping with her, and we
 wanted a great many things for our hospital in the way of drugs, etc.,
 and we also wanted more than anything else some medical scales for
 weighing drugs.Inglis saw hanging up
 in it three pairs of these scales.So she asked the man, in her most
 persuasive manner, if he would sell her a pair of these scales for our
 hospital use.He explained at length that he used all the scales, and
 was sorry that he could not possibly sell them.Inglis bought
 some more things--in fact, we stayed in the shop for about an hour
 buying things to the amount of £10, and between each of the different
 articles purchased, she would again revert to the scales and say,
 “You know it is for _your_ men that we want them,” until at last the
 man--exhausted by his refusals--took down the scales and presented
 them to her.When she asked “How much are they?” he made a bow, and
 said it would be a pleasure to give them to her.‘When we were taken prisoners, and had been so for some time, and
 before we were liberated, the German Command came bringing a paper
 which they commanded Dr.The purport of the paper was
 a statement which declared that the British prisoners had been well
 treated in the hands of the Germans, and was already signed by two men
 who were heads of other British units.Inglis said, “Why should
 I sign this paper?I do not know if all the prisoners are being well
 treated by you, therefore I decline to sign it.” To which the German
 authorities replied, “You must sign it.” Dr.Inglis then said, “Well,
 make me,” and that was the end of that incident--she never did sign it.‘So convinced were some of the people belonging to the Scottish
 Women’s unit that the British forces were coming to the aid of their
 Serbian ally, that long after they were taken prisoners they thought,
 each time they heard a gun from a different quarter, that their
 liberators were close at hand.So much so indeed, that three of the
 members of the unit begged that in the event of the unit being sent
 home they might be allowed to stay behind in Serbia with the Serbs,
 to help the Serbian Red Cross.Inglis _unofficially_ consented to
 this, and with the help of the Serbian Red Cross these three people in
 question adjourned to a village hard by which was about a mile from
 the hospital, three days before the unit had orders to move.Inglis and three other people of the unit knew where these
 three members were living.However, the date of the departure was
 changed, and the unit was told they were to wait another twenty days.This made it impossible for these three people to appear again with
 the unit.They continued to live at the little house which sheltered
 them.Suddenly one afternoon one of the members of the unit went to
 ask at the German Command if there were any letters for the unit.At
 this interview, which took place about three o’clock in the afternoon,
 the person was informed that the whole unit was to leave that night
 at 7.30.Inglis sent the person who received this command to tell
 the three people in the cottage to get ready, and that they must go,
 she thought.But the messenger only said, “We have had orders that the
 unit is to go at 7.30 to-night,” but did not say that Dr.Inglis had
 sent an order for the three people to get ready, so they did nothing
 but simply went to bed at ten o’clock, thinking the unit had already
 started.It was a wintry night, snowing heavily, and not a night that
 one would have sent out a dog!‘At about half-past ten a knock came to the window, and Dr.Inglis’
 voice was heard saying, “You have to come at once to the train.I
 am here with an armed guard!” (All the rest of the unit had been at
 the station for some hours, but the train was not allowed to start
 until every one was there.)It was
 difficult to get her to enter the house, and naturally she seemed
 rather ruffled, having had to come more than a mile in the deep snow,
 as she was the only person who knew anything about us.One of the
 party said, “Are you really cross, or are you pretending because the
 armed guard understands English?” She gave her queer little smile, and
 said, “No, I am not pretending.” The whole party tramped through the
 snow to the station, and on the way she told them she was afraid that
 she had smashed somebody’s window, having knocked at another cottage
 before she found ours in the dark, thinking it was the one we lived
 in, for which she was very much chaffed by her companions, who knew
 well her views on the question of militant tactics!‘The first stages of this journey were made in horse-boxes with no
 accommodation whatsoever.Occasionally the train drew up in the middle
 of the country, and anybody who wished to get out had simply to ask
 the sentry who guarded the door, to allow them to get out for a moment.‘The next night was spent lying on the floor of the station at
 Belgrade, the eight sentries and all their charges all lying on the
 floor together; the only person who seemed to be awake was the officer
 who guarded the door himself all night.In the morning one was not
 allowed to go even to wash one’s hands without a sentry to come and
 stand at the door.The next two days were spent in an ordinary train
 rather too well heated with four a side in second-class compartments.At Vienna all the British units who were being sent away were formed
 into a group on the station at 6 A.M., where they awaited the arrival
 of the American Consul, guarded all the time by their sentries, who
 gave his parole that if the people were allowed to go out of the
 station they would return at eight o’clock, the time they had to leave
 that town.Inglis with a party adjourned to a
 hotel where baths, etc., were provided.Other members were allowed to
 do what they liked.‘The unit was detained for eight days at Bludenz, close to the
 frontier, for Switzerland.On their arrival at Zürich they were met
 by the British Consul-General, Vice-Consul, and many members of the
 British Colony, who gave Dr.Inglis and her unit a very warm-hearted
 welcome, bringing quantities of flowers, and doing all they could to
 show them kindness and pleasure at their safe arrival.‘It is difficult for people who have never been prisoners to know what
 the first day’s freedom means.Everybody had a different expression,
 and seemed to have a different outlook on life.But already we could
 see our leader was engrossed with plans and busy with schemes for the
 future work of the unit.‘The next day the Consul-General made a speech in which he told the
 unit all that had passed during the last four months, of which they
 knew nothing.’

_To her Sister._

      ‘BRINDISI, _en route_ for SERBIA,
      ‘_April 28, 1915_.‘The boat ought to have left last night, but it did not even come in
 till this morning.However, we have only lost twenty-four hours.‘It has been a most luxurious journey, except the bit from Naples
 here, and that was rather awful, with spitting men and shut windows,
 in first-class carriages, remember.When we got here we immediately
 ordered baths, but “the boiler was broken.” So, I said, “Well, then,
 we must go somewhere else”--with the result that we were promised
 baths in our rooms at once.That was a nice bath, and then I curled
 up on the sofa and went to sleep.Our windows look right on to the
 docks, and the blue Mediterranean beyond.It is so queer to see the
 red, white, and green flags, and to think they mean Italy, and not the
 N.U.W.S.S.!‘I went out before dinner last night, and strolled through the quaint
 streets.The whole population was out, and most whole-hearted and
 openly interested in my uniform.‘This is a most delightful window, with all the ships and the colours.There are three men-of-war in, and half a dozen of the quaintest
 little boats, which a soldier told me were “scouts.” I wished I had
 asked a sailor, for I had never heard of “scouts.” The soldier I asked
 is one of the bersaglieri with cock’s feathers, a huge mass of them,
 in his hat.They all say Italy is certainly coming into the war.One
 man on the train to Rome was coming from Cardiff to sell coal to the
 Italian Government.He told us weird stories about German tricks to
 get our coal through Spain and other countries.‘It was a pleasure seeing Royaumont.It is a _huge_ success, and I do
 think Dr.The wards and the theatre,
 and the X-Ray department, and the rooms for mending and cleaning the
 men’s clothes were all perfect.’

_To Mrs.Simson._

      ‘S.W.H., KRAGUJEVATZ,
      _May 30/15_.‘Well, this is a perfectly lovely place, and the Serbians are
 delightful.I am staying with a charming woman, Madame Milanovitz.She
 is a Vice-President of the Serbian Women’s League, formed to help the
 country in time of war.I think she wanted to help us because of all
 the hospital has done here.Any how, _I_ score--I have a beautiful
 room and everything.She gives me an early cup of coffee, and for the
 rest I live with the unit.Neither she nor I can speak six words of
 one another’s languages, but her husband can talk a little French.Now, she has asked the little Serbian lady who teaches the unit
 Serbian, to live with her to interpret.‘We have had a busy time since we arrived.The unit is nursing 550
 beds, in three hospitals, having been sent out to nurse 300 beds.There is first the surgical hospital, called Reserve No.It was a
 school, and is in two blocks with a long courtyard between.I think
 we have got it really quite well equipped, with a fine X-Ray room.The theatre, and the room opposite where the dressings are done, both
 very well arranged, and a great credit to Sister Bozket.The one thing
 that troubled me was the floor--old wood and holes in it, impossible
 to sterilise--but yesterday, Major Protitch, our Director, said he was
 going to get cement laid down in it and the theatre.Chesney, “This is the best surgical hospital
 in Serbia.” You must not believe that _quite_, for they are very good
 at saying pleasant things here!‘There are two other hospitals, the typhus one, No.6 Reserve, and
 one for relapsing fever and general diseases, No.We have put most of our strength in No.6, and it is in
 good working order, but No.7 has had only one doctor, and two day
 Sisters and one night, for over 200 beds.Still it is wonderful what
 those three women have done.We have Austrian prisoners as orderlies
 everywhere, in the hospitals and in the houses.The conglomeration of
 languages is too funny for words--Serbian, German, French, English.Sometimes, you have to get an orderly to translate Serbian into
 German, and another to translate the German into French before you can
 get at what is wanted.Two words we have all learnt, _dotra_, which
 means “good,” and which these grateful people use at once if they
 feel a little better, or are pleased about anything, and the other is
 _boli_, pain--poor men!‘So much for what we _have_ been doing; but the day before
 yesterday we got our orders for a new bit of work.They are forming a
 disinfecting centre at Mladanovatz, and Colonel Grustitch, who is the
 head of the Medical Service here, wants us to go up there at once,
 with our whole fever staff, under canvas.They are giving us the tents
 till ours come out.Typhus is decreasing so much, that No.6 is to be
 turned into a surgical hospital, and there will be only one infectious
 diseases hospital here.I am so pleased at being asked to do this,
 for it is part of a big and well thought out scheme.Alice Hutchison goes to Posheravatz also
 for infectious diseases.I hope she is at Salonika to-day.We really began to think the Governor was going to
 keep her altogether!Her equipment has all come, and yesterday I sent
 Mrs.Smith up to Posheravatz to choose the site and
 pitch the tent.‘They gave me an awfully exciting bit of news in Colonel G.’s office
 yesterday, and that was that five motor cars were in Serbia, north of
 Mladanovatz, for _me_.Of course, I had wired for six, but you have
 been prompt about them.How they got into the north of Serbia I cannot
 imagine, unless they were dropped out of aeroplanes.‘Really, it is wonderful the work this unit has done in the most awful
 stress all through March and April.We ought to be awfully proud of
 them.Soltau a decoration, and Patsy
 Hunter had two medals._To her Niece, Amy M‘Laren._

      ‘VALJEVO, _August 16, 1915_.‘DARLING AMY,--I wonder if you could find this place on the map.I have spelt it properly, but if you want to say it you must say
 _Valuvo_.One of the hospitals mother has been collecting so much
 money for is here.It is in tents,
 on a bit of sloping ground looking south.There are big tents for
 the patients, and little tents for the staff.I pull my bed out
 of the tent every night, and sleep outside under the stars.Such
 lovely starlight nights we have here.Alice Hutchison is head of
 this unit, and I am here on a visit to her.My own hospital is in
 a town--Kragujevatz.Now, I wonder if you can find that place?The
 hospital there is in a girls’ school.Now--I wonder what will happen
 to the lessons of all those little girls as long as the war lasts?Serbia has been at war for three years, four wars in three years, and
 the women of the country have kept the agriculture of the country
 going all that time.A Serbian officer told me the other day that
 the country is so grateful to them, that they are going to strike a
 special medal for the women to show their thanks, when this war is
 over.This is such a beautiful country, and such nice people.Some day
 when the war is over, we’ll come here, and have a holiday.How are you
 getting on, my precious?God bless you,
 dear little girlie.--Ever your loving Aunt

      ELSIE.’

As the fever died out, a worse enemy came in.Serbia was overrun by
the Austro-German forces, and she, with others of her units, was taken
prisoner, as they had decided it was their duty to remain at their work
among the sick and wounded.Again the Serbian Minister is quoted:--

 ‘When the typhus calamity was overcome, the Scottish women reorganised
 themselves as tent hospitals and offered to go as near as possible
 to the army at the front.Their camp in the town of Valjevo--which
 suffered most of all from the Austrian invasion--might have stood
 in the middle of England.In Lazarevatz, shortly before the new
 Austro-German offensive, they formed a surgical hospital almost out
 of nothing, in the devastated shops and the village inns, and they
 accomplished the nursing of hundreds of wounded who poured in from
 the battle-field.When it became obvious that the Serbian army could
 not resist the combined Austrians, Germans, Magyars, and Bulgarians,
 who were about four times their numbers, the main care of the Serbian
 military authorities was what to do with the hospitals full of
 wounded, and whom to leave with the wounded soldiers, who refused to
 be left to fall into the hands of the cruel enemy.Then the Scottish
 women declared that they were not going to leave their patients, and
 that they would stay with them, whatever the conditions, and whatever
 might be expected from the enemy.They remained with the Serbian
 wounded as long as they could be of use to them.Simson._

      ‘KRUSHIEEVATZ, _Nov.‘We are in the very centre of the storm, and it just feels exactly
 like having the rain pouring down, and the wind beating in gusts, and
 not being able to see for the water in one’s eyes, and just holding on
 and saying, “It cannot last, it is so bad.” These poor little people,
 you cannot imagine anything more miserable than they are.Remember,
 they have been fighting for years for their independence, and now it
 all seems to end.Germans, Austrians,
 Bulgars, and all that is left is this western Morava Valley, and
 the country a little south of it.And their big Allies--from here
 it looks as if they are never going to move.I went into Craijuvo
 yesterday, in the car, to see about Dr.The road
 was crowded with refugees pouring away, all their goods piled on
 their rickety ox-wagons, little children on the top, and then bands
 of soldiers, stragglers from the army.These men were forming up
 again, as we passed back later on.We decided we must stand by our hospitals; it was too awful
 leaving badly wounded men with no proper care.Sir Ralph eventually
 agreed, and we gave everybody in the units the choice of going or
 staying.We have about 115 people in the Scottish unit, and twenty
 have gone.Smith brings up the rear-guard to-day, with one or two
 laggards and a wounded English soldier we have had charge of.MacGregor has trekked for Novi Bazaar.It is
 the starting-place for Montenegro.We all managed wonderfully in our
 first “evacuations,” and saved practically everything, but now it is
 hopeless.The bridges are down, and the trucks standing anyhow on
 sidings, and, worst of all, the people have begun looting.There’ll be famine, as well as cold, in this corner of the
 world soon, and then the distant prospect of 150,000 British troops at
 Salonika won’t help much.‘The beloved British troops,--the thought of them always cheers.But
 not the thought of the idiots at the top who had not enough gumption
 to _know_ this must happen.Anybody, even us women, could have told
 them that the Germans must try and break through to the help of the
 Turks.‘We have got a nice building here for a hospital, and Dr.Holloway
 is helping in the military hospital.I believe there are about 1000
 wounded in the place.I can’t write a very interesting letter, Amy
 dear, because at the bottom of my heart I don’t believe it will ever
 reach you.I don’t see them managing the Montenegrin passes at this
 time of year!There is a persistent rumour that the French have
 retaken Skopiro, and if that is true perhaps the Salonika route will
 be open soon.‘Some day, I’ll tell you all the exciting things that have been
 happening, and all the funny things too!For there have been funny
 things, in the middle of all the sadness.The guns are booming away,
 and the country looking so lovely in the sunlight.I wonder if Serbia
 is a particularly beautiful country, or whether it looks so lovely
 because of the tragedy of this war, just as bed seems particularly
 delightful when the night bell goes!’

      ‘SERBIAN MILITARY HOSPITAL,
      ‘KRUSHIEEVATZ, _Nov.‘We have been here about a month.It was dreadfully sad work leaving
 our beautiful little hospital at Krushieevatz.Here, we are working in
 the Serbian military hospital, and living in it also.You can imagine
 that we have plenty to do, when you hear we have 900 wounded.The
 prisoners are brought in every day, sometimes thousands, and go on to
 the north, leaving the sick.The Director has put the sanitation and
 the laundry into our hands also.‘We have had a hard frost for four days now, and snowstorms.My
 warm things did not arrive--I suppose they are safe at Salonika.Fortunately last year’s uniform was still in existence, and I wear
 three pairs of stockings, with my high boots.We have all cut our
 skirts short, for Serbian mud is awful.It is a lovely land, and the
 views round here are very cheering.One sunset I shall never forget--a
 glorious sky, and the hills deep blue against it.In the foreground
 the camp fires, and the prisoners round them in the fading light.’

With the invasion came the question of evacuation.At one time it was
possible the whole of the British unit might escape _via_ Montenegro.Sir Ralph Paget, realising that the equipment could not be saved,
allowed any of the hospital unit who wished to remain with their
wounded.Two parties went with the retreating Serbs, and their story
and the extraordinary hardships they endured has been told elsewhere.Those left at Krushieevatz were in Dr.Inglis’ opinion the fortunate
units.For three months they tended the Serbian wounded under foreign
occupation.Inglis kept to their work, and when
necessary confronted the Austro-German officers with all the audacity
of their leader and the Scottish thistle combined.When we went up
there were 900 patients.During the greatest part of the pressure the
number rose to 1200.Patients were placed in the corridors--at first
one man to one bed, but later two beds together, and three men in them.Then there were no more bedsteads, and mattresses were placed on the
floor.The magazine in full blast was a
sight, once seen, never to be forgotten.There were three tiers,
the slightly wounded men in the highest tier.Inglis says the time to see the place at its
best or its worst was in the gloaming, when two or three feeble oil
lamps illuminated the gloom, and the tin bowls clattered and rattled as
the evening ration of beans was given out, and the men swarmed up and
down the poles of their shelves chattering as Serbs will chatter.The
Sisters called the place ‘the Zoo.’

The dread of the renewal of the typhus scourge, amid such conditions
of overcrowding, underfeeding, fatigue and depression, was great.Inglis details the appalling tasks the unit undertook in sanitation.There was no expert amongst them:--

 ‘When we arrived, the hospital compound was a truly terrible
 place--the sights and smells beyond description.We dug the rubbish
 into the ground, emptied the overflowing cesspool, built incinerators,
 and cleaned, and cleaned, and cleaned.That is an Englishman’s job all
 over the world.Our three untrained English girl orderlies took to it
 like ducks to water.It was not the pleasantest or easiest work in the
 world; but they did it, and did it magnificently.‘Laundry and bathing arrangements were installed and kept going.We
 had not a single case of typhus; we had a greater achievement than
 its prevention.Late of an evening, when men among the prisoners were
 put into the wards, straight from the march, unwashed and crawling
 with lice, there was great indignation among the patients already in.“Doktoritza,” they said, “if you put these dirty men in among us we
 shall all get typhus.” Our hearts rejoiced.If we have done nothing
 else, we thought, we have driven that fact home to the Serbian mind
 that dirt and typhus go together.’

Dr.Inglis describes the misery of the Serbian prisoners:--

 ‘They had seen men go out to battle, conscious of the good work they
 had done for the Allies in driving back the Austrians in their first
 punitive expedition.We are the only ones who, so far, have beaten
 our enemy.They came back to us broken and dispirited.They were
 turned into the hospital grounds, with a scanty ration of beans, with
 a little meat and half a loaf of bread for twenty-four hours.Their
 camp fires flickered fitfully through the long bitter cold nights.Every scrap of wood was torn up, the foot bridges over the drains, and
 the trees hacked down for firewood.We added to the rations of our
 sanitary workers, we gave away all the bread we could, but we could
 not feed that enclosure of hungry men.We used to hear them coughing
 and moaning all night.’

Dr.Inglis details the starving condition of the whole country, the
weakness of the famine-stricken men who worked for them, the starved
yoke oxen, and all the manifold miseries of a country overrun by the
enemy.‘There was,’ she says, ‘a curious exhilaration in working for those
 grateful patient men, and in helping the director, Major Nicolitch, so
 loyal to his country and so conscientious in his work, to bring order
 out of chaos, and yet the unhappiness in the Serbian houses, and the
 physical wretchedness of those cold hungry prisoners lay always like
 a dead weight on our spirit.Never shall we forget the beauty of the
 sunrises, or the glory of the sunsets, with clear, cold sunlit days
 between, and the wonderful starlit nights.But we shall never forget
 “the Zoo” either, or the groans outside the windows when we hid our
 heads under the blankets to shut out the sound.The unit got no news,
 and they made it a point of honour to believe nothing said in the
 German telegrams.We could not believe Serbia had been sacrificed for
 nothing.We were convinced it was some deep laid scheme for weakening
 other fronts, and so it was natural to believe rumours, such as that
 the English had taken Belgium, and the French were in Metz.‘The end of the five months of service in captivity, and to captive
 Serbs ended.On the 11th February 1916, they were sent north under an
 Austrian guard with fixed bayonets, thus to Vienna, and so by slow
 stages they came to Zürich.‘It was a great thing to be once more “home” and to realise how strong
 and straight and fearless a people inhabit these islands: to realise
 not so much that they mean to win the war, but rather that they
 consider any other issue impossible.’

So Dr.Inglis came back to plan new campaigns for the help of the
Serbian people, who lay night and day upon her heart.She knew she had
the backing of the Suffrage societies, and she intended to get the
ear of the English public for the cause of the Allies in the Balkans.‘We,’ who had sent her out, found her changed in many ways.Physically
she had altered much, and if we could ever have thought of the body
in the presence of that dauntless spirit, we might have seen that the
Angel of Shadows was not far away.The privations and sufferings she
described so well when she had to speak of her beloved Serbs had been
fully shared by the unit.Their comfort was always her thought; she
never would have anything that could not be shared and shared alike,
but there was little but hardship to share, and one and all scorned to
speak of privations which were a light affliction compared to those
of a whole nation groaning and waiting to be redeemed from its great
tribulation.There was a look in her face of one whose spirit had been pierced by
the sword.The brightness of her eyes was dimmed, for she had seen the
days when His judgments were abroad upon the earth:--

    ‘Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
    He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are
        stored;
    He has loosed the fatal lightning of His terrible swift sword:
    I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
    They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
    I have read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps.’

She could never forget the tragedy of Serbia, and she came home, not
to rest, but vowed to yet greater endeavours for their welfare.The
attitude of the Allies she did not pretend to understand.She had
something of the spirit of Oliver Cromwell, when he threatened to
send his fleet across the Alps to help the Waldensians.In her public
speeches, when she set forth what in her outlook could have been done,
no censor cut out the sentences which were touched by the live coals
from off her altar of service.Elsie never recognised the word
‘impossible’ for herself, and for her work that was well.As to her
political and military outlook, the story of the nations will find it a
place in the history of the war.For a few months she worked from the bases of her two loyal
Committees in London and Edinburgh.She spoke at many a public meeting,
and filled many a drawing-room.The Church of Scotland knew her
presence in London.‘One of our most treasured memories will be that
keen, clever face of hers in St.Columba’s of a Sunday--with the far,
wistful melancholy in it, added to its firm determination.’ So writes
the minister.‘We’ knew what lay behind the wistful brave eyes, a yet
more complete dedication to the service of her Serbian brethren.CHAPTER X

RUSSIA

1917

    ‘Even so in our mortal journey,
      The bitter north winds blow,
    And thus upon life’s red river,
      Our hearts as oarsmen row.And when the Angel of Shadow
      Rests his feet on wave and shore,
    And our eyes grow dim with watching,
      And our hearts faint at the oar,

    Happy is he who heareth
      The signal of his release
    In the bells of the holy city
      The chimes of eternal peace.’


Dr.Inglis’ return to England was the signal for renewed efforts
on the part of the Committees managing the S.W.H.This memoir has
necessarily to follow the personality of the leader, but it must never
be forgotten that her strength and all her sinews of war lay in the
work of those who carried on at home, week by week.Strong committees
of women, ably organised and thoroughly staffed, took over the burden
of finance--a matter Dr.Inglis once amusingly said, ‘did not interest
her.’ They found and selected the _personnel_ on which success so much
depended, they contracted for and supervised the sending out of immense
consignments of equipment and motor transport.They dealt with the
Government department, and in loyal devotion smoothed every possible
obstacle out of the path of those flying squadrons, the units of the
S.W.H.It was inevitable the quick brain and tenacious energy of Dr.Inglis,
far away from the base of her operations, should at times have found
it hard to understand why the wheels occasionally seemed to drag, and
the new effort she desired to make did not move at the pace which to
her eager spirit seemed possible.Two enterprises filled her mind on
her return in 1916.One, by the help of the London Committee, she put
through.This was the celebration of Kossovo Day in Great Britain.The flag-day of the Serbian Patriot King was under her chairmanship
prepared for in six weeks.Hundreds of lectures on the history of
Serbia were arranged for and delivered throughout the country, and no
one failed to do her work, however remote they might think the prospect
of making the British people interested in a country and patriot so far
from the ken of their island isolation.Kossovo Day was a success, and through the rush of the work Dr.Inglis
was planning the last and most arduous of all the undertakings of the
S.W.H., that of the unit which was to serve with the Serbian Volunteers
on the Rumanian Russian front.Inglis knew from private sources the
lack of hospital arrangements in Mesopotamia, and she, with the backing
of the Committees, had approached the authorities for leave to take a
fully equipped unit to Basra.When the story of the Scottish Women’s
Hospital is written, the correspondence between the War Office, the
Foreign Office, and S.W.H.will throw a tragic light on this lamentable
episode, and, read with the report of the Committees, it will prove how
quick and foreseeing of trouble was her outlook.Inglis
brought her units back from Serbia, she again urged the War Office to
send her out.Of her treatment by the War Office, Mrs.Fawcett writes:
‘She was not only refused, but refused with contumely and insult.’

True to her instinct never to pause over a set-back, she lost no time
in pressing on her last enterprise for the Serbians.M. Curcin, in _The
Englishwoman_, says:--

 ‘She was already acquainted with one side of the Serbian
 problem--Serbia; she was told that in Russia there was the best
 opportunity to learn about the second half--the Serbs of Austria, the
 Jugoslavs.Inglis succeeded in raising a hospital
 unit and transport section staffed by eighty women heroes of the
 Scottish Women’s Hospitals to start with her on a most adventurous
 undertaking, _via_ Archangel, through Russia to Odessa and the
 Dobrudja.Inglis succeeded also--most difficult of all--in
 getting permission from the British authorities for the journey.Eye-witnesses--officers and soldiers--tell everybody to-day how those
 women descended, practically straight from the railway carriages,
 after forty days’ travelling, beside the stretchers with wounded,
 and helped to dress the wounds of those who had had to defend the
 centre and also a wing of the retreating army.For fifteen months she
 remained with those men, whose _rôle_ is not yet fully realised, but
 is certain to become one of the most wonderful and characteristic
 facts of the conflagration of nations.’

The Edinburgh Committee had already so many undertakings on behalf of
the S.W.H.that they gladly allowed the Committee formed by the London
Branch of the N.U.W.S.S.to undertake the whole work of organising this
last adventure for the Serbian Army.Inglis and her unit sailed the wintry main, and to them she sent
the voluminous and brilliant reports of her work.When the Russian
revolution imperilled the safety of the Serbian Army on the Rumanian
front, she sent home members of her unit, charged with important
verbal messages to her Government.Through the last anxious month,
when communications were cut off, short messages, unmistakably her
own, came back to the London Committee, that they might order her to
return.She would come with the Serbian Army and not without them.We
at home had to rest on the assurances of the Foreign Office, always
alive to the care and encouragement of the S.W.H., that Dr.Inglis and
her unit were safe, and that their return would be expedited at the
safest hour.In those assurances we learnt to rest, and the British
Government did not fail that allied force--the Serbian Army and the
Scottish women serving them.The following letters were those written
to her family with notes from her graphic report to her Committees.The
clear style and beautiful handwriting never changed even in those last
days, when those who were with her knew that nothing but the spirit
kept the wasted body at its work.‘The Serbian Division is superb; we
are proud to be attached to it.’ These were the last words in her last
letter from Odessa in June 1917.That pride of service runs through
all the correspondence.The spirit she inspired is noteworthy in a
book which covers the greater part of these fifteen months, _With the
Scottish Nurses in Rumania_, by Yvonne Fitzroy.In a daily diary a
searchlight is allowed to fall on some of the experiences borne with
such high-hearted nonchalance by the leader and her gallant disciples.Haverfield, who saw her work, writes:

 ‘It was perfectly incredible that one human being could do the work
 she accomplished.Her record piece of work perhaps was at Galatz,
 Rumania, at the end of the retreat.There were masses and masses of
 wounded, and she and her doctors and nurses performed operations and
 dressings for fifty-eight hours out of sixty-three.Scott, of the
 armoured cars, noted the time, and when he told her how long she had
 been working, she simply said, “Well, it was all due to Mrs.Milne,
 the cook, who kept us supplied with hot soup.” She had been very
 tired for a long time; undoubtedly the lack of food, the necessity of
 sleeping on the floor, and nursing her patients all the time told on
 her health.In Russia she was getting gradually more tired until she
 became ill.When she was the least bit better she was up again, and
 all the time she attended to the business of the unit.‘Just before getting home she had a relapse, and the last two or
 three days on board ship, we know now, she was dying.She made all the
 arrangements for the unit which she brought with her, however, and
 interviewed every member of it.To Miss Onslow, her transport officer,
 she said, when she arrived at Newcastle, “I shall be up in London in a
 few days’ time, and we will talk the matter of a new unit over.” Miss
 Onslow turned away with tears in her eyes.’

      ‘H.M.TRANSPORT ----,
      ‘_Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--Here we are more than half way through our voyage.We
 got off eventually on Wednesday night, and lay all Thursday in the
 river.You never in your life saw such a filthy boat as this was when
 we came on board.The captain had been taken off an American liner the
 day before.The only officer who had been on this boat before was the
 engineer officer.The crew were drunk to a man,
 and, as the Transport officer said, “The only way to get this ship
 right, is to get her _out_.” So we got out.I must say we got into
 shape very quickly.We cleaned up, and now we are painting.They won’t
 know her when she gets back.She is an Austrian Lloyd captured at the
 beginning of the war, and she has been trooping in the Mediterranean
 since.She was up at Glasgow for this new start, but she struck the
 Glasgow Fair, and could therefore get nothing done, so she was brought
 down to the port we started from--as she was.The captain seems to be an awfully good man.He is Scotch,
 and was on the Anchor Line to Bombay.She has all our equipment, fourteen of our cars.For passengers,
 there are ourselves, seventy-five people, and three Serbian officers,
 and the mother and sister of one of them, and thirty-two Serbian
 non-commissioned officers.On the saloon deck there are
 twenty-two very small, single cabins.And on this deck larger cabins
 with either three or four berths.I am on this deck in the most
 luxurious quarters.It is called _The Commanding Officer’s Cabin_
 (ahem).There is a huge cabin with one berth; off it on one side
 another cabin with a writing-table and sofa, and off it on the other
 side a bathroom and dressing-room!Of course, if we had had rough
 weather, and the ports had had to be closed, it would not have been so
 nice, especially as the glass in all the portholes is blackened, but
 we have had perfectly glorious weather.At night every porthole and
 window is closed to shut in the light, but the whole ship is very well
 ventilated.A good many of them sleep up in the boats, or in one of
 the lorries.‘We sighted one submarine, but it took no notice of us, so we took
 no notice of it.We had all our boats allotted to us the very first
 day.We divided the unit among them, putting one responsible person
 in charge of each, and had boat drill several times.Then one day the
 captain sounded the alarm for practice, and everybody was at their
 station in three minutes in greatcoat and life-belt.The amusing
 thing was that some of them thought it was a real alarm, and were
 most annoyed and disappointed to find there was not a submarine
 really there!The unit as a whole seems very nice and capable, though
 there are one or two queer characters!But most of them are healthy,
 wholesome bricks of girls.Of course
 a field hospital is quite a new bit of work.‘We reach our port of disembarkation this afternoon.The voyage
 has been a most pleasant one in every way.As soon as sea-sickness
 was over the unit developed a tremendous amount of energy, and we
 have had games on deck, and concerts, and sports, and a fancy dress
 competition!All this in addition to drill every morning, which was
 compulsory.‘We began the day at 8.30--breakfast, the cabins were tidied.9.30--roll call and cabin inspection immediately after; then
 drill--ordinary drill, stretcher drill, and Swedish drill in sections.Lunch was at 12.30, and then there were lessons in Russian, Serbian,
 and French, to which they could go if they liked, and most of them
 took one, or even two, and lectures on motor construction, etc.Tea at
 4, and dinner 6.30.You would have thought there was not much time for
 anything else, but the superfluous energy of a British unit manages
 to put a good deal more in.(The head of a British unit in Serbia
 once said to me that the chief duty of the head of a British unit was
 to use up the superfluous energy of the unit in harmless ways.He
 said that the only time there was no superfluous energy was when the
 unit was overworking.That was the time I found that particular unit
 playing rounders!)I was standing next
 to a Serb officer during the obstacle race, and he suddenly turned to
 me and said, “C’est tout-à-fait nouveau pour nous, Madame.” I thought
 it must be, for at that moment they were getting under a sail which
 had been tied down to the deck--two of them hurled themselves on the
 sail and dived under it, you saw four legs kicking wildly, and then
 the sail heaved and fell, and two dishevelled creatures emerged at the
 other side, and tore at two life-belts which they went through, and so
 on.I should think it was indeed _tout-à-fait nouveau_.Some of the
 dresses at the fancy dress competition were most clever.There was
 Napoleon--the last phase, in the captain’s long coat and somebody’s
 epaulettes, and one of our grey hats, side to the front, excellent;
 and Tweedledum and Tweedledee, in saucepans and life-belts.One of
 them got herself up as a “greaser,” and went down to the engine-room
 to get properly dirty, with such successful result that, when she was
 coming up to the saloon, with her little oiling can in her hand, one
 of the officers stopped her with, “Now, where are you going to, my
 lad?”

 ‘We ended up with all the allied National Anthems, the Serbs leading
 their own.‘I do love to see them enjoying themselves, and to hear them
 chattering and laughing along the passages, for they’ll have plenty
 of hard work later.We had service on Sunday, which I took, as
 the captain could not come down.Could you get us some copies of
 the Archbishop of Canterbury’s war prayers?The captain declares he was snap-shotted six times
 one morning.I don’t know if the Russian Government will let us take
 all these cameras with us.We are flying the Union Jack for the first
 time to-day since we came out.It is good to know you are all thinking
 of us.--Ever your loving sister,

      ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

      ‘ON THE TRAIN TO MOSCOW,
      ‘_Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--Here we are well on our way to Moscow, having got
 through Archangel in 2½ days--a feat, for we were told at home that it
 might be six weeks.They did not know that there is a party of our
 naval men there helping the Russians, and Archangel is magnificently
 organised now.‘When one realises that the population was 5000 before the war,
 and is now 20,000, it is quite clear there was bound to be some
 disorganisation at first.‘I never met a kinder set of people than are collected at Archangel
 just now.They simply did everything for us, and sent us off in a
 train with a berth for each person, and gave us a wonderful send off.The Russian Admiral gave us a letter which acts as a kind of magic
 ring whenever it is produced.The first time it was really quite
 startling.We were longing for Nyamdonia where we were to get dinner.We were told we should be there at four o’clock, then at five, and
 at six o’clock we pulled up at a place unknown, and rumours began
 to spread that our engine was off, and sure enough it was, and was
 shunting trucks.Miss Little, one of our Russian-speaking people,
 and I got out.We tried our united eloquence, she in fluent Russian,
 and I saying, _Shechaz_, which means “immediately” at intervals, and
 still they looked helpless and said, “Two hours and a half.” Then I
 produced my letter, and you never saw such a change.They said, “Five
 minutes,” and we were off in three.We tried it all along the line
 after that; my own belief is that we should still be at the unknown
 place, without that letter, shunting trucks.At one station, Miss
 Little heard the station-master saying, “There is a great row going
 on here, and there will be trouble to-morrow if this train isn’t got
 through.” Eventually, we reached Nyamdonia at 11.30, and found a
 delightful Russian officer, and an excellent dinner paid for by the
 Russian Government, waiting for us.We all thought the food very good,
 and I thought the sauce of hunger helped.The next day, profiting
 over our Nyamdonia experience, I said meals were to be had at regular
 times from our stores in the train, and we should take the restaurants
 as we found them, with the result that we arrived at Vorega, where
 _déjeuner_ had been ordered just as we finished a solid lunch of ham
 and eggs.I said they had better go out and have two more courses,
 which they did with great content, and found it quite as nice as the
 night before.‘This is a special train for us and the Serbian officers and
 non-coms.We broke a coupling after we left Nyamdonia, and they sent
 out another carriage from there, but it had not top berths, so they
 had another sleeper ready when we reached Vologda.They gave us
 another and stronger engine at Nyamdonia, because we asked for it, and
 have repaired cisterns, and given us chickens and eggs; and when we
 thank them, they say, “It is for our friends.” The crowd stand round
 three deep while we eat, and watch us all the time, quite silently in
 the stations.In Archangel one old man asked, “Who, on God’s earth,
 are you?”

 ‘They gave us such a send-off from Archangel!Russian soldiers were
 drawn up between the ship and the train, and cheered us the whole way,
 with a regular British cheer; our own crew turned out with a drum
 and a fife and various other instruments, and marched about singing.Then they made speeches, and cheered everybody, and then suddenly the
 Russian soldiers seized the Serbian officers and tossed them up and
 down, up and down, till they were stopped by a whistle.But they had
 got into the mood by then, and they rushed at me.You can imagine, I
 fled, and seized hold of the British Consul.I did think the British
 Empire would stand by me, but he would do nothing but laugh.And I
 found myself up in the air above the crowd, up and down, quite safe,
 hands under one and round one.They were so happy that I waved my hand
 to them, and they shouted and cheered.The unit is only annoyed that
 they had not their cameras, and that anyhow it was dark.Then they
 tossed Captain Bevan, who is in command there, because he was English,
 and the Consul for the same reason, and the captain of the transport
 because he had brought us out.We sang all the national anthems, and
 then they danced for us.It was a weird sight in the moonlight.Some
 of the dances were like Indian ones, and some reminded me of our
 Highland flings.We went on till one in the morning--all the British
 colony, there.I confess, I was tired--though I did enjoy it.Captain
 Bevan’s good-bye was the nicest and so unexpected--simply “God bless
 you.” Mrs.Young, the Consul’s wife, Mrs.Kerr, both Russians, simply
 gave up their whole time to us, took the girls about, and Mrs.Kerr
 had _the whole unit_ to tea.I had lunch one day at the British Mess,
 and another day at the Russian Admiral’s.They all came out to dinner
 with us.‘Of course a new face means a lot in an out-of-the-way place, and
 seventy-five new faces was a God-send.Well, as I said before, they
 are the kindest set of people I ever came across.They brought us our
 bread, and changed our money, and arranged with the bank, and got us
 this train with berths, and thought of every single thing for us.‘NEARING ODESSA,
      ‘_Sep.‘DARLING EVE,--We are nearing the second stage of our journey, and
 _they say_ we shall be in Odessa to-night.We have all come to the
 conclusion that a Russian minute is about ten times as long as ours.If we get in to-night we shall have taken nine days from Archangel;
 with all the lines blocked with military trains, that is not bad.All the same we have had some struggles, but it has been a very
 comfortable journey and very pleasant.The Russian officials all along
 the line have been most helpful and kind.A Serbian officer on board,
 or rather a Montenegrin, looked after us like a father.‘What we should have done without M. and Mme.Malinina at Moscow, I
 don’t know.They gave the whole afternoon up to us: took us to the
 Kremlin--he, the whole unit on special tramcars, and she, three of
 us in her motor.She has a beautiful
 hospital, a clearing one at the station, and he is a member of the
 Duma, and Commandant of all the Red Cross work in Moscow.We only had
 a glimpse of the Kremlin, yet enough to make one want to see more.I
 carried away one beautiful picture to remember--the view of Moscow in
 the sunset light, simply gorgeous.‘The unit are very very well, and exceedingly cheerful.I am not
 sorry to have had these three weeks since we left to get the unit in
 hand.When M. Malinina said it was
 time to leave the Kremlin, and the order was given to “Fall in,” I was
 quite proud of them, they did it so quickly.It is wonderful even now
 what they manage to do.Miss H. says they are like eels in a basket.They were told not to eat fruit without peeling it, so one of them
 peeled an apple with her teeth.They were told not to drink unboiled
 water, so they handed their water-bottles out at dead of night to
 Russian soldiers, to whom they could not explain, to fill for them,
 as of course they understood they were not to fill them from water on
 the train.I must say they are an awfully nice lot on the whole.We
 certainly shall not fail for want of energy.The Russian crowds are
 tremendously interested in them.--Ever your loving aunt,

      ‘ELSIE.’

      ‘RENI, _Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--We have left Odessa and are really off to our
 Division.We were told this is the important point in the war
 just now--“A Second Verdun.” The great General Mackensen is in command
 against us.He was in command at Krushinjevatz when we were taken
 prisoners.Every one says how anxiously they are looking out for us,
 and, indeed, we shall have our work cut out for us.We are two little
 field hospitals for a whole Division.Think if that was the provision
 for our own men.We saw the
 2nd Division preparing in Odessa.Only from the point of view of the
 war, they ought to be looked after, but when one remembers that they
 are men, every one of them with somebody who cares for them, it is
 dreadful.I wish we were each six women instead of one.I have wired
 home for another Base Hospital to take the place of the British Red
 Cross units when they move on with the 2nd Division.The Russians are
 splendid in taking the Serbs into their Base Hospitals, but you can
 imagine what the pressure is from their own huge armies.We had such
 a reception at Odessa.All the Russian officials, at the station, and
 our Consul, and a line drawn up of twenty Serbian officers.They had
 a motor car and forty droskies and a squad of Serbian soldiers to
 carry up our personal luggage, and most delightful quarters for us on
 the outskirts of the town in a sanatorium.We were the guests of the
 city while we were there.Odessa
 is immensely interested in us.We were told that the form of greeting
 while we were there was, “Have you seen _them_?” The two best things
 were the evening at the Serbian Mess, and the gala performance at the
 opera.The cheering of the Serbian mess when we went in was something
 to remember, but I can tell you I felt quite choking when the whole
 house last night turned round and cheered us after we tried to sing
 our National Anthem to them with the orchestra.‘DEAREST AMY,--Just a line to say I am all right.Four weeks to-morrow
 since we reached Medgidia, and began our hospital.We evacuated it in
 three weeks, and here we are all back on the frontier.Such a time it
 has been, Amy dear.You cannot imagine what war is just behind the
 lines, and in a retreat!--our second retreat, and almost to the same
 day.We evacuated Kragujevatz on the 25th of October last year.We
 evacuated Medgidia on the 22nd this year.On the 25th this year, we
 were working in a Russian dressing-station at Harshova, and were moved
 on in the evening.We arrived at Braila to find 11,000 wounded, and
 seven doctors--only one of them a surgeon.Am going back to Braila to do surgery.Have
 sent every trained person there.--Your loving sister,

      ELSIE.‘_P.S._--We have had lots of exciting things too, and amusing things,
 and _good_ things.’

      ‘ON THE DANUBE AT TULCEA,
      ‘_Nov.‘DEAREST AMY,--I am writing this on the boat between Tulcea and
 Ismail, where I am going to see our second hospital and the transport.Admiral Vesolskin has given me a special boat, and we motored over
 from Braila.The Étappen command had been expecting us all afternoon,
 and the boat was ready.They were very amused to find that “the
 doctor” they had been expecting was a _woman_!‘Our main hospital was at Medgidia, and our field hospital at
 Bulbulmic, only about seven miles from the front.They gave us a
 very nice building, a barrack, at Medgidia for the hospital, and the
 _personnel_ were in tents on the opposite hill.We arrived on the
 day of the offensive, and were ready for patients within forty-eight
 hours.We were there less than three weeks, and during that time we
 unpacked the equipment and repacked it.We made really a rather nice
 hospital at Medgidia, and the field hospital.We pitched and struck
 the camp--we were nursing and operating the whole time, and evacuating
 rapidly too, and our cars were on the road practically always.‘The first notice we got of the retreat was our field hospital being
 brought back five versts.Then we were told to
 send the equipment to Galatz, but to keep essential things and the
 _personnel_.The whole country was covered with
 groups of soldiers who had lost their regiments.Russians, Serbs, and
 Rumanians.The Rumanian guns were simply being rushed back, through
 the crowds of refugees.The whole country was moving: in some places
 the panic was awful.One part of our scattered unit came in for it.You would have thought the Bulgars were at the heels of the people.One man threw away a baby right in front of the cars.They were
 throwing everything off the carts to lighten them, and our people,
 being of a calmer disposition, picked up what they wanted in the way
 of vegetables, etc.Men, with their rifles and bayonets, climbed on
 to the Red Cross cars to save a few minutes.We simply went head
 over heels out of the country.I want to collect all the different
 stories of our groups.My special lot slept the first night on straw
 in Caromacat; the next night on the roadside round a lovely fire; the
 next (much reduced in numbers, for I had cleared the majority off in
 barges for Galatz), we slept in an empty room at Hershova, and spent
 the next day dressing at the wharf.And by the next night we were in
 Braila, involved in the avalanche of wounded that descended on that
 place, and there we have been ever since.‘We found some of our transport, and, while we were having tea, an
 officer came in and asked us to go round and help in a hospital.There, we were told, there were 11,000 wounded (I believe the official
 figures are 7000).They had been working thirty-six hours without
 stopping when we arrived.‘The wounded had overflowed into empty houses, and were lying about in
 their uniforms, and their wounds not dressed for four or five days.‘So we just turned up our sleeves and went in.I got back all the
 trained Sisters from Galatz, and now the pressure is over.One thing
 I am going up to Ismail for, is to get into touch with the Serbian H.2, and find out what they want us to do next.The Serb wounded were
 evacuated straight to Odessa.‘The unit as a whole has behaved splendidly, plucky and cheery through
 everything, and game for any amount of work.‘And we are prouder of our Serbs than ever.I do hope the papers at
 home have realised what the 1st Division did, and how they suffered in
 the fight in the middle of September.General Genlikoffsky said to me,
 “_C’était magnifique, magnifique!Ils sont les héros_”;--and another
 Russian: “We did not quite believe in these Austrian Serbs, but no one
 will ever doubt them again.”

 ‘Personally, I have been awfully well, and prouder than ever of
 British women.I wish you could have seen trained Sisters scrubbing
 floors at Medgidia, and those strapping transport girls lifting the
 stretchers out of the ambulances so steadily and gently.I have told
 in the Report how Miss Borrowman and Miss Brown brought the equipments
 through to Galatz.We lost only one Ludgate boiler and one box of
 radiators.We lost two cars, but that was really the fault of a rather
 stupid Serbian officer.It is a comfort to feel you are all thinking
 of us.--Your loving sister,

      ‘E.I.’

      ‘IN AN AMBULANCE TRAIN BETWEEN
      ‘RENI AND ODESSA, _Jan.‘DARLING EVE,--Now we have got a hospital at Reni again, for badly
 wounded, working in connection with the evacuation station.We have
 got the dearest little house to live in ourselves, but, as we are
 getting far more people out from Odessa, we shall have to overflow
 into the Expedition houses.I
 remember thinking Reni a most uninteresting place--crowds of shipping
 and the wharf all crammed with sacks.It was just a big junction like
 Crewe!‘The hospital at Reni is a real building, but it is not finished.One
 unfinished bit is the windows, which have one layer of glass each,
 though they have double sashes.When this was pointed out, I thought
 it was a mere continental foible.When the cold came I realised
 that there is some sense in this foible after all!We _cannot_ get
 the wards warm, notwithstanding extra stoves and roaring fires.The
 poor Russians do mind cold so much.But they don’t want to leave the
 hospital.One man whom I told he must have an operation later on in
 another hospital, said he would rather wait for it in ours.The first
 time we had to evacuate, we simply could not get the men to go.‘We have got a Russian Secretary now, because we are using Russian
 Red Cross money, and he told us he had been told in Petrograd that
 the S.W.H.were beautifully organised, and the only drawback was
 the language.We have got a
 certain number of Austrian prisoners as orderlies, and most of them
 curiously can speak Russian, so we get on better.This is a most comfortable
 way of travelling, and the quickest.We have 500 wounded on board,
 twenty-three of them ours.I am going to Odessa to find out why we
 cannot get Serb patients.There are still thousands of them in Odessa,
 and yet Dr.The Serbs we meet seem
 to think it is somehow our fault!I tell them I have written and
 telegraphed, and planned and made two journeys to Ismail, to try and
 get a real Serbian Hospital going, and yet it doesn’t go.‘What did happen over the change of Government?I do hope we have got
 the right lot now, to put things straight at home, and carry through
 things abroad.Remember it all depends on you people at home._The
 whole thing depends on us._ I know we lose the perspective in this
 gloomy corner, but there is one thing quite clear, and that is that
 they are all trusting to our _sticking_ powers.They know we’ll hold
 on--of course--I only wish we would realise that it would be as well
 to use our intellects too, and have them clear of alcohol.’

      ‘IN AN AMBULANCE TRAIN,
      ‘NEAR ODESSA, _Jan.‘You don’t know what a comfort it is on this tumultuous front, to
 know that all you people at home have just settled down to it, and
 that you’ll put things right in the long run.It is curious to feel
 how everybody is trusting to that.The day we left Braila, a Rumanian
 said to me in the hall, “It is England we are trusting to.She has
 got hold now like a strong dog!” But it is a bigger job than any of
 you imagine, _I_ think.But there is not the slightest doubt we shall
 pull it off.I am glad to think the country has discovered that it is
 possible to have an alternative Government.If it does not do, we must
 find yet another._To her little Niece, Amy M‘Laren_

      ‘ON AN AMBULANCE TRAIN,
      ‘NEAR ODESSA, _Jan.‘DARLING AMY,--How are you all?We have been very busy since we came
 out here: first a hospital for the Serbs at Medgidia, then in a
 Rumanian hospital at Braila, and then for the Russians at Galatz and
 Reni.In the very middle, by some funny mistake, we were sent flying
 right on to the front line.However we nipped out again just in time,
 and the station was burnt to the ground just half an hour after we
 left.I’ll tell you the name of the place when the war is over, and
 show it to you on the map.We saw the petrol tanks on fire as we came
 away, and the ricks of grain too.‘Our hospital at Galatz was in a school.I don’t think the children
 in these parts are doing many lessons during the war, and that will
 be a great handicap for their countries afterwards.Perhaps, however,
 they are learning other lessons.When we left the Dobrudja we saw the
 crowds of refugees on their carts, with the things they had been able
 to save, and all the little children packed in among the furniture and
 pots and pans and pigs.‘In one cart I saw two fascinating babies about three years old,
 sitting in a kind of little nest made of pillows and rugs.They were
 little girls, one fair and one dark, and they sat there, as good as
 gold, watching everything with such interest.There were streams of
 carts along the roads, and all the villages deserted.That is what
 the war means out here.It is not quite so bad in our safe Scotland,
 is it?--thanks to the fleet.And that is why it seems to me we have
 got to help these people, because they are having the worst of it.I wonder if you can knit socks yet, for I can use any number, and
 bandages.Blessings on you, precious
 little girl.--Your loving aunt,

      ELSIE.’

 ‘I have had my meals with the Staff.Unfortunately, most of them
 speak only Russian, but one man speaks French, and another German.The man who speaks German is
 having English lessons from her.He picked up _Punch_ and showed _me_ YOU.So, I said “you.”
 He repeated it quite nicely, and then found another OU.“Though,”
 and when I said “though,” he flung up his hands, and said, “Why a
 practical nation like the English should do things like this!”’

      ‘S.W.H.,
      RENI, _March 5, 1917_.‘DARLING MARY,--We have been having such icy weather here, such
 snowstorms sweeping across the plain.One day I really thought the house would be cut off from the hospital.The unit going over to Roll was quite a sight, with the indiarubber
 boots, and peaked Russian caps, with the ends twisted round their
 throats.We should have thoroughly enjoyed it if it had not been for
 the shortage of fuel.However, we were never absolutely without wood,
 and now have plenty, as a Cossack regiment sent a squad of men across
 the Danube to cut for us, and we brought it back in our carts.The
 Danube is frozen right across--such a curious sight.The first time in
 seven years, they say--so nice of it to do it just when we are here!I
 would not have missed it for anything.The hospital has only had about
 forty patients for some time, as there has been no fighting, and it
 was just as well when we were so short of wood.We collected them all
 into one ward, and let the other fires out.‘The chief of the medical department held an inspection.Took off the
 men’s shirts and looked for lice, turned up the sheets, and beat the
 mattresses to look for dust, tasted the men’s food, and in the end
 stated we were _ochin chesté_ (very clean), and that the patients
 were well cared for medically and well nursed.All of which was
 very satisfactory, but he added that the condition of the orderlies
 was disgraceful, and so it was.I hadn’t realised they were my job.However, I told him next time he came he should not find one single
 louse.Laird and I have a nice snug little room together.That is one
 blessing here, we have plenty of sun.Very soon it will begin to get
 quite hot.I woke up on the 1st of March and thought of getting home
 last year that day, and two days after waking up in Eve’s dear little
 room, with the roses on the roof.Bless all you dear people.--Ever
 your loving aunt,

      ‘ELSIE.’

      ‘_March 23, 1917._

 ‘We have been awfully excited and interested in the news from
 Petrograd.We heard of it, probably long after you people at home
 knew all about it!It is most interesting to see how everybody is on
 the side of the change, from Russian officers, who come to tea and
 beam at us, and say, “Heresho” (good) to the men in the wards.In any
 case they say we shall find the difference all over the war area.One
 Russian officer, who was here before the news came, was talking about
 the Revolution in England two hundred years ago, and said it was the
 most interesting period of European history.“They say all these ideas
 began with the French Revolution, but they didn’t--they began long
 before in England,” he thought.He spoke English beautifully, and had
 had an English nurse.He had read Milton’s political pamphlets, and
 we wondered all the time whether he was thinking of changes in Russia
 after the war, but now I wonder if he knew the changes were coming
 sooner.‘Do you know we have all been given the St.Prince
 Dolgourokoff, who is in command on this front, arrived quite
 unexpectedly, just after roll call.The telegram saying he was coming
 arrived a quarter of an hour after he left!General Kropensky, the
 head of the Red Cross, rushed up, and the Prince arrived about two
 minutes after him.He went all over the hospital, and a member of
 his gilded staff told matron he was very pleased with everything.He decorated two men in the wards with St.George’s Medal, and then
 said he wanted to see us together, and shook hands with everybody and
 said, “Thank you,” and gave each of us a medal too; Dr.Laird’s was
 for service, as she had not been under fire.George’s Medal is a
 silver one with “For Bravery” on its back.Our patients were awfully
 pleased, and inpressed on us that it carried with it a pension of a
 rouble a month for life.We gave them all cigarettes to commemorate
 the occasion.‘It was rather satisfactory to see how the hospital looked in its
 ordinary, and even I was _fairly_ satisfied.I tell the unit that
 they must remember that they have an old maid as commandant, and must
 live up to it!I cannot stand dirt, and crooked charts and crumpled
 sheets.One Sister, I hear, put it delightfully in a letter home: “Our
 C.M.O.is an idealist!” I thought that was rather sweet; I believe she
 added, “but she does appreciate good work.” Certainly, I appreciate
 hers.She is in charge of the room for dressings, and it is one of the
 thoroughly satisfactory points in the hospital.‘The Greek priest came yesterday to bless the hospital.We put up
 “Icons” in each of the four wards.The Russians are a very religious
 people, and it seems to appeal to some mystic sense in them.The
 priest just put on a stole, green and gold, and came in his long grey
 cloak.The two wards open out of one another, so he held the service
 in one, the men all saying the responses and crossing themselves.The
 four icons lay on the table before him, with three lighted candles at
 the inner comers, and he blessed water and sprinkled them, and then he
 sprinkled everybody in the room.The icons were fixed up in the corner
 of the wards, and I bought little lamps to burn in front of them, as
 they always have them.We are going to have the evening hymn sung
 every evening at six o’clock.I heard that first in Serbia from those
 poor Russian prisoners, who sang it regularly every evening.The night nurses come up from the
 village literally wet through, having dragged one another out of mud
 holes all the way.Now, a cart goes down to fetch them each evening.We have twenty horses and nine carts belonging to us.I have made Vera
 Holme master of the horse.‘I have heard two delightful stories from the Sisters who have
 returned from Odessa.There is a great rivalry between the Armoured
 Car men and the British Red Cross men, about the capabilities of
 their Sisters.(We, it appears, are the Armoured Car Sisters!)man said their Sisters were so smart they got a man on to the
 operating-table five minutes after the other one went off.Said an
 Armoured Car man: “But that’s nothing.The Scottish Sisters get the
 second one on before the first one is off.” The other story runs that
 there was some idea of the men waiting all night on a quay, and the
 men said, “But you don’t think we are Scottish Sisters, sir, do you?”
 I have no doubt that refers to Galatz, where we made them work all
 night.’

      ‘RENI, _Easter Day, 1917_.‘We, all the patients, sick and wounded, belonging to the Army and
 Navy, and coming from different parts of the great, free Russia, who
 are at present in your hospital, are filled with feelings of the
 truest respect for you.We think it our duty as citizens on this
 beautiful day of Holy Easter to express to you, highly respected and
 much beloved Doctor, as well as to your whole Unit, our best thanks
 for all the care and attention you have bestowed upon us.We bow low
 and very respectfully before the constant and useful work which we
 have seen daily, and which we know to be for the well-being of our
 allied countries.‘We are quite sure that, thanks to the complete unity of action of
 all the allied countries, the hour of gladness and the triumph of the
 Allied arms in the cause of humanity and the honour of nations is near.‘_Vive l’Angleterre!_

      ‘Russian Soldiers, Citizens, and the Russian Sister,
      ’VERA V. DE KOLESNIKOFF.’

      ‘RENI, _March 2, 1917_.‘DARLING EVE,--Very many thanks for the war prayers.The Archbishop’s prayers that I wanted are the
 original ones at the beginning of the war.Just at present we are
 very lucky as regards the singing, as there are three or four capital
 voices in the unit.We have the service at 1.30 on Sunday.That lets
 all the morning work be finished.I do wonder what has become of Miss
 Henderson and the new orderlies!We want them all
 so badly, not to speak of my cool uniform.That will be needed very
 soon I think.We are having
 glorious weather, so sunny and warm.All the snow has gone, and the
 mud is appalling.I thought I knew the worst mud could do in Serbia,
 but it was nothing to this.We have made little tiled paths all about
 our domain, and keep comparatively clean there.I wish we could take
 over the lot of buildings.The other day I thought I had made a great
 score, and bought two thousand poud of wood at a very small price.It
 was thirty-five versts out.We got the Cossacks to lend us transport.But the transport stuck in the mud, and came back the next day, having
 had to haul the empty carts out of mud holes by harnessing four horses
 first to one cart and then to another.It was no wonder I got the wood
 so cheap.‘_April 18, 1918._

 ‘I am writing this sitting out in my little tent, with a glorious
 view over the Danube.We have pitched some of the tents to relieve
 the crowding in the house.They are no longer beautiful and white, as
 they were at Medgidia.We have had to stain them a dirty grey colour,
 so as to hide them from aeroplanes.Yesterday, we had an awful gale,
 and a downpour of rain, and the tents stood splendidly, and not a
 drop of water came through.Miss Pleister and the Austrian orderly
 who helped her to pitch them are triumphant.Do get our spy-incident,
 from the office.We had an awful
 two days, but it is quite a joke to look back on.The unit were most
 thoroughly and Britishly angry.But I very soon saw
 the other side, and managed to get them in hand once more.General
 Kropensky, our chief, was a perfect brick.The armoured car section
 sent a special despatch rider over to Galatz to fetch him, and he came
 off at once.He talks perfect English, and he has since written me a
 charming letter saying our _sang-froid_ and our _savoir-faire_ saved
 the situation.I am afraid there was not much _sang-froid_ among us,
 but some of us managed to keep hold of our common sense.As I told
 the girls, in common fairness they must look at the other side--spy
 fever raging, a foreign hospital right on the front, and a Revolution
 in progress.I told them, even if they did not care about Russia, I
 supposed they cared about the war and England, and I wondered what
 effect it would have on all these Russian soldiers if we went away
 with the thing not cleared up, and still under suspicion.After all,
 the ordinary Russian soldier knows nothing about England, except in
 the very concrete form of _us_.We should have played right into the
 devil’s hands if we had gone away.Of course, they saw it at once,
 and we stuck to our guns for England’s sake.The 6th Army, I think,
 understands that England, as represented by this small unit, is keen
 on the war, and does not spy!We have had a telegram from the General
 in command, apologising, and our patients have been perfectly angelic.And the men from all regiments round come up to the out-patients’
 department, and are most grateful and punctiliously polite.You know the Russian greeting
 on Easter morning, “Christ is risen,” and the answer, “He is risen
 indeed.” We learnt them both, and made our greetings in Russian
 fashion.On Easter Eve we went to the church in the village.The church was crowded with soldiers--very
 few women there.They were most reverent and absorbed outside in the
 courtyards.It was a very curious scene; little groups of people with
 lighted candles waiting to get in.Here, we had a very nice Easter
 service.My “choir” had three lovely Easter hymns, and we even sang
 the Magnificat.One of the armoured car men, on his way from Galatz
 to Belgrade, stayed for the service, and it was nice to have a man’s
 voice in the singing.Except that we are very idle, we are very happy here.Our patients are
 delightful, the hospital in good order.The Steppe is a fascinating
 place to wander over, the little valleys, and the villages hidden
 away in them, and the flowers!We have been riding our transport
 horses--rather rough, but quite nice and gentle.We all ride astride
 of course.‘_On Active Service._

      ‘To Mrs.FLINDERS PETRIE,
      Hon.Sec., Scottish Women’s Hospitals.‘RENI, _May 8, 1917_.PETRIE,--How perfectly splendid about the Egyptologists.Miss Henderson brought me your message, saying how splendidly they are
 subscribing.That is of course all due to you, you wonderful woman.It was such a tantalising thing to hear that you had actually thought
 of coming out as an Administrator, and that you found you could not.I cannot tell you how splendid it would have been if you could have
 come.... I want “a woman of the world”... and I want an adaptable
 person, who will talk to the innumerable officers who swarm about this
 place, and ride with the girls, and manage the officials!‘I do wish you could see our hospital now.Such a nice story:--Matron was in Reni the other day, seeing the
 Commandant of the town about some things for the hospital, and when
 she came out she found a crowd of Russian soldiers standing round her
 house.They asked her if she had got what she wanted, and she said the
 Commandant was going to see about it.Whereupon the men said, “The
 Commandant must be told that the Scottish Hospital (_Schottlandsche
 bolnitza_) is the best hospital on this front, and must have whatever
 it wants.That is the opinion of the Russian Soldier.” Do you
 recognise the echo of the big reverberation that has shaken Russia.We get on awfully well with the Russian soldier.Two of our patients
 were overheard talking the other day, and they said, “The Russian
 Sisters are pretty but not good, and the English Sisters are good
 and not pretty.” The story was brought up to the mess-room by quite
 a nice-looking girl who had overheard it.But we thought we’d let
 the judgment stand and be like Kingsley’s “maid”--though we _don’t_
 undertake to endorse the Russian part of it!‘We have got some of the _personnel_ tents pitched now, and it is
 delightful.It was rather close quarters in the little house.I am
 writing in my tent now, looking out over the Danube.Such a lovely
 place, Reni is--and the Steppe is fascinating with its wide plains and
 little unexpected valleys full of flowers.The other night our camp was the centre of a fight.They are drilling recruits here, and suddenly the other
 night we found ourselves being defended by one party while another
 attacked from the Steppe.The battle raged all night, and the camp was
 finally carried at four o’clock in the morning amid shouts and cheers
 and barking of dogs.It was even too much for me, and I have slept
 through bombardments.‘It has been so nice hearing about you all from Miss Henderson.How
 splendidly the money is coming in.Petrie,
 _do_ make them send the reliefs more quickly.I know all about boats,
 but, as you knew the orderlies had to leave on the 15th of January,
 the reliefs ought to have been off by the 1st.‘I wish you could hear the men singing their evening hymn in hospital.I am so glad we thought of putting up the
 icons for them.‘Good-bye for the present, dear Mrs.My kindest regards to
 Professor Flinders Petrie.--Ever yours affectionately,

      ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

      ‘_May 11, 1917._

 ‘It was delightful seeing Miss Henderson, and getting news of all you
 dear people.But she did arrive
 with all her equipment.The equipment I wired for in October, and
 which was sent out by itself, arrived in Petrograd, got through to
 Jassy, and has there stuck.We have not got a single thing, and the
 Consuls have done their best.French, one of the chaplains in Petrograd, came here.He said
 he would have some services here.We pitched a tent, and we had the
 Communion.I have sent down a notice to the armoured car
 yacht, and I hope some of the men will come up.We and they are the
 only English people here.‘The Serbs have sent me a message saying we may have to rejoin our
 Division soon.I don’t put too much weight on this, because I know
 my dearly beloved Serbs, and their habit of saying the thing they
 think you would like, but still we are preparing.I shall be very
 sorry to leave our dear little hospital here, and the Russians.They
 are a fascinating people, especially the common soldier.I hope that
 as we have done this work for the Russians and therefore have some
 little claim on them, it will help us to get things more easily for
 the Serbs.We have one little laddie in, about ten years old, the
 most amusing brat.He was wounded by an aeroplane bomb in a village
 seven versts out, and was sent into Reni to a hospital.But, when he
 got there he found the hospital was for sick only (a very inferior
 place!He wanders about with a Russian
 soldier’s cap on his head and wrapped round with a blanket, and we
 hear his pretty little voice singing to himself all over the place.‘Nicolai, the man who came in when the hospital was first opened,
 and has been so very ill, is really getting better.He had his
 dressing left for two days for the first time the other day, and his
 excitement and joy were quite pathetic.“_Ochin heroshe doktorutza,
 ochin herosho_” (Very good, dear doctor, very good), he kept saying,
 and then he added, “Now, I know I am not going to die!” Poor boy,
 he has nearly died several times, and would have died if he had not
 had English Sisters to nurse him.He has been awfully naughty--the
 wretch.He bit one of the Sisters one day when she tried to give him
 his medicine.Now, he kisses my hand to make up.The other day I
 ordered massage for his leg, and he made the most awful row, howled
 and whined, and declared it would hurt (really, he has had enough pain
 to destroy anybody’s nerve), and then suddenly pointed to a Sister who
 had come in, and said what she had done for him was the right thing.I asked what she had done for him; “Massaged his leg,” she said.I
 got that promptly translated into Russian, and the whole room roared
 with laughter.Poor Nicolai--after a minute, he joined in.His home
 is in Serbia, “a very nice home with a beautiful garden.” His mother
 is evidently the important person there.His father is a smith, and
 he had meant to be a smith too, but now he has got the St.George’s
 Cross, which carries with it a pension of six roubles a month, and he
 does not think he will do any work at all.He is the eldest of the
 family, twenty-four years old, and has three sisters, and a little
 brother of five.Can’t you imagine how he was spoilt!and how proud
 they are of him now, only twenty-four, and a _sous-officier_, and
 been awarded the St.George’s Cross which is better than the medal;
 and been wounded, four months in hospital, and had three operations!He has been so ill I am afraid the spoiling continued in the Scottish
 Women’s Hospital.Laird says she would not be his future wife for
 anything.‘We admitted such a nice-looking boy to-day, with thick, curly, yellow
 hair, which I had ruthlessly cropped, against his strong opposition.I
 doubt if I should have had the heart, if I had known how ill he was.I found him this evening with
 tears running silently over his cheeks, a Cossack, a great big man.He may have to go on to Odessa, as a severe
 operation and bombs and a nervous breakdown don’t go together.‘We have made friends with lots of the officers; there is one, also
 a Cossack, who spends a great part of his time here.His regiment is
 at the front, and he has been left for some special work, and he seems
 rather lonely.He is a nice boy, and brings nice horses for us to
 ride.We have been having quite a lot of riding, on our own transport
 horses too.It is heavenly riding here across the great plain.We all
 ride astride, and at first we found the Cossacks’ saddles most awfully
 uncomfortable, but now we are quite used to them.Our days fly past
 here, and in a sense are monotonous, but I don’t think we are any of
 us the worse for a little monotony as an interlude!quite fairly
 often there is a party at one of the regiments here!The girls enjoy
 them, and matron and I chaperone them alternately and reluctantly.It
 was quite a rest during Lent when there were no parties.‘The spy incident has quite ended, and we have won.Matron was in Reni
 the other day asking the Commandant about something, and when she came
 out she found a little crowd of Russian soldiers round her house.They
 asked her if she had got what she wanted, and she said the Commandant
 had said he would see about it.They answered, “The Commandant must
 be told that the S.W.H.is the best hospital on this front, and that
 it must have everything it wants.” That is the opinion of the Russian
 soldier!If you were here you would recognise the new tone of the
 Russian soldier in these days,--but I am glad he approves of our
 hospital.’

      ‘ODESSA, _June 24, 1917_.‘I wish you could realise how the little nations, Serbs and Rumanians
 and Poles, count on us.What a comfort it is to them to think we are
 “the most tenacious” nation in Europe.In their eyes it all hangs on
 us.I don’t believe we can disentangle
 it all in our minds just now.The only thing is just to go on doing
 one’s bit.Because, one thing is quite clear, Europe won’t be a
 habitable place if Germany wins--for anybody.‘I think there are going to be a lot of changes here.’

      ‘_July 15, 1917._

 ‘I have had German measles!The Consul asked me what I meant by that
 at my time of life!The majority of people say how unpatriotic and
 Hunnish of you!Well, a few days off did not do me any harm.I had
 a very luxurious time lying in my tent.The last lot of orderlies
 brought it out.’

      ‘ODESSA, _Aug.‘The work at Reni is coming to an end, and we are to go to the front
 with the Serbian Division.I cannot write about it owing to censors
 and people.But I am going to risk this: the Serbs ought to be most
 awfully proud.The Russian General on the front is going to insist on
 having them “to stiffen up his Russian troops.” I think you people at
 home ought to know what magnificent fighting men these Serbs are, and
 so splendidly disciplined, simply worth their weight in gold.There
 are only two divisions of them after all.We have about thirty-five of
 them in hospital just now as sanitaries, and they are such a comfort;
 their quickness and their devotion is wonderful.The hospital was full
 and overflowing when I left--still Russians.Most of the cases were
 slight; a great many left hands, if you know what that _means_.I
 don’t think the British Army does know!‘We had a Red Cross inspecting officer down from Petrograd.He was
 very pleased with everything, and kissed my hand on departing, and
 said we were doing great things for the Alliance.I wanted to say many
 things, but thought I had better leave it alone.‘We are operating at 5 A.M.now, because the afternoons are so hot.The other day we began at 5, and had to go till 4 P.M.‘Matron and I had a delightful ride the other evening.Just as we
 had turned for home, an aeroplane appeared, and the first shot from
 the anti-aircraft guns close beside us was too much for our horses,
 who promptly bolted.However, there was nothing but the clear Steppe
 before us, so we just sat tight and went.After a little they
 recovered themselves, and really behaved very well.’

      ‘_Aug.28._

 ‘You dear, dear people, how sweet of you to send me a telegram for
 my birthday.You don’t know how nice it was to get it and to feel you
 were thinking of me.Miss G. brought it
 me with a very puzzled face, and said, “I cannot quite make out this
 telegram.” It was written in Russian characters.She evidently was not
 used to people doing such mad things as telegraphing the “Many happy
 returns of the day” half across the world.I understood it at once,
 and it nearly made me cry.It was good to get it, though I think the
 Food Controller or somebody ought to come down on you for wasting
 money in the middle of a war.‘I am finishing this letter in Reni.We closed the hospital yesterday,
 and joined our Division somewhere on Friday.The rush that had begun
 before I got to Odessa got much worse.They had an awfully busy time,
 a faint reminiscence of Galatz, though, as they were operating twelve
 hours on end, I don’t know it was so very faint.We had no more left
 hands, but all the bad cases.Everybody worked magnificently, but they
 always do in a push.The time a British unit goes to pieces is when
 there is nothing to do!‘So this bit of work ends, eight months.I am quite sorry to leave it,
 but quite quite glad to get back to our Division.‘Well, Amy dearest, good-bye for the present.Love to all you dear people.’

      ‘S.W.H.,
      ‘HADJI ABDUL, _Oct.‘I wonder if this is my last letter from Russia!We hope to be off
 in a very few days now.We have had a very pleasant time in this
 place with its Turkish name.We are with the Division, and were given this perfectly beautiful
 camping-ground, with trees, and a <DW72> towards the east.The question
 was whether we were going to Rumania or elsewhere.It is nice being
 back with these nice people.They have been most kind and friendly,
 and we have picnics and rides and _dances_, and dinners, and till this
 turmoil of the move began we had an afternoon reception every day
 under the walnut trees!Now, we are packed up and ready to go, and I
 mean to walk in on you one morning.‘We shall have about two months to refit, but one of those is my due
 as a holiday, _which I am going to take_.I’ll see you all soon.--Your
 loving aunt,

      ‘ELSIE.’

_To Mrs.Simson_

      ‘ARCHANGEL, _Nov.Have not been very well; nothing to worry about.Shall report in London, then come straight to you.‘INGLIS.’




CHAPTER XI

THE MOORINGS CUT

    ‘Not I, but my Unit.’

    ‘My dear Unit, good-bye.’--Nov.‘Into the wide deep seas which we call God
    You plunged.This is not death,
    You seemed to say, but fuller life.’

The reports of Dr.Inglis as chief medical officer to the London
Committee were as detailed and foreseeing in the very last one that
she wrote as in the first from on board the transport that took her
and her unit out.She writes:--‘In view of the fact that we are in the
middle of big happenings I should like Dr.Laird to bring ½ ton cotton
wool, six bales moss dressings, 100 lb.ether, 20
gallons rectified spirits.I wonder what news of the river boat for
Mesopotamia?’ After they had landed and were at work:--‘I have wired
asking for another hospital for the base.I know you have your hands
full, but I also know that if the people at home realise what their
help would mean out here just now, we would not have to ask twice.And
again:--’Keep the home fires burning and let us feel their warmth.’ She
soon encountered the usual obstacles:--‘I saw that there was no good in
the world talking about regular field hospitals to them until they had
tried our mettle.The ordinary male disbelief in our capacity cannot
be argued away.It can only be worked away.’ So she acted.Russia
created disbelief, but the men at arms of all nations saw and believed.In November she wrote back incredulously:--‘Rumours of falling back.Anxious about the equipment.’ In bombardments, in
retreat, and evacuations the equipment was her one thought.‘Stand by
the equipment’ became a joke in her unit.On one occasion one of the
orderlies had a heavy fall from a lorry on which she was in charge of
the precious stuff.Dusty and shaken, she was gathering herself up,
when the voice of the chief rang out imperatively urgent, ‘Stand by the
equipment.’ On the rail certain trucks, bearing all the equipment, got
on a wrong line, and were carried away:--‘The blue ribbon belongs to
Miss Borrowman and Miss Brown.They saw our wagons disappearing with
a refugee train, whereupon these two ran after it and jumped on, and
finally brought the equipment safely to Galatz.They invented a General
Popovitch who would be very angry if it did not get through.Without
those two girls and their ingenuity, the equipment would not have got
through.’

She details all the difficulties of packing up and evacuating after
the despatch rider came with the order that the hospitals were to
fall back to Galatz.The only method their own, all else chaotic and
helpless, working night and day, the unit accomplished everything.At
the station, packed with a country and army in flight, Dr.Inglis had a
talk with a Rumanian officer.He told her that he had been in Glasgow,
and had there been invited out to dinner, and had seen ‘English
customs.’ ‘It was good to feel those English customs were still going
on quietly, whatever was happening here, breakfast coming regularly and
hot water for baths, and everything as it should be.It was probably
absurd, but it came like a great wave of comfort to feel that England
was there quiet and strong and invincible behind everything and
everybody.’

As we read these natural vivid diary reports, we too can feel it was
good of England that Dr.Inglis was to the last on that front--

    ‘Ambassador from Britain’s Crown,
      And type of all her race.’

Dr.Inglis never lost sight of the Army she went out to serve.She
refused to return unless they were brought away from the Russian front
with her.‘I wonder if a proper account of what happened then went home to
 the English papers?The Serbian Division went into the fight 15,000
 strong.They were in the centre--the Rumanians on their left, and the
 Russians on their right.The Rumanians broke, and they fought for
 twenty-four hours on two fronts.They came out of the fight, having
 lost 11,000 men.It is almost incredible, and that is when we ought to
 have been out, and could have been out if we had not taken so long to
 get under way.’

In the last Report, dated October 29, 1917, she tells her Committee she
has been ‘tied by the leg to bed.’ There are notes on coming events:--

 ‘There really seems a prospect of getting away soon.The Foreign
 Office knows us only too well.Only 6000 of the Division go in this
 lot, the rest (15,000) to follow.’

There is a characteristic last touch.‘I have asked Miss Onslow to get English paper-back novels for the
 unit on their journey.At a certain shop, they can be got for a rouble
 each, and good ones.’

To members of that unit, doctors, sisters, orderlies, we are indebted
for many personal details, and for the story of the voyage west,
when for her the sun was setting.Her work was accomplished when on
the transport with her and her unit were the representatives of that
Serbian Army with whom she served, faithful unto death.Miss Arbuthnot, the granddaughter of Sir William Muir, the friend of
John Inglis, was one of those who helped to nurse Dr.Inglis:--

 ‘I sometimes looked after her when the Sister attending her was
 off duty.Her consideration and kindness were quite extraordinary,
 while her will and courage were quite indomitable.To die as she did
 in harness, having completed her great work in getting the Serbs away
 from Russia, is what she would have chosen.Inglis at Hadji Abdul, a small mud village about ten
 miles from Galatz.She was looking very ill, but was always busy.For
 some time she had been ill with dysentery, but she never even stayed
 in bed for breakfast till it was impossible for her to move from bed.‘During our time at Hadji we had about forty Serbian patients, a few
 wounded, but mostly sick.Inglis did a few minor operations, but
 her last major one was a gastro-enterotomy performed on one of our own
 chauffeurs, a Serb, Joe, by name.The operation took three hours and
 was entirely satisfactory, although Dr.Inglis did not consider him
 strong enough to travel back to England.She was particularly fond of
 this man, and took no end of trouble with him.Even after she became
 so very ill she used constantly to visit him.‘The Serbs entertained us to several picnics, which we duly returned.Inglis was always an excellent hostess, so charming and genial
 to every one, and so eager that both entertainers and entertained
 should equally enjoy themselves.Provided her permission was asked
 first, and duty hours or regular meals not neglected, she was always
 keen every one should enjoy themselves riding, walking, or going for
 picnics.If any one was ill, she never insisted on their getting up
 in spite of everything, as most doctors, and certainly all matrons,
 wish us to do.She was strict during duty hours, and always required
 implicit obedience to her orders--whatever they were.She was always
 so well groomed--never a hair out of place.One felt so proud of her among the dirty and generally
 unsuitably dressed women in other hospitals.She was very independent,
 and would never allow any of us to wait on her.The cooks were not
 allowed to make her any special dishes that the whole unit could not
 share.As long as she could, she messed with the unit, and there was
 no possibility of avoiding her quick eye; anything which was reserved
 for her special comfort was rejected.Once, a portion of chicken was
 kept as a surprise for her.She asked whether there had been enough
 for all, and when the cooks reluctantly confessed there was only the
 one portion she sent it away.‘During one of the evacuations, an order had been given that there
 were only two blankets allowed in each valise.Some one, mindful of
 her weakness, stuffed an extra one into Dr.Inglis’ bag, because in
 her emaciated condition she suffered much from the cold.It stirred
 her to impetuous anger, and with something of the spirit of David, as
 he poured out the water brought him at the peril of the lives of his
 followers, she flung the blanket out of the railway carriage, as a
 lesson to those of her unit who had disobeyed an order.Inglis read the Church service with great dignity
 and simplicity.On the weekday evenings, before she became so ill,
 she would join us in a game of bridge, and played nearly every night.During the retreats when nothing more could be done, and she felt
 anxious, she would sit down and play a game of patience.During the
 weeks of uncertainty, when the future of the Serbs was doubtful, and
 she was unable to take any active part, she fretted very much.‘After endless conflicting rumours and days of waiting, the
 news arrived that they were to go to England.Her delight was
 extraordinary, for she had lain in her bed day after day planning how
 she could help them, and sending endless wires to those in authority
 in England, but feeling herself very impotent.Once the good news
 arrived, her marvellous courage and tenacity helped her to recover
 sufficiently, and prepare all the details for the journey with the
 Serbs.We left on the 29th October, with the H.G.Staff and two
 thousand Serbian soldiers, in a special train going to Archangel.Inglis spent fifteen days on the train, in a second-class
 compartment, with no proper bed.Her strength varied, but she was
 compelled to lie down a great deal, although she insisted on dressing
 every morning.On two occasions she walked for five minutes on the
 station platform; each time it absolutely exhausted her.Though she
 suffered much pain and discomfort, she never complained.She could
 only have benger, chicken broth and condensed milk, and she often
 found it impossible to take even these.If one happened to bring her
 tea, or her food, she thanked one so charmingly.‘At Archangel there was no means of carrying her on to the boat, so
 with help (one orderly in front, and one lifting her behind), she
 climbed a ladder twenty feet high, from the platform to the deck of
 the transport.She was a good sailor, and had a comfortable cabin on
 the ship.She improved on board slightly, and used to sit in the small
 cabin allotted to us on the upper deck.She played patience, and was
 interested in our sea-sick symptoms.There was a young naval officer
 very seriously ill on the boat.Our people were nursing him, and she
 constantly went to prescribe; she feared he would not live, and he
 died before we reached our port.Inglis had a relapse; violent pain set
 in, and she had to return to bed.Even then, a few days before we
 reached England, she insisted on going through all the accounts,
 and prepared fresh plans to take the unit on to join the Serbs at
 Salonika.In six weeks she expected to be ready to start.She sent for
 each of us in turn, and asked if we would go with her.Needless to
 say, only those who could not again leave home, refused, and then with
 the deepest regret.Inglis
 had a violent attack of pain, and had no sleep all night.Next morning
 she insisted on getting up to say good-bye to the Serbian staff.‘It was a wonderful example of her courage and fortitude, to see her
 standing unsupported--a splendid figure of quiet dignity.Her face
 ashen and drawn like a mask, dressed in her worn uniform coat, with
 the faded ribbons that had seen such good service.As the officers
 kissed her hand, and thanked her for all she had done for them, she
 said to each of them a few words accompanied with her wonderful smile.’

As they looked on her, they also must have understood, ‘sorrowing most
of all, that they should see her face no more.’

 ‘After that parting was over, Dr.She left the boat Sunday afternoon, 25th November, and
 arrived quite exhausted at the hotel.I was allowed to see her for
 a minute before the unit left for London that night.She could only
 whisper, but was as sweet and patient as she ever was.She said we
 should meet soon in London.’

After her death, many who had watched her through these strenuous
years, regretted that she did not take more care of herself.Symptoms
of the disease appeared so soon, she must have known what overwork and
war rations meant in her state.This may be said of every follower of
the One who saved others, but could not save Himself.The life story
of Saint and Pioneer is always the same.To continue to ill-treat
‘brother body’ meant death to St.Francis; to remain in the fever
swamps of Africa meant death to Livingstone.The poor, and the freedom
of the slave, were the common cause for which both these laid down
their lives.Of the same spirit was this daughter of our race.Had she
remained at home on her return from Serbia she might have been with us
to-day, but we should not have the woman we now know, and for whom we
give thanks on every remembrance of her.Miss Arbuthnot makes no allusion to
its dangers.Everything written by the ‘unit’ is instinct with the
high courage of their leader.We know now how great were the perils
surrounding the transports on the North seas.Old, and unseaworthy, the
menace below, the storm above, through the night of the Arctic Circle,
she was safely brought to the haven where all would be.More than once
death in open boats was a possibility to be faced; there were seven
feet of water in the engine-room, and only the stout hearts of her
captain and crew knew all the dangers of their long watch and ward.As the transport entered the Tyne a blizzard swept over the country.We who waited for news on shore wondered where on the cold grey seas
laboured the ship bringing home ‘Dr.Elsie and her unit.’

In her last hours she told her own people of the closing days on
board:--

 ‘When we left Orkney we had a dreadful passage, and even after we got
 into the river it was very rough.We were moored lower down, and,
 owing to the high wind and storm, a big liner suddenly bore down upon
 us, and came within a foot of cutting us in two, when our moorings
 broke, we swung round, and were saved.I said to the one who told
 me--“Who cut our moorings?” She answered, “No one cut them, they
 broke.”’

There was a pause, and then to her own she broke the knowledge that she
had heard the call and was about to obey the summons.‘The same hand who cut our moorings then is cutting mine now, and I am
 going forth.’

Her niece Evelyn Simson notes how they heard of the arrival:--

 ‘A wire came on Friday from Aunt Elsie, saying they had arrived in
 Newcastle.We tried all Saturday to get news by wire and ’phone,
 but got none.We think now this was because the first news came by
 wireless, and they did not land till Sunday.‘Aunt Elsie answered our prepaid wire, simply saying, “I am in bed, do
 not telephone for a few days.” I was free to start off by the night
 train, and arrived about 2 A.M.were
 at the Station Hotel, and I saw Aunt Elsie’s name in the book.I did
 not like to disturb her at that hour, and went to my room till 7.30.I
 found her alone; the night nurse was next door.She was surprised to
 see me, as she thought it would be noon before any one could arrive.She looked terribly wasted, but she gave me such a strong embrace that
 I never thought the illness was more than what might easily be cured
 on land, with suitable diet.‘I felt her pulse, and she said.“It is not very good, Eve dear, I
 know, for I have a pulse that beats in my head, and I know it has been
 dropping beats all night.” She wanted to know all about every one, and
 we had a long talk before any one came in.Ward had been to her, always, and we arranged that Dr.Aunt Elsie then packed me off to get some breakfast, and
 Dr.Ward told me she was much worse than she had been the night before.‘I telephoned to Edinburgh saying she was “very ill.” When Dr.Williams came, I learnt that there was practically no hope of her
 living.They started injections and oxygen, and Aunt Elsie said, “Now
 don’t think we didn’t think of all these things before, but on board
 ship nothing was possible.”

 ‘It was not till Dr.Williams’ second visit that she asked me if the
 doctor thought “this was the end.” When she saw that it was so, she
 at once said, without pause or hesitation, “Eve, it will be grand
 starting a new job over there,”--then, with a smile, “although there
 are two or three jobs here I would like to have finished.” After this
 her whole mind seemed taken up with the sending of last messages to
 her committees, units, friends, and relations.It simply amazed me how
 she remembered every one down to her grand-nieces and nephews.When I
 knew mother and Aunt Eva were on their way, I told her, and she was
 overjoyed.Early in the morning she told me wonderful things about
 bringing back the Serbs.I found it very hard to follow, as it was an
 unknown story to me.I clearly remember she went one day to the Consul
 in Odessa, and said she must wire certain things.She was told she
 could only wire straight to the War Office--“and so I got into touch
 straight with the War Office.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren at one moment commented--“You have done magnificent
 work.” Back swiftly came her answer, “Not I, but my unit.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren says: ‘Mrs.Simson and I arrived at Newcastle on Monday
 evening.It was a glorious experience to be with her those last two
 hours.She was emaciated almost beyond recognition, but all sense
 of her bodily weakness was lost in the grip one felt of the strong
 alert spirit, which dominated every one in the room.She was clear
 in her mind, and most loving to the end.The words she greeted us
 with were--“So, I am going over to the other side.” When she saw we
 could not believe it, she said, with a smile, “For a long time I
 _meant_ to live, but now I _know_ I am going.” She spoke naturally
 and expectantly of going over.Certainly she met the unknown with a
 cheer!As the minutes passed she seemed to be entering into some great
 experience, for she kept repeating, “This is wonderful--but this is
 wonderful.” Then, she would notice that some one of us was standing,
 and she would order us to sit down--another chair must be brought if
 there were not enough.To the end, she would revert to small details
 for our comfort.As flesh and heart failed, she seemed to be breasting
 some difficulty, and in her own strong way, without distress or fear,
 she asked for help, “You must all of you help me through this.” We
 repeated to her many words of comfort.Again and again she answered
 back, “I know.” One, standing at the foot of the bed, said to her,
 “You will give my love to father”; instantly the humorous smile lit
 her face, and she answered, “Of course I will.”

 ‘At her own request her sister read to her words of the life
 beyond--“Let not your heart be troubled--In my Father’s house are many
 mansions; if it were not so I would have told you,” and, even as they
 watched her, she fell on sleep.‘After she had left us, there remained with those that loved her only
 a great sense of triumph and perfect peace.The room seemed full of a
 glorious presence.One of us said, “This is not death; it makes one
 wish to follow after.”’

As ‘We’ waited those anxious weeks for the news of the arrival of Dr.Inglis and her Army, there were questionings, how we should welcome
and show her all love and service.The news quickly spread she was not
well--might be delayed in reaching London; the manner of greeting her
must be to ensure rest.The storm had spent itself, and the moon was riding high in a cloudless
heaven, when others waiting in Edinburgh on the 26th learnt the news
that she too had passed through the storm and shadows, and had crossed
the bar.That her work here was to end with her life had not entered the minds
of those who watched for her return, overjoyed to think of seeing her
face once more.She had concealed her mortal weakness so completely,
that even to her own the first note of warning had come with the words
that she had landed, but was in bed:--‘then we thought it was time one
of us should go to her.’

Her people brought her back to the city of her fathers, and to the
hearts who had sent her forth, and carried her on the wings of their
strong confidence.There was to be no more going forth of her active
feet in the service of man, and all that was mortal was carried for
the last time into the church she had loved so well.Then we knew and
understood that she had been called where His servants shall serve Him.The Madonna lilies, the lilies of France and of the fields, were placed
around her.Over her hung the torn banners of Scotland’s history.The
Scottish women had wrapped their country’s flag around them in one of
their hard-pressed flights.On her coffin, as she lay looking to the
East in high St.Giles’, were placed the flags of Great Britain and
Serbia.She had worn ‘the faded ribbons’ of the orders bestowed on her by
France, Russia, and Serbia.It has often been asked at home and abroad
why she had received no decorations at the hands of her Sovereign.It
is not an easy question to answer.Inglis was buried, amid marks of respect
and recognition which make that passing stand alone in the history of
the last rites of any of her fellow-citizens.Great was the company
gathered within the church.The chancel was filled by her family and
relatives--her Suffrage colleagues, representatives from all the
societies, the officials of the hospitals and hostels she had founded
at home, the units whom she had led and by whose aid she had done great
things abroad.Last and first of all true-hearted mourners the people
of Serbia represented by their Minister and members of the Legation.The chief of the Scottish Command was present, and by his orders
military honours were paid to this happy warrior of the Red Cross.The service had for its keynote the Hallelujah Chorus, which was played
as the procession left St.It was a thanksgiving instinct with
triumph and hope.The Resurrection and the Life was in prayer and
praise.The Dean of the Order of the Thistle revealed the thoughts of
many hearts in his farewell words:--

 ‘We are assembled this day with sad but proud and grateful hearts to
 remember before God a very dear and noble lady, our beloved sister,
 Elsie Inglis, who has been called to her rest.We mourn only for
 ourselves, not for her.She has died as she lived, in the clear light
 of faith and self-forgetfulness, and now her name is linked for ever
 with the great souls who have led the van of womanly service for God
 and man.A wondrous union of strength and tenderness, of courage
 and sweetness, she remains for us a bright and noble memory of high
 devotion and stainless honour.Especially to-day, in the presence of
 representatives of the land for which she died, we think of her as an
 immortal link between Serbia and Scotland, and as a symbol of that
 high courage which will sustain us, please God, till that stricken
 land is once again restored, and till the tragedy of war is eradicated
 and crowned with God’s great gifts of peace and of righteousness.’

The buglers of the Royal Scots sounded ‘the Reveille to the waking
morn,’ and the coffin with the Allied flags was placed on the gun
carriage.Women were in the majority of the massed crowd that awaited
the last passing.‘Why did they no gie her the V.C.?’ asked the
shawl-draped women holding the bairns of her care: these and many
another of her fellow-citizens lined the route and followed on foot
the long road across the city.As the procession was being formed,
Dr.Inglis’ last message was put into the hands of the members of the
London Committee for S.W.H.It ran:--

      ‘_November 26, 1917._

 ‘So sorry I cannot come to London.Will send Gwynn in a day or two with
 explanations and suggestions.Colonel Miliantinovitch and Colonel
 Tcholah Antitch were to make appointment this week or next from
 Winchester; do see them, and also as many of the committee as possible
 and show them every hospitality.They have been very kind to us, and
 whatever happens, dear Miss Palliser, do beg the Committee to make
 sure that they (the Serbs) have their hospitals and transport, for
 they do need them.‘Many thanks to the Committee for their kindness to me and their
 support of me.‘Dictated to Miss Evelyn Simson.’

How the people loved her!was the thought, as she passed through the
grief-stricken crowds.These, who knew her best, smiled as they said
one to another, ‘How all this would surprise her!’

Edinburgh is a city of spires and of God’s acres, the graves cut in
the living rock, within gardens and beside running waters.Across the
Water of Leith the long procession wound its way.Within sight of the
grave, it was granted to her grateful brethren, the representatives
of the Serbian nation, to carry her coffin, and lower it to the place
where the mortal in her was to lie in its last rest.Her life’s story
was grouped around her--the Serbian officers, the military of her own
nation at war, the women comrades of the common cause, the poor and
suffering--to one and all she had been the inspiring succourer.November mists had drifted all day across the city, veiling the
fortress strength of Scotland, and the wild wastes of seas over which
she had returned home to our island strength.Even as we turned and
left her, the grey clouds at eventide were transfused and glorified by
the crimson glow of the sunset on the hills of Time.Printed in Great Britain by T. and A. CONSTABLE, Printers to His

It is ideal, this student life with its student loves of four years, but
is it right to many an honest little comrade, who seldom knows an hour
when she is away from her ami?who has suffered and starved and slaved
with him through years of days of good and bad luck--who has encouraged
him in his work, nursed him when ill, and made a thousand golden hours
in this poet's or painter's life so completely happy, that he looks back
on them in later life as never-to-be-forgotten?He remembers the good
dinners at the little restaurant near his studio, where they dined among
the old crowd.There were Lavaud the sculptor and Francine, with the
figure of a goddess; Moreau, who played the cello at the opera; little
Louise Dumont, who posed at Julian's, and old Jacquemart, the very soul
of good fellowship, who would set them roaring with his inimitable
humor.What good dinners they were!--and how long they sat over their coffee
and cigarettes under the trees in front of this little restaurant--often
ten and twelve at a time, until more tables had to be pushed together
for others of their good friends, who in passing would be hailed to join
them.And how Marguerite used to sing all through dinner and how they
would all sing, until it grew so late and so dark that they had to puff
their cigarettes aglow over their plates, and yell to Madame Giraud for
a light!And how the old lady would bustle out with the little oil lamp,
placing it in the center of the long table amid the forest of vin
ordinaires, with a "Voila, mes enfants!"and a cheery word for all these
good boys and girls, whom she regarded quite as her own children.It seemed to them then that there would never be anything else but
dinners at Madame Giraud's for as many years as they pleased, for no one
ever thought of living out one's days, except in this good Bohemia of
Paris.They could not imagine that old Jacquemart would ever die, or
that La Belle Louise would grow old, and go back to Marseilles, to live
with her dried-up old aunt, who sold garlic and bad cheese in a little
box of a shop, up a crooked street!Or that Francine would marry Martin,
the painter, and that the two would bury themselves in an adorable
little spot in Brittany, where they now live in a thatched farm-house,
full of Martin's pictures, and have a vegetable garden of their own--and
a cow--and some children![Illustration: A STUDIO DEJEUNER]

And those memorable dinners in the old studio back of the Gare
Montparnasse!when paints and easels were pushed aside, and the table
spread, and the piano rolled up beside it.There was the buying of the
chicken, and the salad that Francine would smother in a dressing into
which she would put a dozen different things--herbs and spices and tiny
white onions!And what a jolly crowd came to these impromptu feasts!How they danced and sang until the gray
morning light would creep in through the big skylight, when all these
good bohemians would tiptoe down the waxed stairs, and slip past the
different ateliers for fear of waking those painters who might be
asleep--a thought that never occurred to them until broad daylight, and
the door had been opened, after hours of pandemonium and music and
noise!In a little hotel near the Odeon, there lived a family of just such
bohemians--six struggling poets, each with an imagination and a love of
good wine and good dinners and good times that left them continually in
a state of bankruptcy!As they really never had any money--none that
ever lasted for more than two days and two nights at the utmost, their
good landlord seldom saw a sou in return for his hospitable roof, which
had sheltered these six great minds who wrote of the moon, and of fate,
and fortune, and love.For days they would dream and starve and write.Then followed an auction
sale of the total collection of verses, hawked about anywhere and
everywhere among the editeurs, like a crop of patiently grown fruit.Having sold it, literally by the yard, they would all saunter up the
"Boul' Miche," and forget their past misery, in feasting, to their
hearts' content, on the good things of life.On days like these, you
would see them passing, their black-brimmed hats adjusted jauntily over
their poetic locks--their eyes beaming with that exquisite sense of
feeling suddenly rich, that those who live for art's sake know!The
keenest of pleasures lie in sudden contrasts, and to these six poetic,
impractical Bohemians, thus suddenly raised from the slough of despond
to a state where they no longer trod with mortals--their cup of
happiness was full and spilling over.They must not only have a good
time, but so must every one around them.With their great riches, they
would make the world gay as long as it lasted, for when it was over they
knew how sad life would be.For a while--then they would scratch
away--and have another auction![Illustration: DAYLIGHT]

Unlike another good fellow, a painter whom I once knew, who periodically
found himself without a sou, and who would take himself, in despair, to
his lodgings, make his will, leaving most of his immortal works to his
English aunt, go to bed, and calmly await death!In a fortunate space of
time his friends, who had been hunting for him all over the Quarter,
would find him at last and rescue him from his chosen tomb; or his good
aunt, fearing he was ill, would send a draft!Then life would, to this
impractical philosopher, again become worth living.He would dispatch a
"petit bleu" to Marcelle; and the two would meet at the Cafe Cluny, and
dine at La Perruse on filet de sole au vin blanc, and a bottle of Haut
Barsac--the bottle all cobwebs and cradled in its basket--the garcon, as
he poured its golden contents, holding his breath meanwhile lest he
disturb its long slumber.There are wines that stir the soul, and this was one of them--clear as a
topaz and warming as the noonday sun--the same warmth that had given it
birth on its hillside in Bordeaux, as far back as '82.It warmed the
heart of Marcelle, too, and made her cheeks glow and her eyes
sparkle--and added a rosier color to her lips.It made her talk--clearly
and frankly, with a full and a happy heart, so that she confessed her
love for this "bon garcon" of a painter, and her supreme admiration for
his work and the financial success he had made with his art.All of
which this genial son of Bohemia drank in with a feeling of pride, and
he would swell out his chest and curl the ends of his long mustache
upwards, and sigh like a man burdened with money, and secure in his
ability and success, and with a peaceful outlook into the future--and
the fact that Marcelle loved him of all men!They would linger long over
their coffee and cigarettes, and then the two would stroll out under the
stars and along the quai, and watch the little Seine boats crossing and
recrossing, like fireflies, and the lights along the Pont Neuf reflected
deep down like parti-colored ribbons in the black water.[Illustration: (pair of high heeled shoes)]




CHAPTER V

"A DEJEUNER AT LAVENUE'S"


If you should chance to breakfast at "Lavenue's," or, as it is called,
the "Hotel de France et Bretagne," for years famous as a rendezvous of
men celebrated in art and letters, you will be impressed first with the
simplicity of the three little rooms forming the popular side of this
restaurant, and secondly with the distinguished appearance of its
clientele.[Illustration: MADEMOISELLE FANNY AND HER STAFF]

As you enter the front room, you pass good Mademoiselle Fanny at the
desk, a cheery, white-capped, genial old lady, who has sat behind that
desk for forty years, and has seen many a "bon garcon" struggle up the
ladder of fame--from the days when he was a student at the Beaux-Arts,
until his name became known the world over.It has long been a
favorite restaurant with men like Rodin, the sculptor--and Colin, the
painter--and the late Falguiere--and Jean Paul Laurens and Bonnat,
and dozens of others equally celebrated--and with our own men, like
Whistler and Sargent and Harrison, and St.These three plain little rooms are totally different from the "other
side," as it is called, of the Maison Lavenue.Here one finds quite a
gorgeous cafe, with a pretty garden in the rear, and another
room--opening into the garden--done in delicate green lattice and
mirrors.This side is far more expensive to dine in than the side with
the three plain little rooms, and the gentlemen with little red
ribbons in their buttonholes; but as the same good cook dispenses from
the single big kitchen, which serves for the dear and the cheap side
the same good things to eat at just half the price, the reason for the
popularity of the "cheap side" among the crowd who come here daily is
evident.[Illustration: RODIN]

It is a quiet, restful place, this Maison Lavenue, and the best place I
know in which to dine or breakfast from day to day.There is an air of
intime and cosiness about Lavenue's that makes one always wish to
return.[Illustration: (group of men dining)]

You will see a family of rich bourgeois enter, just in from the country,
for the Montparnasse station is opposite.The fat, sunburned mama, and
the equally rotund and genial farmer-papa, and the pretty daughter, and
the newly married son and his demure wife, and the two younger
children--and all talking and laughing over a good dinner with
champagne, and many toasts to the young couple--and to mama and papa,
and little Josephine--with ices, and fruit, and coffee, and liqueur to
follow.All these you will see at Lavenue's on the "cheap side"--and the
beautiful model, too, who poses for Courbel, who is breakfasting with
one of the jeunesse of Paris.dine in the front
room with the rest, and jump up now and then to wait on madame and
monsieur.It is a very democratic little place, this popular side of the house of
M. Lavenue, founded in 1854.And there is a jolly old painter who dines there, who is also an
excellent musician, with an ear for rhythm so sensitive that he could
never go to sleep unless the clock in his studio ticked in regular time,
and at last was obliged to give up his favorite atelier, with its
picturesque garden----

"For two reasons, monsieur," he explained to me excitedly; "a little
girl on the floor below me played a polka--the same polka half the
day--always forgetting to put in the top note; and the fellow over me
whistled it the rest of the day and put in the top note false; and so I
moved to the rue St.Peres, where one only hears, within the cool
court-yard, the distant hum of the busy city.The roar of Paris, so full
of chords and melody!Listen to it sometimes, monsieur, and you will
hear a symphony!"[Illustration: "LA FILLE DE LA BLANCHISSEUSE"
By Bellanger.--Estampe Moderne]

And Mademoiselle Fanny will tell you of the famous men she has known for
years, and how she has found the most celebrated of them simple in their
tastes, and free from ostentation--"in fact it is always so, is it not,
with les hommes celebres?C'est toujours comme ca, monsieur, toujours!"and mentions one who has grown gray in the service of art and can count
his decorations from half a dozen governments.Madame will wax
enthusiastic--her face wreathed in smiles.he is a bon garcon; he
always eats with the rest, for three or four francs, never more!He is
so amiable, and, you know, he is very celebrated and very rich"; and
madame will not only tell you his entire history, but about his
work--the beauty of his wife and how "aimables" his children are.Mademoiselle Fanny knows them all.But the men who come here to lunch are not idlers; they come in, many of
them, fresh from a hard morning's work in the studio.The tall sculptor
opposite you has been at work, since his morning coffee, on a group for
the government; another, bare-armed and in his flannel shirt, has been
building up masses of clay, punching and modeling, and scraping away,
all the morning, until he produces, in the rough, the body of a
giantess, a huge caryatide that is destined, for the rest of her
existence, to hold upon her broad shoulders part of the facade of an
American building.The "giantess" in the flesh is lunching with him--a
Juno-like woman of perhaps twenty-five, with a superb head well poised,
her figure firm and erect.You will find her exceedingly interesting,
quiet, and refined, and with a knowledge of things in general that will
surprise you, until you discover she has, in her life as a model, been
thrown daily in conversation with men of genius, and has acquired a
smattering of the knowledge of many things--of art and literature--of
the theater and its playwrights--plunging now and then into medicine and
law and poetry--all these things she has picked up in the studios, in
the cafes, in the course of her Bohemian life.This "vernis," as the
French call it, one finds constantly among the women here, for their
days are passed among men of intelligence and ability, whose lives and
energy are surrounded and encouraged by an atmosphere of art.In an hour, the sculptor and his Juno-like model will stroll back to the
studio, where work will be resumed as long as the light lasts.[Illustration: A TRUE TYPE]

The painter breakfasting at the next table is hard at work on a
decorative panel for a ceiling.It is already laid out and squared up,
from careful pencil drawings.Two young architects are working for him,
laying out the architectural balustrade, through which one, a month
later, looks up at the allegorical figures painted against the dome of
the blue heavens, as a background.And so the painter swallows his eggs,
mayonnaise, and demi of beer, at a gulp, for he has a model coming at
two, and he must finish this ceiling on time, and ship it, by a fast
liner, to a millionaire, who has built a vault-like structure on the
Hudson, with iron dogs on the lawn.Here this beautiful panel will be
unrolled and installed in the dome of the hard-wood billiard-room, where
its rich, mellow scheme of color will count as naught; and the cupids
and the flesh-tones of the chic little model, who came at two, will
appear jaundiced; and Aunt Maria and Uncle John, and the twins from
Ithaca, will come in after the family Sunday dinner of roast beef and
potatoes and rice pudding and ice-water, and look up into the dome and
agree "it's grand."But the painter does not care, for he has locked up
his studio, and taken his twenty thousand francs and the model--who came
at two--with him to Trouville.At night you will find a typical crowd of Bohemians at the Closerie des
Lilas, where they sit under a little clump of trees on the sloping dirt
terrace in front.Here you will see the true type of the Quarter.It is
the farthest up the Boulevard St.Michel of any of the cafes, and just
opposite the "Bal Bullier," on the Place de l'Observatoire.The terrace
is crowded with its habitues, for it is out of the way of the stream of
people along the "Boul' Miche."The terrace is quite dark, its only
light coming from the cafe, back of a green hedge, and it is cool there,
too, in summer, with the fresh night air coming from the Luxembourg
Gardens.Below it is the cafe and restaurant de la Rotonde, a very
well-built looking place, with its rounding facade on the corner.[Illustration: (studio)]

At the entrance of every studio court and apartment, there lives the
concierge in a box of a room generally, containing a huge feather-bed
and furnished with a variety of things left by departing tenants to this
faithful guardian of the gate.Many of these small rooms resemble the
den of an antiquary with their odds and ends from the studios--old
swords, plaster casts, sketches and discarded furniture--until the place
is quite full.Yet it is kept neat and clean by madame, who sews all day
and talks to her cat and to every one who passes into the court-yard.Here your letters are kept, too, in one of a row of boxes, with the
number of your atelier marked thereon.At night, after ten, your concierge opens the heavy iron gate of your
court by pulling a cord within reach of the family bed.He or she is
waked up at intervals through the night to let into and out of a court
full of studios those to whom the night is ever young.Or perhaps your
concierge will be like old Pere Valois, who has three pretty daughters
who do the housework of the studios, as well as assist in the
guardianship of the gate.They are very busy, these three daughters of
Pere Valois--all the morning you will see these little "femmes de
menage" as busy as bees; the artists and poets must be waked up, and
beds made and studios cleaned.There are many that are never cleaned at
all, but then there are many, too, who are not so fortunate as to be
taken care of by the three daughters of Pere Valois.[Illustration: VOILA LA BELLE ROSE, MADAME!]There is no gossip within the quarter that your "femme de menage" does
not know, and over your morning coffee, which she brings you, she will
regale you with the latest news about most of your best friends,
including your favorite model, and madame from whom you buy your wine,
always concluding with: "That is what I heard, monsieur,--I think it is
quite true, because the little Marie, who is the femme de menage of
Monsieur Valentin, got it from Celeste Dauphine yesterday in the cafe in
the rue du Cherche Midi."In the morning, this demure maid-of-all-work will be in her calico dress
with her sleeves rolled up over her strong white arms, but in the
evening you may see her in a chic little dress, at the "Bal Bullier," or
dining at the Pantheon, with the fellow whose studio is opposite yours.[Illustration: A BUSY MORNING]

Alice Lemaitre, however, was a far different type of femme de menage
than any of the gossiping daughters of old Pere Valois, and her lot was
harder, for one night she left her home in one of the provincial towns,
when barely sixteen, and found herself in Paris with three francs to her
name and not a friend in this big pleasure-loving city to turn to.After
many days of privation, she became bonne to a woman known as Yvette de
Marcie, a lady with a bad temper and many jewels, to whom little Alice,
with her rosy cheeks and bright eyes and willing disposition to work in
order to live, became a person upon whom this fashionable virago of a
demi-mondaine vented the worst that was in her--and there was much of
this--until Alice went out into the world again.She next found
employment at a baker's, where she was obliged to get up at four in the
morning, winter and summer, and deliver the long loaves of bread at the
different houses; but the work was too hard and she left.The baker paid
her a trifle a week for her labor, while the attractive Yvette de Marcie
turned her into the street without her wages.It was while delivering
bread one morning to an atelier in the rue des Dames, that she chanced
to meet a young painter who was looking for a good femme de menage to
relieve his artistic mind from the worries of housekeeping.Little Alice
fairly cried when the good painter told her she might come at twenty
francs a month, which was more money than this very grateful and brave
little Brittany girl had ever known before.[Illustration: (brocanteur shop front)]

"You see, monsieur, one must do one's best whatever one undertakes,"
said Alice to me; "I have tried every profession, and now I am a good
femme de menage, and I am 'bien contente.'No," she continued, "I shall
never marry, for one's independence is worth more than anything else.When one marries," she said earnestly, her little brow in a frown,
"one's life is lost; I am young and strong, and I have courage, and so I
can work hard.One should be content when one is not cold and hungry,
and I have been many times that, monsieur.Once I worked in a fabrique,
where, all day, we painted the combs of china roosters a bright red for
bon-bon boxes--hundreds and hundreds of them until I used to see them in
my dreams; but the fabrique failed, for the patron ran away with the
wife of a Russian.He was a very stupid man to have done that, monsieur,
for he had a very nice wife of his own--a pretty brunette, with a
charming figure; but you see, monsieur, in Paris it is always that way.C'est toujours comme ca."CHAPTER VI

"AT MARCEL LEGAY'S"


Just off the Boulevard St.Michel and up the narrow little rue Cujas,
you will see at night the name "Marcel Legay" illumined in tiny
gas-jets.This is a cabaret of chansonniers known as "Le Grillon," where
a dozen celebrated singing satirists entertain an appreciative audience
in the stuffy little hall serving as an auditorium.Here, nightly, as
the piece de resistance--and late on the programme (there is no printed
one)--you will hear the Bard of Montmartre, Marcel Legay, raconteur,
poet, musician, and singer; the author of many of the most popular songs
of Montmartre, and a veteran singer in the cabarets.[Illustration: MARCEL LEGAY]

From these cabarets of the student quarters come many of the cleverest
and most beautiful songs.Here men sing their own creations, and they
have absolute license to sing or say what they please; there is no
mincing of words, and many times these rare bohemians do not take the
trouble to hide their clever songs and satires under a double entente.No celebrated man or woman, known in art or letters, or connected with
the Government--from the soldier to the good President of the Republique
Francaise--is spared.The eccentricity of each celebrity is caught by
them, and used in song or recitation.Besides these personal caricatures, the latest political questions of
the day--religion and the haut monde--come in for a large share of
good-natured satire.To be cleverly caricatured is an honor, and should
evince no ill-feeling, especially from these clever singing comedians,
who are the best of fellows at heart; whose songs are clever but never
vulgar; who sing because they love to sing; and whose versatility
enables them to create the broadest of satires, and, again, a little
song with words so pure, so human, and so pathetic, that the applause
that follows from the silent room of listeners comes spontaneously from
the heart.It is not to be wondered at that "The Grillon" of Marcel Legay's is a
popular haunt of the habitues of the Quarter, who crowd the dingy little
room nightly.You enter the "Grillon" by way of the bar, and at the
further end of the bar-room is a small anteroom, its walls hung in
clever posters and original drawings.This anteroom serves as a sort of
green-room for the singers and their friends; here they chat at the
little tables between their songs--since there is no stage--and through
this anteroom both audience and singers pass into the little hall.There
is the informality of one of our own "smokers" about the whole affair.Furthermore, no women sing in "Le Grillon"--a cabaret in this respect is
different from a cafe concert, which resembles very much our smaller
variety shows.A small upright piano, and in front of it a low platform,
scarcely its length, complete the necessary stage paraphernalia of the
cabaret, and the admission is generally a franc and a half, which
includes your drink.In the anteroom, four of the singers are smoking and chatting at the
little tables.One of them is a tall, serious-looking fellow, in a black
frock coat.He peers out through his black-rimmed eyeglasses with the
solemnity of an owl--but you should hear his songs!--they treat of the
lighter side of life, I assure you.Another singer has just finished his
turn, and comes out of the smoky hall, wiping the perspiration from his
short, fat neck.The audience is still applauding his last song, and he
rushes back through the faded green velvet portieres to bow his thanks.[Illustration: A POET-SINGER]

A broad-shouldered, jolly-looking fellow, in white duck trousers, is
talking earnestly with the owl-like looking bard in eyeglasses.Suddenly
his turn is called, and you follow him in, where, as soon as he is seen,
he is welcomed by cheers from the students and girls, and an elaborate
fanfare of chords on the piano.When this popular poet-singer has
finished, there follows a round of applause and a pounding of canes,
and then the ruddy-faced, gray-haired manager starts a three-times-three
handclapping in unison to a pounding of chords on the piano.This is the
proper ending to every demand for an encore in "Le Grillon," and it
never fails to bring one.It is nearly eleven when the curtain parts and Marcel Legay rushes
hurriedly up the aisle and greets the audience, slamming his straw hat
upon the lid of the piano.He passes his hand over his bald pate--gives
an extra polish to his eyeglasses--beams with an irresistibly funny
expression upon his audience--coughs--whistles--passes a few remarks,
and then, adjusting his glasses on his stubby red nose, looks
serio-comically over his roll of music.He is dressed in a long, black
frock-coat reaching nearly to his heels.This coat, with its velvet
collar, discloses a frilled white shirt and a white flowing bow scarf;
these, with a pair of black-and-white check trousers, complete this
every-day attire.But the man inside these voluminous clothes is even still more
eccentric.Short, indefinitely past fifty years of age, with a round
face and merry eyes, and a bald head whose lower portion is framed
in a fringe of long hair, reminding one of the coiffure of some
pre-Raphaelite saint--indeed, so striking is this resemblance that the
good bard is often caricatured with a halo surrounding this medieval
fringe.In the meantime, while this famous singer is selecting a song, he is
overwhelmed with demands for his most popular ones.A dozen students and
girls at one end of the little hall, now swimming in a haze of pipe and
cigarette smoke, are hammering with sticks and parasols for "Le matador
avec les pieds du vent"; another crowd is yelling for "La Goularde."Marcel Legay smiles at them all through his eyeglasses, then roars at
them to keep quiet--and finally the clamor in the room gradually
subsides--here and there a word--a giggle--and finally silence."Now, my children, I will sing to you the story of Clarette," says the
bard; "it is a very sad histoire.I have read it," and he smiles and
cocks one eye.His baritone voice still possesses considerable fire, and in his heroic
songs he is dramatic.In "The Miller who grinds for Love," the feeling
and intensity and dramatic quality he puts into its rendition are
stirring.As he finishes his last encore, amidst a round of applause, he
grasps his hat from the piano, jams it over his bald pate with its
celestial fringe, and rushes for the door.Here he stops, and, turning
for a second, cheers back at the crowd, waving the straw hat above his
head.The next moment he is having a cooling drink among his confreres
in the anteroom.Such "poet-singers" as Paul Delmet and Dominique Bonnaud have made the
"Grillon" a success; and others like Numa Bles, Gabriel Montoya,
D'Herval, Fargy, Tourtal, and Edmond Teulet--all of them well-known over
in Montmartre, where they are welcomed with the same popularity that
they meet with at "Le Grillon."Genius, alas, is but poorly paid in this Bohemia!There are so many who
can draw, so many who can sing, so many poets and writers and sculptors.To many of the cleverest, half a loaf is too often better than no
bread.You will find often in these cabarets and in the cafes and along the
boulevard, a man who, for a few sous, will render a portrait or a
caricature on the spot.You learn that this journeyman artist once was a
well-known painter of the Quarter, who had drawn for years in the
academies.The man at present is a wreck, as he sits in a cafe with
portfolio on his knees, his black slouch hat drawn over his scraggly
gray hair.But his hand, thin and drawn from too much stimulant and too
little food, has lost none of its knowledge of form and line; the sketch
is strong, true, and with a chic about it and a simplicity of expression
that delight you.[Illustration: THE SATIRIST]

"Ah!"he replies, "it is a long story, monsieur."So long and so much of
it that he can not remember it all!Perhaps it was the woman with the
velvety black eyes--tall and straight--the best dancer in all Paris.Yes, he remembers some of it--long, miserable years--years of struggles
and jealousy, and finally lies and fights and drunkenness; after it was
all over, he was too gray and old and tired to care!One sees many such derelicts in Paris among these people who have worn
themselves out with amusement, for here the world lives for pleasure,
for "la grande vie!"To the man, every serious effort he is obliged to
make trends toward one idea--that of the bon vivant--to gain success and
fame, but to gain it with the idea of how much personal daily pleasure
it will bring him.Ennui is a word one hears constantly; if it rains
toute le monde est triste.To have one's gaiety interrupted is regarded
as a calamity, and "tout le monde" will sympathize with you.To live a
day without the pleasures of life in proportion to one's purse is
considered a day lost.If you speak of anything that has pleased you one will, with a gay
rising inflection of the voice and a smile, say: "Ah!c'est gai
la-bas--and monsieur was well amused while in that beautiful
country?"they will exclaim, as you
enthusiastically continue to explain.They never dull your enthusiasm
by short phlegmatic or pessimistic replies.And when you are sad
they will condone so genuinely with you that you forget your
disappointments in the charming pleasantry of their sympathy.But all
this continual race for pleasure is destined in the course of time to
end in ennui!The Parisian goes into the latest sport because it affords him a
new sensation.Being blase of all else in life, he plunges into
automobiling, buys a white and red racer--a ponderous flying juggernaut
that growls and snorts and smells of the lower regions whenever it
stands still, trembling in its anger and impatience to be off, while its
owner, with some automobiling Marie, sits chatting on the cafe terrace
over a cooling drink.The two are covered with dust and very thirsty;
Marie wears a long dust-colored ulster, and he a wind-proof coat and
high boots.Meanwhile, the locomotive-like affair at the curbstone is
working itself into a boiling rage, until finally the brave chauffeur
and his chic companion prepare to depart.Marie adjusts her white lace
veil, with its goggles, and the chauffeur puts on his own mask as he
climbs in; a roar--a snort, a cloud of blue gas, and they are gone!There are other enthusiasts--those who go up in balloons!one cries enthusiastically, "to be 'en
ballon'--so poetic--so fin de siecle!It is a fantaisie charmante!"In a balloon one forgets the world--one is no longer a part of it--no
longer mortal.What romance there is in going up above everything with
the woman one loves--comrades in danger--the ropes--the wicker cage--the
ceiling of stars above one and Paris below no bigger than a gridiron!How chic to shoot straight
up among the drifting clouds and forget the sordid little world, even
the memory of one's intrigues!"Enfin seuls," they say to each other, as the big Frenchman and the chic
Parisienne countess peer down over the edge of the basket, sipping a
little chartreuse from the same traveling cup; she, with the black hair
and white skin, and gowned "en ballon" in a costume by Paillard; he in
his peajacket buttoned close under his heavy beard.They seem to brush
through and against the clouds!A gentle breath from heaven makes the
basket decline a little and the ropes creak against the hardwood clinch
blocks.It grows colder, and he wraps her closer in his own coat."Courage, my child," he says; "see, we have gone a great distance;
to-morrow before sundown we shall descend in Belgium."cries the Countess; "I do not like those Belgians."but you shall see, Therese, one shall go where one pleases soon; we
are patient, we aeronauts; we shall bring credit to La Belle France; we
have courage and perseverance; we shall give many dinners and weep over
the failures of our brave comrades, to make the dirigible balloon
'pratique.'our dejeuner in Paris and our
dinner where we will."Therese taps her polished nails against the edge of the wicker cage and
hums a little chansonette."Je t'aime"--she murmurs.*     *     *     *     *

I did not see this myself, and I do not know the fair Therese or the
gentleman who buttons his coat under his whiskers; but you should have
heard one of these ballooning enthusiasts tell it to me in the Taverne
du Pantheon the other night.His only regret seemed to be that he, too,
could not have a dirigible balloon and a countess--on ten francs a
week![Illustration: (woman)]

CHAPTER VII

"POCHARD"


Drunkards are not frequent sights in the Quarter; and yet when these
people do get drunk, they become as irresponsible as maniacs.Excitable
to a degree even when sober, these most wretched among the poor when
drunk often appear in front of a cafe--gaunt, wild-eyed, haggard, and
filthy--singing in boisterous tones or reciting to you with tense voices
a jumble of meaningless thoughts.The man with the matted hair, and toes out of his boots, will fold his
arms melodramatically, and regard you for some moments as you sit in
front of him on the terrace.Then he will vent upon you a torrent
of abuse, ending in some jumble of socialistic ideas of his own
concoction.When he has finished, he will fold his arms again and move
on to the next table.He is crazy with absinthe, and no one pays any
attention to him.On he strides up the "Boul' Miche," past the cafes,
continuing his ravings.As long as he is moderately peaceful and
confines his wandering brain to gesticulations and speech, he is let
alone by the police.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

You will see sometimes a man and a woman--a teamster out of work or with
his wages for the day, and with him a creature--a blear-eyed, slatternly
looking woman, in a filthy calico gown.The man clutches her arm, as
they sing and stagger up past the cafes.The woman holds in her
claw-like hand a half-empty bottle of cheap red wine.Now and then they
stop and share it; the man staggers on; the woman leers and dances and
sings; a crowd forms about them.Some years ago this poor girl sat on
Friday afternoons in the Luxembourg Gardens--her white parasol on her
knees, her dainty, white kid-slippered feet resting on the little stool
which the old lady, who rents the chairs, used to bring her.She was
regarded as a bonne camarade in those days among the students--one of
the idols of the Quarter!But she became impossible, and then an
outcast!That women should become outcasts through the hopelessness of
their position or the breaking down of their brains can be understood,
but that men of ability should sink into the dregs and stay there seems
incredible.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

Near the rue Monge there is a small cafe and restaurant, a place
celebrated for its onion soup and its chicken.From the tables outside,
one can see into the small kitchen, with its polished copper sauce-pans
hanging about the grill.Lachaume, the painter, and I were chatting at one of its little tables,
he over an absinthe and I over a coffee and cognac.I had dined early
this fresh October evening, enjoying to the full the bracing coolness of
the air, pungent with the odor of dry leaves and the faint smell of
burning brush.The world was hurrying by--in twos and threes--hurrying
to warm cafes, to friends, to lovers.The breeze at twilight set the dry
leaves shivering.The yellow glow from the
shop windows--the blue-white sparkle of electricity like pendant
diamonds--made the Quarter seem fuller of life than ever.These fall
days make the little ouvrieres trip along from their work with rosy
cheeks, and put happiness and ambition into one's very soul.[Illustration: A GROUP OF NEW STUDIOS]

Soon the winter will come, with all the boys back from their country
haunts, and Celeste and Mimi from Ostende.How gay it will be--this
Quartier Latin then!How gay it always is in winter--and then the rainy
season.Thus it was that Lachaume
and I sat talking, when suddenly a spectre passed--a spectre of a man,
his face silent, white, and pinched--drawn like a mummy's.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR'S MODEL]

He stopped and supported his shrunken frame wearily on his crutches, and
leaned against a neighboring wall.He made no sound--simply gazed
vacantly, with the timidity of some animal, at the door of the small
kitchen aglow with the light from the grill.He made no effort to
approach the door; only leaned against the gray wall and peered at it
patiently."A beggar," I said to Lachaume; "poor devil!"old Pochard--yes, poor devil, and once one of the handsomest men in
Paris.""What I'm drinking now, mon ami."He looks older than I do, does he not?"continued
Lachaume, lighting a fresh cigarette, "and yet I'm twenty years his
senior.You see, I sip mine--he drank his by the goblet," and my friend
leaned forward and poured the contents of the carafe in a tiny
trickling stream over the sugar lying in its perforated spoon.[Illustration: BOY MODEL]

"Ah!those were great days when Pochard was the life of the Bullier," he
went on; "I remember the night he won ten thousand francs from the
Russian.It didn't last long; Camille Leroux had her share of
it--nothing ever lasted long with Camille.He was once courrier to an
Austrian Baron, I remember.The old fellow used to frequent the Quarter
in summer, years ago--it was his hobby.Pochard was a great favorite in
those days, and the Baron liked to go about in the Quarter with him, and
of course Pochard was in his glory.He would persuade the old nobleman
to prolong his vacation here.Once the Baron stayed through the winter
and fell ill, and a little couturiere in the rue de Rennes, whom the old
fellow fell in love with, nursed him.He died the summer following, at
Vienna, and left her quite a little property near Amiens.He was a good
old Baron, a charitable old fellow among the needy, and a good bohemian
besides; and he did much for Pochard, but he could not keep him sober!"[Illustration: BOUGUEREAU AT WORK]

"After the old man's death," my friend continued, "Pochard drifted from
bad to worse, and finally out of the Quarter, somewhere into misery on
the other side of the Seine.No one heard of him for a few years, until
he was again recognized as being the same Pochard returned again to the
Quarter.He was hobbling about on crutches just as you see him there.And now, do you know what he does?Get up from where you are sitting,"
said Lachaume, "and look into the back kitchen.Is he not standing there
by the door--they are handing him a small bundle?""Yes," said I, "something wrapped in newspaper.""Do you know what is in it?--the carcass of the chicken you have just
finished, and which the garcon carried away.Pochard saw you eating it
half an hour ago as he passed."No, to sell," Lachaume replied, "together with the other bones he is
able to collect--for soup in some poorest resort down by the river,
where the boatmen and the gamins go.The few sous he gets will buy
Pochard a big glass, a lump of sugar, and a spoon; into the goblet, in
some equally dirty 'boite,' they will pour him out his green treasure of
absinthe.Then Pochard will forget the day--perhaps he will dream of the
Austrian Baron--and try and forget Camille Leroux.[Illustration: GEROME]

Marguerite Girardet, the model, also told me between poses in the studio
the other day of just such a "pauvre homme" she once knew."When he was
young," she said, "he won a second prize at the Conservatoire, and
afterward played first violin at the Comique.Now he plays in front of
the cafes, like the rest, and sometimes poses for the head of an old
man![Illustration: A. MICHELENA]

"Many grow old so young," she continued; "I knew a little model once
with a beautiful figure, absolutely comme un bijou--pretty, too, and
had she been a sensible girl, as I often told her, she could still have
earned her ten francs a day posing; but she wanted to dine all the time
with this and that one, and pose too, and in three months all her fine
'svelte' lines that made her a valuable model among the sculptors were
gone.You see, I have posed all my life in the studios, and I am over
thirty now, and you know I work hard, but I have kept my fine
lines--because I go to bed early and eat and drink little.Then I have
much to do at home; my husband and I for years have had a comfortable
home; we take a great deal of pride in it, and it keeps me very busy to
keep everything in order, for I pose very early some mornings and then
go back and get dejeuner, and then back to pose again.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR'S STUDIO]

"In the summer," she went on, "we take a little place outside of Paris
for a month, down the Seine, where my husband brings his work with him;
he is a repairer of fans and objets d'art.You should come in and see us
some time; it is quite near where you painted last summer.Ah yes," she
exclaimed, as she drew her pink toes under her, "I love the country!Last year I posed nearly two months for Monsieur Z., the painter--en
plein air; my skin was not as white as it is now, I can tell you--I was
absolutely like an Indian![Illustration: FREMIET]

"Once"--and Marguerite smiled at the memory of it--"I went to England to
pose for a painter well known there.It was an important tableau, and I
stayed there six months.It was a horrible place to me--I was always
cold--the fog was so thick one could hardly see in winter mornings going
to the studio.Besides, I could get nothing good to eat!He was a
celebrated painter, a 'Sir,' and lived with his family in a big stone
house with a garden.We had tea and cakes at five in the studio--always
tea, tea, tea!--I can tell you I used to long for a good bottle of
Madame Giraud's vin ordinaire, and a poulet.So I left and came back to
Paris.J'etais toujours, toujours
triste la!In Paris I make a good living; ten francs a day--that's not
bad, is it?and my time is taken often a year ahead.I like to pose for
the painters--the studios are cleaner than those of the sculptor's.Some
of the sculptors' studios are so dirty--clay and dust over everything!Did you see Fabien's studio the other day when I posed for him?Tiens!--you should have seen it last year when he was
working on the big group for the Exposition!It is clean now compared
with what it was.You see, I go to my work in the plainest of clothes--a
cheap print dress and everything of the simplest I can make, for in half
an hour, left in those studios, they would be fit only for the
blanchisseuse--the wax and dust are in and over everything!There is
no time to change when one has not the time to go home at mid-day."[Illustration: JEAN PAUL LAURENS]

And so I learned much of the good sense and many of the economies in the
life of this most celebrated model.You can see her superb figure
wrought in marble and bronze by some of the most famous of modern French
sculptors all over Paris.There is another type of model you will see, too--one who rang my bell
one sunny morning in response to a note written by my good friend, the
sculptor, for whom this little Parisienne posed.She came without her hat--this "vrai type"--about seventeen years of
age--with exquisite features, her blue eyes shining under a wealth of
delicate blonde hair arranged in the prettiest of fashions--a little
white bow tied jauntily at her throat, and her exquisitely delicate,
strong young figure clothed in a simple black dress.She had about her
such a frank, childlike air!Yes, she posed for so and so, and so and
so, but not many; she liked it better than being in a shop; and it
was far more independent, for one could go about and see one's
friends--and there were many of her girl friends living on the same
street where this chic demoiselle lived.As she sat buttoning her boots, she
looked up at me innocently, slipped her five francs for the morning's
work in her reticule, and said:

"I live with mama, and mama never gives me any money to spend on myself.This is Sunday and a holiday, so I shall go with Henriette and her
brother to Vincennes.[Illustration: OLD MAN MODEL]

It would have been quite impossible for me to have gone with them--I was
not even invited; but this very serious and good little Parisienne, who
posed for the figure with quite the same unconsciousness as she would
have handed you your change over the counter of some stuffy little shop,
went to Vincennes with Henriette and her brother, where they had a
beautiful day--scrambling up the paths and listening to the band--all at
the enormous expense of the artist; and this was how this good little
Parisienne managed to save five francs in a single day!There are old-men models who knock at your studio too, and who are
celebrated for their tangled gray locks, which they immediately
uncover as you open your door.These unkempt-looking Father Times and
Methuselahs prowl about the staircases of the different ateliers daily.So do little children--mostly Italians and all filthily dirty; swarthy,
black-eyed, gypsy-looking girls and boys of from twelve to fifteen years
of age, and Italian mothers holding small children--itinerant madonnas.These are the poorer class of models--the riff-raff of the Quarter--who
get anywhere from a few sous to a few francs for a seance.And there are four-footed models, too, for I know a kindly old horse who
has served in many a studio and who has carried a score of the famous
generals of the world and Jeanne d'Arcs to battle--in many a modern
public square.CHAPTER VIII

THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS


In this busy Quarter, where so many people are confined throughout the
day in work-shops and studios, a breathing-space becomes a necessity.The
gardens of the Luxembourg, brilliant in flowers and laid out in the
Renaissance, with shady groves and long avenues of chestnut-trees
stretching up to the Place de l'Observatoire, afford the great
breathing-ground for the Latin Quarter.If one had but an hour to spend in the Quartier Latin, one could not
find a more interesting and representative sight of student life than
between the hours of four and five on Friday afternoon, when the
military band plays in the Luxembourg Gardens.This is the afternoon
when Bohemia is on parade.Then every one flocks here to see one's
friends--and a sort of weekly reception for the Quarter is held.The
walks about the band-stand are thronged with students and girls,
and hundreds of chairs are filled with an audience of the older
people--shopkeepers and their families, old women in white lace caps,
and gray-haired old men, many in straight-brimmed high hats of a mode of
twenty years past.Here they sit and listen to the music under the cool
shadow of the trees, whose rich foliage forms an arbor overhead--a roof
of green leaves, through which the sunbeams stream and in which the fat,
gray pigeons find a paradise.[Illustration: THE CHILDREN'S SHOP--LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]

There is a booth near-by where waffles, cooked on a small oven in the
rear, are sold.In front are a dozen or more tables for ices and
drinkables.Every table and chair is taken within hearing distance of
the band.When these musicians of the army of France arrive, marching in
twos from their barracks to the stand, it is always the signal for that
genuine enthusiasm among the waiting crowd which one sees between the
French and their soldiers.If you chance to sit among the groups at the little tables, and watch
the passing throng in front of you, you will see some queer "types,"
many of them seldom en evidence except on these Friday afternoons in the
Luxembourg.Buried, no doubt, in some garret hermitage or studio, they
emerge thus weekly to greet silently the passing world.A tall poet stalks slowly by, reading intently, as he walks, a well-worn
volume of verses--his faded straw hat shading the tip of his long nose.Following him, a boy of twenty, delicately featured, with that purity of
expression one sees in the faces of the good--the result of a life,
perhaps, given to his ideal in art.He wears his hair long and curling
over his ears, with a long stray wisp over one eye, the whole cropped
evenly at the back as it reaches his black velvet collar.He wears, too,
a dove-gray vest of fine corduroy, buttoned behind like those of the
clergy, and a velvet tam-o'-shanter-like cap, and carries between his
teeth a small pipe with a long goose-quill stem.You can readily see
that to this young man with high ideals there is only one corner of the
world worth living in, and that lies between the Place de l'Observatoire
and the Seine.Three students pass, in wide broadcloth trousers, gathered in tight at
the ankles, and wearing wide-brimmed black hats.Hanging on the arm of
one of the trio is a short snub-nosed girl, whose Cleo-Merodic hair,
flattened in a bandeau over her ears, not only completely conceals them,
but all the rest of her face, except her two merry black eyes and her
saucy and neatly rouged lips.She is in black bicycle bloomers and a
white, short duck jacket--a straw hat with a wide blue ribbon band, and
a fluffy piece of white tulle tied at the side of her neck.It is impossible, in such a close
crowd, to be in a hurry; besides, one never is here.Near-by sit two old ladies, evidently concierges from some atelier
court.One holds the printed program of the music, cut carefully from
her weekly newspaper; it is cheaper than buying one for two sous, and
these old concierges are economical.In this Friday gathering you will recognize dozens of faces which you
have seen at the "Bal Bullier" and the cafes.The girl in the blue tailor-made dress, with the little dog, who you
remember dined the night before at the Pantheon, is walking now arm in
arm with a tall man in black, a mourning band about his hat.The girl is
dressed in black, too--a mark of respect to her ami by her side.The
dog, who is so small that he slides along the walk every time his chain
is pulled, is now tucked under her arm.One of the tables near the waffle stand is taken by a group of six
students and four girls.All of them have arrived at the table in the
last fifteen minutes--some alone, some in twos.The girl in the scarlet
gown and white kid slippers, who came with the queer-looking "type"
with the pointed beard, is Yvonne Gallois--a bonne camarade.She keeps
the rest in the best of spirits, for she is witty, this Yvonne, and a
great favorite with the crowd she is with.She is pretty, too, and has a
whole-souled good-humor about her that makes her ever welcome.The
fellow she came with is Delmet the architect--a great wag--lazy, but
full of fun--and genius.The little girl sitting opposite Yvonne is Claire Dumont.She is
explaining a very sad "histoire" to the "type" next to her, intense in
the recital of her woes.Her alert, nervous little face is a study; when
words and expression fail, she shrugs her delicate shoulders, accenting
every sentence with her hands, until it seems as if her small, nervous
frame could express no more--and all about her little dog "Loisette!"[Illustration: AT THE HEAD OF THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]

"Yes, the villain of a concierge at Edmond's studio swore at him twice,
and Sunday, when Edmond and I were breakfasting late, the old beast saw
'Loisette' on the stairs and threw water over her; she is a sale bete,
that grosse femme!She shall see what it will cost her, the old miser;
and you know I have always been most amiable with her.She is jealous
of me--that is it--oh!Poor
'Loisette'--she shivered all night with fright and from being wet.Edmond and I are going to find another place.Yes, she shall see what it
will be there without us--with no one to depend upon for her snuff and
her wine.If she were concierge at Edmond's old atelier she would be
treated like that horrid old Madame Fouquet."The boys in the atelier over her window hated this old Madame Fouquet, I
remember.She was always prying about and complaining, so they fished up
her pet gold-fish out of the aquarium on her window-sill, and fried them
on the atelier stove, and put them back in the window on a little plate
all garnished with carrots.She swore vengeance and called in the
police, but to no avail.One day they fished up the parrot in its cage,
and the green bird that screamed and squawked continually met a speedy
and painless death and went off to the taxidermist.Then the cage was
lowered in its place with the door left ajar, and the old woman felt
sure that her pet had escaped and would some day find his way back to
her--a thing this garrulous bird would never have thought of doing had
he had any say in the matter.So the old lady left the door of the cage open for days in the event of
his return, and strange to tell, one morning Madame Fouquet got up to
quarrel with her next-door neighbor, and, to her amazement, there was
her green pet on his perch in his cage.She called to him, but he did
not answer; he simply stood on his wired legs and fixed his glassy eyes
on her, and said not a word--while the gang of Indians in the windows
above yelled themselves hoarse.It was just such a crowd as this that initiated a "nouveau" once in one
of the ateliers.They stripped the new-comer, and, as is often the
custom on similar festive occasions, painted him all over with
sketches, done in the powdered water-colors that come in glass jars.They are cheap and cover a lot of surface, so that the gentleman in
question looked like a human picture-gallery.After the ceremony, he was
put in a hamper and deposited, in the morning, in the middle of the Pont
des Arts, where he was subsequently found by the police, who carted him
off in a cab.[Illustration: THE FONTAINE DE MEDICIS]

But you must see more of this vast garden of the Luxembourg to
appreciate truly its beauty and its charm.Filled with beautiful
sculpture in bronze and marble, with its musee of famous modern pictures
bought by the Government, with flower-beds brilliant in geraniums and
fragrant in roses, with the big basin spouting a jet of water in its
center, where the children sail their boats, and with that superb
"Fontaine de Medicis" at the end of a long, rectangular basin of
water--dark as some pool in a forest brook, the green vines trailing
about its sides, shaded by the rich foliage of the trees overhead.On the other side of the Luxembourg you will find a garden of roses,
with a rich bronze group of Greek runners in the center, and near it,
back of the long marble balustrade, a croquet ground--a favorite spot
for several veteran enthusiasts who play here regularly, surrounded for
hours by an interested crowd who applaud and cheer the participants in
this passe sport.This is another way of spending an afternoon at the sole cost of one's
leisure.Often at the Punch and Judy show near-by, you will see two old
gentlemen,--who may have watched this same Punch and Judy show when they
were youngsters,--and who have been sitting for half an hour, waiting
for the curtain of the miniature theater to rise.It is popular--this
small "Theatre Guignol," and the benches in front are filled with the
children of rich and poor, who scream with delight and kick their
little, fat bare legs at the first shrill squeak of Mr.The three
who compose the staff of this tiny attraction have been long in its
service--the old harpist, and the good wife of the showman who knows
every child in the neighborhood, and her husband who is Mr.Punch, the
hangman, and the gendarme, and half a dozen other equally historical
personages.A thin, sad-looking man, this husband, gray-haired, with a
careworn look in his deep-sunken eyes, who works harder hourly, daily,
yearly, to amuse the heart of a child than almost any one I know.The little box of a theater is stifling hot in summer, and yet he must
laugh and scream and sing within it, while his good wife collects the
sous, talking all the while to this and to that child whom she has known
since its babyhood; chatting with the nurses decked out in their
gay-colored, Alsatian bows, the ribbons reaching nearly to the ground.A French nurse is a gorgeous spectacle of neatness and cleanliness, and
many of the younger ones, fresh from country homes in Normandy and
Brittany, with their rosy cheeks, are pictures of health.Wherever you
see a nurse, you will see a "piou-piou" not far away, which is a very
belittling word for the red-trousered infantryman of the Republique
Francaise.Surrounding the Palais du Luxembourg, these "piou-pious," less fortunate
for the hour, stand guard in the small striped sentry-boxes, musket at
side, or pace stolidly up and down the flagged walk.Marie, at the
moment, is no doubt with the children of the rich Count, in a shady spot
near the music.How cruel is the fate of many a gallant "piou-piou"!Farther down the gravel-walk strolls a young Frenchman and his
fiancee--the mother of his betrothed inevitably at her side!It is under
this system of rigid chaperonage that the young girl of France is given
in marriage.It is not to be wondered at that many of them marry to be
free, and that many of the happier marriages have begun with an
elopement![Illustration: THE PALACE OF THE LUXEMBOURG]

The music is over, and the band is filing out, followed by the crowd.A
few linger about the walks around the band-stand to chat.The old lady
who rents the chairs is stacking them up about the tree-trunks, and long
shadows across the walks tell of the approaching twilight.Overhead,
among the leaves, the pigeons coo.For a few moments the sun bathes
the great garden in a pinkish glow, then drops slowly, a blood-red disk,
behind the trees.The air grows chilly; it is again the hour to
dine--the hour when Paris wakes.In the smaller restaurants of the Quarter one often sees some strange
contrasts among these true bohemians, for the Latin Quarter draws its
habitues from every part of the globe.They are not all French--these
happy-go-lucky fellows, who live for the day and let the morrow slide.You will see many Japanese--some of them painters--many of them taking
courses in political economy, or in law; many of them titled men of high
rank in their own country, studying in the schools, and learning, too,
with that thoroughness and rapidity which are ever characteristic of
their race.You will find, too, Brazilians; gentlemen from Haiti of
darker hue; Russians, Poles, and Spaniards--men and women from every
clime and every station in life.They adapt themselves to the Quarter
and become a part of this big family of Bohemia easily and naturally.In this daily atmosphere only the girl-student from our own shores seems
out of place.She will hunt for some small restaurant, sacred in its
exclusiveness and known only to a dozen bon camarades of the Quarter.Perhaps this girl-student, it may be, from the West and her cousin from
the East will discover some such cosy little boite on their way back
from their atelier.To two other equally adventurous female minds they
will impart this newest find; after that you will see the four dining
there nightly together, as safe, I assure you, within these walls of
Bohemia as they would be at home rocking on their Aunt Mary's porch.There is, of course, considerable awkwardness between these bon
camarades, to whom the place really belongs, and these very innocent
new-comers, who seek a table by themselves in a corner under the few
trees in front of the small restaurant.And yet every one is exceedingly
polite to them.Madame the patronne hustles about to see that the dinner
is warm and nicely served; and Henriette, who is waiting on them, none
the less attentive, although she is late for her own dinner, which she
will sit down to presently with madame the patronne, the good cook, and
the other girls who serve the small tables.[Illustration: WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE THEATERS]

This later feast will be augmented perhaps by half the good boys and
girls who have been dining at the long table.Perhaps they will all come
in and help shell the peas for to-morrow's dinner.And yet this is a
public place, where the painters come, and where one pays only for what
one orders.It is all very interesting to the four American girls, who
are dining at the small table.But what must Mimi think of these silent and exclusive strangers, and
what, too, must the tall girl in the bicycle bloomers think, and the
little girl who has been ill and who at the moment is dining with
Renould, the artist, and whom every one--even to the cook, is so glad to
welcome back after her long illness?There is an unsurmountable barrier
between the Americans at the little table in the corner and that jolly
crowd of good and kindly people at the long one, for Mimi and Henriette
and the little girl who has been so ill, and the French painters and
sculptors with them, cannot understand either the language of these
strangers or their views of life.exclaims one of the strangers in a whisper, "do look at that
queer little 'type' at the long table--the tall girl in black actually
kissed him!"Why, my dear, I saw it plainly!"There is no law against kissing in the open air in Paris,
and besides, the tall girl in black has known the little "type" for a
Parisienne age--thirty days or less.The four innocents, who have coughed through their soup and whispered
through the rest of the dinner, have now finished and are leaving, but
if those at the long table notice their departure, they do not show it.In the Quarter it is considered the height of rudeness to stare.You
will find these Suzannes and Marcelles exceedingly well-bred in the
little refinements of life, and you will note a certain innate dignity
and kindliness in their bearing toward others, which often makes one
wish to uncover his head in their presence.CHAPTER IX

"THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE QUARTER"


There are many streets of the Quarter as quiet as those of a country
village.Some of them, like the rue Vaugirard, lead out past gloomy
slaughter-houses and stables, through desolate sections of vacant
lots, littered with the ruins of factory and foundry whose tall,
smoke-begrimed chimneys in the dark stand like giant sentries, as if
pointing a warning finger to the approaching pedestrian, for these
ragged edges of the Quarter often afford at night a lurking-ground for
footpads.In just such desolation there lived a dozen students, in a small nest of
studios that I need not say were rented to them at a price within their
ever-scanty means.It was marveled at among the boys in the Quarter that
any of these exiles lived to see the light of another day, after
wandering back at all hours of the night to their stronghold.Possibly their sole possessions consisted of the clothes they had on, a
few bad pictures, and their several immortal geniuses.That the
gentlemen with the sand-bags knew of this I am convinced, for the
students were never molested.Verily, Providence lends a strong and
ready arm to the drunken man and the fool!The farther out one goes on the rue Vaugirard, the more desolate
and forbidding becomes this long highway, until it terminates at
the fortifications, near which is a huge, open field, kept clear
of such permanent buildings as might shelter an enemy in time of
war.Scattered over this space are the hovels of squatters and
gipsies--fortune-telling, horse-trading vagabonds, whose living-vans
at certain times of the year form part of the smaller fairs within
the Quarter.[Illustration: (factory chimneys along empty street)]

And very small and unattractive little fairs they are, consisting of
half a dozen or more wagons, serving as a yearly abode for these
shiftless people; illumined at night by the glare of smoking oil
torches.There is, moreover, a dingy tent with a half-drawn red curtain
that hides the fortune-telling beauty; and a traveling shooting-gallery,
so short that the muzzle of one's rifle nearly rests upon the painted
lady with the sheet-iron breastbone, centered by a pinhead of a
bull's-eye which never rings.There is often a small carousel, too,
which is not only patronized by the children, but often by a crowd of
students--boys and girls, who literally turn the merry-go-round into a
circus, and who for the time are cheered to feats of bareback riding by
the enthusiastic bystanders.These little Quarter fetes are far different from the great fete de
Neuilly across the Seine, which begins at the Porte Maillot, and
continues in a long, glittering avenue of side-shows, with mammoth
carousels, bizarre in looking-glass panels and golden figures.Within
the circle of all this throne-like gorgeousness, a horse-power organ
shakes the very ground with its clarion blasts, while pink and white
wooden pigs, their tails tied up in bows of colored ribbons, heave and
swoop round and round, their backs loaded with screaming girls and
shouting men.It was near this very same Port Maillot, in a colossal theater, built
originally for the representation of one of the Kiralfy ballets, that a
fellow student and myself went over from the Quarter one night to "supe"
in a spectacular and melodramatic pantomime, entitled "Afrique a Paris."We were invited by the sole proprietor and manager of the show--an
old circus-man, and one of the shrewdest, most companionable, and
intelligent of men, who had traveled the world over.He spoke no
language but his own unadulterated American.This, with his dominant
personality, served him wherever fortune carried him!So, accepting his invitation to play alternately the dying soldier and
the pursuing cannibal under the scorching rays of a tropical limelight,
and with an old pair of trousers and a flannel shirt wrapped in a
newspaper, we presented ourselves at the appointed hour, at the edge of
the hostile country.[Illustration: (street scene)]

Here we found ourselves surrounded by a horde of savages who needed no
greasepaint to stain their ebony bodies, and many of whose grinning
countenances I had often recognized along our own Tenderloin.Besides,
there were cowboys and "greasers" and diving elks, and a company of
French Zouaves; the latter, in fact, seemed to be the only thing foreign
about the show.Our friend, the manager, informed us that he had thrown
the entire spectacle together in about ten days, and that he had
gathered with ease, in two, a hundred of those dusky warriors, who had
left their coat-room and barber-shop jobs in New York to find themselves
stranded in Paris.He was a hustler, this circus-man, and preceding the spectacle of the
African war, he had entertained the audience with a short variety-show,
to brace the spectacle.He insisted on bringing us around in front and
giving us a box, so we could see for ourselves how good it really was.During this forepart, and after some clever high trapeze work,
the sensation of the evening was announced--a Signore, with an
unpronounceable name, would train a den of ten forest-bred lions!When the orchestra had finished playing "The Awakening of the Lion," the
curtain rose, disclosing the nerveless Signore in purple tights and
high-topped boots.A long, portable cage had been put together on the
stage during the intermission, and within it the ten pacing beasts.There is something terrifying about the roar of a lion as it begins with
its high-keyed moan, and descends in scale to a hoarse roar that seems
to penetrate one's whole nervous system.But the Signore did not seem to mind it; he placed one foot on the sill
of the safety-door, tucked his short riding-whip under his arm, pulled
the latch with one hand, forced one knee in the slightly opened door,
and sprang into the cage.went the iron door as it found its
lock.went the Signore's revolver, as he drove the snarling,
roaring lot into the corner of the cage.The smoke from his revolver
drifted out through the bars; the house was silent.The trainer walked
slowly up to the fiercest lion, who reared against the bars as he
approached him, striking at the trainer with his heavy paws, while the
others slunk into the opposite corner.The man's head was but half a
foot now from the lion's; he menaced the beast with the little
riding-whip; he almost, but did not quite strike him on the tip of his
black nose that worked convulsively in rage.Then the lion dropped
awkwardly, with a short growl, to his forelegs, and slunk, with the
rest, into the corner.It was the little
riding-whip they feared, for they had never gauged its sting.Not the
heavy iron bar within reach of his hand, whose force they knew."An ugly lot," I said, turning to our friend the manager, who had taken
his seat beside me."Yes," he mused, peering at the stage with his keen gray eyes; "green
stock, but a swell act, eh?I've got a
girl here who comes on and does art poses among the lions; she's a
dream--French, too!"A girl of perhaps twenty, enveloped in a bath gown, now appeared at the
wings.The next instant the huge theater became dark, and she stood in
full fleshings, in the center of the cage, brilliant in the rays of a
powerful limelight, while the lions circled about her at the command of
the trainer."Yes," said I, "she is.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

"No, she never worked with the cats before," he said; "she's new to the
show business; she said her folks live in Nantes.She worked here in a
chocolate factory until she saw my 'ad' last week and joined my show.We
gave her a rehearsal Monday and we put her on the bill next night.She's
a good looker with plenty of grit, and is a winner with the bunch in
front.""How did you get her to take the job?""Well," he replied, "she balked at the act at first, but I showed her
two violet notes from a couple of swell fairies who wanted the job, and
after that she signed for six weeks."he exclaimed dryly, and he bit the corner of his stubby
mustache and smiled."This is the last act in the olio, so you will have
to excuse me.*     *     *     *     *

There are streets and boulevards in the Quarter, sections of which are
alive with the passing throng and the traffic of carts and omnibuses.Then one will come to a long stretch of massive buildings, public
institutions, silent as convents--their interminable walls flanking
garden or court.Germain is just such a highway until it crosses the
Boulevard St.Michel--the liveliest roadway of the Quarter.Then it
seems to become suddenly inoculated with its bustle and life, and from
there on is crowded with bourgeoise and animated with the commerce of
market and shop.An Englishman once was so fired with a desire to see the gay life of the
Latin Quarter that he rented a suite of rooms on this same Boulevard St.Germain at about the middle of this long, quiet stretch.Here he stayed
a fortnight, expecting daily to see from his "chambers" the gaiety of a
Bohemia of which he had so often heard.At the end of his disappointing
sojourn, he returned to London, firmly convinced that the gay life of
the Latin Quarter was a myth.[Illustration: (crowded street market)]

But the man from Denver, the "Steel King," and the two thinner
gentlemen with the louis-lined waistcoats who accompanied him and whom
Fortune had awakened in the far West one morning and had led them to
"The Great Red Star copper mine"--a find which had ever since been a
source of endless amusement to them--discovered the Quarter before they
had been in Paris a day, and found it, too, "the best ever," as they
expressed it.They did not remain long in Paris, this rare crowd of seasoned genials,
for it was their first trip abroad and they had to see Switzerland and
Vienna, and the Rhine; but while they stayed they had a good time Every
Minute.The man from Denver and the Steel King sat at one of the small tables,
leaning over the railing at the "Bal Bullier," gazing at the sea of
dancers."Billy," said the man from Denver to the Steel King, "if they had this
in Chicago they'd tear out the posts inside of fifteen minutes"--he
wiped the perspiration from his broad forehead and pushed his
twenty-dollar Panama on the back of his head.he mused, clinching the butt of his perfecto between
his teeth.it beats all I ever see," and he chuckled to
himself, his round, genial face, with its double chin, wreathed in
smiles.he called to one of the 'copper twins,' "did you get on
to that little one in black that just went by--well!Already the pile of saucers on their table reached a foot high--a record
of refreshments for every Yvonne and Marcelle that had stopped in
passing."Certainly, sit right down," cried the Steel King."Here, Jack,"--this
to the aged garcon, "smoke up!and ask the ladies what they'll
have"--all of which was unintelligible to the two little Parisiennes and
the garcon, but quite clear in meaning to all three.interrupted the taller of the two girls, "un cafe
glace pour moi.""Et moi," answered her companion gayly, "Je prends une limonade!"thundered good-humoredly the man from Denver; "git 'em
a good drink.yes, that's it--whiskey--I see you're on,
and two.he explains, holding up two fat fingers, "all straight,
friend--two whiskeys with seltzer on the side--see?Now go roll your
hoop and git back with 'em.""Oh, non, monsieur!"cried the two Parisiennes in one breath; "whiskey!ca pique et c'est trop fort."At this juncture the flower woman arrived with a basketful of red roses."Voulez-vous des fleurs, messieurs et mesdames?""Certainly," cried the Steel King; "here, Maud and Mamie, take the lot,"
and he handed the two girls the entire contents of the basket.The
taller buried her face for a moment in the red Jaqueminots and drank in
their fragrance.When she looked up, two big tears trickled down to the
corners of her pretty mouth.The
smaller girl gave a little cry of delight and shook her roses above her
head as three other girls passed.Ten minutes later the two possessed
but a single rose apiece--they had generously given all the rest away.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

The "copper twins" had been oblivious of all this.They had been hanging
over the low balustrade, engaged in a heart-to-heart talk with two
pretty Quartier brunettes.It seemed to be really a case of love at
first sight, carried on somewhat under difficulties, for the "copper
twins" could not speak a word of French, and the English of the two chic
brunettes was limited to "Oh, yes!""Good morning," "Good
evening," and "I love you."The four held hands over the low railing,
until the "copper twins" fairly steamed in talk; warmed by the sun of
gaiety and wet by several rounds of Highland dew, they grew sad and
earnest, and got up and stepped all over the Steel King and the man from
Denver, and the two Parisiennes' daintily slippered feet, in squeezing
out past the group of round tables back of the balustrade, and down on
to the polished floor--where they are speedily lost to view in the maze
of dancers, gliding into the whirl with the two brunettes.When the
waltz is over they stroll out with them into the garden, and order wine,
and talk of changing their steamer date.The good American, with his spotless collar and his well-cut clothes,
with his frankness and whole-souled generosity, is a study to the modern
grisette.He seems strangely attractive to her, in contrast with a
certain type of Frenchman, that is selfish, unfaithful, and mean--that
jealousy makes uncompanionable and sometimes cruel.She will tell you
that these pale, black-eyed, and black-bearded boulevardiers are all
alike--lazy and selfish; so unlike many of the sterling, good fellows of
the Quarter--Frenchmen of a different stamp, and there are many of
these--rare, good Bohemians, with hearts and natures as big as all
out-doors--"bons garcons," which is only another way of saying
"gentlemen."As you tramp along back to your quarters some rainy night you find many
of the streets leading from the boulevards silent and badly lighted,
except for some flickering lantern on the corner of a long block which
sends the shadows scurrying across your path.You pass a student perhaps
and a girl, hurrying home--a fiacre for a short distance is a luxury in
the Quarter.Now you hear the click-clock of an approaching cab, the
cocher half asleep on his box.The hood of the fiacre is up, sheltering
the two inside from the rain.As the voiture rumbles by near a
street-light, you catch a glimpse of a pink silk petticoat within and a
pair of dainty, white kid shoes--and the glint of an officer's sword.Farther on, you pass a silent gendarme muffled in his night cloak; a few
doors farther on in a small cafe, a bourgeois couple, who have arrived
on a late train no doubt to spend a month with relatives in Paris, are
having a warming tipple before proceeding farther in the drizzling rain.They have, of course, invited the cocher to drink with them.They have
brought all their pets and nearly all their household goods--two dogs,
three bird-cages, their tiny occupants protected from the damp air by
several folds of newspaper; a cat in a stout paper box with air holes,
and two trunks, well tied with rope.[Illustration: (street market)]

"Ah, yes, it has been a long journey!"Her husband
corroborates her, as they explain to the patronne of the cafe and to the
cocher that they left their village at midday.Anything over two hours
on the chemin-de-fer is considered a journey by these good French
people!As you continue on to your studio, you catch a glimpse of the lights of
the Boulevard Montparnasse.Next a cab with a green light rattles by;
then a ponderous two-wheeled cart lumbers along, piled high with red
carrots as neatly arranged as cigars in a box--the driver asleep on his
seat near his swinging lantern--and the big Normandy horses taking the
way.It is late, for these carts are on their route to the early morning
market--one of the great Halles.The tired waiters are putting up the
shutters of the smaller cafes and stacking up the chairs.Now a cock
crows lustily in some neighboring yard; the majority at least of the
Latin Quarter has turned in for the night.A moment later you reach your
gate, feel instinctively for your matches.In the darkness of the court
a friendly cat rubs her head contentedly against your leg.It is the
yellow one that sleeps in the furniture factory, and you pick her up and
carry her to your studio, where, a moment later, she is crunching
gratefully the remnant of the beau maquereau left from your
dejeuner--for charity begins at home.CHAPTER X

EXILED


Scores of men, celebrated in art and in literature, have, for a longer
or shorter period of their lives, been bohemians of the Latin Quarter.And yet these years spent in cafes and in studios have not turned them
out into the world a devil-me-care lot of dreamers.They have all
marched and sung along the "Boul' Miche"; danced at the "Bullier";
starved, struggled, and lived in the romance of its life.It has all
been a part of their education, and a very important part too, in the
development of their several geniuses, a development which in later life
has placed them at the head of their professions.These years of
camaraderie--of a life free from all conventionalities, in daily touch
with everything about them, and untrammeled by public censure or the
petty views of prudish or narrow minds, have left them free to cut a
straight swath merrily toward the goal of their ideals, surrounded all
the while by an atmosphere of art and good-fellowship that permeates the
very air they breathe.If a man can work at all, he can work here, for between the
working-hours he finds a life so charming, that once having lived
it he returns to it again and again, as to an old love.How many are the romances of this student Quarter!How many hearts have
been broken or made glad!How many brave spirits have suffered and
worked on and suffered again, and at last won fame!We who come with a fresh eye know nothing of all that has passed
within these quaint streets--only those who have lived in and through it
know its full story.[Illustration: THE MUSEE CLUNY]

Pochard has seen it; so has the little old woman who once danced at the
opera; so have old Bibi La Puree, and Alphonse, the gray-haired garcon,
and Mere Gaillard, the flower-woman.They have seen the gay boulevards
and the cafes and generations of grisettes, from the true grisette of
years gone by, in her dainty white cap and simple dress turned low at
the throat, to the tailor-made grisette of to-day.Yet the eyes of the little old woman still dance; they have not grown
tired of this ever-changing kaleidoscope of human nature, this paradise
of the free, where many would rather struggle on half starved than live
a life of luxury elsewhere.I knew one once who lived in an
air-castle of his own building--a tall, serious fellow, a sculptor, who
always went tramping about in a robe resembling a monk's cowl, with his
bare feet incased in coarse sandals; only his art redeemed these
eccentricities, for he produced in steel and ivory the most exquisite
statuettes.One at the Salon was the sensation of the day--a knight in
full armor, scarcely half a foot in height, holding in his arms a nymph
in flesh-tinted ivory, whose gentle face, upturned, gazed sweetly into
the stern features behind the uplifted vizor; and all so exquisitely
carved, so alive, so human, that one could almost feel the tender heart
of this fair lady beating against the cold steel breastplate.Another "bon garcon"--a painter whose enthusiasm for his art knew no
bounds--craved to produce a masterpiece.This dreamer could be seen
daily ferreting around the Quarter for a studio always bigger than the
one he had.At last he found one that exactly fitted the requirements of
his vivid imagination--a studio with a ceiling thirty feet high, with
windows like the scenic ones next to the stage entrances of the
theaters.Here at last he could give full play to his brush--no subject
seemed too big for him to tackle; he would move in a canvas as big as a
back flat to a third act, and commence on a "Fall of Babylon" or a
"Carnage of Rome" with a nerve that was sublime!The choking dust of the
arena--the insatiable fury of the tigers--the cowering of hundreds of
unfortunate captives--and the cruel multitude above, seated in the vast
circle of the hippodrome--all these did not daunt his zeal.Once he persuaded a venerable old abbe to pose for his portrait.The
old gentleman came patiently to his studio and posed for ten days, at
the end of which time the abbe gazed at the result and said things which
I dare not repeat--for our enthusiast had so far only painted his
clothes; the face was still in its primary drawing."The face I shall do in time," the enthusiast assured the reverend man
excitedly; "it is the effect of the rich color of your robe I wished to
get.And may I ask your holiness to be patient a day longer while I put
in your boots?""Does monsieur think I am not a
very busy man?"Then softening a little, he said, with a smile:

"I won't come any more, my friend.I'll send my boots around to-morrow
by my boy."But the longest red-letter day has its ending, and time and tide beckon
one with the brutality of an impatient jailer.On my studio table is a well-stuffed envelope containing the documents
relative to my impending exile--a stamped card of my identification,
bearing the number of my cell, a plan of the slave-ship, and six red
tags for my baggage.The three pretty daughters of old Pere Valois know of my approaching
departure, and say cheering things to me as I pass the concierge's
window.Pere Valois stands at the gate and stops me with: "Is it true, monsieur,
you are going Saturday?""Yes," I answer; "unfortunately, it is quite true."The old man sighs and replies: "I once had to leave Paris myself";
looking at me as if he were speaking to an old resident."My regiment
was ordered to the colonies.It was hard, monsieur, but I did my duty."The patron of the tobacco-shop,
and madame his good wife, and the wine merchant, and the baker along the
little street with its cobblestone-bed, have all wished me "bon voyage,"
accompanied with many handshakings.It is getting late and Pere Valois
has gone to hunt for a cab--a "galerie," as it is called, with a place
for trunks on top.Twenty minutes go by, but no "galerie" is in sight.The three daughters of Pere Valois run in different directions to find
one, while I throw the remaining odds and ends in the studio into my
valise.At last there is a sound of grating wheels below on the gravel
court.The "galerie" has arrived--with the smallest of the three
daughters inside, all out of breath from her run and terribly excited.There are the trunks and the valises and the bicycle in its crate to get
down.Two soldiers, who have been calling on two of the daughters, come
up to the studio and kindly offer their assistance.There is no time to
lose, and in single file the procession starts down the atelier stairs,
headed by Pere Valois, who has just returned from his fruitless search
considerably winded, and the three girls, the two red-trousered soldiers
and myself tugging away at the rest of the baggage.It is not often one departs with the assistance of three pretty femmes
de menage, a jolly old concierge, and a portion of the army of the
French Republic.With many suggestions from my good friends and an
assuring wave of the hand from the aged cocher, my luggage is roped and
chained to the top of the rickety, little old cab, which sways and
squeaks with the sudden weight, while the poor, small horse, upon whom
has been devolved the task of making the 11.35 train, Gare St.Lazare,
changes his position wearily from one leg to the other.He is evidently
thinking out the distance, and has decided upon his gait.cry the three girls and Pere Valois and the two soldiers,
as the last trunk is chained on.The dingy vehicle groans its way slowly out of the court.Just as it
reaches the last gate it stops.I ask, poking my head out of the window."Monsieur," says the aged cocher, "it is an impossibility!I regret very
much to say that your bicycle will not pass through the gate."A dozen heads in the windows above offer suggestions.I climb out and
take a look; there are at least four inches to spare on either side in
passing through the iron posts.cries my cocher enthusiastically, "monsieur is right, happily for
us!"He cracks his whip, the little horse gathers itself together--a moment
of careful driving and we are through and into the street and rumbling
away, amid cheers from the windows above.As I glance over my traps, I
see a small bunch of roses tucked in the corner of my roll of rugs with
an engraved card attached."From Mademoiselle Ernestine Valois," it
reads, and on the other side is written, in a small, fine hand, "Bon
voyage."I look back to bow my acknowledgment, but it is too late; we have turned
the corner and the rue Vaugirard is but a memory!*     *     *     *     *

But why go on telling you of what the little shops contain--how narrow
and picturesque are the small streets--how gay the boulevards--what they
do at the "Bullier"--or where they dine?It is Love that moves Paris--it
is the motive power of this big, beautiful, polished city--the love of
adventure, the love of intrigue, the love of being a bohemian if you
will--but it is Love all the same!"I work for love," hums the little couturiere."I work for love," cries the miller of Marcel Legay."I live for love," sings the poet."For the love of art I am a painter," sighs Edmond, in his atelier--"and
for her!""For the love of it I mold and model and create," chants the
sculptor--"and for her!"It is the Woman who dominates Paris--"Les petites femmes!"who have
inspired its art through the skill of these artisans.cries a poor old
woman outside of your train compartment, as you are leaving Havre for
Paris.screams a girl, running near the open window with a little
fishergirl doll uplifted.I see," cries the
pretty vendor; "but it is a boy doll--he will be sad if he goes to
Paris without a companion!"Take all the little fishergirls away from Paris--from the Quartier
Latin--and you would find chaos and a morgue!that is it--L'amour!--L'amour!--L'amour![Illustration: (burning candle)]

to compare with these."Boyd was kneeling before a trunk in the
parlor closet, and presently she put a little square shell box into
Pauline's bands."Box and all, just like they came to me--you know,
they were my grandmother's--but Hilary's a real careful sort of girl."Boyd--I'm not sure that mother would--"  Pauline knew quite
well what was in the box.You just slip them in Hilary's top drawer, where
she'll come across them without expecting it.Deary me, I never wear
them, and as I say, I've always meant to give them to her some day.""She'll be perfectly delighted--and they'll look so pretty.Hilary's
got a mighty pretty neck, I think."Pauline went out to the gig, the
little box hidden carefully in her blouse, feeling that Patience was
right and that these were very fairy-story sort of days."You'll be over again soon, won't you?""We're going to be tre-men-dous-ly busy," Patience began, but her
sister cut her short."As soon as I can, Hilary.By Monday noon, the spare room had lost its look of prim order.In the
afternoon, Pauline and her mother went down to the store to buy the
matting.There was not much choice to be had, and the only green and
white there was, was considerably beyond the limit they had allowed
themselves."Never mind," Pauline said cheerfully, "plain white will look ever so
cool and pretty--perhaps, the green would fade.Over a low wicker sewing-chair, she did linger longingly; it would look
so nice beside one of the west windows.She meant to place a low table
for books and work between those side windows.In the end, prudence
won the day, and surely, the new paper and matting were enough to be
grateful for in themselves.By the next afternoon the paper was on and the matting down.Pauline
was up garret rummaging, when she heard someone calling her from the
foot of the stairs."I'm here, Josie," she called back, and her friend
came running up.Pauline held up an armful of old-fashioned chintz."It makes one think of high-waisted
dresses, and minuets and things like that.""They were my great-grandmother's bed curtains.""I'm not sure mother will let me do anything.I came across them just
now in looking for some green silk she said I might have to cover
Hilary's pin-cushion with."Patience has been doing the honors of the new paper
and matting--it's going to be lovely, I think."Pauline scrambled to her feet, shaking out the chintz: "If only mother
would--it's pink and green--let's go ask her.""What do you want to do with it, Pauline?""I haven't thought that far--use it for draperies of some kind, I
suppose," the girl answered.They were standing in the middle of the big, empty room.Suddenly,
Josie gave a quick exclamation, pointing to the bare corner between the
front and side windows."Wouldn't a cozy corner be delightful--with
cover and cushions of the chintz?""I suppose so, dear--only where is the bench part to come from?""Tom'll make the frame for it, I'll go get him this minute," Josie
answered."And you might use that single mattress from up garret," Mrs.Pauline ran up to inspect it, and to see what other treasures might be
forthcoming.The garret was a big, shadowy place, extending over the
whole house, and was lumber room, play place and general refuge, all in
one.Presently, from under the eaves, she drew forward a little
old-fashioned sewing-chair, discarded on the giving out of its cane
seat."But I could tack a piece of burlap on and cover it with a
cushion," Pauline decided, and bore it down in triumph to the new room,
where Tom Brice was already making his measurements for the cozy corner.Josie was on the floor, measuring for the cover.Tom says it won't take long to do his part."Tom straightened himself, slipping his rule into his pocket."I don't
see what you want it for, though," he said."'Yours not to reason why--'" Pauline told him."We see, and so will
Hilary.Don't you and Josie want to join the new club--the 'S."Society of Willing Females, I suppose?""It sounds like some sort of sewing circle," Josie said.Pauline sat down in one of the wide window places."I'm not sure it
might not take in both.It is--'The Seeing Winton First Club.'"Josie looked as though she didn't quite understand, but Tom whistled
softly."What else have you been doing for the past fifteen years, if
you please, ma'am?""One ought to know a place rather thoroughly in
fifteen years, I suppose; but--I'm hoping we can make it seem at least
a little bit new and different this summer--for Hilary.You see, we
shan't be able to send her away, and so, I thought, perhaps, if we
tried looking at Winton--with new eyes--"

"I see," Josie cried."I think it's a splendiferous ideal"

"And, I thought, if we formed a sort of club among ourselves and worked
together--"

"Listen," Josie interrupted again, "we'll make it a condition of
membership, that each one must, in turn, think up something pleasant to
do.""It will be so--necessarily--won't it?"For Winton
was not rich in young people."There will be enough of us," Josie declared hopefully."Not less than the
Graces, nor more than the Muses."And so the new club was formed then and there.There were to be no
regular and formal meetings, no dues, nor fines, and each member was to
consider himself, or herself, an active member of the programme
committee.Tom, as the oldest member of their immediate circle of friends, was
chosen president before that first meeting adjourned; no other officers
were considered necessary at the time.And being president, to him was
promptly delegated the honor--despite his vigorous protests--of
arranging for their first outing and notifying the other members--yet
to be."But," he expostulated, "what's a fellow to think up--in a hole like
this?"It was one of the chief
occupations of Josie's life at present, to contradict all such
heretical utterances on Tom's part.He was to go away that fall to
commence his studies for the medical profession, for it was Dr.Brice's
great desire that, later, his son should assist him in his practice.But, so far, Tom though wanting to follow his father's profession, was
firm in his determination, not to follow it in Winton."And remember," Pauline said, as the three went down-stairs together,
"that it's the first step that counts--and to think up something very
delightful, Tom.""It mustn't be a picnic, I suppose?Hilary won't be up to picnics yet
awhile.""N-no, and we want to begin soon.She'll be back Friday, I think,"
Pauline answered.By Wednesday night the spare room was ready for the expected guest."It's as if someone had waved a fairy wand over it, isn't it?""I think she will and--pleased."Pauline gave one of the cushions in
the cozy corner a straightening touch, and drew the window
shades--Miranda had taken them down and turned them--a little lower."It's a regular company room, isn't it?"The minister drove over to The Maples himself on Friday afternoon to
bring Hilary home."Remember," Patience pointed a warning forefinger at him, just as he
was starting, "not a single solitary hint!""Not a single solitary one," he promised."Well,
he's off at last!But, oh, dear, however can we wait 'til he gets
back?"CHAPTER V

BEDELIA

It was five o'clock that afternoon when Patience, perched, a little
white-clad sentry, on the gate-post, announced joyously--"They're
coming!Patience was as excited as if the expected "guest" were one in fact, as
well as name.It was fun to be playing a game of make-believe, in
which the elders took part.As the gig drew up before the steps, Hilary looked eagerly out."Will
you tell me," she demanded, "why father insisted on coming 'round the
lower road, by the depot--he didn't stop, and he didn't get any parcel?And when I asked him, he just laughed and looked mysterious.""He went," Pauline answered, "because we asked him to--company usually
comes by train--real out-of-town company, you know.""Like visiting ministers and returned missionaries," Patience explained.You must be," she glanced from one to another, "you're all dressed up,"

"We were expecting some, dear," her mother told her, "but she has
arrived."Shaw patted the hand Hilary slipped into hers."You have come
back a good deal better than you went, my dear."And it didn't turn out a stupid--half-way affair, after all," Hilary
declared.Only, I simply had to come home, I
felt somehow--that--that--"

"We were expecting company?""I reckon that was it," Hilary agreed.As she sat there, resting a
moment, before going up-stairs, she hardly seemed the same girl who had
gone away so reluctantly only eight days before.The change of scene,
the outdoor life, the new friendship, bringing with it new interests,
had worked wonders,

"And now," Pauline suggested, taking up her sister's valise, "perhaps
you would like to go up to your room--visitors generally do.""To rest after your journey, you know," Patience prompted.Patience
believed in playing one's part down to the minutest detail."Thank you," Hilary answered, with quite the proper note of formality
in her voice, "if you don't mind; though I did not find the trip as
fatiguing as I had expected."But from the door, she turned back to give her mother a second and most
uncompany-like hug."It is good to be home, Mother Shaw!And please,
you don't want to pack me off again anywhere right away--at least, all
by myself?""Not right away," her mother answered, kissing her."I guess you will think it is good to be home, when you
know--everything," Patience announced, accompanying her sisters
up-stairs, but on the outside of the banisters.Pauline protested laughingly--"Was there ever such a child for
letting things out!"the child exclaimed, "only now--it can't make any
difference.""Oh, what have
you all been up to?"Patience cried, as Hilary stopped before
the door of her own and Pauline's room."Of course you're not," Pauline told her."It strikes me, for
company--you're making yourself very much at home!She led the way along the hall to the spare room,
throwing the door wide open.Hilary cried, then stood quite still on the threshold, looking
about her with wide, wondering eyes.The spare room was grim and gray no longer.Hilary felt as if she must
be in some strange, delightful dream.The cool green of the wall
paper, with the soft touch of pink in ceiling and border, the fresh
white matting, the cozy corner opposite--with its delicate
old-fashioned chintz drapery and big cushions, the new toilet
covers--white over green, the fresh curtains at the windows, the
cushioned window seats, the low table and sewing-chair, even her own
narrow white bed, with its new ruffled spread, all went to make a room
as strange to her, as it was charming and unexpected."Oh," she said again, turning to her mother, who had followed them
up-stairs, and stood waiting just outside the door."How perfectly
lovely it all is--but it isn't for me?""Of course it is," Patience said."Aren't you company--you aren't just
Hilary now, you're 'Miss Shaw' and you're here on a visit; and there's
company asked to supper to-morrow night, and it's going to be such fun!"It was something deeper and better than
fun.She understood now why they had done this--why Pauline had said
that--about her not going away; there was a sudden lump in the girl's
throat--she was glad, so glad, she had said that downstairs----about
not wanting to go away.And when her mother and Patience had gone down-stairs again and Pauline
had begun to unpack the valise, as she had unpacked it a week ago at
The Maples, Hilary sat in the low chair by one of the west windows, her
hands folded in her lap, looking about this new room of hers."There," Pauline said presently, "I believe that's all now--you'd
better lie down, Hilary--I'm afraid you're tired.""No, I'm not; at any rate, not very.I'll lie down if you like, only I
know I shan't be able to sleep."Pauline lowered the pillow and threw a light cover over her."There's
something in the top drawer of the dresser," she said, "but you're not
to look at it until you've lain down at least half an hour.""I feel as if I were in an enchanted palace,", Hilary said, "with so
many delightful surprises being sprung on me all the while."After
Pauline had gone, she lay watching the slight swaying of the wild roses
in the tall jar on the hearth.The wild roses ran rampant in the
little lane leading from the back of the church down past the old
cottage where Sextoness Jane lived.Jane had brought these with her
that morning, as her contribution to the new room.To Hilary, as to Patience, it seemed as if a magic wand had been waved,
transforming the old dull room into a place for a girl to live and
dream in.But for her, the name of the wand was Love.There must be no more impatient longings, no fretful repinings, she
told herself now.She must not be slow to play her part in this new
game that had been originated all for her.The half-hour up, she slipped from the bed and began unbuttoning her
blue-print frock.Being company, it stood to reason she must dress for
supper.But first, she must find out what was in the upper drawer.The first glimpse of the little shell box, told her that.There were
tears in Hilary's gray eyes, as she stood slipping the gold beads
slowly through her fingers.How good everyone was to her; for the
first time some understanding of the bright side even of sickness--and
she had not been really sick, only run-down--and, yes, she had been
cross and horrid, lots of times--came to her."I'll go over just as soon as I can and thank her," the girl thought,
clasping the beads about her neck, "and I'll keep them always and
always."A little later, she came down-stairs all in white, a spray of the pink
and white wild roses in her belt, her soft, fair hair freshly brushed
and braided.She had been rather neglectful of her hair lately.There was no one on the front piazza but her father, and he looked up
from his book with a smile of pleasure."My dear, how well you are
looking!It is certainly good to see you at home again, and quite your
old self."Hilary came to sit on the arm of his chair."It is good to be at home
again.I suppose you know all the wonderful surprises I found waiting
me?""Supper's ready," Patience proclaimed from the doorway."Please come,
because--" she caught herself up, putting a hand into Hilary's, "I'll
show you where to sit, Miss Shaw."she asked, in the tone
frequently used by visiting ministers."I'm a good deal older than I'm treated generally," Patience answered."I am sure I shall like it very much."Hilary slipped into the chair
Patience drew forward politely."The company side of the table--sure
enough," she laughed."It isn't proper to say things to yourself sort of low down in your
voice," Patience reproved her, then at a warning glance from her mother
subsided into silence as the minister took his place.For to-night, at least, Miranda had amply fulfilled Patience's hopes,
as to company suppers.And she, too, played her part in the new game,
calling Hilary "Miss," and never by any chance intimating that she had
seen her before."Did you go over to the manor to see Shirley?""I promised her Pauline and I would be over
soon.We may have Fanny some afternoon, mayn't we, father?""They can't have Fanny, can they,
father?""Nothing is the matter with her," Pauline said hurriedly."Don't pay
any attention to her.""Only, if you would hurry," Patience implored."I--I can't wait much
longer!""For--Well, if you just knew what for,
Hilary Shaw, you'd do some pretty tall hustling!""I'll wait out on the
porch.""Is there anything more--to see, I mean, not to eat?""I
don't see how there can be.""Because, if you are, I'll show
you.""It was sent to Paul," Patience called, from the hall door."But she
says, of course, it was meant for us all; and I think, myself, she's
right about that.""'It' was--before supper," Pauline told her."I certainly hope nothing
has happened to--'it' since then.""Wait and see; by the way, where's that kitten?""She's to follow in a few days; she was a bit too young to leave home
just yet."Hilary stopped short at the foot of the porch steps.Patience's
remark, if it had not absolutely let the cat out of the bag, had at
least opened the bag."Paul, it can't be--"

"In the Shaw's dictionary, at present, there doesn't appear to be any
such word as can't," Pauline declared."Come on---after all, you know,
the only way to find out--is to find out."Patience had danced on ahead down the path to the barn.She stood
waiting for them now in the broad open doorway, her whole small person
one animated exclamation point, while Towser, just home from a
leisurely round of afternoon visits, came forward to meet Hilary,
wagging a dignified welcome."If you don't hurry, I'll 'hi yi' you, like I do Fanny!"She moved to one side, to let Hilary go on into the barn.she demanded, "isn't that something more?"From the stall beside Fanny's, a horse's head reached inquiringly out
for the sugar with which already she had come to associate the frequent
visits of these new friends.She was a pretty, well-made, little mare,
light sorrel, with white markings, and with a slender, intelligent face.Hilary stood motionless, too surprised to speak."Her name's Bedelia," Patience said, doing the honors."She's very
clever, she knows us all already.Fanny hasn't been very polite to
her, and she knows it--Bedelia does, I mean--sometimes, when Fanny
isn't looking, I've caught Bedelia sort of laughing at her--and I don't
blame her one bit.And, oh, Hilary, she can go--there's no need to 'hi
yi' her.""But--" Hilary turned to Pauline."Uncle Paul sent her," Pauline explained.One of the men from Uncle Paul's place in the country
brought her.She was born and bred at River Lawn--that's Uncle Paul's
place--he says."Hilary stroked the glossy neck gently, if Pauline had said the Sultan
of Turkey, instead of Uncle Paul, she could hardly have been more
surprised."Uncle Paul--sent her to you!""Bless me, that isn't all he sent," Patience exclaimed.It seemed to
Patience that they never would get to the end of their story."You
just come look at this, Hilary Shaw!"she ran on through the opening
connecting carriage-house with stable.Hilary cried, following with Pauline.Beside the minister's shabby old gig, stood the smartest of smart
traps, and hanging on the wall behind it, a pretty russet harness, with
silver mountings.Hilary sat down on an old saw horse; she felt again as though she must
be dreaming."There isn't another such cute rig in town, Jim says so," Patience
said."It beats Bell Ward's all to pieces.""But why--I mean, how did Uncle Paul ever come to send it to us?"Of course one had always known that there
was--somewhere--a person named Uncle Paul; but he had appeared about as
remote and indefinite a being as--that same Sultan of Turkey, for
instance."But I don't believe he would've if Paul had not written to him that
time," Patience added."Maybe next time I tell you anything, you'll
believe me, Hilary Shaw.""Was--was that the letter--you remember, that afternoon?""I was in the mood to dare anything that day.""And did he answer; but of course he did."Paul, you
didn't ask him to send you--these," Hilary waved her hand rather
vaguely."Hardly--he did that all on his own.It wasn't a bad sort of letter,
I'll tell you about it by and by.We can go to the manor in style now,
can't we--even if father can't spare Fanny.Bedelia's perfectly
gentle, I've driven her a little ways once or twice, to make sure.We created quite a sensation down
street, I assure you."Dane said," Patience cut in, "that in her young days,
clergymen didn't go kiting 'bout the country in such high-fangled rigs."Dane said, or didn't say," Pauline told her.Dane hasn't got to say on any subject,
wouldn't make you tired listening to it.""Patience, if you don't stop repeating what everyone says, I shall--"

"If you speak to mother--then you'll be repeating," Patience declared."Maybe, I oughtn't to have said those things before--company.""I think we'd better go back to the house now," Pauline suggested."Sextoness Jane says," Patience remarked, "that she'd have sure admired
to have a horse and rig like that, when she was a girl.She says, she
doesn't suppose you'll be passing by her house very often.""And, now, please," Hilary pleaded, when she had been established in
her hammock on the side porch, with her mother in her chair close by,
and Pauline sitting on the steps, "I want to hear--everything.I'm
what Miranda calls 'fair mazed.'"So Pauline told nearly everything, blurring some of the details a
little and getting to that twenty-five dollars a month, with which they
were to do so much, as quickly as possible."O Paul, really," Hilary sat up among her cushions--"Why, it'll
be--riches, won't it?""But--Oh, I'm afraid you've spent all the first twenty-five on me; and
that's not a fair division--is it, Mother Shaw?""We used it quite according to Hoyle," Pauline insisted."We got our
fun that way, didn't we, Mother Shaw?""All the same, after this, you've simply got to 'drink fair, Betsy,' so
remember," Hilary warned them.Shaw said, and Patience got slowly out of her
big, wicker armchair."I did think--seeing there was company,--that probably you'd like me to
stay up a little later to-night.""If the 'company' takes my advice, she'll go, too," her mother answered.Hilary slipped out of the hammock."Mother, do you suppose Miranda's gone to bed yet?""I'll go see," Patience offered, willing to postpone the inevitable for
even those few moments longer."No--and it must be done to-night."I thought it would be that way, dear.""Miranda's  coming,"  Patience  called."She'd just taken her back
hair down, and she's waiting to twist it up again.She's got awful
funny back hair.""I mean, there's such a little--"

"Go up-stairs and get yourself ready for bed at once.""You ain't took sick, Hilary?""Please, Miranda, if it wouldn't be too much
trouble, will you bring Pauline's bed in here?""I guessed as much," Miranda said, moving Hilary's bed to one side."Hilary--wouldn't you truly rather have a room to yourself--for a
change?""I have had one to myself--for eight days--and, now I'm going back to
the old way."Sitting among the cushions of the cozy corner, Hilary
superintended operations, and when the two single white beds were
standing side by side, in their accustomed fashion, the covers turned
back for the night, she nodded in satisfied manner."Thank you so
much, Miranda; that's as it should be.To-morrow, you must move in regularly.Upper drawer between us, and
the rest share and share alike, you know."Patience, who had hit upon the happy expedient of braiding her
hair--braids, when there were a lot of them, took a long time--got
slowly up from the hearth rug, her head a sight to behold, with its
tiny, hornlike red braids sticking out in every direction."I suppose
I'd better be going.I wish I had someone to talk to, after I'd gone
to bed."Pauline kissed the wistful little face."Never mind, old girl, you
know you'd never stay awake long enough to talk to anyone."She and Hilary stayed awake talking, however, until Pauline's prudence
got the better of her joy in having her sister back in more senses than
one.It was so long since they had had such a delightful bedtime talk."Seeing Winton First Club," Hilary said musingly."Paul, you're ever
so clever.Shirley insisted those letters stood for 'Suppression of
Woman's Foibles Club'; and Mr.Dayre suggested they meant, 'Sweet Wild
Flowers.'""You've simply got to go to sleep now, Hilary, else mother'll  come and
take me away.""I'll never say again--that nothing ever
happens to us."Tom and Josie came to supper the next night.Shirley was there, too,
she had stopped in on her way to the post-office with her father that
afternoon, to ask how Hilary was, and been captured and kept to supper
and the first club meeting that followed.Hilary had been sure she would like to join, and Shirley's prompt and
delighted acceptance of their invitation proved her right."I've only got five names on my list," Tom said, as the young folks
settled themselves on the porch after supper."I suppose we'll think
of others later.""That'll make ten, counting us five, to begin with," Pauline said."Bell and Jack Ward," Tom took out his list, "the Dixon boys and Edna
Ray."I'd just like to know where I come in, Tom Brice!"Patience demanded,
her voice vibrant with indignation.I didn't suppose--"

"I am to belong!"But Patty--"

"If you're going to say no, you needn't Patty me!""We'll see what mother thinks," Hilary suggested."You wouldn't want
to be the only little girl to belong?""I shouldn't mind," Patience assured her, then feeling pretty sure that
Pauline was getting ready to tell her to run away, she decided to
retire on her own account.That blissful time, when she should be
"Miss Shaw," had one drawback, which never failed to assert itself at
times like these--there would be no younger sister subject to her
authority."Have you decided what we are to do?"Pauline asked Tom, when Patience
had gone.You'll be up to a ride by next Thursday, Hilary?"I'm sure I shall," Hilary answered eagerly."He won't even tell me," Josie said."You're none of you to know until next Thursday."Oh," Shirley said, "I think it's going to be the nicest club that ever
was."CHAPTER VI

PERSONALLY CONDUCTED

"Am I late?"Shirley asked, as Pauline came down the steps to meet her
Thursday afternoon."No, indeed, it still wants five minutes to four.Will you come in, or
shall we wait out here?Hilary is under bond not to make her
appearance until the last minute.""Out here, please," Shirley answered, sitting down on the upper step.Father has at last succeeded in
finding me my nag, horses appear to be at a premium in Winton, and even
if he isn't first cousin to your Bedelia, I'm coming to take you and
Hilary to drive some afternoon.Father got me a surrey, because,
later, we're expecting some of the boys up, and we'll need a two-seated
rig.""We're coming to take you driving, too," Pauline said."Just at
present, it doesn't seem as if the summer would be long enough for all
the things we mean to do in it.""And you don't know yet, what we are to do this afternoon?""Only, that it's to be a drive and, afterwards, supper at the Brices'.That's all Josie, herself, knows about it.Through the drowsy stillness of the summer afternoon, came the notes of
a horn, sounding nearer and nearer.A moment later, a stage drawn by
two of the hotel horses turned in at the parsonage drive at a fine
speed, drawing up before the steps where Pauline and Shirley were
sitting, with considerable nourish.Beside the driver sat Tom, in long
linen duster, the megaphone belonging to the school team in one hand.Along each side of the stage was a length of white cloth, on which was
lettered--

      SEEING WINTON STAGE

As the stage stopped, Tom sprang down, a most businesslike air on his
boyish face."This is the Shaw residence, I believe?"he asked, consulting a piece
of paper."I--I reckon so," Pauline answered, too taken aback to know quite what
she was saying."I understand--"

"Then it's a good deal more than I do," Pauline cut in."That there are several young people here desirous of joining our
little sight-seeing trip this afternoon."From around the corner of the house at that moment peeped a small
freckled face, the owner of which was decidedly very desirous of
joining that trip.Only a deep sense of personal injury kept Patience
from coming forward,--she wasn't going where she wasn't wanted--but
some day--they'd see!Shirley clapped her hands delightedly.Oh, I am
glad you asked me to join the club.""Tom, however--"

"I beg your pardon, Miss?""Oh, I say, Paul," Tom dropped his mask of pretended dignity, "let the
Imp come with us--this time."She, as well as Tom, had caught sight of that
small flushed face, on which longing and indignation had been so
plainly written."I'm not sure that mother will--" she began, "But
I'll see.""Tell her--just this first time," Tom urged, and Shirley added, "She
would love it so.""Mother says," Pauline reported presently, "that Patience may go _this_
time--only we'll have to wait while she gets ready.""She'll never forget it--as long as she lives," Shirley said, "and if
she hadn't gone she would never've forgotten _that_.""Nor let us--for one while," Pauline remarked--"I'd a good deal rather
work with than against that young lady."Hilary came down then, looking ready and eager for the outing.She had
been out in the trap with Pauline several times; once, even as far as
the manor to call upon Shirley."Why," she exclaimed, "you've brought the Folly!Tom, how ever did you
manage it?"Hilary shrugged her shoulders, coming nearer for a closer inspection of
the big lumbering stage.It had been new, when the present proprietor
of the hotel, then a young man, now a middle-aged one, had come into
his inheritance.Fresh back from a winter in town, he had indulged
high hopes of booming his sleepy little village as a summer resort, and
had ordered the stage--since christened the Folly--for the convenience
and enjoyment of the guests--who had never come.A long idle lifetime
the Folly had passed in the hotel carriage-house; used so seldom, as to
make that using a village event, but never allowed to fall into
disrepair, through some fancy of its owner.As Tom opened the door at the back now, handing his guests in with much
ceremony, Hilary laughed softly."It doesn't seem quite--respectful to
actually sit down in the poor old thing.I wonder, if it's more
indignant, or pleased, at being dragged out into the light of day for a
parcel of young folks?""'Butchered to make a Roman Holiday'?"At that moment Patience appeared, rather breathless--but not half as
much so as Miranda, who had been drawn into service, and now appeared
also--"You ain't half buttoned up behind, Patience!"she protested,
"and your hair ribbon's not tied fit to be seen.--My sakes, to think of
anyone ever having named that young one _Patience_!""I'll overhaul her, Miranda," Pauline comforted her."Please, I am to sit up in front with you, ain't I, Tom?""You and I always get on so beautifully together, you know.""I don't see how I can refuse after that,"
and the over-hauling process being completed, Patience climbed up to
the high front seat, where she beamed down on the rest with such a look
of joyful content that they could only smile back in response."Not too far, Tom, for Hilary;
and remember, Patience, what you have promised me."Shaw," Tom assured her, and Patience nodded her head
assentingly.From the parsonage, they went first to the doctor's.Josie was waiting
for them at the gate, and as they drew up before it, with horn blowing,
and horses almost prancing--the proprietor of the hotel had given them
his best horses, in honor of the Folly--she stared from her brother to
the stage, with its white placard, with much the same look of wonder in
her eyes as Pauline and Hilary had shown."So that's what you've been concocting, Tom Brice!"Tom's face was as sober as his manner."I am afraid we are a little
behind scheduled time, being unavoidably delayed.""He means they had to wait for me to get ready," Patience explained."You didn't expect to see me along, did you, Josie?""I don't know what I did expect--certainly, not this."Josie took her
place in the stage, not altogether sure whether the etiquette of the
occasion allowed of her recognizing its other inmates, or not.she remarked, while Shirley asked, if she had ever made this trip
before."Not in this way," Josie answered."I've never ridden in the Folly
before."Once, from the depot to the hotel, when I was a youngster, about
Impatience's age.Uncle Jerry was
the name the owner of the stage went by in Winton."He'd had a lot of
Boston people up, and had been showing them around.""This reminds me of the time father and I did our own New York in one
of those big 'Seeing New York' motors," Shirley said."I came home
feeling almost as if we'd been making a trip 'round some foreign city.""Tom can't make Winton seem foreign," Josie declared.There were three more houses to stop at, lower down the street.From
windows and porches all along the route, laughing, curious faces stared
wonderingly after them, while a small body-guard of children sprang up
as if by magic to attend them on their way.This added greatly to the
delight of Patience, who smiled condescendingly down upon various
intimates, blissfully conscious of the envy she was exciting in their
breasts.It was delightful to be one of the club for a time, at least."And now, if you please, Ladies and Gentlemen," Tom had closed the door
to upon the last of his party, "we will drive first to The Vermont
House, a hostelry well known throughout the surrounding country, and
conducted by one of Vermont's best known and honored sons.""I say, Tom, get that off again where
Uncle Jerry can hear it, and you'll always be sure of his vote."They had reached the rambling old hotel, from the front porch of which
Uncle Jerry himself, surveyed them genially."Ladies and Gentlemen," standing up, Tom turned to face the occupants
of the stage, his megaphone, carried merely as a badge of office,
raised like a conductor's baton, "I wish to impress upon your minds
that the building now before you--liberal rates for the season--is
chiefly remarkable for never having sheltered the Father of His
Country.""Ain't that North
Chamber called the 'Washington room'?""Oh, but that's because the first proprietor's first wife occupied that
room--and she was famous for her Washington pie," Tom answered readily."I assure you, sir, that any and all information which I shall have the
honor to impart to these strangers within our gates may be relied upon
for its accuracy."He gave the driver the word, and the Folly
continued on its way, stopping presently before a little
story-and-a-half cottage not far below the hotel and on a level with
the street."This cottage, my young friends," Tom said impressively, "should
be--and I trust is--enshrined deep within the hearts of all true
Wintonites.Latterly, it has come to be called the Barker cottage, but
its real title is 'The Flag House'; so called, because from that humble
porch, the first Stars and Stripes ever seen in Winton flung its colors
to the breeze.The original flag is still in possession of a lineal
descendant of its first owner, who is, unfortunately, not an inhabitant
of this town."The boyish gravity of tone and manner was not all
assumed now.No one spoke for a moment; eleven pairs of young eyes were looking out
at the little weather-stained building with new interest."I thought,"
Bell Ward said at last, "that they called it the _flag_ place, because
someone of that name had used to live there."As the stage moved on, Shirley leaned back for another look."I shall
get father to come and sketch it," she said."Isn't it the quaintest
old place?""We will now proceed," Tom announced, "to the village green, where I
shall have the pleasure of relating to you certain anecdotes regarding
the part it played in the early life of this interesting old village.""Not too many, old man," Tracy Dixon suggested hurriedly, "or it may
prove a one-sided pleasure."The green lay in the center of the town,--a wide, open space, with
flagstaff in the middle; fine old elms bordered it on all four sides.The Vermont House faced it, on the north, and on the opposite side
stood the general store, belonging to Mr.Ward, with one or two smaller
places of business."The business section" of the town, Tom called it, and quite failed to
notice Tracy's lament that he had not brought his opera glasses with
him."Really, you know," Tracy explained to his companions, "I should
have liked awfully to see it."Cut that out," his brother Bob commanded, "the chap up in front is
getting ready to hold forth again."They were simple enough, those anecdotes, that "the chap up in front"
told them; but in the telling, the boy's voice lost again all touch of
mock gravity.His listeners, sitting there in the June sunshine,
looking out across the old green, flecked with the waving tree shadows,
and bright with the buttercups nodding here and there, seemed to see
those men and boys drilling there in the far-off summer twilights; to
hear the sharp words of command; the sound of fife and drum.And the
familiar names mentioned more than once, well-known village names,
names belonging to their own families in some instances, served to
deepen the impression."Why," Edna Ray said slowly, "they're like the things one learns at
school; somehow, they make one realize that there truly was a
Revolutionary War.Wherever did you pick up such a lot of town
history, Tom?"Back up the broad, main street they went, past the pleasant village
houses, with their bright, well-kept dooryards, under the
wide-spreading trees beneath which so many generations of young folks
had come and gone; past the square, white parsonage, with its setting
of green lawn; past the old stone church, and on out into the by-roads
of the village, catching now and then a glimpse of the great lake
beyond; and now and then, down some lane, a bit of the street they had
left.They saw it all with eyes that for once had lost the
indifference of long familiarity, and were swift to catch instead its
quiet, restful beauty, helped in this, perhaps, by Shirley's very real
admiration.Brice's gate, and here Tom dropped his mantle of
authority, handing all further responsibility as to the entertainment
of the party over to his sister.Hilary was carried off to rest until supper time, and the rest
scattered about the garden, a veritable rose garden on that June
afternoon, roses being Dr."It must be lovely to _live_ in the country," Shirley said, dropping
down on the grass before the doctor's favorite _La France_, and laying
her face against the soft, pink petals of a half-blown bud.She had rather resented the admittance of
this city girl into their set.Shirley's skirt and blouse were of
white linen, there was a knot of red under the broad sailor collar, she
was hatless and the dark hair,--never kept too closely within
bounds--was tossed and blown; there was certainly nothing especially
cityfied in either appearance or manner."That's the way I feel about the city," Edna said slowly, "it must be
lovely to live _there_."I reckon just being alive anywhere such days
as these ought to content one.You haven't been over to the manor
lately, have you?We're really getting
the garden to look like a garden.Reclaiming the wilderness, father
calls it.You'll come over now, won't you--the club, I mean?""Why, of course," Edna answered, she thought she would like to go."I
suppose you've been over to the forts?""Lots of times--father's ever so interested in them, and it's just a
pleasant row across, after supper.""I have fasted too long, I must eat again," Tom remarked, coming across
the lawn."Miss Dayre, may I have the honor?""Are you conductor, or merely club president now?""Oh, I've dropped into private life again.There comes Hilary--doesn't
look much like an invalid, does she?""But she didn't look very well the first time I saw her," Shirley
answered.The long supper table was laid under the apple trees at the foot of the
garden, which in itself served to turn the occasion into a festive
affair."You've given us a bully send-off, Mr."It's
going to be sort of hard for the rest of us to keep up with you.""By the way," Tom said, "Dr.Brice--some of you may have heard of
him--would like to become an honorary member of this club.Patience had been
remarkably good that afternoon--so good that Pauline began to feel
worried, dreading the reaction."One who has all the fun and none of the work," Tracy explained, a
merry twinkle in his brown eyes."I shouldn't mind the work; but mother
won't let me join regularly--mother takes notions now and then--but,
please mayn't I be an honorary member?""Onery, you mean, young lady!"Patience flashed a pair of scornful eyes at him."Father says punning
is the very lowest form of--"

"Never mind, Patience," Pauline said, "we haven't answered Tom yet.I
vote we extend our thanks to the doctor for being willing to join.""He isn't a bit more willing than I am," Patience observed.There was
a general laugh among the real members, then Tom said, "If a Shaw votes
for a Brice, I don't very well see how a Brice can refuse to vote for a
Shaw.""The motion is carried," Bob seconded him."Subject to mother's consent," Pauline added, a quite unnecessary bit
of elder sisterly interference, Patience thought."And now, even if it is telling on yourself, suppose you own up, old
man?""You see we don't in the least credit
you with having produced all that village history from your own stores
of knowledge.""I never said you need to," Tom answered, "even the idea was not
altogether original with me."Patience suddenly leaned forward, her face all alight with interest."I love my love with an A," she said slowly, "because he's an--author.""Well, of all the uncanny young ones!""It's very simple," Patience said loftily."So it is, Imp," Tracy exclaimed; "I love him with an A, because he's
an--A-M-E-R-I-C-A-N!""I took him to the sign of The Apple Tree," Bell took up the thread."And fed him (mentally) on subjects--antedeluvian, or almost so,"
Hilary added."I saw him and Tom walking down the back lane the other night,"
Patience explained.Patience felt that she had won her right to belong
to the club now--they'd see she wasn't just a silly little girl."Father says he--I don't mean Tom--"

"We didn't suppose you did," Tracy laughed."Knows more history than any other man in the state; especially, the
history of the state."Why, father and I read
one of his books just the other week."He surely does," Bob grinned, "and every little while he comes up to
school and puts us through our paces.It's his boast that he was born,
bred and educated right in Vermont.He isn't a bad old buck--if he
wouldn't pester a fellow with too many questions.""He lives out beyond us," Hilary told Shirley."There's a great apple
tree right in front of the gate.He has an old house-keeper to look
after him.I wish you could see his books--he's literally surrounded
with them.""He says, they're books full of
stories, if one's a mind to look for them.""Please," Edna protested, "let's change the subject.Are we to have
badges, or not?""Pins would have to be made to order," Pauline objected, "and would be
more or less expensive.""And it's an unwritten by-law of this club, that we shall go to no
unnecessary expense," Tom insisted."Oh, I know what you're thinking," Tom broke in, "but Uncle Jerry
didn't charge for the stage--he said he was only too glad to have the
poor thing used--'twas a dull life for her, shut up in the
carriage-house year in and year out.""The Folly isn't a she," Patience protested."Folly generally is feminine," Tracy said, "and so--"

"And he let us have the horses, too--for our initial outing," Tom went
on."Said the stage wouldn't be of much use without them.""Let's make him an
honorary member.""I never saw such people for going off at
tangents.""Ribbon would be pretty," Shirley suggested, "with the name of the club
in gilt letters.Her suggestion was received with general acclamation, and after much
discussion, as to color, dark blue was decided on."Blue goes rather well with red," Tom said, "and as two of our members
have red hair," his glance went from Patience to Pauline."I move we adjourn, the president's getting personal," Pauline pushed
back her chair."Who's turn is it to be next?"They drew lots with blades of grass; it fell to Hilary."I warn you,"
she said, "that I can't come up to Tom."Then the first meeting of the new club broke up, the members going
their various ways.Shirley went as far as the parsonage, where she
was to wait for her father."I've had a beautiful time," she said warmly."And I've thought what
to do when my turn comes.Only, I think you'll have to let father in
as an honorary, I'll need him to help me out.""We'll be only too glad," Pauline said heartily."This club's growing
fast, isn't it?Hilary shook her head, "N-not exactly; I've sort of an idea."CHAPTER VII

HILARY'S TURN

Pauline and Hilary were up in their own room, the "new room," as it had
come to be called, deep in the discussion of certain samples that had
come in that morning's mail.Uncle Paul's second check was due before long now, and then there were
to be new summer dresses, or rather the goods for them, one apiece all
around."Because, of course," Pauline said, turning the pretty scraps over,
"Mother Shaw's got to have one, too.We'll have to get it--on the
side--or she'll declare she doesn't need it, and she does.""Just the goods won't come to so very much," Hilary said."No, indeed, and mother and I can make them.""We certainly got a lot out of that other check, or rather, you and
mother did," Hilary went on."Pretty nearly, except the little we decided to lay by each month.But
we did stretch it out in a good many directions.I don't suppose any
of the other twenty-fives will seem quite so big.""But there won't be such big things to get with them," Hilary said,
"except these muslins.""It's unspeakably delightful to have money for the little unnecessary
things, isn't it?"That first check had really gone a long ways.After buying the matting
and paper, there had been quite a fair sum left; enough to pay for two
magazine subscriptions, one a review that Mr.Shaw had long wanted to
take, another, one of the best of the current monthlies; and to lay in
quite a store of new ribbons and pretty turnovers, and several yards of
silkaline to make cushion covers for the side porch, for Pauline,
taking hint from Hilary's out-door parlor at the farm, had been quick
to make the most of their own deep, vine-shaded side porch at the
parsonage.The front piazza belonged in a measure to the general public, there
were too many people coming and going to make it private enough for a
family gathering place.But the side porch was different, broad and
square, only two or three steps from the ground; it was their favorite
gathering place all through the long, hot summers.With a strip of carpet for the floor, a small table resurrected from
the garret, a bench and three wicker rockers, freshly painted green,
and Hilary's hammock, rich in pillows, Pauline felt that their porch
was one to be proud of.To Patience had been entrusted the care of
keeping the old blue and white Canton bowl filled with fresh flowers,
and there were generally books and papers on the table.And they might
have done it all before, Pauline thought now, if they had stopped to
think.Hilary asked her, glancing at the sober face bent
over the samples."I believe I'd forgotten all about them; I think I'll choose this--"
Pauline held up a sample of blue and white striped dimity."You can have it, if you like.""Oh, no, I'll have the pink.""And the lavender dot, for Mother Shaw?""Patience had better have straight white, it'll be in the wash so
often.""Why not let her choose for herself, Paul?"Patience called excitedly, at that moment
from downstairs.Hilary called back, and Patience came hurrying up, stumbling
more than once in her eagerness.The next moment, she pushed wide the
door of the "new room."It's addressed to you,
Hilary--it came by express--Jed brought it up from the depot!"She deposited her burden on the table beside Hilary.It was a
good-sized, square box, and with all that delightful air of mystery
about it that such packages usually have."What do you suppose it is, Paul?""Why, I've never had
anything come unexpectedly, like this, before.""A whole lot of things are happening to us that never've happened
before," Patience said.she pointed to
the address at the upper left-hand corner of the package."Oh, Hilary,
let me open it, please, I'll go get the tack hammer.""Tell mother to come," Hilary said.she added, as Patience scampered off."It doesn't seem quite heavy enough for books.""It isn't another Bedelia, at all events.Hilary, I believe Uncle Paul is really glad I
wrote to him.""Well, I'm not exactly sorry," Hilary declared."Mother can't come yet," Patience explained, reappearing.Dane; she just seems to know when
we don't want her, and then to come--only, I suppose if she waited 'til
we did want to see her, she'd never get here."Impatience, and you'd better not let her hear
you saying it," Pauline warned.But Patience was busy with the tack hammer."You can take the inside
covers off," she said to Hilary."Thanks, awfully," Hilary murmured."It'll be my turn next, won't it?"Patience dropped the tack hammer,
and wrenched off the cover of the box--"Go ahead, Hilary!For Hilary was going about her share of the unpacking in the most
leisurely way."I want to guess first," she said."A picture, maybe," Pauline suggested.Patience dropped cross-legged
on the floor."Then I don't think Uncle Paul's such a very sensible
sort of person," she said.Hilary lifted something from within the box, "but
something to get pictures with."It's a three and a quarter by four and a quarter.We can have fun
now, can't we?""Tom'll show you how to use it," Pauline said."He fixed up a dark
room last fall, you know, for himself."Patience came to investigate the
further contents of the express package."Films and those funny little
pans for developing in, and all."Inside the camera was a message to the effect that Mr.Shaw hoped his
niece would be pleased with his present and that it would add to the
summer's pleasures,

"He's getting real uncley, isn't he?"Then she
caught sight of the samples Pauline had let fall."They'd make pretty scant ones, I'd say," Pauline, answered.Patience spread the bright scraps out on her blue checked
gingham apron.But at the present moment, her small sister was quite impervious to
sarcasm."I think I'll have this," she pointed to a white ground,
closely sprinkled with vivid green dots.Pauline declared, glancing at her sister's red
curls."You'd look like an animated boiled dinner!If you please, who
said anything about your choosing?""You look ever so nice in all white, Patty," Hilary said hastily.She looked up quickly, her blue eyes very persuasive."I don't very often have a brand new, just-out-of-the-store dress, do
I?""Only don't let it be the green then.Good, here's
mother, at last!""Mummy, is blue or green better?"Shaw examined and duly admired the camera, and decided in favor of
a blue dot; then she said, "Mrs.Boyd is down-stairs, Hilary."Boyd exclaimed, as Hilary came into the
sitting-room, "how you are getting on!Why, you don't look like the
same girl of three weeks back."Hilary sat down beside her on the sofa."I've got a most tremendous
favor to ask, Mrs.I hear you young folks are having fine times
lately.Shirley was telling me about the club the other night.""It's about the club--and it's in two parts; first, won't you and Mr.Boyd be honorary members?--That means you can come to the good times if
you like, you know.--And the other is--you see, it's my turn next--"
And when Pauline came down, she found the two deep in consultation.The next afternoon, Patience carried out her long-intended plan of
calling at the manor.Shaw was from home for the day, Pauline and
Hilary were out in the trap with Tom and Josie and the camera."So
there's really no one to ask permission of, Towser," Patience
explained, as they started off down the back lane."Father's got the
study door closed, of course that means he mustn't be disturbed for
anything unless it's absolutely necessary."He was quite ready for a ramble this
bright afternoon, especially a ramble 'cross lots.Shirley and her father were not at home, neither--which was even more
disappointing--were any of the dogs; so, after a short chat with Betsy
Todd, considerably curtailed by that body's too frankly expressed
wonder that Patience should've been allowed to come unattended by any
of her elders, she and Towser wandered home again.In the lane, they met Sextoness Jane, sitting on the roadside, under a
shady tree.She and Patience exchanged views on parish matters,
discussed the new club, and had an all-round good gossip.Jane said, her faded eyes bright with interest, "it must
seem like Christmas all the time up to your house."She looked past
Patience to the old church beyond, around which her life had centered
itself for so many years."There weren't ever such doings at the
parsonage--nor anywhere else, what I knowed of--when I was a girl.Seems like she give an air to the whole
place--so pretty and high-stepping--it's most's good's a circus--not
that I've ever been to a circus, but I've hear tell on them--just to
see her go prancing by.""I think," Patience said that evening, as they were all sitting on the
porch in the twilight, "I think that Jane would like awfully to belong
to our club.""'The S. W. F. Club,' I mean; and you
know it, Paul Shaw.When I get to be fifteen, I shan't act half so
silly as some folks.""What ever put that idea in your head?"It was one of
Hilary's chief missions in life to act as intermediary between her
younger and older sister."Oh, I just gathered it, from what she said.Towser and I met her this
afternoon, on our way home from the manor."her mother asked quickly, with that faculty for
taking hold of the wrong end of a remark, that Patience had had
occasion to deplore more than once.And in the diversion this caused, Sextoness Jane was forgotten.Pauline called from the foot of the
stairs.Hilary finished tying the knot of cherry ribbon at her throat, then
snatching up her big sun-hat from the bed, she ran down-stairs.Before the side door, stood the big wagon, in which Mr.Boyd had driven
over from the farm, its bottom well filled with fresh straw.For
Hilary's outing was to be a cherry picnic at The Maples, with supper
under the trees, and a drive home later by moonlight.Shirley had brought over the badges a day or two before; the blue
ribbon, with its gilt lettering, gave an added touch to the girls'
white dresses and cherry ribbons.Dayre had been duly made an honorary member.He and Shirley were
to meet the rest of the party at the farm.As for Patience H. M., as
Tom called her, she had been walking very softly the past few days.There had been no long rambles without permission, no making calls on
her own account.There _had_ been a private interview between herself
and Mr.Boyd, whom she had met, not altogether by chance, down street
the day before.The result was that, at the present moment, Patience--white-frocked,
blue-badged, cherry-ribboned--was sitting demurely in one corner of the
big wagon.Boyd chuckled as he glanced down at her; a body'd have to get up
pretty early in the morning to get ahead of that youngster.Though not
in white, nor wearing cherry ribbons, Mr.Boyd sported his badge with
much complacency.'Twasn't such a
slow old place, after all.he asked, as Pauline slipped a couple of big pasteboard
boxes under the wagon seat, and threw in some shawls for the coming
home.Remember, you and father have got
to come with us one of these days.Boyd can take a
holiday you can.""Good-by," Hilary called, and Patience waved joyously."This'll make
two times," she comforted herself, "and two times ought to be enough to
establish what father calls 'a precedent.'"They stopped at the four other houses in turn; then Mr.Boyd touched
his horses up lightly, rattling them along at a good rate out on to the
road leading to the lake and so to The Maples.There was plenty of fun and laughter by the way.They had gone
picnicking together so many summers, this same crowd, had had so many
good times together."And yet it seems different, this year, doesn't
it?""We really aren't doing new things--exactly, still
they seem so.""These are the 'Blue Ribbon Brand,' best
goods in the market.""Come to think of it, there aren't so very many new things one can do,"
Tom remarked."Not in Winton, at any rate," Bob added."If anyone dares say anything derogatory to Winton, on this, or any
other, outing of the 'S.W. F. Club,' he, or she, will get into
trouble," Josie said sternly.Boyd was waiting for them on the steps, Shirley close by, while a
glimpse of a white umbrella seen through the trees told that Mr."It's the best cherry season in years," Mrs.Boyd declared, as the
young folks came laughing and crowding about her.She was a prime
favorite with them all."It's in my top drawer, dear.Looks like I'm too old to go wearing
such things, though 'twas ever so good in you to send me one.""Hilary," Pauline turned to her sister, "I'm sure Mrs.Boyd'll let you
go to her top drawer.Not a stroke of business does this club do,
until this particular member has her badge on.""Now," Tom asked, when that little matter had been attended to, "what's
the order of the day?""I haven't, ma'am," Tracy announced."Eat all you like--so long's you don't get sick--and each pick a nice
basket to take home," Mrs.There were no cherries
anywhere else quite so big and fine, as those at The Maples."Boys to pick, girls to pick up," Tom ordered, as they scattered about
among the big, bountifully laden trees."For cherry time,
  Is merry time,"

Shirley improvised, catching the cluster of great red and white
cherries Jack tossed down to her.Even more than the rest of the young folks, Shirley was getting the
good of this happy, out-door summer, with its quiet pleasures and
restful sense of home life.She had never known anything before like
it.It was very different, certainly, from the studio life in New
York, different from the sketching rambles she had taken other summers
with her father.They were delightful, too, and it was pleasant to
think of going back to them again--some day; but just at present, it
was good to be a girl among other girls, interested in all the simple,
homely things each day brought up.And her father was content, too, else how could she have been so?It
was doing him no end of good.Painting a little, sketching a little,
reading and idling a good deal, and through it all, immensely amused at
the enthusiasm with which his daughter threw herself into the village
life."I shall begin to think soon, that you were born and raised in
Winton," he had said to her that very morning, as she came in fresh
from a conference with Betsy Todd.Betsy might be spending her summer
in a rather out-of-the-way spot, and her rheumatism might prevent her
from getting into town--as she expressed it--but very little went on
that Betsy did not hear of, and she was not one to keep her news to
herself."So shall I," Shirley had laughed back.She wondered now, if Pauline
or Hilary would enjoy a studio winter, as much as she was reveling in
her Winton summer?Cherry time _was_ merry time that afternoon.Bob fell out
of one of the trees, but Bob was so used to tumbling, and the others
were so used to having him tumble, that no one paid much attention to
it; and equally, of course, Patience tore her dress and had to be taken
in hand by Mrs."Every rose must have its thorns, you know, kid," Tracy told her, as
she was borne away for this enforced retirement."We'll leave a few
cherries, 'gainst you get back."Patience elevated her small freckled nose, she was an adept at it."I
reckon they will be mighty few--if you have anything to do with it.""You're having a fine time, aren't you, Senior?"Dayre came scrambling down from his tree; he had been routed from his
sketching and pressed into service by his indefatigable daughter.Shirley, you've got a fine color--only it's laid on in
spots.""You're spattery, too," she retorted."I must go help lay out the
supper now.""Will anyone want supper, after so many cherries?"Some of the boys brought the table from the house, stretching it out to
its uttermost length.Boyd provided,
and unpacked the boxes stacked on the porch.From the kitchen came an
appetizing odor of hot coffee.Hilary and Bell went off after flowers
for the center of the table."We'll put one at each place, suggestive of the person--like a place
card," Hilary proposed.Boyd and cut her one of these old-fashioned
spice pinks," Hilary said."Better put a bit of pepper-grass for the Imp," Tracy suggested, as the
girls went from place to place up and down the long table."Paul's to have a <DW29>," Hilary insisted.She remembered how, if it
hadn't been for Pauline's "thought" that wet May afternoon, everything
would still be as dull and dreary as it was then.At her own place she found a spray of belated wild roses, Tom had laid
there, the pink of their petals not more delicate than the soft color
coming and going in the girl's face."We've brought for-get-me-not for you, Shirley," Bell said, "so that
you won't forget us when you get back to the city.""Sound the call to supper, sonny!"Tom told Bob, and Bob, raising the
farm dinner-horn, sounded it with a will, making the girls cover their
ears with their hands and bringing the boys up with a rush."It's a beautiful picnic, isn't it?"Patience said, reappearing in time
to slip into place with the rest."And after supper, I will read you the club song," Tracy announced."Read it now, son--while we eat," Tom suggested.Tracy rose promptly--"Mind you save me a few scraps then.First, it
isn't original--"

"All the better," Jack commented."Hush up, and listen--

  "'A cheerful world?--It surely is.And if you understand your biz
    You'll taboo the worry worm,
    And cultivate the happy germ."'It's a habit to be happy,
    Just as much as to be scrappy.So put the frown away awhile,
    And try a little sunny smile.'"Tracy tossed the scrap of
paper across the table to Bell."Put it to music, before the next
round-up, if you please.""We've got a club song and a club badge, and we ought to have a club
motto," Josie said."It's right to your hand, in your song," her brother answered."'It's
a habit to be happy.'"Pauline seconded him, and the motto was at once adopted.CHAPTER VIII

SNAP-SHOTS

Bell Ward set the new song to music, a light, catchy tune, easy to pick
up.It took immediately, the boys whistled it, as they came and went,
and the girls hummed it.Patience, with cheerful impartiality, did
both, in season and out of season.It certainly looked as though it were getting to be a habit to be happy
among a good many persons in Winton that summer.The spirit of the new
club seemed in the very atmosphere.A rivalry, keen but generous, sprang up between the club members in the
matter of discovering new ways of "Seeing Winton," or, failing that, of
giving a new touch to the old familiar ones.There were many informal and unexpected outings, besides the club's
regular ones, sometimes amongst all the members, often among two or
three of them.Frequently, Shirley drove over in the surrey, and she and Pauline and
Hilary, with sometimes one of the other girls, would go for long
rambling drives along the quiet country roads, or out beside the lake.Shirley generally brought her sketch-book and there were pleasant
stoppings here and there.And there were few days on which Bedelia and the trap were not out,
Bedelia enjoying the brisk trots about the country quite as much as her
companions.Hilary soon earned the title of "the kodak fiend," Josie declaring she
took pictures in her sleep, and that "Have me; have my camera," was
Hilary's present motto.Certainly, the camera was in evidence at all
the outings, and so far, Hilary had fewer failures to her account than
most beginners.Her "picture diary" she called the big scrap-book in
which was mounted her record of the summer's doings.Those doings were proving both numerous and delightful.Shaw, as
an honorary member, had invited the club to a fishing party, which had
been an immense success.The doctor had followed it by a moonlight
drive along the lake and across on the old sail ferry to the New York
side, keeping strictly within that ten-mile-from-home limit, though
covering considerably more than ten miles in the coming and going.There had been picnics of every description, to all the points of
interest and charm in and about the village; an old-time supper at the
Wards', at which the club members had appeared in old-fashioned
costumes; a strawberry supper on the church lawn, to which all the
church were invited, and which went off rather better than some of the
sociables had in times past.As the Winton _Weekly News_ declared proudly, it was the gayest summer
the village had known in years.Paul Shaw's theory about
developing home resources was proving a sound one in this instance at
least.Hilary had long since forgotten that she had ever been an invalid, had
indeed, sometimes, to be reminded of that fact.She had quite
discarded the little "company" fiction, except now and then, by way of
a joke."I'd rather be one
of the family these days.""That's all very well," Patience retorted, "when you're getting all the
good of being both.Patience had not
found her summer quite as cloudless as some of her elders; being an
honorary member had not meant _all_ of the fun in her case.She wished
very much that it were possible to grow up in a single night, thus
wiping out forever that drawback of being "a little girl."Still, on the whole, she managed to get a fair share of the fun going
on and quite agreed with the editor of the _Weekly News_, going so far
as to tell him so when she met him down street.She had a very kindly
feeling in her heart for the pleasant spoken little editor; had he not
given her her full honors every time she had had the joy of being
"among those present"?There had been three of those checks from Uncle Paul; it was wonderful
how far each had been made to go.It was possible nowadays to send for
a new book, when the reviews were more than especially tempting.There
had also been a tea-table added to the other attractions of the side
porch, not an expensive affair, but the little Japanese cups and
saucers were both pretty and delicate, as was the rest of the service;
while Miranda's cream cookies and sponge cakes were, as Shirley
declared, good enough to be framed.Even the minister appeared now and
then of an afternoon, during tea hour, and the young people, gathered
on the porch, began to find him a very pleasant addition to their
little company, he and they getting acquainted, as they had never
gotten acquainted before.Sextoness Jane came every week now to help with the ironing, which
meant greater freedom in the matter of wash dresses; and also, to
Sextoness Jane herself, the certainty of a day's outing every week.To
Sextoness Jane, those Tuesdays at the parsonage were little short of a
dissipation.Miranda, unbending in the face of such sincere and humble
admiration, was truly gracious.The glimpses the little bent, old
sextoness got of the young folks, the sense of life going on about her,
were as good as a play, to quote her own simile, confided of an evening
to Tobias, her great black cat, the only other inmate of the old
cottage."I reckon Uncle Paul would be rather surprised," Pauline said one
evening, "if he could know all the queer sorts of ways in which we use
his money.But the little easings-up do count for so much.""Indeed they do," Hilary agreed warmly, "though it hasn't all gone for
easings-ups, as you call them, either."She had sat down right in the
middle of getting ready for bed, to revel in her ribbon box; she so
loved pretty ribbons!The committee on finances, as Pauline called her mother, Hilary, and
herself, held frequent meetings."And there's always one thing," the
girl would declare proudly, "the treasury is never entirely empty."She kept faithful account of all money received and spent; each month a
certain amount was laid away for the "rainy day"--which meant, really,
the time when the checks should cease to come---"for, you know, Uncle
Paul only promised them for the _summer_," Pauline reminded the others,
and herself, rather frequently.Nor was all of the remainder ever
quite used up before the coming of the next check."You're quite a business woman, my dear," Mr.Shaw said once, smiling
over the carefully recorded entries in the little account-book she
showed him.She wrote regularly to her uncle; her letters unconsciously growing
more friendly and informal from week to week.They were bright, vivid
letters, more so than Pauline had any idea of.Paul
Shaw felt himself becoming very well acquainted with these young
relatives whom he had never seen, and in whom, as the weeks went by, he
felt himself growing more and more interested.Without realizing it, he got into the habit of looking forward to that
weekly letter; the girl wrote a nice clear hand, there didn't seem to
be any nonsense about her, and she had a way of going right to her
point that was most satisfactory.It seemed sometimes as if he could
see the old white parsonage and ivy-covered church; the broad
tree-shaded lawns; the outdoor parlor, with the young people gathered
about the tea-table; Bedelia, picking her way along the quiet country
roads; the great lake in all its moods; the manor house.Sometimes Pauline would enclose one or two of Hilary's snap-shots of
places, or persons.At one of these, taken the day of the fishing
picnic, and under which Hilary had written "The best catch of the
season," Mr.Somehow he had never
pictured Phil to himself as middle-aged.If anyone had told him, when
the lad was a boy, that the time would come when they would be like
strangers to each other--Mr.Paul Shaw slipped the snap-shot and letter
back into their envelope.It was that afternoon that he spent considerable time over a catalogue
devoted entirely to sporting goods; and it was a fortnight later that
Patience came flying down the garden path to where Pauline and Hilary
were leaning over the fence, paying a morning call to Bedelia, sunning
herself in the back pasture."You'll never guess what's come _this_ time!And Jed says he reckons
he can haul it out this afternoon if you're set on it!And it's
addressed to the 'Misses Shaw,' so that means it's _mine, too_!"Patience dropped on the grass, quite out of breath.The "it" proved to be a row-boat with a double set of oar-locks, a
perfect boat for the lake, strong and safe, but trig and neat of
outline.Hilary named it the "Surprise" at first sight, and Tom was sent for at
once to paint the name in red letters to look well against the white
background and to match the boat's red trimmings.Some of the young people had boats over at
the lake, rather weather-beaten, tubby affairs, Bell declared them,
after the coming of the "Surprise."A general overhauling took place
immediately, the girls adopted simple boating dresses--red and white,
which were their boating colors.A new zest was given to the water
picnics, Bedelia learning to know the lake road very well.August had come before they fairly realized that their summer was more
than well under way.In little more than a month the long vacation
would be over.Tom and Josie were to go to Boston to school; Bell to
Vergennes."There'll never be another summer quite like it!""I can't bear to think of its being over.""It isn't--yet," Pauline answered."Tom's coming," Patience heralded from the gate, and Hilary ran indoors
for hat and camera.Pauline asked, as her sister came
out again."Out by the Cross-roads' Meeting-House," Tom answered."Hilary has
designs on it, I believe.""You'd better come, too, Paul," Hilary urged."It's a glorious morning
for a walk.""I'm going to help mother cut out; perhaps I'll come to meet you with
Bedelia 'long towards noon."_I'm_ not going to be busy this morning," Patience insinuated."Oh, yes you are, young lady," Pauline told her."Mother said you were
to weed the aster bed."Patience looked longingly after the two starting gayly off down the
path, their cameras swung over their shoulders, then she looked
disgustedly at the aster bed.It was quite the biggest of the smaller
beds.--She didn't see what people wanted to plant so many asters for;
she had never cared much for asters, she felt she should care even less
about them in the future.By the time Tom and Hilary reached the old Cross-Roads' Meeting-House
that morning, after a long roundabout ramble, Hilary, for one, was
quite willing to sit down and wait for Pauline and the trap, and eat
the great, juicy blackberries Tom gathered for her from the bushes
along the road.It had rained during the night and the air was crisp and fresh, with a
hint of the coming fall."Summer's surely on the down grade," Tom
said, throwing himself on the bank beside Hilary."So Paul and I were lamenting this morning.I don't suppose it matters
as much to you folks who are going off to school.""Still it means another summer over," Tom said soberly.He was rather
sorry that it was so--there could never be another summer quite so
jolly and carefree."And the breaking up of the club, I suppose?""I don't see why we need call it a break--just a discontinuance, for a
time."There'll be a lot of you left, to keep it going.""Y-yes, but with three, or perhaps more, out, I reckon we'll have to
postpone the next installment until another summer."Tom went off then for more berries, and Hilary sat leaning back against
the trunk of the big tree crowning the top of Meeting-House Hill, her
eyes rather thoughtful.From where she sat, she had a full view of
both roads for some distance and, just beyond, the little hamlet
scattered about the old meeting-house.Before the gate of one of the houses stood a familiar gig, and
presently, as she sat watching, Dr.Brice came down the narrow
flower-bordered path, followed by a woman.At the gate both stopped;
the woman was saying something, her anxious, drawn face seeming out of
keeping with the cheery freshness of the morning and the flowers
nodding their bright heads about her.As the doctor stood listening, his old shabby medicine case in his
hand, with face bent to the troubled one raised to his, and bearing
indicating grave sympathy and understanding, Hilary reached for her
camera."I want it for the book Josie and I are making for you to take away
with you, 'Winton Snap-shots.'Tom looked at the gig, moving slowly off down the road now.He hated
to say so, but he wished Hilary would not put that particular snap-shot
in.He had a foreboding that it was going to make him a bit
uncomfortable--later--when the time for decision came; though, as for
that, he had already decided--beyond thought of change.He wished that
the pater hadn't set his heart on his coming back here to practice--and
he wished, too, that Hilary hadn't taken that photo."It's past twelve," Tom glanced at the sun."Maybe we'd better walk on
a bit."But they had walked a considerable bit, all the way to the parsonage,
in fact, before they saw anything of Pauline.There, she met them at
the gate."Have you seen any trace of Patience--and Bedelia?""They're both missing, and it's pretty safe guessing they're together.""But Patience would never dare--"

"Wouldn't she!""Jim brought Bedelia 'round about
eleven and when I came out a few moments later, she was gone and so was
Patience.We traced them as far as the
Lake road.""I'll go hunt, too," Tom offered."Don't you worry, Paul; she'll turn
up all right--couldn't down the Imp, if you tried.""But she's never driven Bedelia alone; and Bedelia's not Fanny."However, half an hour later, Patience drove calmly into the yard,
Towser on the seat beside her, and if there was something very like
anxiety in her glance, there was distinct triumph in the way she
carried her small, bare head.she announced, smiling pleasantly from
her high seat, at the worried, indignant group on the porch."I tell
you, there isn't any need to 'hi-yi' this horse!""Did you ever hear the beat of that!"Shaw said, and Patience climbed obediently
down.She bore the prompt banishment to her own room which followed,
with seeming indifference.Certainly, it was not unexpected; but when
Hilary brought her dinner up to her presently, she found her sitting on
the floor, her head on the bed.It was only a few days now to
Shirley's turn and it was going to be such a nice turn.Patience felt
that for once Patience Shaw had certainly acted most unwisely.Hilary put the tray on the table and sitting
down on the bed, took the tumbled head on her knee."We've been so
worried!You see, Bedelia isn't like Fanny!""That's why I wanted to get a chance to drive her by myself for once!out on the Lake road I just let her loose!"For
the moment, pride in her recent performance routed all contrition from
Patience's voice--"I tell you, folks I passed just stared!""Patience, how--"

"I wasn't scared the least bit; and, of course, Bedelia knew it.Uncle
Jerry says they always know when you're scared, and if Mr.Allen is the
most up in history of any man in Vermont, Uncle Jerry is the most in
horses."Hilary felt that the conversation was hardly proceeding upon the lines
her mother would have approved of, especially under present
circumstances."That has nothing to do with it, you know, Patience,"
she said, striving to be properly severe.I think it's nice not being scared of
things.You're sort of timid 'bout things, aren't you, Hilary?""It's going to be such a dreadful long
afternoon--all alone.""But I can't stay, mother would not want--"

"Just for a minute.I--coming back,
I met Jane, and I gave her a lift home--and she did love it so--she
says she's never ridden before behind a horse that really went as if it
enjoyed it as much as she did.That was some good out of being bad,
wasn't it?And--I told you--ever'n' ever so long ago, that I was
mighty sure Jane'd just be tickled to death to belong to our club.I
think you might ask her--I don't see why she shouldn't like Seeing
Winton, same's we do--she doesn't ever have fun--and she'll be dead
pretty soon.She's getting along, Jane is--it'd make me mad's anything
to have to die 'fore I'd had any fun to speak of.Jane's really very
good company--when you draw her out--she just needs drawing out--Jane
does.Seems to me, she remembers every funeral and wedding and
everything--that's ever taken place in Winton."Patience stopped,
sheer out of breath, but there was an oddly serious look on her little
eager face.Hilary stroked back the tangled red curls."Maybe you're right, Patty;
maybe we have been selfish with our good times.I'll have to go now,
dear.You--I may tell mother--that you are sorry--truly, Patty?""But I reckon, it's a good deal on account of
Shirley's turn," she explained."You don't suppose you could fix that up with mother?You're pretty
good at fixing things up with mother, Hilary."Hilary laughed, but when she had closed the door, she
opened it again to stick her head in."I'll try, Patty, at any rate,"
she promised.Shaw was busy in the
study and Pauline had gone out on an errand.Hilary went up-stairs
again, going to sit by one of the side windows in the "new room."Over at the church, Sextoness Jane was making ready for the regular
weekly prayer meeting; never a service was held in the church that she
did not set all in order.Through one of the open windows, Hilary
caught sight of the bunch of flowers on the reading-desk.Jane had
brought them with her from home.Presently, the old woman herself came
to the window to shake her dust-cloth, standing there a moment, leaning
a little out, her eyes turned to the parsonage.Pauline was coming up
the path, Shirley and Bell were with her.They were laughing and
talking, the bright young voices making a pleasant break in the quiet
of the garden.It seemed to Hilary, as if she could catch the wistful
look in Jane's faded eyes, a look only half consciously so, as if the
old woman reached out vaguely for something that her own youth had been
without and that only lately she had come to feel the lack of.A quick lump came into the girl's throat.Life had seemed so bright
and full of untried possibilities only that very morning, up there on
Meeting-House Hill, with the wind in one's face; and then had come that
woman, following the doctor down from the path.Life was surely
anything but bright for her this crisp August day--and now here was
Jane.And presently--at the moment it seemed very near indeed to
Hilary--she and Paul and all of them would be old and, perhaps,
unhappy.And then it would be good to remember--that they had tried to
share the fun and laughter of this summer of theirs with others.Hilary thought of the piece of old tapestry hanging on the studio wall
over at the manor--of the interwoven threads--the dark as necessary to
the pattern as the bright.Perhaps they had need of Sextoness Jane, of
the interweaving of her life into theirs--of the interweaving of all
the village lives going on about them--quite as much as those more
sober lives needed the brightening touch of theirs."I'm coming," Hilary answered, and went slowly down to where the others
were waiting on the porch."I've been having a think--and I've come to the conclusion that we're a
selfish, self-absorbed set."Pauline went to the study window, "please come out here.Hilary's calling us names, and that isn't polite.""I hope not very bad names," she said.Hilary swung slowly back and forth in the hammock."I didn't mean it
that way--it's only--"  She told what Patience had said about Jane's
joining the club, and then, rather reluctantly, a little of what she
had been thinking."I think Hilary's right," Shirley declared."Let's form a deputation
and go right over and ask the poor old soul to join here and now.""I would never've thought of it," Bell said."But I don't suppose I've
ever given Jane a thought, anyway.""Patty's mighty cute--for all she's such a terror at times," Pauline
admitted."She knows a lot about the people here--and it's just
because she's interested in them.""Come on," Shirley said, jumping up."We're going to have another
honorary member.""I think it would be kind, girls," Mrs."Jane will
feel herself immensely flattered, and I know of no one who upholds the
honor of Winton more honestly or persistently."Shaw," Shirley coaxed, "when we come back, mayn't
Patience Shaw, H. M., come down and have tea with us?""I hardly think--"

"Please, Mother Shaw," Hilary broke in; "after all--she started this,
you know.That sort of counterbalances the other, doesn't it?""Well, we'll see," her mother laughed.Pauline ran to get one of the extra badges with which Shirley had
provided her, and then the four girls went across to the church.Sextoness Jane was just locking the back door--not the least important
part of the afternoon's duties with her--as they came through the
opening in the hedge."Good afternoon," she said cheerily, "was you
wanting to go inside?""No," Pauline answered, "we came over to invite you to join our club.We thought, maybe, you'd like to?""And wear one of
them blue-ribbon affairs?""See, here it is," and she pointed to
the one in Pauline's hand.Sextoness Jane came down the steps."Me, I ain't never wore a badge!Oncet, when I was a little youngster,'most
like Patience, teacher, she got up some sort of May doings.We was all
to wear white dresses and red, white and blue ribbons--very night
before, I come down with the mumps.Looks like I always come down when
I ought to've stayed up!""But you won't come down with anything this time," Pauline pinned the
blue badge on the waist of Jane's black and white calico."Now you're
an honorary member of 'The S. W. F.She was still stroking it softly as she walked slowly away towards
home.CHAPTER IX

AT THE MANOR

  "'All the names I know from nurse:
    Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse,
    Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock,
    And the Lady Hollyhock,'"

Patience chanted, moving slowly about the parsonage garden, hands full
of flowers, and the big basket, lying on the grass beyond, almost full.Behind her, now running at full speed, now stopping suddenly, back
lifted, tail erect, came Lucky, the black kitten from The Maples.Lucky had been an inmate of the parsonage for some weeks now and was
thriving famously in her adopted home.Towser tolerated her with the
indifference due such a small, insignificant creature, and she
alternately bullied and patronized Towser."We haven't shepherd's purse, nor lady's smock, that I know of, Lucky,"
Patience said, glancing back at the kitten, at that moment threatening
battle at a polite nodding Sweet William, "but you can see for yourself
that we have hollyhocks, while as for bachelor's buttons!Just look at
that big, blue bunch in one corner of the basket."It was the morning of the day of Shirley's turn and Pauline was
hurrying to get ready to go over and help decorate the manor.She was
singing, too; from the open windows of the "new room" came the words--

  "'A cheerful world?--It surely is
    And if you understand your biz
    You'll taboo the worry worm,
    And cultivate the happy germ.'"To which piece of good advice, Patience promptly whistled back the gay
refrain.On the back porch, Sextoness Jane--called in for an extra half-day--was
ironing the white dresses to be worn that afternoon.And presently,
Patience, her basket quite full and stowed away in the trap waiting
before the side door, strolled around to interview her."Well, I was sort of calculating
on going over for a bit; Miss Shirley having laid particular stress on
my coming and this being the first reg'lar doings since I joined the
club.I told her and Pauline they mustn't look for me to go junketing
'round with them all the while, seeing I'm in office--so to speak--and
my time pretty well taken up with my work."I--"  Patience edged nearer the porch.Behind Jane stood the tall
clothes-horse, with its burden of freshly ironed white things.At
sight of a short, white frock, very crisp and immaculate, the blood
rushed to the child's face, then as quickly receded.--After all, it
would have had to be ironed for Sunday and--well, mother certainly had
been very non-committal the past few days--ever since that escapade
with Bedelia, in fact--regarding her youngest daughter's hopes and
fears for this all-important afternoon.And Patience had been wise
enough not to press the matter."But, oh, I do wonder if Hilary has--"  Patience went back to the side
porch.Hilary was there talking to Bedelia."You--you have fixed it
up?"Patience repressed a sudden desire to stamp her foot, and Hilary,
seeing the real doubt and longing in her face, relented."Mother wants
to see you, Patty.From the doorway, she looked back--"I just knew
you wouldn't go back on me, Hilary!I'll love you forever'n' ever."Pauline came out a moment later, drawing on her driving gloves."I
feel like a story-book girl, going driving this time in the morning, in
a trap like this.I wish you were coming, too, Hilary.""Oh, I'm like the delicate story-book girl, who has to rest, so as to
be ready for the dissipations that are to come later.I look the part,
don't I?"Pauline looked down into the laughing, sun-browned face."If Uncle
Paul were to see you now, he might find it hard to believe I
hadn't--exaggerated that time.""Well, it's your fault--and his, or was, in the beginning.You've a
fine basket of flowers to take; Patience has done herself proud this
morning.""It's wonderful how well that young lady can behave--at times."When I hear mother tell how like her you used to
be, I don't feel too discouraged about Patty.""That strikes me as rather a double-edged sort of speech," Pauline
gathered up the reins."Good-by, and don't get too tired."Shirley's turn was to be a combination studio tea and lawn-party, to
which all club members, both regular and honorary, not to mention their
relatives and friends, had been bidden.Following this, was to be a
high tea for the regular members."That's Senior's share," Shirley had explained to Pauline."He insists
that it's up to him to do something."Dayre was on very good terms with the "S. W. F.As for
Shirley, after the first, no one had ever thought of her as an outsider.It was hard now, Pauline thought, as she drove briskly along, the lake
breeze in her face, and the sound of Bedelia's quick trotting forming a
pleasant accompaniment to her, thoughts, very hard, to realize how soon
the summer would be over.But perhaps--as Hilary said--next summer
would mean the taking up again of this year's good times and
interests,--Shirley talked of coming back.As for the winter--Pauline
had in mind several plans for the winter.Those of the club members to
stay behind must get together some day and talk them over.One thing
was certain, the club motto must be lived up to bravely.If not in one
way, why in another.There must be no slipping back into the old
dreary rut and routine.It lay with themselves as to what their winter
should be."And there's fine sleighing here, Bedelia," she said."We'll get the
old cutter out and give it a coat of paint."Bedelia tossed her head, as if she heard in imagination the gay
jingling of the sleighbells."But, in the meantime, here is the manor," Pauline laughed, "and it's
the prettiest August day that ever was, and lawn-parties and such
festivities are afoot, not sleighing parties."The manor stood facing the lake with its back to the road, a broad
sloping lawn surrounded it on three sides, with the garden at the back.For so many seasons, it had stood lonely and neglected, that Pauline
never came near it now, without rejoicing afresh in its altered aspect.Even the sight of Betsy Todd's dish towels, drying on the currant
bushes at one side of the back door, added their touch to the sense of
pleasant, homely life that seemed to envelop the old house nowadays.Shirley came to the gate, as Pauline drew up, Phil, Pat and Pudgey in
close attention."I have to keep an eye on them," she told Pauline."They've just had their baths, and they're simply wild to get out in
the middle of the road and roll.I've told them no self-respecting dog
would wish to come to a lawn-party in anything but the freshest of
white coats, but I'm afraid they're not very self-respecting.""Patience is sure Towser's heart is heavy because he is not to come;
she has promised him a lawn-party on his own account, and that no
grown-ups shall be invited.She's sent you the promised flowers, and
hinted--more or less plainly--that she would have been quite willing to
deliver them in person."Oh, but I'm afraid you've robbed yourself!""The boys have been putting
the awning up."Dayre's fellow artists, who had come up a
day or two before, on a visit to the manor.One of them, at any rate,
deserved Shirley's title."Looks pretty nice,
doesn't it?"he said, with a wave of the hand towards the red and white
striped awning, placed at the further edge of the lawn.Shirley smiled her approval, and introduced him to Pauline, adding that
Miss Shaw was the real founder of their club."It's a might jolly sort of club, too," young Oram said."That is exactly what it has turned out to be," Pauline laughed."Are
the vases ready, Shirley?"Shirley brought the tray of empty flower vases out on the veranda, and
sent Harry Oram for a bucket of fresh water."Harry is to make the
salad," she explained to Pauline, as he came back."Before he leaves
the manor he will have developed into a fairly useful member of
society.""You've never eaten one of my salads, Miss Shaw," Harry said."When
you have, you'll think all your previous life an empty dream.""It's much more likely her later life will prove a nightmare,--for a
while, at least," Shirley declared."Still, Paul, Harry does make them
rather well.Betsy Todd, I am sorry to say, doesn't approve of him.But there are so many persons and things she doesn't approve of;
lawn-parties among the latter."Pauline nodded sympathetically; she knew Betsy Todd of old.Her wonder
was, that the Dayres had been able to put up with her so long, and she
said so."'Hobson's choice,'" Shirley answered, with a little shrug."She isn't
much like our old Therese at home, is she, Harry?But nothing would
tempt Therese away from her beloved New York.Nevaire have
I heard of zat place!'she told Harry, when he interviewed her for us.Senior's gone to Vergennes--on business thoughts intent, or I hope they
are.He's under strict orders not to 'discover a single bit' along the
way, and to get back as quickly as possible.""You see how beautifully she has us all in training?"Suddenly she looked up from her flowers with sobered
face."I wonder," she said slowly, "if you know what it's meant to
us--you're being here this summer, Shirley?Sometimes things do fit in
just right after all.It's helped out wonderfully this summer, having
you here and the manor open.""Pauline has a fairy-story uncle down in New York," Shirley turned to
Harry.I've met him, once or twice--he didn't strike me as
much of a believer in fairy tales.""He's made us believe in them," Pauline answered."I think Senior might have provided me with such a delightful sort of
uncle," Shirley observed."I told him so, but he says, while he's
awfully sorry I didn't mention it before, he's afraid it's too late
now.""Uncle Paul sent us Bedelia," Pauline told the rather perplexed-looking
Harry, "and the row-boat and the camera and--oh, other things.""Because he wanted them to have a nice, jolly summer," Shirley
explained."Pauline's sister had been sick and needed brightening up.""You don't think he's looking around for a nephew to adopt, do you?""A well-intentioned, intelligent young man--with no
end of talent.""For making salads," Shirley added with a sly smile."Oh, well, you know," Harry remarked casually, "these are what Senior
calls my'salad days.'"Whereupon Shirley rose without a word, carrying off her vases of
flowers.The party at the manor was, like all the club affairs, a decided
success.Never had the old place looked so gay and animated, since
those far-off days of its early glory.The young people coming and going--the girls in their light dresses and
bright ribbons made a pleasant place of the lawn, with its background
of shining water.The tennis court, at one side of the house, was one
of the favorite gathering spots; there were one or two boats out on the
lake.The pleasant informality of the whole affair proved its greatest
charm.Allen was there, pointing out to his host the supposed end of the
subterranean passage said to connect the point on which the manor stood
with the old ruined French fort over on the New York side.The
minister was having a quiet chat with the doctor, who had made a
special point of being there.Mothers of club members were exchanging
notes and congratulating each other on the good comradeship and general
air of contentment among the young people.Sextoness Jane was there,
in all the glory of her best dress--one of Mrs.Shaw's handed-down
summer ones--and with any amount of items picked up to carry home to
Tobias, who was certain to expect a full account of this most unusual
dissipation on his mistress's part.Even Betsy Todd condescended to
put on her black woolen--usually reserved for church and funerals--and
walk about among the other guests; but always, with an air that told
plainly how little she approved of such goings on.The Boyds were
there, their badges in full evidence.And last, though far from least,
in her own estimation, Patience was there, very crisp and white and on
her best behavior,--for, setting aside those conditions mother had seen
fit to burden her with, was the delightful fact that Shirley had asked
her to help serve tea.The principal tea-table was in the studio, though there was a second
one, presided over by Pauline and Bell, out under the awning at the
edge of the lawn.Patience thought the studio the very nicest room she had ever been in.It was long and low--in reality, the old dancing-hall, for the manor
had been built after the pattern of its first owner's English home; and
in the deep, recessed windows, facing the lake, many a bepatched and
powdered little belle of Colonial days had coquetted across her fan
with her bravely-clad partner.Dayre had thrown out an extra window at one end, at right angles to
the great stone fireplace, banked to-day with golden rod, thereby
securing the desired north light.On the easel, stood a nearly finished painting,--a sunny corner of the
old manor kitchen, with Betsy Todd in lilac print gown, peeling apples
by the open window, through which one caught a glimpse of the tall
hollyhocks in the garden beyond.Before this portrait, Patience found Sextoness Jane standing in mute
astonishment."Betsy looks like she was just going to say--'take your hands out of
the dish!'Betsy had once helped out
at the parsonage, during a brief illness of Miranda's, and the young
lady knew whereof she spoke."I'd never've thought," Jane said slowly, "that anyone'd get that fond
of Sister Todd--as to want a picture of her!""Oh, it's because she's such a character, you know," Patience explained
serenely.Jane was so good about letting one explain things."'A
perfect character,' I heard one of those artist men say so.""Not what I'd call a 'perfect'
character--not that I've got anything against Sister Todd; but she's
too fond of finding out a body's faults."Patience went off then in search of empty tea-cups.She was having a
beautiful time; at present only one cloud overshadowed her horizon.Already some tiresome folks were beginning to think about going.There
was the talk of chores to be done, suppers to get, and with the
breaking up, must come an end to her share in the party.For mother,
though approached in the most delicate fashion, had proved obdurate
regarding the further festivity to follow.Had mother been willing to
consider the matter, Patience would have cheerfully undertaken to
procure the necessary invitation.Shirley was a very obliging girl."And really, my dears," she said, addressing the three P's
collectively, "it does seem a pity to have to go home before the fun's
all over.And I could manage it--Bob would take me out rowing--if I
coaxed--he rows very slowly.I don't suppose, for one moment, that we
would get back in time.I believe--"  For fully three minutes,
Patience sat quite still in one of the studio window seats, oblivious
of the chatter going on all about her; then into her blue eyes came a
look not seen there very often--"No," she said sternly, shaking her
head at Phil, much to his surprise, for he wasn't doing anything."No--it wouldn't be _square_--and there would be the most awful to-do
afterwards."Shaw called to her to come, that
father was waiting, Patience responded with a very good grace.Dayre caught the wistful look in the child's face."Bless me," he said
heartily."You're not going to take Patience home with you, Mrs.Let her stay for the tea--the young people won't keep late hours, I
assure you.""Sometimes, I find it quite as well not to think things over," Mr."Why, dear me, I'd quite counted on Patience's being
here.You see, I'm not a regular member, either; and I want someone to
keep me in countenance."So presently, Hilary felt a hand slipped eagerly into hers."And oh, I
just love Mr.Then Patience went back to her window seat to play the delightful game
of "making believe" she hadn't stayed.She imagined that instead, she
was sitting between father and mother in the gig, bubbling over with
the desire to "hi-yi" at Fanny, picking her slow way along.The studio was empty, even the dogs were outside, speeding the parting
guests with more zeal than discretion.But after awhile Harry Oram
strolled in."You're an
artist, too, aren't you?""So kind of you to say so," Harry murmured."I have heard grave doubts
expressed on the subject by my too impartial friends.""I mean to be one when I grow up," Patience told him, "so's I can have
a room like this--with just rugs on the floor; rugs slide so
nicely--and window seats and things all cluttery.""May I come and have tea with you?"It'll be really tea--not pretend kind," Patience said."But I'll have
that sort for any children who may come.Hilary takes pictures--she
doesn't make them though.Harry glanced through the open doorway, to where
Hilary sat resting.She was "making" a picture now, he thought to
himself, in her white dress, under the big tree, her pretty hair
forming a frame about her thoughtful face.Taking a portfolio from a
table near by, he went out to where Hilary sat."Your small sister says you take pictures," he said, drawing a chair up
beside hers, "so I thought perhaps you'd let me show you these--they
were taken by a friend of mine.""Oh, but mine aren't anything like these!Hilary bent over the photographs he handed her; marveling over their
soft tones.They were mostly bits of landscape, with here and there a
water view and one or two fleecy cloud effects.It hardly seemed as
though they could be really photographs."I wish I
could--there are some beautiful views about here that would make
charming pictures.""She didn't in the beginning," Harry said, "She's lame; it was an
accident, but she can never be quite well again, so she took this up,
as an amusement at first, but now it's going to be her profession.""And you really think--anyone
could learn to do it?""No, not anyone; but I don't see why the right sort of person couldn't.""I wonder--if I could develop into the right sort.""May I come and see what you have done--and talk it over?""Since this friend of mine took it up, I'm ever so interested in camera
work."She had never thought of her camera
holding such possibilities within it, of its growing into something
better and more satisfying than a mere playmate of the moment.Supper was served on the lawn; the pleasantest, most informal, of
affairs, the presence of the older members of the party serving to turn
the gay give and take of the young folks into deeper and wider
channels, and Shirley's frequent though involuntary--"Do you remember,
Senior?"calling out more than one vivid bit of travel, of description
of places, known to most of them only through books.Later, down on the lower end of the lawn, with the moon making a path
of silver along the water, and the soft hush of the summer night over
everything, Shirley brought out her guitar, singing for them strange
folk-songs, picked up in her rambles with her father.Afterwards, the
whole party sang songs that they all knew, ending up at last with the
club song."'It's a habit to be happy,'" the fresh young voices chorused, sending
the tune far out across the lake; and presently, from a boat on its
further side, it was whistled back to them.Edna said,

"Give it up," Tom answered."Someone who's heard it--there've been
plenty of opportunities for folks to hear it.""Well it isn't a bad gospel to scatter broadcast," Bob remarked."And maybe it's someone who doesn't live about here, and he will go
away taking our tune with him, for other people to catch up," Hilary
suggested."But if he only has the tune and not the words," Josie objected, "what
use will that be?""The spirit of the words is in the tune," Pauline said."No one could
whistle or sing it and stay grumpy.""They'd have to 'put the frown away awhile, and try a little sunny
smile,' wouldn't they?"Patience had been a model of behavior all the evening.Mother would be
sure to ask if she had been good, when they got home.That was one of
those aggravating questions that only time could relieve her from.No
one ever asked Paul, or Hilary, that--when they'd been anywhere.Dayre had promised, the party broke up early, going off in the
various rigs they had come in.Tom and Josie went in the trap with the
Shaws."It's been perfectly lovely--all of it," Josie said, looking
back along the road they were leaving."Every good time we have seems
the best one yet.""You wait 'til my turn comes," Pauline told her."I've such a scheme
in my head."She was in front, between Tom, who was
driving, and Hilary, then she leaned forward, they were nearly home,
and the lights of the parsonage showed through the trees."There's a
light in the parlor--there's company!""And one up in our old room, Hilary.Goodness,
it must be a visiting minister!I didn't know father was expecting
anyone.""I just bet it
isn't any visiting minister--but a visiting--uncle!I feel it in my
bones, as Miranda says.""I feel it in my bones," Patience repeated."I just _knew_ Uncle Paul
would come up--a story-book uncle would be sure to.""Well, here we are," Tom laughed."You'll know for certain pretty
quick."CHAPTER X

THE END OF SUMMER

It was Uncle Paul, and perhaps no one
was more surprised at his unexpected coming,
than he himself.That snap-shot of Hilary's had considerable
to do with it; bringing home to him the
sudden realization of the passing of the years.For the first time, he had allowed himself to
face the fact that it was some time now since
he had crossed the summit of the hill, and that
under present conditions, his old age promised
to be a lonely, cheerless affair.He had never had much to do with young
people; but, all at once, it seemed to him that
it might prove worth his while to cultivate
the closer acquaintance of these nieces of his.Pauline, in particular, struck him as likely to
improve upon a nearer acquaintance.And
that afternoon, as he rode up Broadway, he
found himself wondering how she would
enjoy the ride; and all the sights and wonders
of the great city.Later, over his solitary dinner, he suddenly
decided to run up to Winton the next day.He would not wire them, he would rather like
to take Phil by surprise.So he had arrived at the parsonage,
driving up in Jed's solitary hack, and much plied
with information, general and personal, on the
way, just as the minister and his wife reached
home from the manor.Doesn't father look
tickled to death!"Patience declared, coming
in to her sisters' room that night, ostensibly
to have an obstinate knot untied, but inwardly
determined to make a third at the usual
bedtime talk for that once, at least.It wasn't
often they all came up together."He looks mighty glad," Pauline said."And isn't it funny, bearing him called
Phil?"Patience curled herself up in the
cozy corner."I never've thought of father
as Phil."Hilary paused in the braiding of her long
hair."I'm glad we've got to know him--Uncle
Paul, I mean--through his letters, and
all the lovely things he's done for us; else, I
think I'd have been very much afraid of him.""So am I," Pauline assented.Oram meant--he doesn't look as if
he believed much in fairy stories.But I like
his looks--he's so nice and tall and straight.""He used to have red hair, before it turned
gray," Hilary said, "so that must be a family
trait; your chin's like his, Paul, too,--so
square and determined.""You cut to bed, youngster," Pauline
commanded."You're losing all your beauty
sleep; and really, you know--"

Patience went to stand before the mirror."Maybe I ain't--pretty--yet; but I'm going
to be--some day.Dayre says he likes
red hair, I asked him.He says for me not to
worry; I'll have them all sitting up and taking notice yet."At which Pauline bore promptly down
upon her, escorting her in person to the door
of her own room."And you'd better get to
bed pretty quickly, too, Hilary," she advised,
coming back."You've had enough excitement for one day."Paul Shaw stayed a week; it was a
busy week for the parsonage folk and for
some other people besides.Before it was
over, the story-book uncle had come to know
his nieces and Winton fairly thoroughly;
while they, on their side, had grown very well
acquainted with the tall, rather silent man,
who had a fashion of suggesting the most
delightful things to do in the most matter-of-fact manner.There were one or two trips decidedly
outside that ten-mile limit, including an all day
sail up the lake, stopping for the night at a
hotel on the New York shore and returning
by the next day's boat.There was a visit to
Vergennes, which took in a round of the shops,
a concert, and another night away from home.Hilary
sighed blissfully one morning, as she and her
uncle waited on the porch for Bedelia and
the trap.Hilary was to drive him over to
The Maples for dinner."Or such a summer altogether," Pauline
added, from just inside the study window."I should think it has; we ought to be
eternally grateful to you for making us find
them out," Pauline declared.Shaw smiled, more as if to himself."I
daresay they're not all exhausted yet.""Perhaps," Hilary said slowly, "some
places are like some people, the longer and
better you know them, the more you keep
finding out in them to like.""Father says," Pauline suggested, "that one
finds, as a rule, what one is looking for.""Here we are," her uncle exclaimed, as
Patience appeared, driving Bedelia."Do you
know," he said, as he and Hilary turned out
into the wide village street, "I haven't seen the
schoolhouse yet?"It isn't
much of a building," Hilary answered."It is said to be a very good school for the
size of the place."Hilary turned Bedelia
up the little by-road, leading to the old
weather-beaten schoolhouse, standing back
from the road in an open space of bare ground.I would've been this June, if I
hadn't broken down last winter.""You will be able to go on this fall?"He says, if all his patients got on so
well, by not following his advice, he'd have
to shut up shop, but that, fortunately for
him, they haven't all got a wise uncle down in
New York, to offer counter-advice."Shaw remarked,
adding, "and Pauline considers herself through school?"I know she would like
to go on--but we've no higher school here and--She
read last winter, quite a little, with
father."Supposing you both had an opportunity--for
it must be both, or neither, I judge--and
the powers that be consented--how about
going away to school this winter?"she
cried, "you mean--"

"I have a trick of meaning what I say," her
uncle said, smiling at her."I wish I could say--what I want to--and
can't find words for--" Hilary said."We haven't consulted the higher authorities
yet, you know.""And--Oh, I don't see how mother could
get on without us, even if--"

"Mothers have a knack at getting along
without a good many things--when it means
helping their young folks on a bit,"
Mr."I'll have a talk with her
and your father to-night."That evening, pacing up and down the
front veranda with his brother, Mr.Shaw
said, with his customary abruptness, "You
seem to have fitted in here, Phil,--perhaps, you
were in the right of it, after all.I take it
you haven't had such a hard time, in some ways."Looking back nearly twenty years, he told
himself, that he did not regret that early
choice of his.He had fitted into the life here;
he and his people had grown together.It had
not always been smooth sailing and more than
once, especially the past year or so, his
narrow means had pressed him sorely, but on the
whole, he had found his lines cast in a
pleasant place, and was not disposed to rebel
against his heritage."Yes," he said, at last, "I have fitted in;
too easily, perhaps."Except in the accumulating of books," his
brother suggested."I have not been
able to give unlimited rein even to that mild
ambition.Fortunately, the rarer the
opportunity, the greater the pleasure it brings
with it--and the old books never lose their charm."Paul Shaw flicked the ashes from his
cigar."And the girls--you expect them to
fit in, too?"A note the elder
brother knew of old sounded in the younger
man's voice."Don't mount your high horse just yet,
Phil," he said."I'm not going to rub you up
the wrong way--at least, I don't mean to; but
you were always an uncommonly hard chap to
handle--in some matters.I grant you, it is
their home and not a had sort of home for a
girl to grow up in."Shaw stood for a
moment at the head of the steps, looking off
down the peaceful, shadowy street.It had
been a pleasant week; he had enjoyed it
wonderfully.Already the city
was calling to him; he was homesick for its
rush and bustle, the sense of life and movement."You and I stand as far apart to-day, in
some matters, Phil, as we did twenty--thirty
years ago," he said presently, "and that eldest
daughter of yours--I'm a fair hand at reading
character or I shouldn't be where I am to-day,
if I were not--is more like me than you.""So I have come to think--lately.""That second girl takes after you; she
would never have written that letter to me
last May.""No, Hilary would not have at the time--"

"Oh, I can guess how you felt about it at
the time.But, look here, Phil, you've got
over that--surely?After all, I like to think
now that Pauline only hurried on the
inevitable."Paul Shaw laid his hand on the
minister's shoulder."Nearly twenty years is
a pretty big piece out of a lifetime.I see now
how much I have been losing all these years.""It has been a long time, Paul; and,
perhaps, I have been to blame in not trying more
persistently to heal the breach between us.I
assure you that I have regretted it daily.""You always did have a lot more pride in
your make-up than a man of your profession
has any right to allow himself, Phil.But if
you like, I'm prepared to point out to you
right now how you can make it up to me.Here comes Lady Shaw and we won't
waste time getting to business."That night, as Pauline and Hilary were in
their own room, busily discussing, for by no
means the first time that day, what Uncle Paul
had said to Hilary that morning, and just
how he had looked, when he said it, and was
it at all possible that father would consent,
and so on, _ad libitum_, their mother tapped at the door."That is how you take it," Mrs.She was glad, very glad, that this
unforeseen opportunity should be given her
daughters; and yet--it meant the first break
in the home circle, the first leaving home for them."I'll try and run up for a day or two, before
the girls go to school," he promised his
sister-in-law."Let me know, as soon as you have
decided _where_ to send them."Patience was divided in her opinion, as to
this new plan.It would be lonesome without
Paul and Hilary; but then, for the time
being, she would be, to all intents and purposes,
"Miss Shaw."Also, Bedelia was not going
to boarding-school--on the whole, the
arrangement had its advantages.Of course,
later, she would have her turn at school--Patience
meant to devote a good deal of her
winter's reading to boarding-school stories.She told Sextoness Jane so, when that
person appeared, just before supper time."A lot of things
keep happening to you folks right along," she
observed."Nothing's ever happened to me,
'cept mumps--and things of that sort; you
wouldn't call them interesting."They're 'round on the porch, looking at
some photos Mr.Oram's brought over; and
he's looking at Hilary's.Hilary's going in
for some other kind of picture taking.I wish
she'd leave her camera home, when she goes to
school.Do you want to speak to them about
anything particular?""I'll wait a bit," Jane sat down on the
garden-bench beside Patience.the latter said, as the
front gate clicked a few moments later.she called, "You're wanted, Paul!""You and Hilary going to be busy
tonight?"Jane asked, as Pauline came across
the lawn."Well," Jane said, "it ain't prayer-meeting
night, and it ain't young peoples' night and it
ain't choir practice night, so I thought maybe
you'd like me to take my turn at showing you
something.Not all the club--like's not they
wouldn't care for it, but if you think they
would, why, you can show it to them sometime.""So can I--if you tell mother you want me
to," Patience put in."A good two miles--we'd best walk--we
can rest after we get there.Maybe, if you
like, you'd better ask Tom and Josie.Your
ma'll be better satisfied if he goes along, I
reckon.I'll come for you at about half-past
seven.""All right, thank you ever so much," Pauline
said, and went to tell Hilary, closely
pursued by Patience.Shaw
vetoed Pauline's proposition that Patience
should make one of the party."Not every time, my dear," she explained.Promptly at half-past seven Jane
appeared.she said, as the four
young people came to meet her."You don't
want to go expecting anything out of the
common.Like's not, you've all seen it a heap
of times, but maybe not to take particular
notice of it."She led the way through the garden to the
lane running past her cottage, where Tobias
sat in solitary dignity on the doorstep, down
the lane to where it merged in to what was
nothing more than a field path."But not out on the water," Josie said."You're taking us too far below the pier for that.""It'll be on the water--what
you're going to see," she was getting
a good deal of pleasure out of her small
mystery, and when they reached the low shore,
fringed with the tall sea-grass, she took her
party a few steps along it to where an old log
lay a little back from the water."I reckon
we'll have to wait a bit," she said, "but it'll
be 'long directly."They sat down in a row, the young people
rather mystified.Apparently the broad
expanse of almost motionless water was quite
deserted.There was a light breeze blowing
and the soft swishing of the tiny waves against
the bank was the only sound to break the
stillness; the sky above the long irregular range
of mountains on the New York side, still wore
its sunset colors, the lake below sending hack
a faint reflection of them.But presently these faded until only the
afterglow was left, to merge in turn into the
soft summer twilight, through which the stars
began to glimpse, one by one.The little group had been mostly silent,
each busy with his or her thoughts; so far as
the young people were concerned, happy
thoughts enough; for if the closing of each
day brought their summer nearer to its
ending, the fall would bring with it new
experiences, an entering of new scenes.Sextoness Jane broke the silence,
pointing up the lake, to where a tiny point of
red showed like a low-hung star through the
gathering darkness.Moment by moment,
other lights came into view, silently, steadily,
until it seemed like some long, gliding
sea-serpent, creeping down towards them through
the night.They had all seen it, times without number,
before.The long line of canal boats being
towed down the lake to the canal below; the
red lanterns at either end of each boat
showing as they came.But to-night, infected
perhaps, by the pride, the evident delight, in
Jane's voice, the old familiar sight held them
with the new interest the past months had
brought to bear upon so many old, familiar things."It is--wonderful," Pauline said at last."It might be a scene from--fairyland, almost.""Me--I love to see them come stealing long
like that through the dark," Jane said slowly
and a little hesitatingly.It was odd to be
telling confidences to anyone except Tobias."I don't know where they come from, nor
where they're a-going to.Many's the night
I walk over here just on the chance of seeing
one.Mostly, this time of year, you're pretty
likely to catch one.When I was younger, I
used to sit and fancy myself going aboard on
one of them and setting off for strange parts.I wasn't looking to settle down here in Winton
all my days; but I reckon, maybe, it's just's
well--anyhow, when I got the freedom to
travel, I'd got out of the notion of it--and
perhaps, there's no telling, I might have been
terribly disappointed.And there ain't any
hindrance 'gainst my setting off--in my own
mind--every time I sits here and watches a
tow go down the lake.I've seen a heap of
big churches in my travels--it's mostly easier
'magining about them--churches are pretty
much alike I reckon, though I ain't seen many, I'll admit."No one answered for a moment, but Jane,
used to Tobias for a listener, did not mind.Then in the darkness, Hilary laid a hand
softly over the work-worn ones clasped on
Jane's lap.It was hard to imagine Jane
young and full of youthful fancies and
longings; yet years ago there had been a Jane--not
Sextoness Jane then--who had found
Winton dull and dreary and had longed to get
away.But for her, there had been no one to
wave the magic wand, that should transform
the little Vermont village into a place filled
with new and unexplored charms.Never in
all Jane's many summers, had she known one
like this summer of theirs; and for them--the
wonder was by no means over--the years
ahead were bright with untold possibilities.Hilary sighed for very happiness, wondering
if she were the same girl who had rocked
listlessly in the hammock that June morning,
protesting that she didn't care for "half-way" things."I'm ever so glad we came, thank you so
much, Jane," Pauline said heartily."I wonder what'll have happened by the
time we all see our next tow go down," Josie
said, as they started towards home."We may see a good many more than one
before the general exodus," her brother answered."But we won't have time to come watch for
them.Oh, Paul, just think, only a little
while now--"

Tom slipped into step with Hilary, a little
behind the others."I never supposed the old
soul had it in her," he said, glancing to where
Jane trudged heavily on ahead."Still, I
suppose she was young--once; though I've never
thought of her being so before.""I wonder,--maybe,
she's been better off, after all, right, here at
home.She wouldn't have got to be
Sextoness Jane anywhere else, probably.""Is there a
hidden meaning--subject to be carefully avoided?""So you and Paul are off on your travels, too?""Yes, though I can hardly believe it yet.""And just as glad to go as any of us.""Oh, but we're coming back--after we've
been taught all manner of necessary things.""Edna'll be the only one of you girls left
behind; it's rough on her.""It certainly is; we'll all have to write her
heaps of letters.""Much time there'll be for letter-writing,
outside of the home ones," Tom said."Speaking of time," Josie turned towards
them, "we're going to be busier than any bee
ever dreamed of being, before or since Dr.They certainly were busy days that
followed.So many of the young folks were
going off that fall that a good many of the
meetings of "The S. W. F. Club" resolved
themselves into sewing-bees, for the girl members only."If we'd known how jolly they were, we'd
have tried them before," Bell declared one
morning, dropping down on the rug Pauline
had spread under the trees at one end of the
parsonage lawn.Patience, pulling bastings with a business-like
air, nodded her curly head wisely."Miranda says,
folks mostly get 'round to enjoying
their blessings 'bout the time they come to lose them.""Has the all-important question been
settled yet, Paul?"Edna asked, looking up from
her work.She might not be going away to
school, but even so, that did not debar one
from new fall clothes at home."They're coming to Vergennes with me,"
Bell said."Then we can all come home
together Friday nights.""They're coming to Boston with me," Josie
corrected, "then we'll be back together for
Thanksgiving."Shirley, meekly taking her first sewing
lessons under Pauline's instructions, and frankly
declaring that she didn't at all like them,
dropped the hem she was turning."They're
coming to New York with me; and in the
between-times we'll have such fun that they'll
never want to come home.""It looks as though
Hilary and I would have a busy winter
between you all.It is a comfort to know where
we are going."she warned, when later the
party broke up."Are we going out in a blaze of glory?""You might tell us where we are going,
now, Paul," Josie urged."You wait until
Friday, like good little girls.Mind, you all
bring wraps; it'll be chilly coming home."Pauline's turn was to be the final wind-up
of the club's regular outings.No one outside
the home folks, excepting Tom, had been
taken into her confidence--it had been
necessary to press him into service.And when, on
Friday afternoon, the young people gathered
at the parsonage, all but those named were
still in the dark.Allen, Harry Oram and Patience
were there; the minister and Dr.Brice
had promised to join the party later if possible.As a rule, the club picnics were cooperative
affairs; but to-day the members, by special
request, arrived empty-handed.Paul
Shaw, learning that Pauline's turn was yet to
come, had insisted on having a share in it."I am greatly interested in this club," he
had explained."I like results, and I think,"
he glanced at Hilary's bright happy face,
"that the 'S.W. F. Club' has achieved at least
one very good result."And on the morning before the eventful
Friday, a hamper had arrived from New
York, the watching of the unpacking of which
had again transformed Patience, for the time,
from an interrogation to an exclamation point."It's a beautiful hamper," she explained to
Towser."It truly is--because father says,
it's the inner, not the outer, self that makes
for real beauty, or ugliness; and it certainly
was the inside of that hamper that counted.I wish you were going, Towser.See here,
suppose you follow on kind of quietly
to-morrow afternoon--don't show up too soon, and
I guess I can manage it."Which piece of advice Towser must have
understood.At any rate, he acted upon it to
the best of his ability, following the party at a
discreet distance through the garden and down
the road towards the lake; and only when the
halt at the pier came, did he venture near, the
most insinuating of dogs.And so successfully did Patience manage
it, that when the last boat-load pushed off
from shore, Towser sat erect on the narrow
bow seat, blandly surveying his fellow
voyagers."He does so love picnics," Patience
explained to Mr.Dayre, "and this is
the last particular one for the season.I kind
of thought he'd go along and I slipped in a
little paper of bones.""We're out on the wide ocean sailing.""I wish we
were--the water's quiet as a mill-pond this afternoon."For the great lake, appreciating perhaps
the importance of the occasion, had of its many
moods chosen to wear this afternoon its
sweetest, most beguiling one, and lay, a broad
stretch of sparkling, rippling water, between
its curving shores.Beyond, the range of mountains rose dark
and somber against the cloud-flecked sky,
their tops softened by the light haze that told
of coming autumn.And presently, from boat to boat, went the
call, "We're going to Port Edward!"But that's not _in_ Winton," Edna protested."Of it, if not in it," Jack Ward assured them."Do you reckon you can show us anything
new about that old fort, Paul Shaw?""Why, I could go all over it
blindfolded.""Not to show the new--to unfold the old,"
Pauline told him."It is--in substance," Pauline looked across
her shoulder to where Mr.Allen sat,
imparting information to Harry Oram."So that's why you asked the old fellow,"
Tracy said.They were rounding the slender point on
which the tall, white lighthouse stood, and
entering the little cove where visitors to the fort
usually beached their boats.A few rods farther inland, rose the tall,
grass-covered, circular embankment,
surrounding the crumbling, gray walls, the outer
shells of the old barracks.At the entrance to the enclosure, Tom
suddenly stepped ahead, barring the way."No
passing within this fort without the
counter-sign," he declared."'It's a
habit to be happy,'" she suggested, and Tom
drew back for her to enter.But one by one,
he exacted the password from each.Inside, within the shade of those old, gray
walls, a camp-fire had been built and
camp-kettle swung, hammocks had been hung under
the trees and when cushions were scattered
here and there the one-time fort bore anything
but a martial air.But something of the spirit of the past must
have been in the air that afternoon, or perhaps,
the spirit of the coming changes; for this
picnic--though by no means lacking in charm--was
not as gay and filled with light-hearted
chaff as usual.There was more talking in
quiet groups, or really serious searching for
some trace of those long-ago days of storm and stress.With the coming of evening, the fire was
lighted and the cloth laid within range of its
flickering shadows.The night breeze had
sprung up and from outside the sloping
embankment they caught the sound of the waves
breaking on the beach.True to their
promise, the minister and Dr.Brice appeared at
the time appointed and were eagerly welcomed
by the young people.Supper was a long, delightful affair that
night, with much talk of the days when the
fort had been devoted to far other purposes
than the present; and the young people,
listening to the tales Mr.Allen told in his quiet yet
strangely vivid way, seemed to hear the slow
creeping on of the boats outside and to be
listening in the pauses of the wind for the
approach of the enemy."I'll take it back, Paul," Tracy told her, as
they were repacking the baskets."Even the
old fort has developed new interests."W. F. Club' will
continue its good work," Jack said.Going back, Pauline found herself sitting
in the stern of one of the boats, beside her
father.The club members were singing the
club song.But Pauline's thoughts had
suddenly gone back to that wet May afternoon.She could see the dreary, rain-swept garden,
hear the beating of the drops on the
window-panes.How long ago and remote it all
seemed; how far from the hopeless discontent,
the vague longings, the real anxiety of that
time, she and Hilary had traveled."There's one thing,"
she said, "we've had one summer that I shall
always feel would be worth reliving.And
we're going to have more of them.""I am glad to hear that," Mr.Pauline looked about her--the lanterns at
the ends of the boats threw dancing lights out
across the water, no longer quiet; overhead,
the sky was bright with stars."Everything
is so beautiful," the girl said slowly."One
seems to feel it more--every day.""'The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the
Lord hath made even both of them,'" her
father quoted gravely."The
hearing ear and the seeing eye"--it was a good
thought to take with them--out into the new
life, among the new scenes.One would need
them everywhere--out in the world, as well as
in Winton.And then, from the boat just
ahead, sounded Patience's clear
treble,--"'There's a Good Time Coming.'"It was a frightful suggestion, and we looked to see Eleanore Leavenworth
recoil.But that expression of outraged feeling was left for her cousin
to exhibit.Starting indignantly from her seat, Mary cast one hurried
glance around her, and opened her lips to speak; but Eleanore, slightly
turning, motioned her to have patience, and replied in a cold and
calculating voice: "You are not sure, sir, that this _was_ done.If my
uncle, for some purpose of his own, had fired the pistol off yesterday,
let us say--which is surely possible, if not probable--the like results
would be observed, and the same conclusions drawn.""Miss Leavenworth," the coroner went on, "the ball has been extracted
from your uncle's head!""It corresponds with those in the cartridges found in his stand drawer,
and is of the number used with this pistol."Her head fell forward on her hands; her eyes sought the floor; her whole
attitude expressed disheartenment.Seeing it, the coroner grew still
more grave."Miss Leavenworth," said he, "I have now some questions to put you
concerning last night."You, however, saw your uncle or your cousin during the course of it?""No, sir; I saw no one after leaving the dinner table--except Thomas,"
she added, after a moment's pause."He came to bring me the card of a gentleman who called.""May I ask the name of the gentleman?"The matter seemed trivial; but the sudden start given by the lady at my
side made me remember it."Miss Leavenworth, when seated in your room, are you in the habit of
leaving your door open?""Not in the habit; no,
sir.""Why did you leave it open last night?""Was that before or after the servants went up?"Harwell when he left the library and ascended to his
room?""How much longer did you leave your door open after that?""I--I--a few minutes--a--I cannot say," she added, hurriedly.How pale her face was, and how she trembled!"Miss Leavenworth, according to evidence, your uncle came to his death
not very long after Mr.If your door was open, you
ought to have heard if any one went to his room, or any pistol shot was
fired."I heard no confusion; no, sir.""Miss Leavenworth, excuse my persistence, but did you hear anything?"Why
do you ask me so many questions?"I leaped to my feet; she was swaying, almost fainting.But before I
could reach her, she had drawn herself up again, and resumed her former
demeanor."Excuse me," said she; "I am not myself this morning.I beg
your pardon," and she turned steadily to the coroner."I asked," and his voice grew thin and high,--evidently her manner was
beginning to tell against her,--"when it was you heard the library door
shut?""I cannot fix the precise time, but it was after Mr.Harwell came up,
and before I closed my own."The coroner cast a quick look at the jury, who almost to a man glanced
aside as he did so."Miss Leavenworth, we are told that Hannah, one of the servants, started
for your room late last night after some medicine."When did you first learn of her remarkable disappearance from this
house during the night?"Molly met me in the hall, and asked
how Hannah was.I thought the inquiry a strange one, and naturally
questioned her.A moment's talk made the conclusion plain that the girl
was gone.""What did you think when you became assured of this fact?""No suspicion of foul play crossed your mind?""You did not connect the fact with that of your uncle's murder?""I did not know of this murder then.""Oh, some thought of the possibility of her knowing something about it
may have crossed my mind; I cannot say.""Can you tell us anything of this girl's past history?""I can tell you no more in regard to it than my cousin has done.""Do you not know what made her sad at night?"Her cheek flushed angrily; was it at his tone, or at the question
itself?she never confided her secrets to my keeping.""Then you cannot tell us where she would be likely to go upon leaving
this house?""Miss Leavenworth, we are obliged to put another question to you.We are
told it was by your order your uncle's body was removed from where it
was found, into the next room.""Didn't you know it to be improper for you or any one else to disturb
the body of a person found dead, except in the presence and under the
authority of the proper officer?""I did not consult my knowledge, sir, in regard to the subject: only my
feelings.""Then I suppose it was your feelings which prompted you to remain
standing by the table at which he was murdered, instead of following the
body in and seeing it properly deposited?Or perhaps," he went on, with
relentless sarcasm, "you were too much interested, just then, in the
piece of paper you took away, to think much of the proprieties of the
occasion?""Who says I took a piece
of paper from the table?""One witness has sworn to seeing you bend over the table upon which
several papers lay strewn; another, to meeting you a few minutes later
in the hall just as you were putting a piece of paper into your pocket.This was a home thrust, and we looked to see some show of agitation, but
her haughty lip never quivered."You have drawn the inference, and you must prove the fact."The answer was stateliness itself, and we were not surprised to see the
coroner look a trifle baffled; but, recovering himself, he said:

"Miss Leavenworth, I must ask you again, whether you did or did not take
anything from that table?""I decline answering the question," she quietly
said."Pardon me," he rejoined: "it is necessary that you should.""When any suspicious paper
is found in my possession, it will be time enough then for me to explain
how I came by it.""Do you realize to what this refusal is liable to subject you?""I am afraid that I do; yes, sir."Gryce lifted his hand, and softly twirled the tassel of the window
curtain.It had now become evident to all, that Eleanore Leavenworth not only
stood on her defence, but was perfectly aware of her position, and
prepared to maintain it.Even her cousin, who until now had preserved
some sort of composure, began to show signs of strong and uncontrollable
agitation, as if she found it one thing to utter an accusation herself,
and quite another to see it mirrored in the countenances of the men
about her."Miss Leavenworth," the coroner continued, changing the line of attack,
"you have always had free access to your uncle's apartments, have you
not?""Might even have entered his room late at night, crossed it and stood at
his side, without disturbing him sufficiently to cause him to turn his
head?""Yes," her hands pressing themselves painfully together."Miss Leavenworth, the key to the library door is missing.""It has been testified to, that previous to the actual discovery of the
murder, you visited the door of the library alone.Will you tell us if
the key was then in the lock?""Now, was there anything peculiar about this key, either in size or
shape?"She strove to repress the sudden terror which this question produced,
glanced carelessly around at the group of servants stationed at her
back, and trembled."It was a little different from the others," she
finally acknowledged."Ah, gentlemen, the handle was broken!"emphasized the coroner, looking
towards the jury.Gryce seemed to take this information to himself, for he gave
another of his quick nods."You would, then, recognize this key, Miss Leavenworth, if you should
see it?"She cast a startled look at him, as if she expected to behold it in his
hand; but, seeming to gather courage at not finding it produced, replied
quite easily:

"I think I should, sir."The coroner seemed satisfied, and was about to dismiss the witness when
Mr.Gryce quietly advanced and touched him on the arm."One moment,"
said that gentleman, and stooping, he whispered a few words in the
coroner's ear; then, recovering himself, stood with his right hand in
his breast pocket and his eye upon the chandelier.Had he repeated to the coroner the words
he had inadvertently overheard in the hall above?But a glance at
the latter's face satisfied me that nothing of such importance had
transpired.He looked not only tired, but a trifle annoyed."Miss Leavenworth," said he, turning again in her direction; "you have
declared that you did not visit your uncle's room last evening.Gryce, who immediately drew from his breast a
handkerchief curiously soiled."It is strange, then, that your
handkerchief should have been found this morning in that room."Then, while Mary's face hardened into a sort of
strong despair, Eleanore tightened her lips and coldly replied, "I
do not see as it is so very strange.I was in that room early this
morning."A distressed blush crossed her face; she did not reply.What we now wish, is to know how it came to be in your
uncle's apartment."I have told
you I was in the habit of visiting his room.But first, let me see if it
is my handkerchief.""I presume so, as I am told it has your initials embroidered in the
corner," he remarked, as Mr.They look like--"

"--what they are," said the coroner."If you have ever cleaned a pistol,
you must know what they are, Miss Leavenworth."She let the handkerchief fall convulsively from her hand, and stood
staring at it, lying before her on the floor."I know nothing about it,
gentlemen," she said."It is my handkerchief, but--" for some cause she
did not finish her sentence, but again repeated, "Indeed, gentlemen, I
know nothing about it!"Kate, the cook, was now recalled, and asked to tell when she last washed
the handkerchief?"This, sir; this handkerchief?Oh, some time this week, sir," throwing a
deprecatory glance at her mistress."Well, I wish I could forget, Miss Eleanore, but I can' t. It is the
only one like it in the house."Yesterday morning," half choking over the words."And when did you take it to her room?"The cook threw her apron over her head."Yesterday afternoon, with the
rest of the clothes, just before dinner.Indade, I could not help it,
Miss Eleanore!"This somewhat contradictory evidence
had very sensibly affected her; and when, a moment later, the coroner,
having dismissed the witness, turned towards her, and inquired if she
had anything further to say in the way of explanation or otherwise,
she threw her hands up almost spasmodically, slowly shook her head and,
without word or warning, fainted quietly away in her chair.A commotion, of course, followed, during which I noticed that Mary did
not hasten to her cousin, but left it for Molly and Kate to do what
they could toward her resuscitation.In a few moments this was in so far
accomplished that they were enabled to lead her from the room.As they
did so, I observed a tall man rise and follow her out.A momentary silence ensued, soon broken, however, by an impatient stir
as our little juryman rose and proposed that the jury should now adjourn
for the day.This seeming to fall in with the coroner's views, he
announced that the inquest would stand adjourned till three o'clock the
next day, when he trusted all the jurors would be present.A general rush followed, that in a few minutes emptied the room of all
but Miss Leavenworth, Mr.A DISCOVERY


    "His rolling Eies did never rest in place,
     But walkte each where for feare of hid mischance,
     Holding a lattis still before his Pace,
     Through which he still did peep as forward he did pace."MISS LEAVENWORTH, who appeared to have lingered from a vague terror
of everything and everybody in the house not under her immediate
observation, shrank from my side the moment she found herself left
comparatively alone, and, retiring to a distant corner, gave herself
up to grief.Turning my attention, therefore, in the direction of Mr.Gryce, I found that person busily engaged in counting his own fingers
with a troubled expression upon his countenance, which may or may not
have been the result of that arduous employment.But, at my approach,
satisfied perhaps that he possessed no more than the requisite number,
he dropped his hands and greeted me with a faint smile which was,
considering all things, too suggestive to be pleasant."Well," said I, taking my stand before him, "I cannot blame you.You had
a right to do as you thought best; but how had you the heart?Was she
not sufficiently compromised without your bringing out that wretched
handkerchief, which she may or may not have dropped in that room,
but whose presence there, soiled though it was with pistol grease, is
certainly no proof that she herself was connected with this murder?"Raymond," he returned, "I have been detailed as police officer and
detective to look after this case, and I propose to do it.""Of course," I hastened to reply."I am the last man to wish you to
shirk your duly; but you cannot have the temerity to declare that this
young and tender creature can by any possibility be considered as at all
likely to be implicated in a crime so monstrous and unnatural.The mere
assertion of another woman's suspicions on the subject ought not----"

But here Mr."You talk when your attention should
be directed to more important matters.That other woman, as you are
pleased to designate the fairest ornament of New York society, sits over
there in tears; go and comfort her."Looking at him in amazement, I hesitated to comply; but, seeing he was
in earnest, crossed to Mary Leavenworth and sat down by her side.She was weeping, but in a slow, unconscious way, as if grief had been
mastered by fear.The fear was too undisguised and the grief too natural
for me to doubt the genuineness of either."Miss Leavenworth," said I, "any attempt at consolation on the part of a
stranger must seem at a time like this the most bitter of mockeries; but
do try and consider that circumstantial evidence is not always absolute
proof."Starting with surprise, she turned her eyes upon me with a slow,
comprehensive gaze wonderful to see in orbs so tender and womanly."No," she repeated; "circumstantial evidence is not absolute proof, but
Eleanore does not know this.She is so intense; she cannot see but one
thing at a time.She has been running her head into a noose, and oh,--"
Pausing, she clutched my arm with a passionate grasp: "Do you think
there is any danger?Will they--" She could not go on."Miss Leavenworth," I protested, with a warning look toward the
detective, "what do you mean?"Like a flash, her glance followed mine, an instant change taking place
in her bearing."Your cousin may be intense," I went on, as if nothing had occurred;
"but I do not know to what you refer when you say she has been running
her head into a noose.""I mean this," she firmly returned: "that, wittingly or unwittingly, she
has so parried and met the questions which have been put to her in this
room that any one listening to her would give her the credit of
knowing more than she ought to of this horrible affair.She acts"--Mary
whispered, but not so low but that every word could be distinctly
heard in all quarters of the room--"as if she were anxious to conceal
something.But she is not; I am sure she is not.Eleanore and I are not
good friends; but all the world can never make me believe she has any
more knowledge of this murder than I have.Won't somebody tell her,
then--won't you--that her manner is a mistake; that it is calculated to
arouse suspicion; that it has already done so?And oh, don't forget to
add"--her voice sinking to a decided whisper now--"what you have just
repeated to me: that circumstantial evidence is not always absolute
proof.""You request me to tell her this," said I."Wouldn't it be better for
you to speak to her yourself?""Eleanore and I hold little or no confidential communication," she
replied.I could easily believe this, and yet I was puzzled.Indeed, there was
something incomprehensible in her whole manner.Not knowing what else
to say, I remarked, "That is unfortunate.She ought to be told that the
straightforward course is the best by all means.""Oh, why has this awful trouble come to me,
who have always been so happy before!""Perhaps for the very reason that you have always been so happy.""It was not enough for dear uncle to die in this horrible manner; but
she, my own cousin, had to----"

I touched her arm, and the action seemed to recall her to herself."Miss Leavenworth," I whispered, "you should hope for the best.Besides,
I honestly believe you to be disturbing yourself unnecessarily.If
nothing fresh transpires, a mere prevarication or so of your cousin's
will not suffice to injure her."I said this to see if she had any reason to doubt the future.How could there be anything fresh, when she is
perfectly innocent?"Wheeling round in her seat
till her lovely, perfumed wrapper brushed my knee, she asked: "Why
didn't they ask me more questions?I could have told them Eleanore never
left her room last night.""Yes; my room is nearer the head of the stairs than hers; if she had
passed my door, I should have heard her, don't you see?""That does not follow," I answered sadly."I would say whatever was necessary," she whispered.Yes, this woman would lie now to save her cousin; had
lied during the inquest.But then I felt grateful, and now I was simply
horrified."Miss Leavenworth," said I, "nothing can justify one in violating the
dictates of his own conscience, not even the safety of one we do not
altogether love."she returned; and her lip took a tremulous curve, the lovely bosom
heaved, and she softly looked away.If Eleanore's beauty had made less of an impression on my fancy, or her
frightful situation awakened less anxiety in my breast, I should have
been a lost man from that moment."I did not mean to do anything very wrong," Miss Leavenworth continued."No, no," said I; and there is not a man living who would not have said
the same in my place.What more might have passed between us on this subject I cannot say, for
just then the door opened and a man entered whom I recognized as the one
who had followed Eleanore Leavenworth out, a short time before.Gryce," said he, pausing just inside the door; "a word if you
please."The detective nodded, but did not hasten towards him; instead of that,
he walked deliberately away to the other end of the room, where he
lifted the lid of an inkstand he saw there, muttered some unintelligible
words into it, and speedily shut it again.Immediately the uncanny fancy
seized me that if I should leap to that inkstand, open it and peer in,
I should surprise and capture the bit of confidence he had intrusted
to it.But I restrained my foolish impulse, and contented myself with
noting the subdued look of respect with which the gaunt subordinate
watched the approach of his superior.inquired the latter as he reached him: "what now?"The man shrugged his shoulders, and drew his principal through the open
door.Once in the hall their voices sank to a whisper, and as their
backs only were visible, I turned to look at my companion."I do not know; I fear so.Miss Leavenworth," I proceeded, "can it be
possible that your cousin has anything in her possession she desires to
conceal?""Then you think she is trying to conceal something?"But there was considerable talk about a paper----"

"They will never find any paper or anything else suspicious in
Eleanore's possession," Mary interrupted."In the first place, there
was no paper of importance enough"--I saw Mr.Gryce's form suddenly
stiffen--"for any one to attempt its abstraction and concealment."May not your cousin be acquainted with
something----"

"There was nothing to be acquainted with, Mr.We lived the most
methodical and domestic of lives.I cannot understand, for my part, why
so much should be made out of this.My uncle undoubtedly came to his
death by the hand of some intended burglar.That nothing was stolen from
the house is no proof that a burglar never entered it.As for the doors
and windows being locked, will you take the word of an Irish servant
as infallible upon such an important point?I believe the
assassin to be one of a gang who make their living by breaking into
houses, and if you cannot honestly agree with me, do try and consider
such an explanation as possible; if not for the sake of the family
credit, why then"--and she turned her face with all its fair beauty upon
mine, eyes, cheeks, mouth all so exquisite and winsome--"why then, for
mine."Raymond, will you be kind
enough to step this way?"Glad to escape from my present position, I hastily obeyed."We propose to take you into our confidence," was the easy response.I bowed to the man I saw before me, and stood uneasily waiting.Anxious
as I was to know what we really had to fear, I still intuitively shrank
from any communication with one whom I looked upon as a spy."A matter of some importance," resumed the detective."It is not
necessary for me to remind you that it is in confidence, is it?"Instantly the whole appearance of the man Fobbs changed.Assuming an
expression of lofty importance, he laid his large hand outspread upon
his heart and commenced.Gryce to watch the movements of Miss Eleanore
Leavenworth, I left this room upon her departure from it, and followed
her and the two servants who conducted her up-stairs to her own
apartment.Then it _was_ the fire she was after!"he cried, clapping
himself on the knee."Excuse me; I am ahead of my story.She did not appear to notice me
much, though I was right behind her.It was not until she had reached
the door of this room--which was not her room!"he interpolated
dramatically, "and turned to dismiss her servants, that she seemed
conscious of having been followed.Eying me then with an air of
great dignity, quickly eclipsed, however, by an expression of patient
endurance, she walked in, leaving the door open behind her in a
courteous way I cannot sufficiently commend."Honest as the man appeared, this was
evidently anything but a sore subject with him.Observing me frown, he
softened his manner."Not seeing any other way of keeping her under my eye, except by
entering the room, I followed her in, and took a seat in a remote
corner.She flashed one look at me as I did so, and commenced pacing the
floor in a restless kind of way I'm not altogether unused to.At last
she stopped abruptly, right in the middle of the room.she gasped; 'I'm faint again--quick!Now in order to get that glass of water it was necessary for me
to pass behind a dressing mirror that reached almost to the ceiling;
and I naturally hesitated.But she turned and looked at me, and--Well,
gentlemen, I think either of you would have hastened to do what she
asked; or at least"--with a doubtful look at Mr.Gryce--"have given
your two ears for the privilege, even if you didn't succumb to the
temptation.""I stepped out of sight, then, for a moment;
but it seemed long enough for her purpose; for when I emerged, glass in
hand, she was kneeling at the grate full five feet from the spot where
she had been standing, and was fumbling with the waist of her dress in
a way to convince me she had something concealed there which she was
anxious to dispose of.I eyed her pretty closely as I handed her the
glass of water, but she was gazing into the grate, and didn't appear to
notice.Drinking barely a drop, she gave it back, and in another moment
was holding out her hands over the fire.At any rate, she shivered most
naturally.But there were a few dying embers in the grate, and when
I saw her thrust her hand again into the folds of her dress I became
distrustful of her intentions and, drawing a step nearer, looked over
her shoulder, when I distinctly saw her drop something into the
grate that clinked as it fell.Suspecting what it was, I was about to
interfere, when she sprang to her feet, seized the scuttle of coal that
was upon the hearth, and with one move emptied the whole upon the dying
embers.'I want a fire,' she cried, 'a fire!''That is hardly the way
to make one,' I returned, carefully taking the coal out with my hands,
piece by piece, and putting it back into the scuttle, till--"

"Till what?"opening his large hand, and showing me _a
broken-handled key._



X. MR.GRYCE RECEIVES NEW IMPETUS


    "There's nothing ill
     Can dwell in such a temple."THIS astounding discovery made a most unhappy impression upon me.Eleanore the beautiful, the lovesome, was--I did not, could
not finish the sentence, even in the silence of my own mind.Gryce, glancing curiously towards the
key.A woman does not thrill, blush, equivocate, and
faint for nothing; especially such a woman as Miss Leavenworth.""A woman who could do such a deed would be the last to thrill,
equivocate, and faint," I retorted."Give me the key; let me see it."He complacently put it in my hand."If she declares herself innocent, I will believe her.""You have strong faith in the women," he
laughed.I had no reply for this, and a short silence ensued, first broken by Mr."There is but one thing left to do," said he."Fobbs, you will
have to request Miss Leavenworth to come down.Do not alarm her; only
see that she comes.To the reception room," he added, as the man drew
off.No sooner were we left alone than I made a move to return to Mary, but
he stopped me."Come and see it out," he whispered."She will be down in a moment; see
it out; you had best."Glancing back, I hesitated; but the prospect of beholding Eleanore again
drew me, in spite of myself.Telling him to wait, I returned to Mary's
side to make my excuses."What is the matter--what has occurred?"It is all dreadful; and no one tells me anything.""I pray God there may be nothing to tell.Judging from your present
faith in your cousin, there will not be.Take comfort, then, and be
assured I will inform you if anything occurs which you ought to know."Giving her a look of encouragement, I left her crushed against the
crimson pillows of the sofa on which she sat, and rejoined Mr.We
had scarcely entered the reception room when Eleanore Leavenworth came
in.More languid than she was an hour before, but haughty still, she slowly
advanced, and, meeting my eye, gently bent her head."I have been summoned here," said she, directing herself exclusively to
Mr.Gryce, "by an individual whom I take to be in your employ.If so,
may I request you to make your wishes known at once, as I am quite
exhausted, and am in great need of rest."Gryce, rubbing his hands together and
staring in quite a fatherly manner at the door-knob, "I am very sorry to
trouble you, but the fact is I wish to ask you----"

But here she stopped him."Anything in regard to the key which that man
has doubtless told you he saw me drop into the ashes?""Then I must refuse to answer any questions concerning it.I have
nothing to say on the subject, unless it is this:"--giving him a look
full of suffering, but full of a certain sort of courage, too--"that he
was right if he told you I had the key in hiding about my person, and
that I attempted to conceal it in the ashes of the grate.""Still, Miss----"

But she had already withdrawn to the door."I pray you to excuse me,"
said she."No argument you could advance would make any difference in my
determination; therefore it would be but a waste of energy on your
part to attempt any."And, with a flitting glance in my direction, not
without its appeal, she quietly left the room.Gryce stood gazing after her with a look of great
interest, then, bowing with almost exaggerated homage, he hastily
followed her out.I had scarcely recovered from the surprise occasioned by this unexpected
movement when a quick step was heard in the hall, and Mary, flushed and
anxious, appeared at my side.I answered, "she has not said anything.That is the trouble,
Miss Leavenworth.Your cousin preserves a reticence upon certain points
very painful to witness.She ought to understand that if she persists in
doing this, that----"

"That what?"There was no mistaking the deep anxiety prompting this
question."That she cannot avoid the trouble that will ensue."For a moment she stood gazing at me, with great horror-stricken,
incredulous eyes; then sinking back into a chair, flung her hands over
her face with the cry:

"Oh, why were we ever born!Why did we not
perish with those who gave us birth!"In the face of anguish like this, I could not keep still."Dear Miss Leavenworth," I essayed, "there is no cause for such despair
as this.The future looks dark, but not impenetrable.Your cousin will
listen to reason, and in explaining----"

But she, deaf to my words, had again risen to her feet, and stood before
me in an attitude almost appalling."Some women in my position would go mad!She
was conscious of having given the cue which had led to this suspicion of
her cousin, and that in this way the trouble which hung over their heads
was of her own making.I endeavored to soothe her, but my efforts
were all unavailing.Absorbed in her own anguish, she paid but little
attention to me.Satisfied at last that I could do nothing more for her,
I turned to go."I am sorry to leave," said I, "without having afforded you any comfort.Believe me; I am very anxious to assist you.Is there no one I can send
to your side; no woman friend or relative?It is sad to leave you alone
in this house at such a time.""And do you expect me to remain here?and the long shudders shook her very frame."It is not at all necessary for you to do so, Miss Leavenworth," broke
in a bland voice over our shoulders.Gryce was not only at our back, but had
evidently been there for some moments.Seated near the door, one hand
in his pocket, the other caressing the arm of his chair, he met our
gaze with a sidelong smile that seemed at once to beg pardon for
the intrusion, and to assure us it was made with no unworthy motive."Everything will be properly looked after, Miss; you can leave with
perfect safety."I expected to see her resent this interference; but instead of that, she
manifested a certain satisfaction in beholding him there.Drawing me to one side, she whispered, "You think this Mr.Gryce very
clever, do you not?""Well," I cautiously replied, "he ought to be to hold the position he
does.The authorities evidently repose great confidence in him."Stepping from my side as suddenly as she had approached it, she crossed
the room and stood before Mr."Sir," said she, gazing at him with a glance of entreaty: "I hear you
have great talents; that you can ferret out the real criminal from
a score of doubtful characters, and that nothing can escape the
penetration of your eye.If this is so, have pity on two orphan
girls, suddenly bereft of their guardian and protector, and use your
acknowledged skill in finding out who has committed this crime.It
would be folly in me to endeavor to hide from you that my cousin in her
testimony has given cause for suspicion; but I here declare her to be as
innocent of wrong as I am; and I am only endeavoring to turn the eye
of justice from the guiltless to the guilty when I entreat you to look
elsewhere for the culprit who committed this deed."Pausing, she held
her two hands out before him."It must have been some common burglar or
desperado; can you not bring him, then, to justice?"Her attitude was so touching, her whole appearance so earnest and
appealing, that I saw Mr.Gryce's countenance brim with suppressed
emotion, though his eye never left the coffee-urn upon which it had
fixed itself at her first approach."Hannah--the girl who is
gone--must know all about it.Search for her, ransack the city, do
anything; my property is at your disposal.I will offer a large reward
for the detection of the burglar who did this deed!""Miss Leavenworth," he began, and stopped; the
man was actually agitated."Miss Leavenworth, I did not need your very
touching appeal to incite me to my utmost duty in this case.Personal
and professional pride were in themselves sufficient.But, since you
have honored me with this expression of your wishes, I will not conceal
from you that I shall feel a certain increased interest in the affair
from this hour.What mortal man can do, I will do, and if in one month
from this day I do not come to you for my reward, Ebenezer Gryce is not
the man I have always taken him to be.""We will mention no names," said he, gently waving his hand to and fro.A few minutes later, I left the house with Miss Leavenworth, she having
expressed a wish to have me accompany her to the home of her friend,
Mrs.Gilbert, with whom she had decided to take refuge.As we rolled
down the street in the carriage Mr.Gryce had been kind enough to
provide for us, I noticed my companion cast a look of regret behind her,
as if she could not help feeling some compunctions at this desertion of
her cousin.But this expression was soon changed for the alert look of one who
dreads to see a certain face start up from some unknown quarter.Glancing up and down the street, peering furtively into doorways as
we passed, starting and trembling if a sudden figure appeared on the
curbstone, she did not seem to breathe with perfect ease till we had
left the avenue behind us and entered upon Thirty-seventh Street.Then,
all at once her natural color returned and, leaning gently toward me,
she asked if I had a pencil and piece of paper I could give her.Handing them to her, I watched her with some
little curiosity while she wrote two or three lines, wondering she could
choose such a time and place for the purpose."A little note I wish to send," she explained, glancing at the almost
illegible scrawl with an expression of doubt."Couldn't you stop the
carriage a moment while I direct it?"I did so, and in another instant the leaf which I had torn from my
note-book was folded, directed, and sealed with a stamp which she had
taken from her own pocket-book."That is a crazy-looking epistle," she muttered, as she laid it,
direction downwards, in her lap."Why not wait, then, till you arrive at your destination, where you can
seal it properly, and direct it at your leisure?"Look, there is a box on
the corner; please ask the driver to stop once more.""Shall I not post it for you?"But she shook her head, and, without waiting for my assistance, opened
the door on her own side of the carriage and leaped to the ground.Even
then she paused to glance up and down the street, before venturing to
drop her hastily written letter into the box.But when it had left her
hand, she looked brighter and more hopeful than I had yet seen her.And
when, a few moments later, she turned to bid me good-by in front of her
friend's house, it was with almost a cheerful air she put out her hand
and entreated me to call on her the next day, and inform her how the
inquest progressed.I shall not attempt to disguise from you the fact that I spent all
that long evening in going over the testimony given at the inquest,
endeavoring to reconcile what I had heard with any other theory than
that of Eleanore's guilt.Taking a piece of paper, I jotted down the
leading causes of suspicion as follows:

1.Her late disagreement with her uncle, and evident estrangement from
him, as testified to by Mr.The mysterious disappearance of one of the servants of the house.The forcible accusation made by her cousin,--overheard, however, only
by Mr.Her equivocation in regard to the handkerchief found stained with
pistol smut on the scene of the tragedy.Her refusal to speak in regard to the paper which she was supposed to
have taken from Mr.Leavenworth's table immediately upon the removal of
the body.The finding of the library key in her possession."A dark record," I involuntarily decided, as I looked it over; but
even in doing so began jotting down on the other side of the sheet the
following explanatory notes:

1.Disagreements and even estrangements between relatives are common.Cases where such disagreements and estrangements have led to crime,
rare.The disappearance of Hannah points no more certainly in one direction
than another.If Mary's private accusation of her cousin was forcible and
convincing, her public declaration that she neither knew nor suspected
who might be the author of this crime, was equally so.To be sure, the
former possessed the advantage of being uttered spontaneously; but it
was likewise true that it was spoken under momentary excitement, without
foresight of the consequences, and possibly without due consideration of
the facts.An innocent man or woman, under the influence of terror, will
often equivocate in regard to matters that seem to criminate them.With that key in her
possession, and unexplained, Eleanore Leavenworth stood in an attitude
of suspicion which even I felt forced to recognize.Brought to this
point, I thrust the paper into my pocket, and took up the evening
_Express_.Instantly my eye fell upon these words:


    SHOCKING MURDER

    MR.LEAVENWORTH, THE WELL-KNOWN MILLIONAIRE, FOUND DEAD IN HIS ROOM

    NO CLUE TO THE PERPETRATOR OF THE DEED

    THE AWFUL CRIME COMMITTED WITH A PISTOL--EXTRAORDINARY FEATURES OF
    THE AFFAIR

Ah!here at least was one comfort; her name was not yet mentioned
as that of a suspected party.Gryce's expressive look as he handed me that key, and
shuddered."She must be innocent; she cannot be otherwise," I reiterated to myself,
and then pausing, asked what warranty I had of this?Only her beautiful
face; only, only her beautiful face.Abashed, I dropped the newspaper,
and went down-stairs just as a telegraph boy arrived with a message from
Mr.It was signed by the proprietor of the hotel at which Mr.Veeley was then stopping and ran thus:


    "WASHINGTON, D. C.Everett Raymond--

    "Mr.Veeley is lying at my house ill.Have not shown him telegram,
    fearing results.Why this sudden sensation of relief on my part?Could
it be that I had unconsciously been guilty of cherishing a latent dread
of my senior's return?Why, who else could know so well the secret
springs which governed this family?Who else could so effectually put me
upon the right track?Was it possible that I, Everett Raymond, hesitated
to know the truth in any case?No, that should never be said; and,
sitting down again, I drew out the memoranda I had made and, looking
them carefully over, wrote against No.6 the word suspicious in good
round characters.no one could say, after that, I had allowed
myself to be blinded by a bewitching face from seeing what, in a woman
with no claims to comeliness, would be considered at once an almost
indubitable evidence of guilt.And yet, after it was all done, I found myself repeating aloud as I
gazed at it: "If she declares herself innocent, I will believe her."So
completely are we the creatures of our own predilections.THE SUMMONS


    "The pink of courtesy."THE morning papers contained a more detailed account of the murder than
those of the evening before; but, to my great relief, in none of them
was Eleanore's name mentioned in the connection I most dreaded.The final paragraph in the _Times_ ran thus: "The detectives are upon
the track of the missing girl, Hannah."And in the _Herald_ I read the
following notice:

"_A Liberal Reward_ will be given by the relatives of Horatio
Leavenworth, Esq., deceased, for any news of the whereabouts of one
Hannah Chester, disappeared from the house -------- Fifth Avenue since
the evening of March 4.Said girl was of Irish extraction; in age about
twenty-five, and may be known by the following characteristics.Form
tall and slender; hair dark brown with a tinge of red; complexion fresh;
features delicate and well made; hands small, but with the fingers much
pricked by the use of the needle; feet large, and of a coarser type than
the hands.She had on when last seen a checked gingham dress, brown
and white, and was supposed to have wrapped herself in a red and green
blanket shawl, very old.Beside the above distinctive marks, she had
upon her right hand wrist the scar of a large burn; also a pit or two of
smallpox upon the left temple."This paragraph turned my thoughts in a new direction.Oddly enough, I
had expended very little thought upon this girl; and yet how apparent
it was that she was the one person upon whose testimony, if given,
the whole case in reality hinged, I could not agree with those who
considered her as personally implicated in the murder.An accomplice,
conscious of what was before her, would have hid in her pockets whatever
money she possessed.But the roll of bills found in Hannah's trunk
proved her _to_ have left too hurriedly for this precaution.On the
other hand, if this girl had come unexpectedly upon the assassin at his
work, how could she have been hustled from the house without creating
a disturbance loud enough to have been heard by the ladies, one of
whom had her door open?An innocent girl's first impulse upon such an
occasion would have been to scream; and yet no scream was heard; she
simply disappeared.That the person seen
by her was one both known and trusted?I would not consider such a
possibility; so laying down the paper, I endeavored to put away all
further consideration of the affair till I had acquired more facts
upon which to base the theory.But who can control his thoughts when
over-excited upon any one theme?All the morning I found myself turning
the case over in my mind, arriving ever at one of two conclusions.Hannah Chester must be found, or Eleanore Leavenworth must explain when
and by what means the key of the library door came into her possession.At two o'clock I started from my office to attend the inquest; but,
being delayed on the way, missed arriving at the house until after the
delivery of the verdict.This was a disappointment to me, especially as
by these means I lost the opportunity of seeing Eleanore Leavenworth,
she having retired to her room immediately upon the dismissal of the
jury.Harwell was visible, and from him I heard what the verdict
had been."Death by means of a pistol shot from the hand of some person unknown."The result of the inquest was a great relief to me.Nor could I help seeing that, for all his studied self-command, the
pale-faced secretary shared in my satisfaction.What was less of a relief to me was the fact, soon communicated, that
Mr.Gryce and his subordinates had left the premises immediately upon
the delivery of the verdict.Gryce was not the man to forsake an
affair like this while anything of importance connected with it remained
unexplained.Could it be he meditated any decisive action?Somewhat
alarmed, I was about to hurry from the house for the purpose of learning
what his intentions were, when a sudden movement in the front lower
window of the house on the opposite side of the way arrested my
attention, and, looking closer, I detected the face of Mr.Fobbs peering
out from behind the curtain.The sight assured me I was not wrong in my
estimate of Mr.Gryce; and, struck with pity for the desolate girl left
to meet the exigencies of a fate to which this watch upon her movements
was but the evident precursor, I stepped back and sent her a note, in
which, as Mr.Veeley's representative, I proffered my services in case
of any sudden emergency, saying I was always to be found in my rooms
between the hours of six and eight.This done, I proceeded to the house
in Thirty-seventh Street where I had left Miss Mary Leavenworth the day
before.Ushered into the long and narrow drawing-room which of late years
has been so fashionable in our uptown houses, I found myself almost
immediately in the presence of Miss Leavenworth."Oh," she cried, with an eloquent gesture of welcome, "I had begun to
think I was forsaken!"and advancing impulsively, she held out her hand."A verdict of murder, Miss Leavenworth.""Perpetrated by party or parties unknown."A look of relief broke softly across her features."I found no one in the house who did not belong there.""There is no one here," said she.At length, in an awkward way enough, I turned
towards her and said:

"I do not wish either to offend or alarm you, but I must say that I
consider it your duty to return to your own home to-night.""Is there any particular reason for my doing so?Have you not perceived the impossibility of my remaining in the same
house with Eleanore?""Miss Leavenworth, I cannot recognize any so-called impossibility of
this nature.Eleanore is your cousin; has been brought up to regard you
as a sister; it is not worthy of you to desert her at the time of her
necessity.You will see this as I do, if you will allow yourself a
moment's dispassionate thought.""Dispassionate thought is hardly possible under the circumstances," she
returned, with a smile of bitter irony.But before I could reply to this, she softened, and asked if I was very
anxious to have her return; and when I replied, "More than I can say,"
she trembled and looked for a moment as if she were half inclined to
yield; but suddenly broke into tears, crying it was impossible, and that
I was cruel to ask it."Pardon me," said I, "I have indeed
transgressed the bounds allotted to me.I will not do so again; you have
doubtless many friends; let some of them advise you.""The friends you speak of are flatterers.You alone have the courage to command me to do what is right.""Excuse me, I do not command; I only entreat."She made no reply, but began pacing the room, her eyes fixed, her hands
working convulsively."You little know what you ask," said she."I feel
as though the very atmosphere of that house would destroy me; but--why
cannot Eleanore come here?"Gilbert will be quite willing, and I could keep my room, and we need not
meet.""You forget that there is another call at home, besides the one I have
already mentioned.To-morrow afternoon your uncle is to be buried.""You are the head of the household," I now ventured, "and the proper
one to attend to the final offices towards one who has done so much for
you."There was something strange in the look which she gave me."It is true,"
she assented.Then, with a grand turn of her body, and a quick air of
determination: "I am desirous of being worthy of your good opinion.I
will go back to my cousin, Mr.I felt my spirits rise a little; I took her by the hand."May that
cousin have no need of the comfort which I am now sure you will be ready
to give her.""I mean to do my duty," was her cold
response.As I descended the stoop, I met a certain thin and fashionably dressed
young man, who gave me a very sharp look as he passed.As he wore his
clothes a little too conspicuously for the perfect gentleman, and as I
had some remembrance of having seen him at the inquest, I set him down
for a man in Mr.Gryce's employ, and hasted on towards the avenue; when
what was my surprise to find on the corner another person, who,
while pretending to be on the look out for a car, cast upon me, as I
approached, a furtive glance of intense inquiry.As this latter was,
without question, a gentleman, I felt some annoyance, and, walking
quietly up to him, asked if he found my countenance familiar, that he
scrutinized it so closely."I find it a very agreeable one," was his unexpected reply, as he turned
from me and walked down the avenue.Nettled, and in no small degree mortified, at the disadvantage in which
his courtesy had placed me, I stood watching him as he disappeared,
asking myself who and what he was.For he was not only a gentleman, but
a marked one; possessing features of unusual symmetry as well as a form
of peculiar elegance.Not so very young--he might well be forty--there
were yet evident on his face the impress of youth's strongest emotions,
not a curve of his chin nor a glance of his eye betraying in any way the
slightest leaning towards _ennui,_ though face and figure were of that
type which seems most to invite and cherish it."He can have no connection with the police force," thought I; "nor is it
by any means certain that he knows me, or is interested in my affairs;
but I shall not soon forget him, for all that."The summons from Eleanore Leavenworth came about eight o'clock in the
evening.It was brought by Thomas, and read as follows:

"Come, Oh, come!I--" there breaking off in a tremble, as if the pen had
fallen from a nerveless hand.It did not take me long to find my way to her home."Constant you are--
    ... And for secrecy
     No lady closer.""No, 't is slander,
    Whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue
    Outvenoms all the worms of Nile.""You will find Miss Eleanore in the
drawing-room, sir," she said, ushering me in.Fearing I knew not what, I hurried to the room thus indicated, feeling
as never before the sumptuousness of the magnificent hall with its
antique flooring, carved woods, and bronze ornamentations:--the mockery
of _things_ for the first time forcing itself upon me.Laying my hand
on the drawing-room door, I listened.Slowly pulling it
open, I lifted the heavy satin curtains hanging before me to the floor,
and looked within.Sitting in the light of a solitary gas jet, whose faint glimmering just
served to make visible the glancing satin and stainless marble of
the gorgeous apartment, I beheld Eleanore Leavenworth.Pale as the
sculptured image of the Psyche that towered above her from the mellow
dusk of the bow-window near which she sat, beautiful as it, and almost
as immobile, she crouched with rigid hands frozen in forgotten entreaty
before her, apparently insensible to sound, movement, or touch; a silent
figure of despair in presence of an implacable fate.Impressed by the scene, I stood with my hand upon the curtain,
hesitating if to advance or retreat, when suddenly a sharp tremble shook
her impassive frame, the rigid hands unlocked, the stony eyes softened,
and, springing to her feet, she uttered a cry of satisfaction, and
advanced towards me.I exclaimed, starting at the sound of my own voice.She paused, and pressed her hands to her face, as if the world and all
she had forgotten had rushed back upon her at this simple utterance of
her name.They--they are beginning to
say that I--" she paused, and clutched her throat.she gasped,
pointing to a newspaper lying on the floor at her feet.I stooped and lifted what showed itself at first glance to be the
_Evening Telegram._ It needed but a single look to inform me to what she
referred.There, in startling characters, I beheld:


    THE LEAVENWORTH MURDER

    LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MYSTERIOUS CASE

    A MEMBER OF THE MURDERED MAN'S OWN FAMILY
    STRONGLY SUSPECTED OF THE CRIME

    THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN NEW YORK UNDER A CLOUD

    PAST HISTORY OF MISS ELEANORE LEAVENWORTH

I was prepared for it; had schooled myself for this very thing, you
might say; and yet I could not help recoiling.Dropping the paper from
my hand, I stood before her, longing and yet dreading to look into her
face.she panted; "what, what does it mean?and her eyes, fixed and glassy, stared into mine as if she found
it impossible to grasp the sense of this outrage."To accuse _me_" she murmured; "me, me!"striking her breast with her
clenched hand, "who loved the very ground he trod upon; who would have
cast my own body between him and the deadly bullet if I had only known
his danger.she cried, "it is not a slander they utter, but a
dagger which they thrust into my heart!"Overcome by her misery, but determined not to show my compassion until
more thoroughly convinced of her complete innocence, I replied, after a
pause:

"This seems to strike you with great surprise, Miss Leavenworth; were
you not then able to foresee what must follow your determined reticence
upon certain points?Did you know so little of human nature as to
imagine that, situated as you are, you could keep silence in regard to
any matter connected with this crime, without arousing the antagonism of
the crowd, to say nothing of the suspicions of the police?""But--but----"

I hurriedly waved my hand."When you defied the coroner to find
any suspicious paper in your possession; when"--I forced myself to
speak--"you refused to tell Mr.Gryce how you came in possession of the
key--"

She drew hastily back, a heavy pall seeming to fall over her with my
words."Don't," she whispered, looking in terror about her.Sometimes I
think the walls have ears, and that the very shadows listen.""Ah," I returned; "then you hope to keep from the world what is known to
the detectives?""Miss Leavenworth," I went on, "I am afraid you do not comprehend
your position.Try to look at the case for a moment in the light of
an unprejudiced person; try to see for yourself the necessity of
explaining----"

"But I cannot explain," she murmured huskily.I do not know whether it was the tone of my voice or the word itself,
but that simple expression seemed to affect her like a blow.she cried, shrinking back: "you do not, cannot doubt me, too?I
thought that you--" and stopped."I did not dream that I--" and stopped
again.You have mistrusted
me from the first; the appearances against me have been too strong"; and
she sank inert, lost in the depths of her shame and humiliation."Ah,
but now I am forsaken!"Starting forward, I exclaimed: "Miss
Leavenworth, I am but a man; I cannot see you so distressed.Say
that you are innocent, and I will believe you, without regard to
appearances."Springing erect, she towered upon me."Can any one look in my face
and accuse me of guilt?"Then, as I sadly shook my head, she hurriedly
gasped: "You want further proof!"and, quivering with an extraordinary
emotion, she sprang to the door."Come, then," she cried, "come!"her eyes flashing full of resolve upon
me.Aroused, appalled, moved in spite of myself, I crossed the room to where
she stood; but she was already in the hall.Hastening after her, filled
with a fear I dared not express, I stood at the foot of the stairs; she
was half-way to the top.Following her into the hall above, I saw her
form standing erect and noble at the door of her uncle's bedroom.she again cried, but this time in a calm and reverential tone;
and flinging the door open before her, she passed in.Subduing the wonder which I felt, I slowly followed her.There was no
light in the room of death, but the flame of the gas-burner, at the far
end of the hall, shone weirdly in, and by its glimmering I beheld her
kneeling at the shrouded bed, her head bowed above that of the murdered
man, her hand upon his breast."You have said that if I declared my innocence you would believe me,"
she exclaimed, lifting her head as I entered."See here," and laying
her cheek against the pallid brow of her dead benefactor, she kissed the
clay-cold lips softly, wildly, agonizedly, then, leaping to her feet,
cried, in a subdued but thrilling tone: "Could I do that if I were
guilty?Would not the breath freeze on my lips, the blood congeal in
my veins, and my heart faint at this contact?Son of a father loved and
reverenced, can you believe me to be a woman stained with crime when I
can do this?"and kneeling again she cast her arms over and about that
inanimate form, looking in my face at the same time with an expression
no mortal touch could paint, nor tongue describe."In olden times," she went on, "they used to say that a dead body would
bleed if its murderer came in contact with it.What then would happen
here if I, his daughter, his cherished child, loaded with benefits,
enriched with his jewels, warm with his kisses, should be the thing they
accuse me of?Would not the body of the outraged dead burst its very
shroud and repel me?"I could not answer; in the presence of some scenes the tongue forgets
its functions.she went on, "if there is a God in heaven who loves justice and
hates a crime, let Him hear me now.If I, by thought or action, with
or without intention, have been the means of bringing this dear head to
this pass; if so much as the shadow of guilt, let alone the substance,
lies upon my heart and across these feeble woman's hands, may His wrath
speak in righteous retribution to the world, and here, upon the breast
of the dead, let this guilty forehead fall, never to rise again!"An awed silence followed this invocation; then a long, long sigh of
utter relief rose tremulously from my breast, and all the feelings
hitherto suppressed in my heart burst their bonds, and leaning towards
her I took her hand in mine."You do not, cannot believe me tainted by crime now?"she whispered,
the smile which does not stir the lips, but rather emanates from the
countenance, like the flowering of an inner peace, breaking softly out
on cheek and brow.The word broke uncontrollably from my lips; "crime!""No," she said calmly, "the man does not live who could accuse me of
crime, _here_."For reply, I took her hand, which lay in mine, and placed it on the
breast of the dead.Softly, slowly, gratefully, she bowed her head."There is one who will
believe in me, however dark appearances may be."THE PROBLEM


    "But who would force the soul, tilts with a straw
     Against a champion cased in adamant."WHEN we re-entered the parlor below, the first sight that met our eyes
was Mary, standing wrapped in her long cloak in the centre of the room.She had arrived during our absence, and now awaited us with lifted head
and countenance fixed in its proudest expression.Looking in her face, I
realized what the embarrassment of this meeting must be to these
women, and would have retreated, but something in the attitude of Mary
Leavenworth seemed to forbid my doing so.At the same time, determined
that the opportunity should not pass without some sort of reconcilement
between them, I stepped forward, and, bowing to Mary, said:

"Your cousin has just succeeded in convincing me of her entire
innocence, Miss Leavenworth.Gryce, heart and
soul, in finding out the true culprit.""I should have thought one look into Eleanore Leavenworth's face would
have been enough to satisfy you that she is incapable of crime," was
her unexpected answer; and, lifting her head with a proud gesture, Mary
Leavenworth fixed her eyes steadfastly on mine.I felt the blood flash to my brow, but before I could speak, her voice
rose again still more coldly than before."It is hard for a delicate girl, unused to aught but the most flattering
expressions of regard, to be obliged to assure the world of her
innocence in respect to the committal of a great crime.And sweeping her cloak from her shoulders with a quick
gesture, she turned her gaze for the first time upon her cousin.Instantly Eleanore advanced, as if to meet it; and I could not but feel
that, for some reason, this moment possessed an importance for them
which I was scarcely competent to measure.But if I found myself unable
to realize its significance, I at least responded to its intensity.And
indeed it was an occasion to remember.To behold two such women, either
of whom might be considered the model of her time, face to face
and drawn up in evident antagonism, was a sight to move the dullest
sensibilities.But there was something more in this scene than that.It
was the shock of all the most passionate emotions of the human soul;
the meeting of waters of whose depth and force I could only guess by the
effect.Drawing back with the cold
haughtiness which, alas, I had almost forgotten in the display of later
and softer emotions, she exclaimed:

"There is something better than sympathy, and that is justice"; and
turned, as if to go."I will confer with you in the reception room, Mr.But Mary, springing forward, caught her back with one powerful hand."No," she cried, "you shall confer with _me!_ I have something to say to
you, Eleanore Leavenworth."And, taking her stand in the centre of the
room, she waited.I glanced at Eleanore, saw this was no place for me, and hastily
withdrew.For ten long minutes I paced the floor of the reception room,
a prey to a thousand doubts and conjectures.What had given rise to the deadly mistrust continually manifested
between these cousins, fitted by nature for the completest companionship
and the most cordial friendship?It was not a thing of to-day or
yesterday.No sudden flame could awake such concentrated heat of emotion
as that of which I had just been the unwilling witness.One must go
farther back than this murder to find the root of a mistrust so great
that the struggle it caused made itself felt even where I stood, though
nothing but the faintest murmur came to my ears through the closed
doors.Presently the drawing-room curtain was raised, and Mary's voice was
heard in distinct articulation."The same roof can never shelter us both after this.To-morrow, you or I
find another home."And, blushing and panting, she stepped into the
hall and advanced to where I stood.But at the first sight of my face,
a change came over her; all her pride seemed to dissolve, and, flinging
out her hands, as if to ward off scrutiny, she fled from my side, and
rushed weeping up-stairs.I was yet laboring under the oppression caused by this painful
termination of the strange scene when the parlor curtain was again
lifted, and Eleanore entered the room where I was.Pale but calm,
showing no evidences of the struggle she had just been through, unless
by a little extra weariness about the eyes, she sat down by my side,
and, meeting my gaze with one unfathomable in its courage, said after
a pause: "Tell me where I stand; let me know the worst at once; I fear
that I have not indeed comprehended my own position."Rejoiced to hear this acknowledgment from her lips, I hastened to
comply.I began by placing before her the whole case as it appeared
to an unprejudiced person; enlarged upon the causes of suspicion, and
pointed out in what regard some things looked dark against her, which
perhaps to her own mind were easily explainable and of small account;
tried to make her see the importance of her decision, and finally wound
up with an appeal."And so I am; but I want the world to be so, too."The finger of suspicion never forgets the way
it has once pointed," she sadly answered."And you will submit to this, when a word--"

"I am thinking that any word of mine now would make very little
difference," she murmured.Fobbs, in hiding behind the curtains of
the opposite house, recurring painfully to my mind."If the affair looks as bad as you say it does," she pursued, "it is
scarcely probable that Mr.Gryce will care much for any interpretation
of mine in regard to the matter."Gryce would be glad to know where you procured that key, if only to
assist him in turning his inquiries in the right direction."She did not reply, and my spirits sank in renewed depression."It is worth your while to satisfy him," I pursued; "and though it may
compromise some one you desire to shield----"

She rose impetuously."I shall never divulge to any one how I came in
possession of that key."And sitting again, she locked her hands in
fixed resolve before her.I rose in my turn and paced the floor, the fang of an unreasoning
jealousy striking deep into my heart.Raymond, if the worst should come, and all who love me should plead
on bended knees for me to tell, I will never do it.""Then," said I, determined not to disclose my secret thought, but
equally resolved to find out if possible her motive for this silence,
"you desire to defeat the cause of justice.""Miss Leavenworth," I now said, "this determined shielding of another at
the expense of your own good name is no doubt generous of you; but
your friends and the lovers of truth and justice cannot accept such a
sacrifice.""If you will not assist us," I went on calmly, but determinedly, "we
must do without your aid.After the scene I have just witnessed above;
after the triumphant conviction which you have forced upon me, not only
of your innocence, but your horror of the crime and its consequences, I
should feel myself less than a man if I did not sacrifice even your own
good opinion, in urging your cause, and clearing your character from
this foul aspersion."Crossing the room, I stood before her."I propose to relieve you utterly
and forever from suspicion, by finding out and revealing to the world
the true culprit."I expected to see her recoil, so positive had I become by this time
as to who that culprit was.But instead of that, she merely folded her
hands still more tightly and exclaimed:

"I doubt if you will be able to do that, Mr."Doubt if I will be able to put my finger upon the guilty man, or doubt
if I will be able to bring him to justice?""I doubt," she said with strong effort, "if any one ever knows who is
the guilty person in this case.""There is one who knows," I said with a desire to test her."The girl Hannah is acquainted with the mystery of that night's evil
doings, Miss Leavenworth.Find Hannah, and we find one who can point out
to us the assassin of your uncle.""That is mere supposition," she said; but I saw the blow had told."Your cousin has offered a large reward for the girl, and the whole
country is on the lookout.Within a week we shall see her in our midst."A change took place in her expression and bearing."The girl cannot help me," she said.Baffled by her manner, I drew back."Is there anything or anybody that
can?""Miss Leavenworth," I continued with renewed earnestness, "you have no
brother to plead with you, you have no mother to guide you; let me then
entreat, in default of nearer and dearer friends, that you will rely
sufficiently upon me to tell me one thing.""Whether you took the paper imputed to you from the library table?"She did not instantly respond, but sat looking earnestly before her with
an intentness which seemed to argue that she was weighing the question
as well as her reply.Finally, turning toward me, she said:

"In answering you, I speak in confidence.Crushing back the sigh of despair that arose to my lips, I went on."I will not inquire what the paper was,"--she waved her hand
deprecatingly,--"but this much more you will tell me.I could with difficulty forbear showing my disappointment."Miss
Leavenworth," I now said, "it may seem cruel for me to press you at this
time; nothing less than my strong realization of the peril in which you
stand would induce me to run the risk of incurring your displeasure by
asking what under other circumstances would seem puerile and insulting
questions.You have told me one thing which I strongly desired to know;
will you also inform me what it was you heard that night while sitting
in your room, between the time of Mr.Harwell's going up-stairs and the
closing of the library door, of which you made mention at the inquest?"I had pushed my inquiries too far, and I saw it immediately.Raymond," she returned, "influenced by my desire not to appear
utterly ungrateful to you, I have been led to reply in confidence to one
of your urgent appeals; but I can go no further.Stricken to the heart by her look of reproach, I answered with some
sadness that her wishes should be respected."Not but what I intend to
make every effort in my power to discover the true author of this crime.That is a sacred duty which I feel myself called upon to perform; but I
will ask you no more questions, nor distress you with further appeals.What is done shall be done without your assistance, and with no other
hope than that in the event of my success you will acknowledge my
motives to have been pure and my action disinterested.""I am ready to acknowledge that now," she began, but paused and looked
with almost agonized entreaty in my face.Raymond, cannot you leave
things as they are?I don't ask for assistance, nor do I want
it; I would rather----"

But I would not listen."Guilt has no right to profit by the generosity
of the guiltless.The hand that struck this blow shall not be
accountable for the loss of a noble woman's honor and happiness as well."I shall do what I can, Miss Leavenworth."As I walked down the avenue that night, feeling like an adventurous
traveller that in a moment of desperation has set his foot upon a plank
stretching in narrow perspective over a chasm of immeasurable depth,
this problem evolved itself from the shadows before me: How, with no
other clue than the persuasion that Eleanore Leavenworth was engaged in
shielding another at the expense of her own good name, I was to
combat the prejudices of Mr.Gryce, find out the real assassin of Mr.Leavenworth, and free an innocent woman from the suspicion that had, not
without some show of reason, fallen upon her?HENRY CLAVERING



XIV.GRYCE AT HOME


    "Nay, but hear me."THAT the guilty person for whom Eleanore Leavenworth stood ready to
sacrifice herself was one for whom she had formerly cherished affection,
I could no longer doubt; love, or the strong sense of duty growing out
of love, being alone sufficient to account for such determined action.Obnoxious as it was to all my prejudices, one name alone, that of the
commonplace secretary, with his sudden heats and changeful manners, his
odd ways and studied self-possession, would recur to my mind whenever I
asked myself who this person could be.Not that, without the light which had been thrown upon the affair by
Eleanore's strange behavior, I should have selected this man as one in
any way open to suspicion; the peculiarity of his manner at the inquest
not being marked enough to counteract the improbability of one in his
relations to the deceased finding sufficient motive for a crime so
manifestly without favorable results to himself.But if love had entered
as a factor into the affair, what might not be expected?James Harwell,
simple amanuensis to a retired tea-merchant, was one man; James Harwell,
swayed by passion for a woman beautiful as Eleanore Leavenworth, was
another; and in placing him upon the list of those parties open to
suspicion I felt I was only doing what was warranted by a proper
consideration of probabilities.But, between casual suspicion and actual proof, what a gulf!To believe
James Harwell capable of guilt, and to find evidence enough to accuse
him of it, were two very different things.I felt myself instinctively
shrink from the task, before I had fully made up my mind to attempt it;
some relenting thought of his unhappy position, if innocent, forcing
itself upon me, and making my very distrust of him seem personally
ungenerous if not absolutely unjust.If I had liked the man better, I
should not have been so ready to look upon him with doubt.But Eleanore must be saved at all hazards.Once delivered up to the
blight of suspicion, who could tell what the result might be; the arrest
of her person perhaps,--a thing which, once accomplished, would cast a
shadow over her young life that it would take more than time to dispel.The accusation of an impecunious secretary would be less horrible than
this.I determined to make an early call upon Mr.Meanwhile the contrasted pictures of Eleanore standing with her hand
upon the breast of the dead, her face upraised and mirroring a glory,
I could not recall without emotion; and Mary, fleeing a short half-hour
later indignantly from her presence, haunted me and kept me awake long
after midnight.It was like a double vision of light and darkness that,
while contrasting, neither assimilated nor harmonized.Do what I would, the two pictures followed me, filling my soul
with alternate hope and distrust, till I knew not whether to place my
hand with Eleanore on the breast of the dead, and swear implicit faith
in her truth and purity, or to turn my face like Mary, and fly from what
I could neither comprehend nor reconcile.Expectant of difficulty, I started next morning upon my search for Mr.Gryce, with strong determination not to allow myself to become flurried
by disappointment nor discouraged by premature failure.My business was
to save Eleanore Leavenworth; and to do that, it was necessary for me to
preserve, not only my equanimity, but my self-possession.The worst
fear I anticipated was that matters would reach a crisis before I could
acquire the right, or obtain the opportunity, to interfere.Leavenworth's funeral being announced for that day gave
me some comfort in that direction; my knowledge of Mr.Gryce being
sufficient, as I thought, to warrant me in believing he would wait till
after that ceremony before proceeding to extreme measures.I do not know that I had any very definite ideas of what a detective's
home should be; but when I stood before the neat three-story brick house
to which I had been directed, I could not but acknowledge there was
something in the aspect of its half-open shutters, over closely drawn
curtains of spotless purity, highly suggestive of the character of its
inmate.A pale-looking youth, with vivid locks of red hair hanging straight down
over either ear, answered my rather nervous ring.Gryce was in, he gave a kind of snort which might have meant
no, but which I took to mean yes."My name is Raymond, and I wish to see him."He gave me one glance that took in every detail of my person and
apparel, and pointed to a door at the head of the stairs.Not waiting
for further directions, I hastened up, knocked at the door he had
designated, and went in.Gryce, stooping above a
desk that might have come over in the _Mayflower,_ confronted me.And rising, he opened with a
squeak and shut with a bang the door of an enormous stove that occupied
the centre of the room."Yes," I returned, eyeing him closely to see if he was in a
communicative mood."But I have had but little time to consider the
state of the weather.My anxiety in regard to this murder----"

"To be sure," he interrupted, fixing his eyes upon the poker, though
not with any hostile intention, I am sure.But perhaps it is an open book to you."I have, though I doubt if it is of the nature you expect.Gryce,
since I saw you last, my convictions upon a certain point have been
strengthened into an absolute belief.The object of your suspicions is
an innocent woman."If I had expected him to betray any surprise at this, I was destined to
be disappointed."That is a very pleasing belief," he observed."I honor
you for entertaining it, Mr."So thoroughly is it mine," I went on,
in the determination to arouse him in some way, "that I have come here
to-day to ask you in the name of justice and common humanity to suspend
action in that direction till we can convince ourselves there is no
truer scent to go upon."But there was no more show of curiosity than before.he cried;
"that is a singular request to come from a man like you."I was not to be discomposed, "Mr.Gryce," I went on, "a woman's name,
once tarnished, remains so forever.Eleanore Leavenworth has too many
noble traits to be thoughtlessly dealt with in so momentous a crisis.If
you will give me your attention, I promise you shall not regret it."He smiled, and allowed his eyes to roam from the poker to the arm of my
chair."Very well," he remarked; "I hear you; say on."I drew my notes from my pocketbook, and laid them on the table."Unsafe, very; never put your plans on
paper."Taking no heed of the interruption, I went on.Gryce, I have had fuller opportunities than yourself for studying
this woman.I have seen her in a position which no guilty person could
occupy, and I am assured, beyond all doubt, that not only her hands, but
her heart, are pure from this crime.She may have some knowledge of its
secrets; that I do not presume to deny.The key seen in her possession
would refute me if I did.You can never wish to see
so lovely a being brought to shame for withholding information which she
evidently considers it her duty to keep back, when by a little patient
finesse we may succeed in our purposes without it.""But," interposed the detective, "say this is so; how are we to arrive
at the knowledge we want without following out the only clue which has
yet been given us?""You will never reach it by following out any clue given you by Eleanore
Leavenworth."His eyebrows lifted expressively, but he said nothing."Miss Eleanore Leavenworth has been used by some one acquainted with her
firmness, generosity, and perhaps love.Let us discover who possesses
sufficient power over her to control her to this extent, and we find the
man we seek."Gryce's compressed lips, and no more.Determined that he should speak, I waited."You have, then, some one in your mind"; he remarked at last, almost
flippantly."You are, then, intending to make a personal business of this matter?""May I ask," he inquired at length,
"whether you expect to work entirely by yourself; or whether, if a
suitable coadjutor were provided, you would disdain his assistance and
slight his advice?""I desire nothing more than to have you for my colleague.""You must feel very sure of
yourself!""I am very sure of Miss Leavenworth."The truth was, I had formed no plans."It seems to me," he continued, "that you have undertaken a rather
difficult task for an amateur.Raymond;
better leave it to me.""I am sure," I returned, "that nothing would please me better----"

"Not," he interrupted, "but that a word from you now and then would
be welcome.I am open to suggestions: as, for
instance, now, if you could conveniently inform me of all you have
yourself seen and heard in regard to this matter, I should be most happy
to listen."Relieved to find him so amenable, I asked myself what I really had to
tell; not so much that he would consider vital.However, it would not do
to hesitate now.Gryce," said I, "I have but few facts to add to those already known
to you.Indeed, I am more moved by convictions than facts.That Eleanore
Leavenworth never committed this crime, I am assured.That, on the other
hand, the real perpetrator is known to her, I am equally certain;
and that for some reason she considers it a sacred duty to shield the
assassin, even at the risk of her own safety, follows as a matter
of course from the facts.Now, with such data, it cannot be a very
difficult task for you or me to work out satisfactorily, to our own
minds at least, who this person can be.A little more knowledge of the
family--"

"You know nothing of its secret history, then?""Do not even know whether either of these girls is engaged to be
married?""I do not," I returned, wincing at this direct expression of my own
thoughts.Raymond," he cried at last, "have
you any idea of the disadvantages under which a detective labors?For
instance, now, you imagine I can insinuate myself into all sorts of
society, perhaps; but you are mistaken.Strange as it may appear, I have
never by any possibility of means succeeded with one class of persons at
all.Tailors and barbers are
no good; I am always found out."He looked so dejected I could scarcely forbear smiling, notwithstanding
my secret care and anxiety."I have even employed a French valet, who understood dancing and
whiskers; but it was all of no avail.The first gentleman I approached
stared at me,--real gentleman, I mean, none of your American
dandies,--and I had no stare to return; I had forgotten that emergency
in my confabs with Pierre Catnille Marie Make-face."Amused, but a little discomposed by this sudden turn in the
conversation, I looked at Mr."Now you, I dare say, have no trouble?Can even
ask a lady to dance without blushing, eh?""Just so," he replied; "now, I can't.I can enter a house, bow to the
mistress of it, let her be as elegant as she will, so long as I have
a writ of arrest in my hand, or some such professional matter upon my
mind; but when it comes to visiting in kid gloves, raising a glass of
champagne in response to a toast--and such like, I am absolutely good
for nothing."And he plunged his two hands into his hair, and looked
dolefully at the head of the cane I carried in my hand."But it is much
the same with the whole of us.When we are in want of a gentleman to
work for us, we have to go outside of our profession."I began to see what he was driving at; but held my peace, vaguely
conscious I was likely to prove a necessity to him, after all.Raymond," he now said, almost abruptly; "do you know a gentleman by
the name of Clavering residing at present at the Hoffman House?""He is very polished in his manners; would you mind making his
acquaintance?"Gryce's example, and stared at the chimney-piece."I
cannot answer till I understand matters a little better," I returned at
length.Henry Clavering, a gentleman and
a man of the world, resides at the Hoffman House.He is a stranger in
town, without being strange; drives, walks, smokes, but never visits;
looks at the ladies, but is never seen to bow to one.In short, a
person whom it is desirable to know; but whom, being a proud man,
with something of the old-world prejudice against Yankee freedom and
forwardness, I could no more approach in the way of acquaintance than I
could the Emperor of Austria.""And you wish----"

"He would make a very agreeable companion for a rising young lawyer
of good family and undoubted respectability.I have no doubt, if you
undertook to cultivate him, you would find him well worth the trouble.""But----"

"Might even desire to take him into familiar relations; to confide in
him, and----"

"Mr.Gryce," I hastily interrupted; "I can never consent to plot for any
man's friendship for the sake of betraying him to the police.""It is essential to your plans to make the acquaintance of Mr.I returned, a light breaking in upon me; "he has some connection
with this case, then?"Gryce smoothed his coat-sleeve thoughtfully."I don't know as it
will be necessary for you to betray him.You wouldn't object to being
introduced to him?""Nor, if you found him pleasant, to converse with him?""Not even if, in the course of conversation, you should come across
something that might serve as a clue in your efforts to save Eleanore
Leavenworth?"The no I uttered this time was less assured; the part of a spy was the
very last one I desired to play in the coming drama."Well, then," he went on, ignoring the doubtful tone in which my assent
had been given, "I advise you to immediately take up your quarters at
the Hoffman House.""I doubt if that would do," I said."If I am not mistaken, I have
already seen this gentleman, and spoken to him.""Well, he is tall, finely formed, of very upright carriage, with a
handsome dark face, brown hair streaked with gray, a piercing eye, and a
smooth address.A very imposing personage, I assure you.""I have reason to think I have seen him," I returned; and in a few words
told him when and where.said he at the conclusion; "he is evidently as much interested
in you as we are in him.I think I see," he added, after a moment's thought."Pity you spoke to him; may have created an unfavorable impression; and
everything depends upon your meeting without any distrust.""Well, we must move slowly, that is all.Give him a chance to see you in
other and better lights.Talk with the best men you meet while there; but not too much, or too
indiscriminately.Clavering is fastidious, and will not feel honored
by the attentions of one who is hail-fellow-well-met with everybody.Show yourself for what you are, and leave all advances to him; he 'll
make them.""Supposing we are under a mistake, and the man I met on the corner of
Thirty-seventh Street was not Mr."I should be greatly surprised, that's all."Not knowing what further objection to make, I remained silent."And this head of mine would have to put on its thinking-cap," he
pursued jovially.Gryce," I now said, anxious to show that all this talk about an
unknown party had not served to put my own plans from my mind, "there is
one person of whom we have not spoken."he exclaimed softly, wheeling around until his broad back
confronted me."Why, who but Mr.--" I could get no further.What right had I to
mention any man's name in this connection, without possessing sufficient
evidence against him to make such mention justifiable?"I beg your
pardon," said I; "but I think I will hold to my first impulse, and speak
no names."The quick blush rising to my face gave an involuntary assent."I see no reason why we shouldn't speak of him," he went on; "that is,
if there is anything to be gained by it.""His testimony at the inquest was honest, you think?"I felt myself slightly nonplussed; and, conscious of appearing at a
disadvantage, lifted my hat from the table and prepared to take my
leave; but, suddenly thinking of Hannah, turned and asked if there was
any news of her.He seemed to debate with himself, hesitating so long that I began to
doubt if this man intended to confide in me, after all, when suddenly he
brought his two hands down before him and exclaimed vehemently:

"The evil one himself is in this business!If the earth had opened and
swallowed up this girl, she couldn't have more effectually disappeared."Eleanore had said: "Hannah can do
nothing for me."Could it be that the girl was indeed gone, and forever?"I have innumerable agents at work, to say nothing of the general
public; and yet not so much as a whisper has come to me in regard to her
whereabouts or situation.I am only afraid we shall find her floating in
the river some fine morning, without a confession in her pocket.""Everything hangs upon that girl's testimony," I remarked."What does Miss Leavenworth say about it?"I thought he looked a trifle surprised at this, but he covered it with a
nod and an exclamation."She must be found for all that," said he, "and
shall, if I have to send out Q.""An agent of mine who is a living interrogation point; so we call him
_Q,_ which is short for query."Then, as I turned again to go: "When the
contents of the will are made known, come to me."WAYS OPENING


    "It is not and it cannot come to good."Leavenworth, but did not see the
ladies before or after the ceremony.I, however, had a few moments'
conversation with Mr.Harwell; which, without eliciting anything new,
provided me with food for abundant conjecture.For he had asked, almost
at first greeting, if I had seen the _Telegram_ of the night before;
and when I responded in the affirmative, turned such a look of mingled
distress and appeal upon me, I was tempted to ask how such a frightful
insinuation against a young lady of reputation and breeding could ever
have got into the papers."That the guilty party might be driven by remorse to own himself the
true culprit."A curious remark to come from a person who had no knowledge or
suspicion of the criminal and his character; and I would have pushed
the conversation further, but the secretary, who was a man of few words,
drew off at this, and could be induced to say no more.Evidently it was
my business to cultivate Mr.Clavering, or any one else who could throw
any light upon the secret history of these girls.Veeley had arrived home, but
was in no condition to consult with me upon so painful a subject as
the murder of Mr.Also a line from Eleanore, giving me her
address, but requesting me at the same time not to call unless I had
something of importance to communicate, as she was too ill to receive
visitors.Ill, alone, and in a strange
home,--'twas pitiful!The next day, pursuant to the wishes of Mr.Gryce, in I stepped into the
Hoffman House, and took a seat in the reading room.I had been there but
a few moments when a gentleman entered whom I immediately recognized
as the same I had spoken to on the corner of Thirty-seventh Street
and Sixth Avenue.He must have remembered me also, for he seemed to be
slightly embarrassed at seeing me; but, recovering himself, took up a
paper and soon became to all appearance lost in its contents, though I
could feel his handsome black eye upon me, studying my features,
figure, apparel, and movements with a degree of interest which equally
astonished and disconcerted me.I felt that it would be injudicious on
my part to return his scrutiny, anxious as I was to meet his eye and
learn what emotion had so fired his curiosity in regard to a perfect
stranger; so I rose, and, crossing to an old friend of mine who sat at
a table opposite, commenced a desultory conversation, in the course of
which I took occasion to ask if he knew who the handsome stranger was.Dick Furbish was a society man, and knew everybody."His name is Clavering, and he comes from London.I don't know anything
more about him, though he is to be seen everywhere except in private
houses.He has not been received into society yet; waiting for letters
of introduction, perhaps.""Oh, yes; I talk to him, but the conversation is very one-sided."I could not help smiling at the grimace with which Dick accompanied this
remark."Which same goes to prove," he went on, "that he is the real
thing."Laughing outright this time, I left him, and in a few minutes sauntered
from the room.As I mingled again with the crowd on Broadway, I found myself wondering
immensely over this slight experience.That this unknown gentleman from
London, who went everywhere except into private houses, could be in
any way connected with the affair I had so at heart, seemed not only
improbable but absurd; and for the first time I felt tempted to doubt
the sagacity of Mr.The next day I repeated the experiment, but with no greater success
than before.Clavering came into the room, but, seeing me, did
not remain.I began to realize it was no easy matter to make his
acquaintance.To atone for my disappointment, I called on Mary
Leavenworth in the evening.She received me with almost a sister-like
familiarity."Ah," she cried, after introducing me to an elderly lady at her
side,--some connection of the family, I believe, who had come to remain
with her for a while,--"you are here to tell me Hannah is found; is it
not so?"I shook my head, sorry to disappoint her."No," said I; "not yet."Gryce was here to-day, and he told me he hoped she would be
heard from within twenty-four hours.""Yes; came to report how matters were progressing,--not that they seemed
to have advanced very far."You must not be so easily
discouraged.""But I cannot help it; every day, every hour that passes in this
uncertainty, is like a mountain weight here"; and she laid one trembling
hand upon her bosom."I would have the whole world at work.I would
leave no stone unturned; I----"

"What would you do?""Oh, I don't know," she cried, her whole manner suddenly changing;
"nothing, perhaps."Then, before I could reply to this: "Have you seen
Eleanore to-day?"She did not seem satisfied, but waited till her friend left the room
before saying more.Then, with an earnest look, inquired if I knew
whether Eleanore was well."I fear she is not," I returned."It is a great trial to me, Eleanore being away.Not," she resumed,
noting, perhaps, my incredulous look, "that I would have you think I
wish to disclaim my share in bringing about the present unhappy state
of things.I am willing to acknowledge I was the first to propose a
separation.But it is none the easier to bear on that account.""It is not as hard for you as for her," said I.because she is left comparatively poor, while I am
rich--is that what you would say?Ah," she went on, without waiting for
my answer, "would I could persuade Eleanore to share my riches with me!Willingly would I bestow upon her the half I have received; but I fear
she could never be induced to accept so much as a dollar from me.""Under the circumstances it would be better for her not to.""Just what I thought; yet it would ease me of a great weight if she
would.This fortune, suddenly thrown into my lap, sits like an incubus
upon me, Mr.When the will was read to-day which makes me
possessor of so much wealth, I could not but feel that a heavy, blinding
pall had settled upon me, spotted with blood and woven of horrors.Ah,
how different from the feelings with which I have been accustomed to
anticipate this day!Raymond," she went on, with a hurried
gasp, "dreadful as it seems now, I have been reared to look forward to
this hour with pride, if not with actual longing.Money has been made
so much of in my small world.Not that I wish in this evil time of
retribution to lay blame upon any one; least of all upon my uncle; but
from the day, twelve years ago, when for the first time he took us in
his arms, and looking down upon our childish faces, exclaimed: 'The
light-haired one pleases me best; she shall be my heiress,' I have
been petted, cajoled, and spoiled; called little princess, and uncle's
darling, till it is only strange I retain in this prejudiced breast any
of the impulses of generous womanhood; yes, though I was aware from the
first that whim alone had raised this distinction between myself and
cousin; a distinction which superior beauty, worth, or accomplishments
could never have drawn; Eleanore being more than my equal in all these
things."Pausing, she choked back the sudden sob that rose in her
throat, with an effort at self-control which was at once touching and
admirable.Then, while my eyes stole to her face, murmured in a low,
appealing voice: "If I have faults, you see there is some slight excuse
for them; arrogance, vanity, and selfishness being considered in the gay
young heiress as no more than so many assertions of a laudable dignity.ah," she bitterly exclaimed "money alone has been the ruin of us
all!"Then, with a falling of her voice: "And now it has come to me
with its heritage of evil, and I--I would give it all for--But this is
weakness!I have no right to afflict you with my griefs.Pray forget all
I have said, Mr.Raymond, or regard my complaints as the utterances of
an unhappy girl loaded down with sorrows and oppressed by the weight of
many perplexities and terrors.""But I do not wish to forget," I replied."You have spoken some good
words, manifested much noble emotion.Your possessions cannot but prove
a blessing to you if you enter upon them with such feelings as these."But, with a quick gesture, she ejaculated: "Impossible!Then, as if startled at her own words, bit her lip
and hastily added: "Very great wealth is never a blessing."And now," said she, with a total change of manner, "I wish to
address you on a subject which may strike you as ill-timed, but which,
nevertheless, I must mention, if the purpose I have at heart is ever to
be accomplished.My uncle, as you know, was engaged at the time of his
death in writing a book on Chinese customs and prejudices.It was a work
which he was anxious to see published, and naturally I desire to carry
out his wishes; but, in order to do so, I find it necessary not only
to interest myself in the matter now,--Mr.Harwell's services being
required, and it being my wish to dismiss that gentleman as soon as
possible--but to find some one competent to supervise its completion.Now I have heard,--I have been told,--that you were the one of all
others to do this; and though it is difficult if not improper for me to
ask so great a favor of one who but a week ago was a perfect stranger to
me, it would afford me the keenest pleasure if you would consent to look
over this manuscript and tell me what remains to be done."The timidity with which these words were uttered proved her to be in
earnest, and I could not but wonder at the strange coincidence of this
request with my secret wishes; it having been a question with me for
some time how I was to gain free access to this house without in any way
compromising either its inmates or myself.Gryce had been the one to recommend me to her favor in this respect.But, whatever satisfaction I may have experienced, I felt myself in duty
bound to plead my incompetence for a task so entirely out of the line
of my profession, and to suggest the employment of some one better
acquainted with such matters than myself.Harwell has notes and memoranda in plenty," she exclaimed, "and
can give you all the information necessary.You will have no difficulty;
indeed, you will not."He seems to be
a clever and diligent young man.""He thinks he can; but I know uncle never
trusted him with the composition of a single sentence.""But perhaps he will not be pleased,--Mr.Harwell, I mean--with the
intrusion of a stranger into his work.""That makes no difference," she
cried.Harwell is in my pay, and has nothing to say about it.I have already consulted him, and he expresses
himself as satisfied with the arrangement.""Very well," said I; "then I will promise to consider the subject.I
can at any rate look over the manuscript and give you my opinion of its
condition.""Oh, thank you," said she, with the prettiest gesture of satisfaction."How kind you are, and what can I ever do to repay you?and she moved towards the door; but
suddenly paused, whispering, with a short shudder of remembrance: "He is
in the library; do you mind?"Crushing down the sick qualm that arose at the mention of that spot, I
replied in the negative."The papers are all there, and he says he can work better in his old
place than anywhere else; but if you wish, I can call him down."But I would not listen to this, and myself led the way to the foot of
the stairs."I have sometimes thought I would lock up that room," she hurriedly
observed; "but something restrains me.I can no more do so than I can
leave this house; a power beyond myself forces me to confront all its
horrors.Sometimes, in the
darkness of the night--But I will not distress you.I have already said
too much; come," and with a sudden lift of the head she mounted the
stairs.Harwell was seated, when we entered that fatal room, in the one
chair of all others I expected to see unoccupied; and as I beheld his
meagre figure bending where such a little while before his eyes had
encountered the outstretched form of his murdered employer, I could not
but marvel over the unimaginativeness of the man who, in the face of
such memories, could not only appropriate that very spot for his own
use, but pursue his avocations there with so much calmness and evident
precision.But in another moment I discovered that the disposition of
the light in the room made that one seat the only desirable one for his
purpose; and instantly my wonder changed to admiration at this quiet
surrender of personal feeling to the requirements of the occasion.He looked up mechanically as we came in, but did not rise, his
countenance wearing the absorbed expression which bespeaks the
preoccupied mind."He is utterly oblivious," Mary whispered; "that is a way of his.I doubt if he knows who or what it is that has disturbed him."And,
advancing into the room, she passed across his line of vision, as if
to call attention to herself, and said: "I have brought Mr.Raymond
up-stairs to see you, Mr.He has been so kind as to accede to
my wishes in regard to the completion of the manuscript now before you."Harwell rose, wiped his pen, and put it away; manifesting,
however, a reluctance in doing so that proved this interference to be
in reality anything but agreeable to him.Observing this, I did not wait
for him to speak, but took up the pile of manuscript, arranged in one
mass on the table, saying:

"This seems to be very clearly written; if you will excuse me, I will
glance over it and thus learn something of its general character."He bowed, uttered a word or so of acquiescence, then, as Mary left the
room, awkwardly reseated himself, and took up his pen.Instantly the manuscript and all connected with it vanished from my
thoughts; and Eleanore, her situation, and the mystery surrounding
this family, returned upon me with renewed force.Looking the secretary
steadily in the face, I remarked:

"I am very glad of this opportunity of seeing you a moment alone, Mr.Harwell, if only for the purpose of saying----"

"Anything in regard to the murder?""Then you must pardon me," he respectfully but firmly replied."It is
a disagreeable subject which I cannot bear to think of, much less
discuss."Disconcerted and, what was more, convinced of the impossibility of
obtaining any information from this man, I abandoned the attempt; and,
taking up the manuscript once more, endeavored to master in some small
degree the nature of its contents.Succeeding beyond my hopes, I opened
a short conversation with him in regard to it, and finally, coming to
the conclusion I could accomplish what Miss Leavenworth desired, left
him and descended again to the reception room.When, an hour or so later, I withdrew from the house, it was with the
feeling that one obstacle had been removed from my path.If I failed
in what I had undertaken, it would not be from lack of opportunity of
studying the inmates of this dwelling.THE WILL OF A MILLIONAIRE


    "Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
     Which we ascribe to Heaven."THE next morning's _Tribune_ contained a synopsis of Mr.Its provisions were a surprise to me; for, while the bulk of his
immense estate was, according to the general understanding, bequeathed
to his niece, Mary, it appeared by a codicil, attached to his will some
five years before, that Eleanore was not entirely forgotten, she having
been made the recipient of a legacy which, if not large, was at least
sufficient to support her in comfort.After listening to the various
comments of my associates on the subject, I proceeded to the house
of Mr.Gryce, in obedience to his request to call upon him as soon as
possible after the publication of the will."Good-morning," he remarked as I entered, but whether addressing me or
the frowning top of the desk before which he was sitting it would be
difficult to say.nodding with a curious back movement
of his head towards a chair in his rear."I am curious to know," I remarked,
"what you have to say about this will, and its probable effect upon the
matters we have in hand.""What is your own idea in regard to it?""Well, I think upon the whole it will make but little difference in
public opinion.Those who thought Eleanore guilty before will feel that
they possess now greater cause than ever to doubt her innocence; while
those who have hitherto hesitated to suspect her will not consider
that the comparatively small amount bequeathed her would constitute an
adequate motive for so great a crime.""You have heard men talk; what seems to be the general opinion among
those you converse with?""That the motive of the tragedy will be found in the partiality shown in
so singular a will, though how, they do not profess to know."Gryce suddenly became interested in one of the small drawers before
him."And all this has not set you thinking?"I am sure I have
done nothing but think for the last three days.I----"

"Of course--of course," he cried."I didn't mean to say anything
disagreeable."Yes," said I; "Miss Leavenworth has requested me to do her that little
favor."Then, with an instant return to his business-like tone: "You are going
to have opportunities, Mr.Now there are two things I want you
to find out; first, what is the connection between these ladies and Mr.Clavering----"

"There is a connection, then?"And secondly, what is the cause of the unfriendly feeling
which evidently exists between the cousins."I drew back and pondered the position offered me.A spy in a fair
woman's house!How could I reconcile it with my natural instincts as a
gentleman?"Cannot you find some one better adapted to learn these secrets for
you?""The part of a spy is anything but agreeable to
my feelings, I assure you."Leavenworth's
manuscript for the press," I said; "I will give Mr.Clavering an
opportunity to form my acquaintance; and I will listen, if Miss
Leavenworth chooses to make me her confidant in any way.But any
hearkening at doors, surprises, unworthy feints or ungentlemanly
subterfuges, I herewith disclaim as outside of my province; my task
being to find out what I can in an open way, and yours to search into
the nooks and corners of this wretched business.""In other words, you are to play the hound, and I the mole; just so, I
know what belongs to a gentleman.""And now," said I, "what news of Hannah?"I cannot say I was greatly surprised, that evening, when, upon
descending from an hour's labor with Mr.Harwell, I encountered Miss
Leavenworth standing at the foot of the stairs.There had been something
in her bearing, the night before, which prepared me for another
interview this evening, though her manner of commencing it was a
surprise.Raymond," said she, with an air of marked embarrassment,
"I want to ask you a question.I believe you to be a good man, and I
know you will answer me conscientiously.As a brother would," she added,
lifting her eyes for a moment to my face."I know it will sound strange;
but remember, I have no adviser but you, and I must ask some one.Raymond, do you think a person could do something that was very wrong,
and yet grow to be thoroughly good afterwards?""Certainly," I replied; "if he were truly sorry for his fault.""But say it was more than a fault; say it was an actual harm; would not
the memory of that one evil hour cast a lasting shadow over one's life?""That depends upon the nature of the harm and its effect upon others.If one had irreparably injured a fellow-being, it would be hard for a
person of sensitive nature to live a happy life afterwards; though the
fact of not living a happy life ought to be no reason why one should not
live a good life.""But to live a good life would it be necessary to reveal the evil you
had done?Cannot one go on and do right without confessing to the world
a past wrong?""Yes, unless by its confession he can in some way make reparation."Drawing back, she stood for one moment
in a thoughtful attitude before me, her beauty shining with almost a
statuesque splendor in the glow of the porcelain-shaded lamp at her
side.Nor, though she presently roused herself, leading the way into the
drawing-room with a gesture that was allurement itself, did she recur to
this topic again; but rather seemed to strive, in the conversation that
followed, to make me forget what had already passed between us.That she
did not succeed, was owing to my intense and unfailing interest in her
cousin.As I descended the stoop, I saw Thomas, the butler, leaning over the
area gate.Immediately I was seized with an impulse to interrogate him
in regard to a matter which had more or less interested me ever since
the inquest; and that was, who was the Mr.Robbins who had called
upon Eleanore the night of the murder?He remembered such a person called, but could not
describe his looks any further than to say that he was not a small man.THE BEGINNING OF GREAT SURPRISES


    "Vous regardez une etoile pour deux motifs, parce qu'elle est
    lumineuse et parce qu'elle est impenetrable.Vous avez aupres
    de vous un plus doux rayonnement et un pas grand mystere, la femme."AND now followed days in which I seemed to make little or no progress.Clavering, disturbed perhaps by my presence, forsook his usual
haunts, thus depriving me of all opportunity of making his acquaintance
in any natural manner, while the evenings spent at Miss Leavenworth's
were productive of little else than constant suspense and uneasiness.But, in the
course of making such few changes as were necessary, I had ample
opportunity of studying the character of Mr.I found him to be
neither more nor less than an excellent amanuensis.Stiff, unbending,
and sombre, but true to his duty and reliable in its performance, I
learned to respect him, and even to like him; and this, too, though I
saw the liking was not reciprocated, whatever the respect may have been.He never spoke of Eleanore Leavenworth or, indeed, mentioned the family
or its trouble in any way; till I began to feel that all this reticence
had a cause deeper than the nature of the man, and that if he did
speak, it would be to some purpose.This suspicion, of course, kept me
restlessly eager in his presence.I could not forbear giving him sly
glances now and then, to see how he acted when he believed himself
unobserved; but he was ever the same, a passive, diligent, unexcitable
worker.This continual beating against a stone wall, for thus I regarded it,
became at last almost unendurable.Clavering shy, and the secretary
unapproachable--how was I to gain anything?The short interviews I had
with Mary did not help matters.Haughty, constrained, feverish, pettish,
grateful, appealing, everything at once, and never twice the same, I
learned to dread, even while I coveted, an interview.She appeared to be
passing through some crisis which occasioned her the keenest suffering.I have seen her, when she thought herself alone, throw up her hands
with the gesture which we use to ward off a coming evil or shut out some
hideous vision.I have likewise beheld her standing with her proud head
abased, her nervous hands drooping, her whole form sinking and inert, as
if the pressure of a weight she could neither upbear nor cast aside
had robbed her even of the show of resistance.Ordinarily she was at least stately in her trouble.Even when the
softest appeal came into her eyes she stood erect, and retained her
expression of conscious power.Even the night she met me in the hall,
with feverish cheeks and lips trembling with eagerness, only to turn and
fly again without giving utterance to what she had to say, she comported
herself with a fiery dignity that was well nigh imposing.That all this meant something, I was sure; and so I kept my patience
alive with the hope that some day she would make a revelation.Those
quivering lips would not always remain closed; the secret involving
Eleanore's honor and happiness would be divulged by this restless being,
if by no one else.Nor was the memory of that extraordinary, if not
cruel, accusation I had heard her make enough to destroy this hope--for
hope it had grown to be--so that I found myself insensibly shortening
my time with Mr.Harwell in the library, and extending my _tete-a-tete_
visits with Mary in the reception room, till the imperturbable secretary
was forced to complain that he was often left for hours without work.But, as I say, days passed, and a second Monday evening came round
without seeing me any further advanced upon the problem I had set myself
to solve than when I first started upon it two weeks before.The subject
of the murder had not even been broached; nor was Hannah spoken of,
though I observed the papers were not allowed to languish an instant
upon the stoop; mistress and servants betraying equal interest in their
contents.It was as if you saw a group of
human beings eating, drinking, and sleeping upon the sides of a volcano
hot with a late eruption and trembling with the birth of a new one.I
longed to break this silence as we shiver glass: by shouting the name
of Eleanore through those gilded rooms and satin-draped vestibules.But
this Monday evening I was in a calmer mood.I was determined to expect
nothing from my visits to Mary Leavenworth's house; and entered it upon
the eve in question with an equanimity such as I had not experienced
since the first day I passed under its unhappy portals.But when, upon nearing the reception room, I saw Mary pacing the floor
with the air of one who is restlessly awaiting something or somebody,
I took a sudden resolution, and, advancing towards her, said: "Do I see
you alone, Miss Leavenworth?"She paused in her hurried action, blushed and bowed, but, contrary to
her usual custom, did not bid me enter."Will it be too great an intrusion on my part, if I venture to come in?"Her glance flashed uneasily to the clock, and she seemed about to excuse
herself, but suddenly yielded, and, drawing up a chair before the fire,
motioned me towards it.Though she endeavored to appear calm, I vaguely
felt I had chanced upon her in one of her most agitated moods, and that
I had only to broach the subject I had in mind to behold her haughtiness
disappear before me like melting snow.I also felt that I had but few
moments in which to do it."Miss Leavenworth," said I, "in obtruding upon you to-night, I have a
purpose other than that of giving myself a pleasure.Instantly I saw that in some way I had started wrong.she asked, breathing coldness from every feature of her face."Yes," I went on, with passionate recklessness."Balked in every other
endeavor to learn the truth, I have come to you, whom I believe to be
noble at the core, for that help which seems likely to fail us in every
other direction: for the word which, if it does not absolutely save your
cousin, will at least put us upon the track of what will.""I do not understand what you mean," she protested, slightly shrinking."Miss Leavenworth," I pursued, "it is needless for me to tell you in
what position your cousin stands.You, who remember both the form and
drift of the questions put to her at the inquest, comprehend it all
without any explanation from me.But what you may not know is this, that
unless she is speedily relieved from the suspicion which, justly or not,
has attached itself to her name, the consequences which such suspicion
entails must fall upon her, and----"

"Good God!"she cried; "you do not mean she will be----"

"Subject to arrest?Shame, horror, and anguish were in every line of her
white face."Why," she cried, flushing painfully; "I cannot say; didn't you tell
me?"No, I did
not, either," she avowed, in a sudden burst of shame and penitence."I
knew it was a secret; but--oh, Mr.Raymond, it was Eleanore herself who
told me.""Yes, that last evening she was here; we were together in the
drawing-room.""That the key to the library had been seen in her possession."Eleanore, conscious of the
suspicion with which her cousin regarded her, inform that cousin of a
fact calculated to add weight to that suspicion?"I have revealed nothing I ought to
have kept secret?""No," said I; "and, Miss Leavenworth, it is this thing which makes
your cousin's position absolutely dangerous.It is a fact that,
left unexplained, must ever link her name with infamy; a bit of
circumstantial evidence no sophistry can smother, and no denial
obliterate.Only her hitherto spotless reputation, and the efforts of
one who, notwithstanding appearances, believes in her innocence, keeps
her so long from the clutch of the officers of justice.That key, and
the silence preserved by her in regard to it, is sinking her slowly into
a pit from which the utmost endeavors of her best friends will soon be
inadequate to extricate her.""And you tell me this----"

"That you may have pity on the poor girl, who will not have pity on
herself, and by the explanation of a few circumstances, which cannot be
mysteries to you, assist in bringing her from under the dreadful shadow
that threatens to overwhelm her.""And would you insinuate, sir," she cried, turning upon me with a look
of great anger, "that I know any more than you do of this matter?that
I possess any knowledge which I have not already made public concerning
the dreadful tragedy which has transformed our home into a desert, our
existence into a lasting horror?Has the blight of suspicion fallen upon
me, too; and have you come to accuse me in my own house----"

"Miss Leavenworth," I entreated; "calm yourself.I only desire you to enlighten me as to your cousin's probable
motive for this criminating silence.You
are her cousin, almost her sister, have been at all events her daily
companion for years, and must know for whom or for what she seals her
lips, and conceals facts which, if known, would direct suspicion to the
real criminal--that is, if you really believe what you have hitherto
stated, that your cousin is an innocent woman."She not making any answer to this, I rose and confronted her."Miss
Leavenworth, do you believe your cousin guiltless of this crime, or
not?"my God; if all the world were only as innocent
as she!""Then," said I, "you must likewise believe that if she refrains from
speaking in regard to matters which to ordinary observers ought to be
explained, she does it only from motives of kindness towards one less
guiltless than herself."No, no; I do not say that.What made you think of any such
explanation?"With one of Eleanore's character, such conduct
as hers admits of no other construction.Either she is mad, or she is
shielding another at the expense of herself."Mary's lip, which had trembled, slowly steadied itself."And whom
have you settled upon, as the person for whom Eleanore thus sacrifices
herself?""Ah," said I, "there is where I seek assistance from you.With your
knowledge of her history----"

But Mary Leavenworth, sinking haughtily back into her chair, stopped
me with a quiet gesture."I beg your pardon," said she; "but you make a
mistake.I know little or nothing of Eleanore's personal feelings.The
mystery must be solved by some one besides me.""When Eleanore confessed to you that the missing key had been seen in
her possession, did she likewise inform you where she obtained it, and
for what reason she was hiding it?""Merely told you the fact, without any explanation?""Was not that a strange piece of gratuitous information for her to
give one who, but a few hours before, had accused her to the face of
committing a deadly crime?""You will not deny that you were once, not only ready to believe her
guilty, but that you actually charged her with having perpetrated this
crime.""Miss Leavenworth, do you not remember what you said in that room
upstairs, when you were alone with your cousin on the morning of the
inquest, just before Mr.Her eyes did not fall, but they filled with sudden terror.I was just outside the door, and----"

"What did you hear?"It seemed as if her eyes would devour my face."Yet nothing was said
when you came in?""You, however, have never forgotten it?""How could we, Miss Leavenworth?"Her head fell forward in her hands, and for one wild moment she seemed
lost in despair.Then she roused, and desperately exclaimed:

"And that is why you come here to-night.With that sentence written upon
your heart, you invade my presence, torture me with questions----"

"Pardon me," I broke in; "are my questions such as you, with reasonable
regard for the honor of one with whom you are accustomed to associate,
should hesitate to answer?Do I derogate from my manhood in asking you
how and why you came to make an accusation of so grave a nature, at a
time when all the circumstances of the case were freshly before you,
only to insist fully as strongly upon your cousin's innocence when
you found there was even more cause for your imputation than you had
supposed?""Miss Leavenworth," said I, rising, and taking my stand before her;
"although there is a temporary estrangement between you and your cousin,
you cannot wish to seem her enemy.Speak, then; let me at least know the
name of him for whom she thus immolates herself.A hint from you----"

But rising, with a strange look, to her feet, she interrupted me with a
stern remark: "If you do not know, I cannot inform you; do not ask me,
Mr.And she glanced at the clock for the second time."Miss Leavenworth, you once asked me if a person who had committed a
wrong ought necessarily to confess it; and I replied no, unless by the
confession reparation could be made.Her lips moved, but no words issued from them."I begin to think," I solemnly proceeded, following the lead of her
emotion, "that confession is the only way out of this difficulty: that
only by the words you can utter Eleanore can be saved from the doom that
awaits her.Will you not then show yourself a true woman by responding
to my earnest entreaties?"I seemed to have touched the right chord; for she trembled, and a look
of wistfulness filled her eyes.Eleanore
persists in silence; but that is no reason why you should emulate her
example.You only make her position more doubtful by it.""I know it; but I cannot help myself.Fate has too strong a hold upon
me; I cannot break away."Any one can escape from bonds imaginary as yours.""No, no," she protested; "you do not understand.""I understand this: that the path of rectitude is a straight one, and
that he who steps into devious byways is going astray."A flicker of light, pathetic beyond description, flashed for a moment
across her face; her throat rose as with one wild sob; her lips opened;
she seemed yielding, when--A sharp ring at the front door-bell!"Oh," she cried, sharply turning, "tell him I cannot see him; tell
him----"

"Miss Leavenworth," said I, taking her by both hands, "never mind the
door; never mind anything but this.I have asked you a question which
involves the mystery of this whole affair; answer me, then, for your
soul's sake; tell me, what the unhappy circumstances were which could
induce you--"

But she tore her hands from mine.she cried; "it will open,
and--"

Stepping into the hall, I met Thomas coming up the basement stairs."Go
back," said I; "I will call you when you are wanted.""You expect me to answer," she exclaimed, when I re-entered, "now, in a
moment?"But----"

"Impossible!""I fear the time will never come, if you do not speak now.""You may open the door now,"
said I, and moved to return to her side.But, with a gesture of command, she pointed up-stairs.and
her glance passed on to Thomas, who stopped where he was."I will see you again before I go," said I, and hastened up-stairs.I heard a rich,
tremulous voice inquire."Yes, sir," came in the butler's most respectful and measured accents,
and, leaning over the banisters I beheld, to my amazement, the form of
Mr.Clavering enter the front hall and move towards the reception room.ON THE STAIRS


    "You cannot _say_ I did it."EXCITED, tremulous, filled with wonder at this unlooked-for event, I
paused for a moment to collect my scattered senses, when the sound of
a low, monotonous voice breaking upon my ear from the direction of the
library, I approached and found Mr.Harwell reading aloud from his late
employer's manuscript.It would be difficult for me to describe the
effect which this simple discovery made upon me at this time.There,
in that room of late death, withdrawn from the turmoil of the world, a
hermit in his skeleton-lined cell, this man employed himself in reading
and rereading, with passive interest, the words of the dead, while above
and below, human beings agonized in doubt and shame.Listening, I heard
these words:

"By these means their native rulers will not only lose their jealous
terror of our institutions, but acquire an actual curiosity in regard to
them."you are late, sir," was the greeting with which he rose and brought
forward a chair.My reply was probably inaudible, for he added, as he passed to his own
seat:

"I am afraid you are not well."And, pulling the papers towards me, I began looking them
over.But the words danced before my eyes, and I was obliged to give up
all attempt at work for that night."_I_ fear I am unable to assist you this evening, Mr.The fact
is, I find it difficult to give proper attention to this business while
the man who by a dastardly assassination has made it necessary goes
unpunished."The secretary in his turn pushed the papers aside, as if moved by a
sudden distaste of them, but gave me no answer."You told me, when you first came to me with news of this fearful
tragedy, that it was a mystery; but it is one which must be solved,
Mr.Harwell; it is wearing out the lives of too many whom we love and
respect.""And Miss Mary," I went on; "myself, you, and many others.""You have manifested much interest in the matter from the
beginning,"--he said, methodically dipping his pen into the ink."And you," said I; "do you take no interest in that which involves not
only the safety, but the happiness and honor, of the family in which you
have dwelt so long?""I have no wish to discuss
this subject.I believe I have before prayed you to spare me its
introduction.""But I cannot consider your wishes in this regard," I persisted."If you
know any facts, connected with this affair, which have not yet been made
public, it is manifestly your duty to state them.The position which
Miss Eleanore occupies at this time is one which should arouse the sense
of justice in every true breast; and if you----"

"If I knew anything which would serve to release her from her unhappy
position, Mr.Raymond, I should have spoken long ago."I bit my lip, weary of these continual bafflings, and rose also."If you have nothing more to say," he went on, "and feel utterly
disinclined to work, why, I should be glad to excuse myself, as I have
an engagement out.""Do not let me keep you," I said, bitterly.He turned upon me with a short stare, as if this display of feeling
was well nigh incomprehensible to him; and then, with a quiet, almost
compassionate bow left the room.I heard him go up-stairs, felt the
jar when his room door closed, and sat down to enjoy my solitude.But
solitude in that room was unbearable.Harwell again
descended, I felt I could remain no longer, and, stepping into the hall,
told him that if he had no objection I would accompany him for a short
stroll.He bowed a stiff assent, and hastened before me down the stairs.By the
time I had closed the library door, he was half-way to the foot, and I
was just remarking to myself upon the unpliability of his figure and the
awkwardness of his carriage, as seen from my present standpoint, when
suddenly I saw him stop, clutch the banister at his side, and hang there
with a startled, deathly expression upon his half-turned countenance,
which fixed me for an instant where I was in breathless astonishment,
and then caused me to rush down to his side, catch him by the arm, and
cry:

"What is it?But, thrusting out his hand, he pushed me upwards.he
whispered, in a voice shaking with intensest emotion, "go back."And
catching me by the arm, he literally pulled me up the stairs.Arrived
at the top, he loosened his grasp, and leaning, quivering from head to
foot, over the banisters, glared below.Startled in my turn, I bent beside him, and saw Henry Clavering come out
of the reception room and cross the hall.Clavering," I whispered, with all the self-possession I
could muster; "do you know him?""Clavering, Clavering,"
he murmured with quaking lips; then, suddenly bounding forward, clutched
the railing before him, and fixing me with his eyes, from which all the
stoic calmness had gone down forever in flame and frenzy, gurgled into
my ear: "You want to know who the assassin of Mr.Look there, then: that is the man, Clavering!"And with a leap, he
bounded from my side, and, swaying like a drunken man, disappeared from
my gaze in the hall above.Rushing upstairs, I knocked at the
door of his room, but no response came to my summons.I then called
his name in the hall, but without avail; he was determined not to show
himself.Resolved that he should not thus escape me, I returned to the
library, and wrote him a short note, in which I asked for an explanation
of his tremendous accusation, saying I would be in my rooms the next
evening at six, when I should expect to see him.This done I descended
to rejoin Mary.But the evening was destined to be full of disappointments.She had
retired to her room while I was in the library, and I lost the interview
from which I expected so much."The woman is slippery as an eel," I
inwardly commented, pacing the hall in my chagrin."Wrapped in mystery,
she expects me to feel for her the respect due to one of frank and open
nature."I was about to leave the house, when I saw Thomas descending the stairs
with a letter in his hand."Miss Leavenworth's compliments, sir, and she is too fatigued to remain
below this evening."I moved aside to read the note he handed me, feeling a little
conscience-stricken as I traced the hurried, trembling handwriting
through the following words:


    "You ask more than I can give.Matters must be received as they are
    without explanation from me.It is the grief of my life to deny you;
    but I have no choice.God forgive us all and keep us from despair.And below:


    "As we cannot meet now without embarrassment, it is better we should
    bear our burdens in silence and apart.As I was crossing Thirty-second Street, I heard a quick footstep behind
me, and turning, saw Thomas at my side."Excuse me, sir," said he, "but
I have something a little particular to say to you.When you asked me
the other night what sort of a person the gentleman was who called
on Miss Eleanore the evening of the murder, I didn't answer you as I
should.The fact is, the detectives had been talking to me about that
very thing, and I felt shy; but, sir, I know you are a friend of the
family, and I want to tell you now that that same gentleman, whoever
he was,--Mr.Robbins, he called himself then,--was at the house again
tonight, sir, and the name he gave me this time to carry to Miss
Leavenworth was Clavering.Yes, sir," he went on, seeing me start; "and,
as I told Molly, he acts queer for a stranger.When he came the other
night, he hesitated a long time before asking for Miss Eleanore, and
when I wanted his name, took out a card and wrote on it the one I told
you of, sir, with a look on his face a little peculiar for a caller;
besides----"

"Well?"Raymond," the butler went on, in a low, excited voice, edging up
very closely to me in the darkness."There is something I have never
told any living being but Molly, sir, which may be of use to those as
wishes to find out who committed this murder.""A fact, sir; which I beg your pardon for troubling you with at this
time; but Molly will give me no rest unless I speak of it to you or Mr.Gryce; her feelings being so worked up on Hannah's account, whom we all
know is innocent, though folks do dare to say as how she must be guilty
just because she is not to be found the minute they want her."Gryce," he resumed,
unconscious of my anxiety, "but I have my fears of detectives, sir; they
catch you up so quick at times, and seem to think you know so much more
than you really do.""But this fact," I again broke in."O yes, sir; the fact is, that that night, the one of the murder you
know, I saw Mr.Clavering, Robbins, or whatever his name is, enter the
house, but neither I nor any one else saw him go out of it; nor do I
know that he _did."_

"What do you mean?""Well, sir, what I mean is this.When I came down from Miss Eleanore and
told Mr.Robbins, as he called himself at that time, that my mistress
was ill and unable to see him (the word she gave me, sir, to deliver)
Mr.Robbins, instead of bowing and leaving the house like a gentleman,
stepped into the reception room and sat down.He may have felt sick, he
looked pale enough; at any rate, he asked me for a glass of water.Not knowing any reason then for suspicionating any one's actions, I
immediately went down to the kitchen for it, leaving him there in the
reception room alone.But before I could get it, I heard the front door
close.said Molly, who was helping me, sir.'I don't
know,' said I, 'unless it's the gentleman has got tired of waiting and
gone.''If he's gone, he won't want the water,' she said.So down I set
the pitcher, and up-stairs I come; and sure enough he was gone, or so
I thought then.But who knows, sir, if he was not in that room or the
drawing-room, which was dark that night, all the time I was a-shutting
up of the house?"I made no reply to this; I was more startled than I cared to reveal."You see, sir, I wouldn't speak of such a thing about any person that
comes to see the young ladies; but we all know some one who was in the
house that night murdered my master, and as it was not Hannah----"

"You say that Miss Eleanore refused to see him," I interrupted, in the
hope that the simple suggestion would be enough to elicitate further
details of his interview with Eleanore.When she first looked at the card, she showed a little
hesitation; but in a moment she grew very flushed in the face, and bade
me say what I told you.I should never have thought of it again if I had
not seen him come blazoning and bold into the house this evening, with
a new name on his tongue.Indeed, and I do not like to think any evil of
him now; but Molly would have it I should speak to you, sir, and ease my
mind,--and that is all, sir."When I arrived home that night, I entered into my memorandum-book a
new list of suspicious circumstances, but this time they were under the
caption "C" instead of "E."IN MY OFFICE


    "Something between an hindrance and a help."THE next day as, with nerves unstrung and an exhausted brain, I entered
my office, I was greeted by the announcement:

"A gentleman, sir, in your private room--been waiting some time, very
impatient."Weary, in no mood to hold consultation with clients new or old, I
advanced with anything but an eager step towards my room, when, upon
opening the door, I saw--Mr.Too much astounded for the moment to speak, I bowed to him silently,
whereupon he approached me with the air and dignity of a highly bred
gentleman, and presented his card, on which I saw written, in free and
handsome characters, his whole name, Henry Ritchie Clavering.After this
introduction of himself, he apologized for making so unceremonious
a call, saying, in excuse, that he was a stranger in town; that his
business was one of great urgency; that he had casually heard honorable
mention of me as a lawyer and a gentleman, and so had ventured to seek
this interview on behalf of a friend who was so unfortunately situated
as to require the opinion and advice of a lawyer upon a question which
not only involved an extraordinary state of facts, but was of a nature
peculiarly embarrassing to him, owing to his ignorance of American laws,
and the legal bearing of these facts upon the same.Having thus secured my attention, and awakened my curiosity, he asked me
if I would permit him to relate his story.Recovering in a measure from
my astonishment, and subduing the extreme repulsion, almost horror,
I felt for the man, I signified my assent; at which he drew from his
pocket a memorandum-book from which he read in substance as follows:

"An Englishman travelling in this country meets, at a fashionable
watering-place, an American girl, with whom he falls deeply in love, and
whom, after a few days, he desires to marry.Knowing his position to be
good, his fortune ample, and his intentions highly honorable, he offers
her his hand, and is accepted.But a decided opposition arising in the
family to the match, he is compelled to disguise his sentiments, though
the engagement remained unbroken.While matters were in this uncertain
condition, he received advices from England demanding his instant
return, and, alarmed at the prospect of a protracted absence from the
object of his affections, he writes to the lady, informing her of
the circumstances, and proposing a secret marriage.She consents with
stipulations; the first of which is, that he should leave her instantly
upon the conclusion of the ceremony, and the second, that he should
intrust the public declaration of the marriage to her.It was not
precisely what he wished, but anything which served to make her his
own was acceptable at such a crisis.He readily enters into the plans
proposed.Meeting the lady at a parsonage, some twenty miles from the
watering-place at which she was staying, he stands up with her before
a Methodist preacher, and the ceremony of marriage is performed.There
were two witnesses, a hired man of the minister, called in for the
purpose, and a lady friend who came with the bride; but there was no
license, and the bride had not completed her twenty-first year.If the lady, wedded in good faith upon that day by
my friend, chooses to deny that she is his lawful wife, can he hold
her to a compact entered into in so informal a manner?Raymond, is my friend the lawful husband of that girl or not?"While listening to this story, I found myself yielding to feelings
greatly in contrast to those with which I greeted the relator but a
moment before.I became so interested in his "friend's" case as to
quite forget, for the time being, that I had ever seen or heard of Henry
Clavering; and after learning that the marriage ceremony took place in
the State of New York, I replied to him, as near as I can remember, in
the following words:

"In this State, and I believe it to be American law, marriage is a
civil contract, requiring neither license, priest, ceremony, nor
certificate--and in some cases witnesses are not even necessary to give
it validity.Of old, the modes of getting a wife were the same as those
of acquiring any other species of property, and they are not materially
changed at the present time.It is enough that the man and woman say to
each other, 'From this time we are married,' or, 'You are now my wife,'
or,'my husband,' as the case may be.The mutual consent is all that is
necessary.In fact, you may contract marriage as you contract to lend a
sum of money, or to buy the merest trifle.""Then your opinion is----"

"That upon your statement, your friend is the lawful husband of the lady
in question; presuming, of course, that no legal disabilities of either
party existed to prevent such a union.As to the young lady's age, I
will merely say that any fourteen-year-old girl can be a party to a
marriage contract."Clavering bowed, his countenance assuming a look of great
satisfaction."I am very glad to hear this," said he; "my friend's
happiness is entirely involved in the establishment of his marriage."He appeared so relieved, my curiosity was yet further aroused.I
therefore said: "I have given you my opinion as to the legality of this
marriage; but it may be quite another thing to prove it, should the same
be contested."He started, cast me an inquiring look, and murmured:

"True.""Allow me to ask you a few questions.Was the lady married under her own
name?""Properly signed by the minister and witnesses?""I cannot say; but I presume she did.""The witnesses were----"

"A hired man of the minister----"

"Who can be found?""The minister is dead, the man has disappeared.""The other witness, the lady friend, where is she?""She can be found; but her action is not to be depended upon.""Has the gentleman himself no proofs of this marriage?""He cannot even prove he was in the town
where it took place on that particular day.""The marriage certificate was, however, filed with the clerk of the
town?"I only know that my friend has made inquiry, and that no
such paper is to be found.""I do not wonder your friend is
concerned in regard to his position, if what you hint is true, and the
lady seems disposed to deny that any such ceremony ever took place.Still, if he wishes to go to law, the Court may decide in his favor,
though I doubt it.His sworn word is all he would have to go upon, and
if she contradicts his testimony under oath, why the sympathy of a jury
is, as a rule, with the woman."Clavering rose, looked at me with some earnestness, and finally
asked, in a tone which, though somewhat changed, lacked nothing of its
former suavity, if I would be kind enough to give him in writing that
portion of my opinion which directly bore upon the legality of the
marriage; that such a paper would go far towards satisfying his friend
that his case had been properly presented; as he was aware that no
respectable lawyer would put his name to a legal opinion without first
having carefully arrived at his conclusions by a thorough examination of
the law bearing upon the facts submitted.This request seeming so reasonable, I unhesitatingly complied with it,
and handed him the opinion.He took it, and, after reading it carefully
over, deliberately copied it into his memorandum-book.This done, he
turned towards me, a strong, though hitherto subdued, emotion showing
itself in his countenance."Now, sir," said he, rising upon me to the full height of his majestic
figure, "I have but one more request to make; and that is, that you will
receive back this opinion into your own possession, and in the day you
think to lead a beautiful woman to the altar, pause and ask yourself:
'Am I sure that the hand I clasp with such impassioned fervor is free?Have I any certainty for knowing that it has not already been given
away, like that of the lady whom, in this opinion of mine, I have
declared to be a wedded wife according to the laws of my country? '"But he, with an urbane bow, laid his hand upon the knob of the door."I
thank you for your courtesy, Mr.Raymond, and I bid you good-day.I hope
you will have no need of consulting that paper before I see you again."It was the most vital shock I had yet experienced; and for a moment
I stood paralyzed.Why should he mix me up with the affair
unless--but I would not contemplate that possibility.Eleanore married,
and to this man?And yet I found myself
continually turning the supposition over in my mind until, to escape
the torment of my own conjectures, I seized my hat, and rushed into
the street in the hope of finding him again and extorting from him an
explanation of his mysterious conduct.But by the time I reached the
sidewalk, he was nowhere to be seen.A thousand busy men, with their
various cares and purposes, had pushed themselves between us, and I was
obliged to return to my office with my doubts unsolved.I think I never experienced a longer day; but it passed, and at five
o'clock I had the satisfaction of inquiring for Mr.Clavering at the
Hoffman House.Judge of my surprise when I learned that his visit to
my office was his last action before taking passage upon the steamer
leaving that day for Liverpool; that he was now on the high seas, and
all chance of another interview with him was at an end.I could scarcely
believe the fact at first; but after a talk with the cabman who
had driven him off to my office and thence to the steamer, I became
convinced.I had been brought face to
face with the accused man, had received an intimation from him that he
was not expecting to see me again for some time, and had weakly gone on
attending to my own affairs and allowed him to escape, like the simple
tyro that I was.My next, the necessity of notifying Mr.But it was now six o'clock, the hour set apart for my
interview with Mr.I could not afford to miss that, so merely
stopping to despatch a line to Mr.Gryce, in which I promised to visit
him that evening, I turned my steps towards home."Often do the spirits
    Of great events stride on before the events,
    And in to-day already walks to-morrow."What revelations might not this man
be going to make!But I subdued the feeling; and, greeting him with what
cordiality I could, settled myself to listen to his explanations.But Trueman Harwell had no explanations to give, or so it seemed; on
the contrary, he had come to apologize for the very violent words he had
used the evening before; words which, whatever their effect upon me, he
now felt bound to declare had been used without sufficient basis in fact
to make their utterance of the least importance."But you must have thought you had grounds for so tremendous an
accusation, or your act was that of a madman."His brow wrinkled heavily, and his eyes assumed a very gloomy
expression."Under the pressure of
surprise, I have known men utter convictions no better founded than mine
without running the risk of being called mad."Clavering's face or form must, then, have been known to
you.The mere fact of seeing a strange gentleman in the hall would have
been insufficient to cause you astonishment, Mr.He uneasily fingered the back of the chair before which he stood, but
made no reply."Sit down," I again urged, this time with a touch of command in my
voice."This is a serious matter, and I intend to deal with it as it
deserves.You once said that if you knew anything which might serve
to exonerate Eleanore Leavenworth from the suspicion under which she
stands, you would be ready to impart it."I said that if I had ever known anything calculated to
release her from her unhappy position, I would have spoken," he coldly
corrected.You know, and I know, that you are keeping something
back; and I ask you, in her behalf, and in the cause of justice, to tell
me what it is.""You are mistaken," was his dogged reply."I have reasons, perhaps, for
certain conclusions I may have drawn; but my conscience will not allow
me in cold blood to give utterance to suspicions which may not only
damage the reputation of an honest man, but place me in the unpleasant
position of an accuser without substantial foundation for my
accusations.""You occupy that position already," I retorted, with equal coldness."Nothing can make me forget that in my presence you have denounced Henry
Clavering as the murderer of Mr.You had better explain
yourself, Mr.He gave me a short look, but moved around and took the chair."You have
me at a disadvantage," he said, in a lighter tone."If you choose to
profit by your position, and press me to disclose the little I know, I
can only regret the necessity under which I lie, and speak.""Then you are deterred by conscientious scruples alone?""Yes, and by the meagreness of the facts at my command.""I will judge of the facts when I have heard them."He raised his eyes to mine, and I was astonished to observe a strange
eagerness in their depths; evidently his convictions were stronger
than his scruples.Raymond," he began, "you are a lawyer, and
undoubtedly a practical man; but you may know what it is to scent danger
before you see it, to feel influences working in the air over and
about you, and yet be in ignorance of what it is that affects you so
powerfully, till chance reveals that an enemy has been at your side, or
a friend passed your window, or the shadow of death crossed your book as
you read, or mingled with your breath as you slept?"I shook my head, fascinated by the intensity of his gaze into some sort
of response."Then you cannot understand me, or what I have suffered these last three
weeks."And he drew back with an icy reserve that seemed to promise but
little to my now thoroughly awakened curiosity."I beg your pardon," I hastened to say; "but the fact of my never having
experienced such sensations does not hinder me from comprehending the
emotions of others more affected by spiritual influences than myself.""Then you will not ridicule me if I say
that upon the eve of Mr.Leavenworth's murder I experienced in a dream
all that afterwards occurred; saw him murdered, saw"--and he clasped
his hands before him, in an attitude inexpressibly convincing, while his
voice sank to a horrified whisper, "saw the face of his murderer!"I started, looked at him in amazement, a thrill as at a ghostly presence
running through me."My reason for denouncing the man I beheld before me in the hall of
Miss Leavenworth's house last night?And, taking out his
handkerchief, he wiped his forehead, on which the perspiration was
standing in large drops."You would then intimate that the face you saw in your dream and the
face you saw in the hall last night were the same?"I had gone to bed
feeling especially contented with myself and the world at large; for,
though my life is anything but a happy one," and he heaved a short sigh,
"some pleasant words had been said to me that day, and I was revelling
in the happiness they conferred, when suddenly a chill struck my heart,
and the darkness which a moment before had appeared to me as the abode
of peace thrilled to the sound of a supernatural cry, and I heard my
name, 'Trueman, Trueman, Trueman,' repeated three times in a voice I did
not recognize, and starting from my pillow beheld at my bedside a woman.Her face was strange to me," he solemnly proceeded, "but I can give you
each and every detail of it, as, bending above me, she stared into my
eyes with a growing terror that seemed to implore help, though her lips
were quiet, and only the memory of that cry echoed in my ears.""Describe the face," I interposed."It was a round, fair, lady's face.Very lovely in contour, but devoid
of coloring; not beautiful, but winning from its childlike look of
trust.The hair, banded upon the low, broad forehead, was brown; the
eyes, which were very far apart, gray; the mouth, which was its most
charming feature, delicate of make and very expressive.There was
a dimple in the chin, but none in the cheeks.It was a face to be
remembered.""Meeting the gaze of those imploring eyes, I started up.Instantly the
face and all vanished, and I became conscious, as we sometimes do in
dreams, of a certain movement in the hall below, and the next instant
the gliding figure of a man of imposing size entered the library.I remember experiencing a certain thrill at this, half terror, half
curiosity, though I seemed to know, as if by intuition, what he was
going to do.Strange to say, I now seemed to change my personality,
and to be no longer a third party watching these proceedings, but Mr.Leavenworth himself, sitting at his library table and feeling his doom
crawling upon him without capacity for speech or power of movement to
avert it.Though my back was towards the man, I could feel his stealthy
form traverse the passage, enter the room beyond, pass to that stand
where the pistol was, try the drawer, find it locked, turn the key,
procure the pistol, weigh it in an accustomed hand, and advance again.I could feel each footstep he took as though his feet were in truth upon
my heart, and I remember staring at the table before me as if I expected
every moment to see it run with my own blood.I can see now how the
letters I had been writing danced upon the paper before me, appearing
to my eyes to take the phantom shapes of persons and things long ago
forgotten; crowding my last moments with regrets and dead shames, wild
longings, and unspeakable agonies, through all of which that face, the
face of my former dream, mingled, pale, sweet, and searching, while
closer and closer behind me crept that noiseless foot till I could
feel the glaring of the assassin's eyes across the narrow threshold
separating me from death and hear the click of his teeth as he set his
lips for the final act.and the secretary's livid face showed the
touch of awful horror, "what words can describe such an experience as
that?In one moment, all the agonies of hell in the heart and brain,
the next a blank through which I seemed to see afar, and as if suddenly
removed from all this, a crouching figure looking at its work with
starting eyes and pallid back-drawn lips; and seeing, recognize no face
that I had ever known, but one so handsome, so remarkable, so unique in
its formation and character, that it would be as easy for me to mistake
the countenance of my father as the look and figure of the man revealed
to me in my dream."said I, in a voice I failed to recognize as my own."Was that of him whom we saw leave Mary Leavenworth's presence last
night and go down the hall to the front door."A PREJUDICE


    "True, I talk of dreams,
     Which are the children of an idle brain
     Begot of nothing but vain phantasy."FOR one moment I sat a prey to superstitious horror; then, my natural
incredulity asserting itself, I looked up and remarked:

"You say that all this took place the night previous to the actual
occurrence?""But you did not seem to take it as such?""No; I am subject to horrible dreams.I thought but little of it in a
superstitious way till I looked next day upon Mr."I do not wonder you behaved strangely at the inquest.""Ah, sir," he returned, with a slow, sad smile; "no one knows what
I suffered in my endeavors not to tell more than I actually knew,
irrespective of my dream, of this murder and the manner of its
accomplishment.""You believe, then, that your dream foreshadowed the manner of the
murder as well as the fact?""It is a pity it did not go a little further, then, and tell us how
the assassin escaped from, if not how he entered, a house so securely
fastened.""That would have been convenient," he repeated."Also, if I had been informed where Hannah was, and why a stranger and a
gentleman should have stooped to the committal of such a crime."Seeing that he was nettled, I dropped my bantering vein.I asked; "are you so well acquainted with all who visit
that house as to be able to say who are and who are not strangers to the
family?"I am well acquainted with the faces of their friends, and Henry
Clavering is not amongst the number; but----"

"Were you ever with Mr.Leavenworth," I interrupted, "when he has been
away from home; in the country, for instance, or upon his travels?""Yet I suppose he was in the habit of absenting himself from home?""Can you tell me where he was last July, he and the ladies?""Yes, sir; they went to R----.Ah,"
he cried, seeing a change in my face, "do you think he could have met
them there?"I looked at him for a moment, then, rising in my turn, stood level with
him, and exclaimed:

"You are keeping something back, Mr.Harwell; you have more knowledge of
this man than you have hitherto given me to understand.He seemed astonished at my penetration, but replied: "I know no more
of the man than I have already informed you; but"--and a burning flush
crossed his face, "if you are determined to pursue this matter--" and he
paused, with an inquiring look."I am resolved to find out all I can about Henry Clavering," was my
decided answer."Then," said he, "I can tell you this much.Henry Clavering wrote a
letter to Mr.Leavenworth a few days before the murder, which I have
some reason to believe produced a marked effect upon the household."And, folding his arms, the secretary stood quietly awaiting my next
question.Leavenworth's
business letters, and this, being from one unaccustomed to write to him,
lacked the mark which usually distinguished those of a private nature.""And you saw the name of Clavering?""I did; Henry Ritchie Clavering."Harwell," I reiterated, "this is no time for false delicacy."I did; but hastily, and with an agitated conscience.""You can, however, recall its general drift?""It was some complaint in regard to the treatment received by him at the
hand of one of Mr."But you inferred----"

"No, sir; that is just what I did not do.I forced myself to forget the
whole thing.""And yet you say it produced an effect upon the family?"None of them have ever appeared quite the
same as before."Harwell," I gravely continued; "when you were questioned as to the
receipt of any letter by Mr.Leavenworth, which might seem in any manner
to be connected with this tragedy, you denied having seen any such; how
was that?"Raymond, you are a gentleman; have a chivalrous regard for the
ladies; do you think you could have brought yourself (even if in your
secret heart you considered some such result possible, which I am not
ready to say I did) to mention, at such a time as that, the receipt of
a letter complaining of the treatment received from one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces, as a suspicious circumstance worthy to be taken
into account by a coroner's jury?""What reason had I for thinking that letter was one of importance?I
knew of no Henry Ritchie Clavering.""And yet you seemed to think it was."It is true; but not as I should hesitate now, if the question were put
to me again."Silence followed these words, during which I took two or three turns up
and down the room."This is all very fanciful," I remarked, laughing in the vain endeavor
to throw off the superstitious horror his words had awakened."I am practical myself
in broad daylight, and recognize the flimsiness of an accusation based
upon a poor, hardworking secretary's dream, as plainly as you do.This
is the reason I desired to keep from speaking at all; but, Mr.Raymond,"
and his long, thin hand fell upon my arm with a nervous intensity which
gave me almost the sensation of an electrical shock, "if the murderer of
Mr.Leavenworth is ever brought to confess his deed, mark my words, he
will prove to be the man of my dream."For a moment his belief was mine; and a mingled
sensation of relief and exquisite pain swept over me as I thought of the
possibility of Eleanore being exonerated from crime only to be plunged
into fresh humiliation and deeper abysses of suffering."He stalks the streets in freedom now," the secretary went on, as if to
himself; "even dares to enter the house he has so wofully desecrated;
but justice is justice and, sooner or later, something will transpire
which will prove to you that a premonition so wonderful as that
I received had its significance; that the voice calling 'Trueman,
Trueman,' was something more than the empty utterances of an excited
brain; that it was Justice itself, calling attention to the guilty."Did he know that the officers of justice were
already upon the track of this same Clavering?I judged not from his
look, but felt an inclination to make an effort and see."You speak with strange conviction," I said; "but in all probability
you are doomed to be disappointed."I do not propose to denounce him;
I do not even propose to speak his name again.I have spoken thus plainly to you only in explanation of last
night's most unfortunate betrayal; and while I trust you will regard
what I have told you as confidential, I also hope you will give me
credit for behaving, on the whole, as well as could be expected under
the circumstances.""Certainly," I replied as I took it.Then, with a sudden impulse to
test the accuracy of this story of his, inquired if he had any means of
verifying his statement of having had this dream at the time spoken of:
that is, before the murder and not afterwards."No, sir; I know myself that I had it the night previous to that of Mr.Leavenworth's death; but I cannot prove the fact.""Did not speak of it next morning to any one?""O no, sir; I was scarcely in a position to do so.""Yet it must have had a great effect upon you, unfitting you for
work----"

"Nothing unfits me for work," was his bitter reply."I believe you," I returned, remembering his diligence for the last few
days."But you must at least have shown some traces of having passed an
uncomfortable night.Have you no recollection of any one speaking to you
in regard to your appearance the next morning?"Leavenworth may have done so; no one else would be likely to
notice."There was sadness in the tone, and my own voice softened as I
said:

"I shall not be at the house to-night, Mr.Harwell; nor do I know when
I shall return there.Personal considerations keep me from Miss
Leavenworth's presence for a time, and I look to you to carry on the
work we have undertaken without my assistance, unless you can bring it
here----"

"I can do that.""I shall expect you, then, to-morrow evening.""Very well, sir"; and he was going, when a sudden thought seemed to
strike him."Sir," he said, "as we do not wish to return to this subject
again, and as I have a natural curiosity in regard to this man, would
you object to telling me what you know of him?You believe him to be a
respectable man; are you acquainted with him, Mr."I know his name, and where he resides.""In London; he is an Englishman."he murmured, with a strange intonation.He bit his lip, looked down, then up, finally fixed his eyes on mine,
and returned, with marked emphasis: "I used an exclamation, sir, because
I was startled.""Yes; you say he is an Englishman.Leavenworth had the most bitter
antagonism to the English.He
would never be introduced to one if he could help it.""You know," continued the secretary, "that Mr.Leavenworth was a man who
carried his prejudices to the extreme.He had a hatred for the English
race amounting to mania.If he had known the letter I have mentioned was
from an Englishman, I doubt if he would have read it.He used to say he
would sooner see a daughter of his dead before him than married to an
Englishman."I turned hastily aside to hide the effect which this announcement made
upon me."You think I am exaggerating," he said."He had doubtless some cause for hating the English with which we are
unacquainted," pursued the secretary."He spent some time in Liverpool
when young, and had, of course, many opportunities for studying their
manners and character."And the secretary made another movement, as if
to leave.But it was my turn to detain him now.Do you
think that, in the case of one of his nieces, say, desiring to marry a
gentleman of that nationality, his prejudice was sufficient to cause him
to absolutely forbid the match?"I had learned what I wished, and saw no further reason for
prolonging the interview.PATCH-WORK


    "Come, give us a taste of your quality."Clavering in his conversation of
the morning had been giving me, with more or less accuracy, a
detailed account of his own experience and position regarding Eleanore
Leavenworth, I asked myself what particular facts it would be necessary
for me to establish in order to prove the truth of this assumption, and
found them to be:

I. That Mr.Clavering had not only been in this country at the time
designated, but that he had been located for some little time at a
watering-place in New York State.That this watering-place should correspond to the one in which Miss
Eleanore Leavenworth was staying at the same time.That they had been seen while there to hold more or less
communication.That they had both been absent from town, at Lorne one time, long
enough to have gone through the ceremony of marriage at a point twenty
miles or so away.V. That a Methodist clergyman, who has since died, lived at that time
within a radius of twenty miles of said watering-place.I next asked myself how I was to establish these acts.Clavering's
life was as yet too little known to me to offer me any assistance; so,
leaving it for the present, I took up the thread of Eleanore's history,
and found that at the time given me she had been in R----, a fashionable
watering-place in this State.Now, if his was true, and my theory
correct, he must have been there also.To prove this fact, became,
consequently, my first business.I resolved to go to R---- on the
morrow.But before proceeding in an undertaking of such importance, I considered
it expedient to make such inquiries and collect such facts as the few
hours I had left to work in rendered possible.I went first to the house
of Mr.I found him lying upon a hard sofa, in the bare sitting-room I have
before mentioned, suffering from a severe attack of rheumatism.His
hands were done up in bandages, and his feet incased in multiplied folds
of a dingy red shawl which looked as if it had been through the wars.Greeting me with a short nod that was both a welcome and an apology,
he devoted a few words to an explanation of his unwonted position; and
then, without further preliminaries, rushed into the subject which was
uppermost in both our minds by inquiring, in a slightly sarcastic way,
if I was very much surprised to find my bird flown when I returned to
the Hoffman House that afternoon."I was astonished to find you allowed him to fly at this time,"
I replied."From the manner in which you requested me to make his
acquaintance, I supposed you considered him an important character in
the tragedy which has just been enacted.""And what makes you think I don't?Oh, the fact that I let him go off
so easily?I never fiddle with the brakes till the
car starts down-hill.But let that pass for the present; Mr.Clavering,
then, did not explain himself before going?""That is a question which I find it exceedingly difficult to answer.Hampered by circumstances, I cannot at present speak with the directness
which is your due, but what I can say, I will.Know, then, that in my
opinion Mr.Clavering did explain himself in an interview with me this
morning.But it was done in so blind a way, it will be necessary for me
to make a few investigations before I shall feel sufficiently sure of
my ground to take you into my confidence.He has given me a possible
clue----"

"Wait," said Mr.Was it done intentionally
and with sinister motive, or unconsciously and in plain good faith?""It is very unfortunate you
cannot explain yourself a little more definitely," he said at last."I
am almost afraid to trust you to make investigations, as you call them,
on your own hook.You are not used to the business, and will lose time,
to say nothing of running upon false scents, and using up your strength
on unprofitable details.""You should have thought of that when you admitted me into partnership.""And you absolutely insist upon working this mine alone?"Clavering, for all I know,
is a gentleman of untarnished reputation.I am not even aware for what
purpose you set me upon his trail.I only know that in thus following
it I have come upon certain facts that seem worthy of further
investigation.""I know it, and for that reason I have come to you for such assistance
as you can give me at this stage of the proceedings.You are in
possession of certain facts relating to this man which it concerns me
to know, or your conduct in reference to him has been purposeless.Now,
frankly, will you make me master of those facts: in short, tell me all
you know of Mr.Clavering, without requiring an immediate return of
confidence on my part?""That is asking a great deal of a professional detective.""I know it, and under other circumstances I should hesitate long before
preferring such a request; but as things are, I don't see how I am to
proceed in the matter without some such concession on your part.At all
events----"

"Wait a moment!Clavering the lover of one of the young
ladies?"Anxious as I was to preserve the secret of my interest in that
gentleman, I could not prevent the blush from rising to my face at the
suddenness of this question."I thought as much," he went on."Being neither a relative nor
acknowledged friend, I took it for granted he must occupy some such
position as that in the family.""I do not see why you should draw such an inference," said I, anxious
to determine how much he knew about him.Clavering is a stranger in
town; has not even been in this country long; has indeed had no time to
establish himself upon any such footing as you suggest."He was
here a year ago to my certain knowledge."Can it be possible I am groping blindly
about for facts which are already in your possession?I pray you listen
to my entreaties, Mr.Gryce, and acquaint me at once with what I want to
know.If I succeed, the glory shall be yours; it I fail, the shame of the
defeat shall be mine.""My reward will be to free an innocent woman from the imputation of
crime which hangs over her."His voice and appearance changed;
for a moment he looked quite confidential."Well, well," said he; "and
what is it you want to know?""I should first like to know how your suspicions came to light on him
at all.What reason had you for thinking a gentleman of his bearing and
position was in any way connected with this affair?""That is a question you ought not to be obliged to put," he returned."Simply because the opportunity of answering it was in your hands before
ever it came into mine.""Don't you remember the letter mailed in your presence by Miss Mary
Leavenworth during your drive from her home to that of her friend in
Thirty-seventh Street?""Certainly, but----"

"You never thought to look at its superscription before it was dropped
into the box.""I had neither opportunity nor right to do so.""And you never regarded the affair as worth your attention?""However I may have regarded it, I did not see how I could prevent Miss
Leavenworth from dropping a letter into a box if she chose to do so.""That is because you are a _gentleman._ Well, it has its disadvantages,"
he muttered broodingly."But you," said I; "how came you to know anything about this letter?Ah, I see," remembering that the carriage in which we were riding at the
time had been procured for us by him."The man on the box was in your
pay, and informed, as you call it."Gryce winked at his muffled toes mysteriously."That is not the
point," he said."Enough that I heard that a letter, which might
reasonably prove to be of some interest to me, had been dropped at such
an hour into the box on the corner of a certain street.That, coinciding
in the opinion of my informant, I telegraphed to the station connected
with that box to take note of the address of a suspicious-looking letter
about to pass through their hands on the way to the General Post Office,
and following up the telegram in person, found that a curious epistle
addressed in lead pencil and sealed with a stamp, had just arrived, the
address of which I was allowed to see----"

"And which was?""Henry R. Clavering, Hoffman House, New York.""And so that is how your attention first came to
be directed to this man?""Why, next I followed up the clue by going to the Hoffman House and
instituting inquiries.Clavering was a regular guest
of the hotel.That he had come there, direct from the Liverpool
steamer, about three months since, and, registering his name as Henry
R. Clavering, Esq., London, had engaged a first-class room which he had
kept ever since.That, although nothing definite was known concerning
him, he had been seen with various highly respectable people, both of
his own nation and ours, by all of whom he was treated with respect.And
lastly, that while not liberal, he had given many evidences of being a
man of means.So much done, I entered the office, and waited for him to
come in, in the hope of having an opportunity to observe his manner when
the clerk handed him that strange-looking letter from Mary Leavenworth.""No; an awkward gawk of a fellow stepped between us just at the critical
moment, and shut off my view.But I heard enough that evening from the
clerk and servants, of the agitation he had shown on receiving it, to
convince me I was upon a trail worth following.I accordingly put on
my men, and for two days Mr.Clavering was subjected to the most
rigid watch a man ever walked under.But nothing was gained by it; his
interest in the murder, if interest at all, was a secret one; and though
he walked the streets, studied the papers, and haunted the vicinity
of the house in Fifth Avenue, he not only refrained from actually
approaching it, but made no attempt to communicate with any of the
family.Meanwhile, you crossed my path, and with your determination
incited me to renewed effort.Clavering's bearing,
and the gossip I had by this time gathered in regard to him, that no one
short of a gentleman and a friend could succeed in getting at the clue
of his connection with this family, I handed him over to you, and----"

"Found me rather an unmanageable colleague."Gryce smiled very much as if a sour plum had been put in his mouth,
but made no reply; and a momentary pause ensued."Did you think to inquire," I asked at last, "if any one knew where Mr.Clavering had spent the evening of the murder?"It was agreed he went out during the
evening; also that he was in his bed in the morning when the servant
came in to make his fire; but further than this no one seemed posted.""So that, in fact, you gleaned nothing that would in any way connect
this man with the murder except his marked and agitated interest in it,
and the fact that a niece of the murdered man had written a letter to
him?""Another question; did you hear in what manner and at what time he
procured a newspaper that evening?""No; I only learned that he was observed, by more than one, to hasten
out of the dining-room with the _Post_ in his hand, and go immediately
to his room without touching his dinner."that does not look---"

"If Mr.Clavering had had a guilty knowledge of the crime, he would
either have ordered dinner before opening the paper, or, having ordered
it, he would have eaten it.""Then you do not believe, from what you have learned, that Mr.Gryce shifted uneasily, glanced at the papers protruding from my
coat pocket and exclaimed: "I am ready to be convinced by you that he
is."That sentence recalled me to the business in hand.Without appearing to
notice his look, I recurred to my questions.Did you learn that, too, at the Hoffman House?""No; I ascertained that in quite another way.In short, I have had a
communication from London in regard to the matter."Yes; I've a friend there in my own line of business, who sometimes
assists me with a bit of information, when requested."You have not had time to write to London, and receive an
answer since the murder."It is enough for me to telegraph him the
name of a person, for him to understand that I want to know everything
he can gather in a reasonable length of time about that person.""It is not there," he said; "if you will be kind enough to feel in my
breast pocket you will find a letter----"

It was in my hand before he finished his sentence."Excuse my
eagerness," I said."This kind of business is new to me, you know."He smiled indulgently at a very old and faded picture hanging on the
wall before him."Eagerness is not a fault; only the betrayal of it.Let us hear what my friend Brown has to
tell us of Mr.Henry Ritchie Clavering, of Portland Place, London."I took the paper to the light and read as follows:


    "Henry Ritchie Clavering, Gentleman, aged 43.Born in

    ----, Hertfordshire, England.Clavering, for
    short time in the army.Mother was Helen Ritchie, of Dumfriesshire,
    Scotland; she is still living.Home with H. R. C., in Portland Place,
    London.H. R. C. is a bachelor, 6 ft.high, squarely built, weight
    about 12 stone.Eyes dark brown;
    nose straight.Called a handsome man; walks erect and rapidly.In
    society is considered a good fellow; rather a favorite, especially with
    ladies.Is liberal, not extravagant; reported to be worth about
    5000 pounds per year, and appearances give color to this statement.Property consists of a small estate in Hertfordshire, and some funds,
    amount not known.Since writing this much, a correspondent sends the
    following in regard to his history.In '46 went from uncle's house to
    Eton.From Eton went to Oxford, graduating in '56.In
    1855 his uncle died, and his father succeeded to the estates.Father
    died in '57 by a fall from his horse or a similar accident.Within a
    very short time H. R. C. took his mother to London, to the residence
    named, where they have lived to the present time."Travelled considerably in 1860; part of the time was with
    ----, of Munich; also in party of Vandervorts from New York; went
    as far east as Cairo.Went to America in 1875 alone, but at end of
    three months returned on account of mother's illness.Nothing is known
    of his movements while in America."From servants learn that he was always a favorite from a boy.More
    recently has become somewhat taciturn.Toward last of his stay watched
    the post carefully, especially foreign ones.Posted scarcely anything
    but newspapers.Have seen, from waste-paper
    basket, torn envelope directed to Amy Belden, no address.American
    correspondents mostly in Boston; two in New York.Names not known, but
    supposed to be bankers.Brought home considerable luggage, and fitted
    up part of house, as for a lady.Left
    for America two months since.Has been, I understand, travelling in the
    south.Has telegraphed twice to Portland Place.His friends hear from
    him but rarely.Letters rec'd recently, posted in New York.One by last
    steamer posted in F----, N. Y.In the country, ---- of ---- has
    charge of the property.F----, N. Y., was a small town near R----."Your friend is a trump," I declared."He tells me just what I wanted
most to know."And, taking out my book, I made memoranda of the facts
which had most forcibly struck me during my perusal of the communication
before me."With the aid of what he tells me, I shall ferret out the
mystery of Henry Clavering in a week; see if I do not."Gryce, "may I expect to be allowed to take
a hand in the game?""As soon as I am reasonably assured I am upon the right tack.""And what will it take to assure you of that?""Not much; a certain point settled, and----"

"Hold on; who knows but what I can do that for you?"And, looking
towards the desk which stood in the corner, Mr.Gryce asked me if I
would be kind enough to open the top drawer and bring him the bits of
partly-burned paper I would find there.Hastily complying, I brought three or four strips of ragged paper, and
laid them on the table at his side."Another result of Fobbs' researches under the coal on the first day of
the inquest," Mr."You thought the key was
all he found.A second turning over of the coal brought
these to light, and very interesting they are, too."I immediately bent over the torn and discolored scraps with great
anxiety.They were four in number, and appeared at first glance to be
the mere remnants of a sheet of common writing-paper, torn lengthwise
into strips, and twisted up into lighters; but, upon closer inspection,
they showed traces of writing upon one side, and, what was more
important still, the presence of one or more drops of spattered blood.This latter discovery was horrible to me, and so overcame me for the
moment that I put the scraps down, and, turning towards Mr.Gryce,
inquired:

"What do you make of them?""That is just the question I was going to put to you."Swallowing my disgust, I took them up again."They look like the
remnants of some old letter," said I."A letter which, from the drop of blood observable on the written side,
must have been lying face up on Mr.Leavenworth's table at the time of
the murder--"

"Just so.""And from the uniformity in width of each of these pieces, as well as
their tendency to curl up when left alone, must first have been torn
into even strips, and then severally rolled up, before being tossed into
the grate where they were afterwards found.""The writing, so far as discernible, is that of a cultivated gentleman.Leavenworth; for I have studied his chirography
too much lately not to know it at a glance; but it may be--Hold!"I
suddenly exclaimed, "have you any mucilage handy?I think, if I could
paste these strips down upon a piece of paper, so that they would
remain flat, I should be able to tell you what I think of them much more
easily.""There is mucilage on the desk," signified Mr.Procuring it, I proceeded to consult the scraps once more for evidence
to guide me in their arrangement.These were more marked than I
expected; the longer and best preserved strip, with its "Mr.Hor" at
the top, showing itself at first blush to be the left-hand margin of
the letter, while the machine-cut edge of the next in length presented
tokens fully as conclusive of its being the right-hand margin of the
same.Selecting these, then, I pasted them down on a piece of paper at
just the distance they would occupy if the sheet from which they were
torn was of the ordinary commercial note size.Immediately it became
apparent: first, that it would take two other strips of the same width
to fill up the space left between them; and secondly, that the writing
did not terminate at the foot of the sheet, but was carried on to
another page.Taking up the third strip, I looked at its edge; it was machine-cut
at the top, and showed by the arrangement of its words that it was
the margin strip of a second leaf.Pasting that down by itself, I
scrutinized the fourth, and finding it also machine-cut at the top but
not on the side, endeavored to fit it to the piece already pasted down,
but the words would not match.Moving it along to the position it
would hold if it were the third strip, I fastened it down; the whole
presenting, when completed, the appearance seen on the opposite page.Then, as I held it up
before his eyes: "But don't show it to me.Study it yourself, and tell
me what you think of it.""Well," said I, "this much is certain: that it is a letter directed to
Mr.Leavenworth from some House, and dated--let's see; that is an _h,_
isn't it?"And I pointed to the one letter just discernible on the line
under the word House."I should think so; but don't ask me.""It must be an _h._ The year is 1875, and this is not the termination
of either January or February.Dated, then, March 1st, 1876, and
signed----"

Mr.Gryce rolled his eyes in anticipatory ecstasy towards the ceiling."By Henry Clavering," I announced without hesitation.Gryce's eyes returned to his swathed finger-ends."Wait a moment, and I'll show you"; and, taking out of my pocket the
card which Mr.Clavering had handed me as an introduction at our late
interview, I laid it underneath the last line of writing on the second
page.Henry Ritchie Clavering on the card;
H----chie--in the same handwriting on the letter."Clavering it is," said he, "without a doubt."But I saw he was not
surprised."And now," I continued, "for its general tenor and meaning."And,
commencing at the beginning, I read aloud the words as they came, with
pauses at the breaks, something as follows: "Mr.Hor--Dear--a niece whom
yo--one too who see--the love and trus--any other man ca--autiful, so
char----s she in face fo----conversation.ery rose has its----rose is no
exception------ely as she is, char----tender as she is,
s----------pable of tramplin------one who trusted----heart------------.-------------------- him to----he owes a----honor----ance."If------t believe ---- her to----cruel----face,---- what is----ble
serv----yours

"H------tchie"

"It reads like a complaint against one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces," I
said, and started at my own words."Why," said I, "the fact is I have heard this very letter spoken of.It _is_ a complaint against one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces, and was
written by Mr.Harwell's communication
in regard to the matter.I thought he had
forsworn gossip."Harwell and I have seen each other almost daily for the last two
weeks," I replied."It would be strange if he had nothing to tell me.""And he says he has read a letter written to Mr."Yes; but the particular words of which he has now forgotten.""These few here may assist him in recalling the rest.""I would rather not admit him to a knowledge of the existence of
this piece of evidence.I don't believe in letting any one into our
confidence whom we can conscientiously keep out.""I see you don't," dryly responded Mr.Not appearing to notice the fling conveyed by these words, I took up the
letter once more, and began pointing out such half-formed words in it
as I thought we might venture to complete, as the Hor--, yo--,
see--utiful----, har----, for----, tramplin----, pable----, serv----.This done, I next proposed the introduction of such others as seemed
necessary to the sense, as _Leavenworth_ after _Horatio; Sir_ after
_Dear; have_ with a possible _you_ before _a niece; thorn_ after _its_
in the phrase _rose has its; on after trampling; whom_ after _to;
debt after a; you_ after _If; me ask_ after _believe; beautiful_ after
_cruel._

Between the columns of words thus furnished I interposed a phrase or
two, here and there, the whole reading upon its completion as follows:

"------------ House."Horatio Leavenworth; Dear Sir:_

"(You) have a niece whom you    one too who seems    worthy    the love
and trust     of any other man ca    so    beautiful, so charming    is
she in face form and    conversation.But every rose has its thorn
and (this) rose is no exception    lovely as she is, charming (as she
is,) tender as she is, she    is    capable of trampling on     one who
trusted her heart a

him to whom she owes a debt of honor a    ance

"If you don't believe me ask her to    her    cruel beautiful face   
what is (her) humble servant yours:

"Henry Ritchie Clavering.""I think that will do," said Mr."Its general tenor is evident,
and that is all we want at this time.""The whole tone of it is anything but complimentary to the lady it
mentions," I remarked."He must have had, or imagined he had, some
desperate grievance, to provoke him to the use of such plain language in
regard to one he can still characterize as tender, charming, beautiful.""Grievances are apt to lie back of mysterious crimes.""I think I know what this one was," I said; "but"--seeing him look
up--"must decline to communicate my suspicion to you for the present.My
theory stands unshaken, and in some degree confirmed; and that is all I
can say.""Then this letter does not supply the link you wanted?""No: it is a valuable bit of evidence; but it is not the link I am in
search of just now.""Yet it must be an important clue, or Eleanore Leavenworth would not
have been to such pains, first to take it in the way she did from her
uncle's table, and secondly----"

"Wait!what makes you think this is the paper she took, or was believed
to have taken, from Mr.Leavenworth's table on that fatal morning?""Why, the fact that it was found together with the key, which we know
she dropped into the grate, and that there are drops of blood on it.""Because I am not satisfied with your reason for believing this to be
the paper taken by her from Mr."Well, first, because Fobbs does not speak of seeing any paper in her
hand, when she bent over the fire; leaving us to conclude that these
pieces were in the scuttle of coal she threw upon it; which surely you
must acknowledge to be a strange place for her to have put a paper she
took such pains to gain possession of; and, secondly, for the reason
that these scraps were twisted as if they had been used for curl papers,
or something of that kind; a fact hard to explain by your hypothesis."The detective's eye stole in the direction of my necktie, which was as
near as he ever came to a face."You are a bright one," said he; "a very
bright one.A little surprised, and not altogether pleased with this unexpected
compliment, I regarded him doubtfully for a moment and then asked:

"What is your opinion upon the matter?""Oh, you know I have no opinion.I gave up everything of that kind when
I put the affair into your hands.""Still----"

"That the letter of which these scraps are the remnant was on Mr.Leavenworth's table at the time of the murder is believed.That upon the
body being removed, a paper was taken from the table by Miss Eleanore
Leavenworth, is also believed.That, when she found her action had been
noticed, and attention called to this paper and the key, she resorted to
subterfuge in order to escape the vigilance of the watch that had been
set over her, and, partially succeeding in her endeavor, flung the key
into the fire from which these same scraps were afterwards recovered, is
also known."Very well, then," said I, rising; "we will let conclusions go for the
present.My mind must be satisfied in regard to the truth or falsity of
a certain theory of mine, for my judgment to be worth much on this or
any other matter connected with the affair."And, only waiting to get the address of his subordinate P., in case
I should need assistance in my investigations, I left Mr.Gryce, and
proceeded immediately to the house of Mr.THE STORY OF A CHARMING WOMAN


    "Fe, fi, fo, fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.""I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted.""YOU have never heard, then, the particulars of Mr.I had been asking him to explain to me Mr.Leavenworth's well-known antipathy to the English race."If you had, you would not need to come to me for this explanation.But
it is not strange you are ignorant of the matter.I doubt if there
are half a dozen persons in existence who could tell you where Horatio
Leavenworth found the lovely woman who afterwards became his wife,
much less give you any details of the circumstances which led to his
marriage.""I am very fortunate, then, in being in the confidence of one who can."It will aid you but little to hear.Horatio Leavenworth, when a young
man, was very ambitious; so much so, that at one time he aspired to
marry a wealthy lady of Providence.But, chancing to go to England, he
there met a young woman whose grace and charm had such an effect upon
him that he relinquished all thought of the Providence lady, though it
was some time before he could face the prospect of marrying the one
who had so greatly interested him; as she was not only in humble
circumstances, but was encumbered with a child concerning whose
parentage the neighbors professed ignorance, and she had nothing to
say.But, as is very apt to be the case in an affair like this, love and
admiration soon got the better of worldly wisdom.Taking his future
in his hands, he offered himself as her husband, when she immediately
proved herself worthy of his regard by entering at once into those
explanations he was too much of a gentleman to demand.She proved to be an American by birth,
her father having been a well-known merchant of Chicago.While he lived,
her home was one of luxury, but just as she was emerging into womanhood
he died.It was at his funeral she met the man destined to be her ruin.How he came there she never knew; he was not a friend of her father's.It is enough he was there, and saw her, and that in three weeks--don't
shudder, she was such a child--they were married.In twenty-four hours
she knew what that word meant for her; it meant blows.Everett, I am
telling no fanciful story.In twenty-four hours after that girl was
married, her husband, coming drunk into the house, found her in his way,
and knocked her down.Her father's estate, on
being settled up, proving to be less than expected, he carried her off
to England, where he did not wait to be drunk in order to maltreat her.She was not free from his cruelty night or day.Before she was sixteen,
she had run the whole gamut of human suffering; and that, not at the
hands of a coarse, common ruffian, but from an elegant, handsome,
luxury-loving gentleman, whose taste in dress was so nice he would
sooner fling a garment of hers into the fire than see her go into
company clad in a manner he did not consider becoming.She bore it till
her child was born, then she fled.Two days after the little one saw the
light, she rose from her bed and, taking her baby in her arms, ran out
of the house.The few jewels she had put into her pocket supported her
till she could set up a little shop.As for her husband, she neither saw
him, nor heard from him, from the day she left him till about two weeks
before Horatio Leavenworth first met her, when she learned from the
papers that he was dead.She was, therefore, free; but though she loved
Horatio Leavenworth with all her heart, she would not marry him.She
felt herself forever stained and soiled by the one awful year of abuse
and contamination.Not till the death of her
child, a month or so after his proposal, did she consent to give him her
hand and what remained of her unhappy life.He brought her to New York,
surrounded her with luxury and every tender care, but the arrow had gone
too deep; two years from the day her child breathed its last, she too
died.It was the blow of his life to Horatio Leavenworth; he was never
the same man again.Though Mary and Eleanore shortly after entered his
home, he never recovered his old light-heartedness.Money became his
idol, and the ambition to make and leave a great fortune behind him
modified all his views of life.But one proof remained that he never
forgot the wife of his youth, and that was, he could not bear to have
the word 'Englishman' uttered in his hearing."Veeley paused, and I rose to go.He seemed a little astonished at my request, but immediately replied:
"She was a very pale woman; not strictly beautiful, but of a contour and
expression of great charm.Her hair was brown, her eyes gray--"

"And very wide apart?"On my way downstairs, I bethought me of a letter which I had in my
pocket for Mr.Veeley's son Fred, and, knowing of no surer way of
getting it to him that night than by leaving it on the library table, I
stepped to the door of that room, which in this house was at the rear
of the parlors, and receiving no reply to my knock, opened it and looked
in.The room was unlighted, but a cheerful fire was burning in the grate,
and by its glow I espied a lady crouching on the hearth, whom at first
glance I took for Mrs.But, upon advancing and addressing her by
that name, I saw my mistake; for the person before me not only refrained
from replying, but, rising at the sound of my voice, revealed a form
of such noble proportions that all possibility of its being that of the
dainty little wife of my partner fled."I see I have made a mistake," said I."I beg your pardon"; and would
have left the room, but something in the general attitude of the lady
before me restrained me, and, believing it to be Mary Leavenworth, I
inquired:

"Can it be this is Miss Leavenworth?"The noble figure appeared to droop, the gently lifted head to fall, and
for a moment I doubted if I had been correct in my supposition.Then
form and head slowly erected themselves, a soft voice spoke, and I heard
a low "yes," and hurriedly advancing, confronted--not Mary, with her
glancing, feverish gaze, and scarlet, trembling lips--but Eleanore, the
woman whose faintest look had moved me from the first, the woman whose
husband I believed myself to be even then pursuing to his doom!The surprise was too great; I could neither sustain nor conceal it.Stumbling slowly back, I murmured something about having believed it
to be her cousin; and then, conscious only of the one wish to fly a
presence I dared not encounter in my present mood, turned, when her
rich, heart-full voice rose once more and I heard:

"You will not leave me without a word, Mr.Raymond, now that chance has
thrown us together?"Then, as I came slowly forward: "Were you so very
much astonished to find me here?""I do not know--I did not expect--" was my incoherent reply."I had
heard you were ill; that you went nowhere; that you had no wish to see
your friends.""I have been ill," she said; "but I am better now, and have come to
spend the night with Mrs.Veeley, because I could not endure the stare
of the four walls of my room any longer."This was said without any effort at plaintiveness, but rather as if she
thought it necessary to excuse herself for being where she was."I am glad you did so," said I."You ought to be here all the while.That dreary, lonesome boarding-house is no place for you, Miss
Leavenworth.It distresses us all to feel that you are exiling yourself
at this time.""I do not wish anybody to be distressed," she returned."It is best for
me to be where I am.There is a child there
whose innocent eyes see nothing but innocence in mine.Do not let my friends be anxious; I can bear it."Then, in
a lower tone: "There is but one thing which really unnerves me; and
that is my ignorance of what is going on at home.Sorrow I can bear, but
suspense is killing me.Will you not tell me something of Mary and home?Veeley; she is kind, but has no real knowledge of Mary
or me, nor does she know anything of our estrangement.She thinks me
obstinate, and blames me for leaving my cousin in her trouble.But you
know I could not help it.You know,--" her voice wavered off into a
tremble, and she did not conclude."I cannot tell you much," I hastened to reply; "but whatever knowledge
is at my command is certainly yours.Is there anything in particular you
wish to know?""Yes, how Mary is; whether she is well, and--and composed.""Your cousin's health is good," I returned; "but I fear I cannot say she
is composed.Harwell in preparing your uncle's book for the
press, and necessarily am there much of the time."The words came in a tone of low horror.It has been thought best to bring it before the
world, and----"

"And Mary has set you at the task?"It seemed as if she could not escape from the horror which this caused."She considers herself as fulfilling her uncle's wishes.He was very
anxious, as you know, to have the book out by July."she broke in, "I cannot bear it."Then, as if she
feared she had hurt my feelings by her abruptness, lowered her voice and
said: "I do not, however, know of any one I should be better pleased to
have charged with the task than yourself.With you it will be a work of
respect and reverence; but a stranger--Oh, I could not have endured a
stranger touching it."She was fast falling into her old horror; but rousing herself, murmured:
"I wanted to ask you something; ah, I know"--and she moved so as to
face me."I wish to inquire if everything is as before in the house; the
servants the same and--and other things?"Darrell there; I do not know of any other change."Darrell to help her bear
her loneliness?"I knew what was coming, and strove to preserve my composure."Yes," I replied; "a few."How low her tones were, but how distinct!Gilbert, Miss Martin, and a--a----"

"Go on," she whispered."A gentleman by the name of Clavering.""You speak that name with evident embarrassment," she said, after a
moment of intense anxiety on my part.Astounded, I raised my eyes to her face.It was very pale, and wore
the old look of self-repressed calm I remembered so well.because there are some circumstances surrounding him which have
struck me as peculiar."To-day it is Clavering; a short time ago it
was----"

"Go on."Her dress rustled on the hearth; there was a sound of desolation in it;
but her voice when she spoke was expressionless as that of an automaton."How many times has this person, of whose name you do not appear to be
certain, been to see Mary?""And do you think he will come again?"A short silence followed this, I felt her eyes searching my face, but
doubt whether, if I had known she held a loaded pistol, I could have
looked up at that moment.Raymond," she at length observed, in a changed tone, "the last time
I saw you, you told me you were going to make some endeavor to restore
me to my former position before the world.I did not wish you to do so
then; nor do I wish you to do so now.Can you not make me comparatively
happy, then, by assuring me you have abandoned or will abandon a project
so hopeless?""It is impossible," I replied with emphasis.Much
as I grieve to be a source of sorrow to you, it is best you should know
that I can never give up the hope of righting you while I live."She put out her hand in a sort of hopeless appeal inexpressibly touching
to behold in the fast waning firelight."I should never be able to face the world or my own conscience if,
through any weakness of my own, I should miss the blessed privilege
of setting the wrong right, and saving a noble woman from unmerited
disgrace."And then, seeing she was not likely to reply to this, drew a
step nearer and said: "Is there not some little kindness I can show you,
Miss Leavenworth?Is there no message you would like taken, or act it
would give you pleasure to see performed?""No," said she; "I have only one request to make,
and that you refuse to grant.""For the most unselfish of reasons," I urged."You think so"; then, before I could reply,
"I could desire one little favor shown me, however.""That if anything should transpire; if Hannah should be found, or--or my
presence required in any way,--you will not keep me in ignorance.That
you will let me know the worst when it comes, without fail."Veeley is coming back, and you would scarcely
wish to be found here by her.""No," said I.

And yet I did not go, but stood watching the firelight flicker on her
black dress till the thought of Clavering and the duty I had for the
morrow struck coldly to my heart, and I turned away towards the
door.But at the threshold I paused again, and looked back.Oh, the
flickering, dying fire flame!Oh, the crowding, clustering shadows!Oh, that drooping figure in their midst, with its clasped hands and its
hidden face!I see it all again; I see it as in a dream; then darkness
falls, and in the glare of gas-lighted streets, I am hastening along,
solitary and sad, to my lonely home.A REPORT FOLLOWED BY SMOKE


    "Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
    Where most it promises; and oft it hits
    Where Hope is coldest, and Despair most sits."Gryce I only waited for the determination of one fact,
to feel justified in throwing the case unreservedly into his hands,
I alluded to the proving or disproving of the supposition that Henry
Clavering had been a guest at the same watering-place with Eleanore
Leavenworth the summer before.When, therefore, I found myself the next morning with the Visitor Book
of the Hotel Union at R---- in my hands, it was only by the strongest
effort of will I could restrain my impatience.Almost immediately I encountered his name, written not half
a page below those of Mr.Leavenworth and his nieces, and, whatever
may have been my emotion at finding my suspicions thus confirmed, I
recognized the fact that I was in the possession of a clue which would
yet lead to the solving of the fearful problem which had been imposed
upon me.Hastening to the telegraph office, I sent a message for the man promised
me by Mr.Gryce, and receiving for an answer that he could not be with
me before three o'clock, started for the house of Mr.Monell, a client
of ours, living in R----.I found him at home and, during our interview
of two hours, suffered the ordeal of appearing at ease and interested
in what he had to say, while my heart was heavy with its first
disappointment and my brain on fire with the excitement of the work then
on my hands.I arrived at the depot just as the train came in.There was but one passenger for R----, a brisk young man, whose whole
appearance differed so from the description which had been given me of
Q that I at once made up my mind he could not be the man I was looking
for, and was turning away disappointed, when he approached, and handed
me a card on which was inscribed the single character "?"Even then I
could not bring myself to believe that the slyest and most successful
agent in Mr.Gryce's employ was before me, till, catching his eye, I saw
such a keen, enjoyable twinkle sparkling in its depths that all doubt
fled, and, returning his bow with a show of satisfaction, I remarked:

"You are very punctual."Glad, sir, to please you.Punctuality
is too cheap a virtue not to be practised by a man on the lookout for
a rise.Down train due in ten minutes; no time to
spare.""I thought you might wish to take it, sir.Brown"--winking
expressively at the name, "always checks his carpet-bag for home when he
sees me coming.But that is your affair; I am not particular.""I wish to do what is wisest under the circumstances.""Go home, then, as speedily as possible."And he gave a third sharp nod
exceedingly business-like and determined."If I leave you, it is with the understanding that you bring your
information first to me; that you are in my employ, and in that of no
one else for the time being; and that _mum_ is the word till I give you
liberty to speak.""Very well then, here are your instructions."He looked at the paper I handed him with a certain degree of care, then
stepped into the waiting-room and threw it into the stove, saying in
a low tone: "So much in case I should meet with some accident: have an
apoplectic fit, or anything of that sort.""But----"

"Oh, don't worry; I sha'n't forget.No need of
anybody using pen and paper with me."And laughing in the short, quick way one would expect from a person of
his appearance and conversation, he added: "You will probably hear from
me in a day or so," and bowing, took his brisk, free way down the street
just as the train came rushing in from the West.My instructions to Q were as follows:

1.To find out on what day, and in whose company, the Misses Leavenworth
arrived at R---- the year before.What their movements had been while
there, and in whose society they were oftenest to be seen.Also the date
of their departure, and such facts as could be gathered in regard to
their habits, etc.Henry Clavering, fellow-guest and probable
friend of said ladies.Name of individual fulfilling the following requirements: Clergyman,
Methodist, deceased since last December or thereabouts, who in July of
Seventy-five was located in some town not over twenty miles from R----.Also name and present whereabouts of a man at that time in service of
the above.To say that the interval of time necessary to a proper inquiry into
these matters was passed by me in any reasonable frame of mind, would be
to give myself credit for an equanimity of temper which I unfortunately
do not possess.Never have days seemed so long as the two which
interposed between my return from R---- and the receipt of the following
letter:

"Sir:

"Individuals mentioned arrived in R---- July 3, 1875.Party consisted
of four; the two ladies, their uncle, and the girl named Hannah.Uncle remained three days, and then left for a short tour through
Massachusetts.Gone two weeks, during which ladies were seen more
or less with the gentleman named between us, but not to an extent
sufficient to excite gossip or occasion remark, when said gentleman
left R---- abruptly, two days after uncle's return.As to
habits of ladies, more or less social.They were always to be seen
at picnics, rides, etc., and in the ballroom.E----considered grave, and, towards the last of her stay, moody.It is
remembered now that her manner was always peculiar, and that she was
more or less shunned by her cousin.However, in the opinion of one girl still to be found at the hotel, she
was the sweetest lady that ever breathed.Uncle, ladies, and servants left R---- for New York, August 7,
1875.H. C. arrived at the hotel in R----July 6, 1875, in-company with Mr.Vandervort, friends of the above.Left July 19, two weeks from
day of arrival.Remembered as the
handsome gentleman who was in the party with the L. girls, and that is
all.F----, a small town, some sixteen or seventeen miles from R----, had
for its Methodist minister, in July of last year, a man who has since
died, Samuel Stebbins by name.Name of man in employ of S. S. at that time is Timothy Cook.He
has been absent, but returned to P---- two days ago.I cried aloud at this point, in my sudden surprise and
satisfaction; "now we have something to work upon!"And sitting down I
penned the following reply:

"T. C. wanted by all means.Also any evidence going to prove that H.
C. and E. L. were married at the house of Mr.S. on any day of July or
August last."Next morning came the following telegram:

"T. C. on the road.Will be with you by 2 p.m."At three o'clock of that same day, I stood before Mr."I am here
to make my report," I announced.The flicker of a smile passed over his face, and he gazed for the first
time at his bound-up finger-ends with a softening aspect which must have
done them good.Gryce," I began, "do you remember the conclusion we came to at our
first interview in this house?""I remember the _one you_ came to.""Well, well," I acknowledged a little peevishly, "the one I came to,
then.It was this: that if we could find to whom Eleanore Leavenworth
felt she owed her best duty and love, we should discover the man who
murdered her uncle.""And do you imagine you have done this?""When I undertook this business of clearing Eleanore Leavenworth from
suspicion," I resumed, "it was with the premonition that this person
would prove to be her lover; but I had no idea he would prove to be her
husband."Gryce's gaze flashed like lightning to the ceiling."The lover of Eleanore Leavenworth is likewise her husband," I repeated.Clavering holds no lesser connection to her than that."Gryce, in a harsh tone that
argued disappointment or displeasure."That I will not take time to state.The question is not how I became
acquainted with a certain thing, but is what I assert in regard to it
true.If you will cast your eye over this summary of events gleaned by
me from the lives of these two persons, I think you will agree with me
that it is."And I held up before his eyes the following:

"During the two weeks commencing July 6, of the year 1875, and ending
July 19, of the same year, Henry R. Clavering, of London, and Eleanore
Leavenworth, of New York, were guests of the same hotel._ Fact proved
by Visitor Book of the Hotel Union at R_----, _New York._

"They were not only guests of the same hotel, but are known to have
held more or less communication with each other._Fact proved by such
servants now employed in R---- as were in the hotel at that time._

"July 19.Clavering left R---- abruptly, a circumstance that would
not be considered remarkable if Mr.Leavenworth, whose violent antipathy
to Englishmen as husbands is publicly known, had not just returned from
a journey.Clavering was seen in the parlor of Mr.Stebbins, the
Methodist minister at F----, a town about sixteen miles from R----,
where he was married to a lady of great beauty._Proved by Timothy Cook,
a man in the employ of Mr.Stebbins, who was called in from the garden
to witness the ceremony and sign a paper supposed to be a certificate._

"July 31._Proved by
newspapers of that date._

"September.Eleanore Leavenworth in her uncle's house in New York,
conducting herself as usual, but pale of face and preoccupied in manner._Proved by servants then in her service._ Mr.Clavering in London;
watches the United States mails with eagerness, but receives no letters.Fits up room elegantly, as for a lady._Proved by secret communication
from London._

"November.Miss Leavenworth still in uncle's house.Clavering in London; shows signs of
uneasiness; the room prepared for lady closed._Proved as above._

"January 17, 1876.Clavering, having returned to America, engages
room at Hoffman House, New York.Leavenworth receives a letter signed by Henry
Clavering, in which he complains of having been ill-used by one of that
gentleman's nieces.A manifest shade falls over the family at this time.Clavering under a false name inquires at the door of Mr.Leavenworth's house for Miss Eleanore Leavenworth."That was the night of
the murder.-"

"Yes; the Mr.Le Roy Robbins said to have called that evening was none
other than Mr.Miss Mary Leavenworth, in a conversation with me,
acknowledges that there is a secret in the family, and is just upon the
point of revealing its nature, when Mr.Upon
his departure she declares her unwillingness ever to mention the subject
again.""And from these facts you draw
the inference that Eleanore Leavenworth is the wife of Mr."And that, being his wife----"

"It would be natural for her to conceal anything she knew likely to
criminate him.""Always supposing Clavering himself had done anything criminal!""Which latter supposition you now propose to justify!""Which latter supposition it is left for _us_ to justify.""Then you have no new evidence against Mr."I should think the fact just given, of his standing in the relation of
unacknowledged husband to the suspected party was something.""No positive evidence as to his being the assassin of Mr.I was obliged to admit I had none which he would consider positive."But
I can show the existence of motive; and I can likewise show it was not
only possible, but probable, he was in the house at the time of the
murder."Gryce, rousing a little from his abstraction."The motive was the usual one of self-interest.Leavenworth stood
in the way of Eleanore's acknowledging him as a husband, and he must
therefore be put out of the way."Too much calculation was shown for the arm
to have been nerved by anything short of the most deliberate intention,
founded upon the deadliest necessity of passion or avarice.""One should never deliberate upon the causes which have led to the
destruction of a rich man without taking into account that most common
passion of the human race.""But----"

"Let us hear what you have to say of Mr.Clavering's presence in the
house at the time of the murder."I related what Thomas the butler had told me in regard to Mr.Clavering's call upon Miss Leavenworth that night, and the lack of proof
which existed as to his having left the house when supposed to do so."Valueless as direct evidence, it might prove of great value as
corroborative."Then, in a graver tone, he went on to say: "Mr.Raymond,
are you aware that in all this you have been strengthening the case
against Eleanore Leavenworth instead of weakening it?"I could only ejaculate, in my sudden wonder and dismay."You have shown her to be secret, sly, and unprincipled; capable of
wronging those to whom she was most bound, her uncle and her husband.""You put it very strongly," said I, conscious of a shocking discrepancy
between this description of Eleanore's character and all that I had
preconceived in regard to it."No more so than your own conclusions from this story warrant me in
doing."Then, as I sat silent, murmured low, and as if to himself:
"If the case was dark against her before, it is doubly so with this
supposition established of her being the woman secretly married to Mr."And yet," I protested, unable to give up my hope without a struggle;
"you do not, cannot, believe the noble-looking Eleanore guilty of this
horrible crime?""No," he slowly said; "you might as well know right here what I think
about that.I believe Eleanore Leavenworth to be an innocent woman."Then what," I cried, swaying between joy at this admission and
doubt as to the meaning of his former expressions, "remains to be done?"Gryce quietly responded: "Why, nothing but to prove your supposition
a false one."TIMOTHY COOK


    "Look here upon this picture and on this.""I doubt if it will be so very difficult,"
said he.Then, in a sudden burst, "Where is the man Cook?""That was a wise move; let us see the boys; have them up.""I expected, of course, you would want to question them," said I, coming
back.In another moment the spruce Q and the shock-headed Cook entered the
room.Gryce, directing his attention at the latter in his own
whimsical, non-committal way; "this is the deceased Mr.Stebbins' hired
man, is it?Well, you look as though you could tell the truth.""I usually calculate to do that thing, sir; at all events, I was never
called a liar as I can remember.""Of course not, of course not," returned the affable detective.Then,
without any further introduction: "What was the first name of the lady
you saw married in your master's house last summer?""As well as if she was my own mother.No disrespect to the lady, sir, if
you know her," he made haste to add, glancing hurriedly at me."What I
mean is, she was so handsome, I could never forget the look of her sweet
face if I lived a hundred years.""I don't know, sirs; she was tall and grand-looking, had the brightest
eyes and the whitest hand, and smiled in a way to make even a common man
like me wish he had never seen her.""Very well; now tell us all you can about that marriage.""Well, sirs, it was something like this.Stebbins'
employ about a year, when one morning as I was hoeing in the garden
I saw a gentleman walk rapidly up the road to our gate and come in.I
noticed him particularly, because he was so fine-looking; unlike anybody
in F----, and, indeed, unlike anybody I had ever seen, for that matter;
but I shouldn't have thought much about that if there hadn't come along,
not five minutes after, a buggy with two ladies in it, which stopped at
our gate, too.I saw they wanted to get out, so I went and held their
horse for them, and they got down and went into the house.""I hadn't been to work long, before I heard some one calling my name,
and looking up, saw Mr.Stebbins standing in the doorway beckoning.I
went to him, and he said, 'I want you, Tim; wash your hands and come
into the parlor.'I had never been asked to do that before, and it
struck me all of a heap; but I did what he asked, and was so taken
aback at the looks of the lady I saw standing up on the floor with
the handsome gentleman, that I stumbled over a stool and made a great
racket, and didn't know much where I was or what was going on, till I
heard Mr.Stebbins say'man and wife'; and then it came over me in a hot
kind of way that it was a marriage I was seeing."Timothy Cook stopped to wipe his forehead, as if overcome with the very
recollection, and Mr.Gryce took the opportunity to remark:

"You say there were two ladies; now where was the other one at this
time?""She was there, sir; but I didn't mind much about her, I was so taken up
with the handsome one and the way she had of smiling when any one looked
at her."Can you remember the color of her hair or eyes?""No, sir; I had a feeling as if she wasn't dark, and that is all I
know."Gryce here whispered me to procure two pictures which I would find
in a certain drawer in his desk, and set them up in different parts of
the room unbeknown to the man.Gryce, "that you have no remembrance
of her name.Weren't you called upon to sign the
certificate?""Yes, sir; but I am most ashamed to say it; I was in a sort of maze,
and didn't hear much, and only remember it was a Mr.Clavering she was
married to, and that some one called some one else Elner, or something
like that.I wish I hadn't been so stupid, sir, if it would have done
you any good.""Tell us about the signing of the certificate," said Mr."Well, sir, there isn't much to tell.Stebbins asked me to put my
name down in a certain place on a piece of paper he pushed towards me,
and I put it down there; that is all.""Was there no other name there when you wrote yours?"Stebbins turned towards the other lady, who now
came forward, and asked her if she wouldn't please sign it, too; and she
said,' yes,' and came very quickly and did so.""And didn't you see her face then?""No, sir; her back was to me when she threw by her veil, and I only saw
Mr.Stebbins staring at her as she stooped, with a kind of wonder on his
face, which made me think she might have been something worth looking at
too; but I didn't see her myself."I went stumbling out of the room, and didn't see
anything more.""Where were you when the ladies went away?""No, sir; that was the queer part of it all.They went back as they
came, and so did he; and in a few minutes Mr.Stebbins came out where I
was, and told me I was to say nothing about what I had seen, for it was
a secret.""Were you the only one in the house who knew anything about it?"No, sir; Miss Stebbins had gone to the sewing circle."I had by this time some faint impression of what Mr.Gryce's suspicions
were, and in arranging the pictures had placed one, that of Eleanore, on
the mantel-piece, and the other, which was an uncommonly fine photograph
of Mary, in plain view on the desk.Cook's back was as yet
towards that part of the room, and, taking advantage of the moment,
I returned and asked him if that was all he had to tell us about this
matter.Gryce, with a glance at Q, "isn't there something you
can give Mr.Q nodded, and moved towards a cupboard in the wall at the side of the
mantel-piece; Mr.Cook following him with his eyes, as was natural,
when, with a sudden start, he crossed the room and, pausing before the
mantelpiece, looked at the picture of Eleanore which I had put there,
gave a low grunt of satisfaction or pleasure, looked at it again, and
walked away.I felt my heart leap into my throat, and, moved by what
impulse of dread or hope I cannot say, turned my back, when suddenly I
heard him give vent to a startled exclamation, followed by the words:
"Why!here she is; this is her, sirs," and turning around saw him
hurrying towards us with Mary's picture in his hands.I do not know as I was greatly surprised.I was powerfully excited, as
well as conscious of a certain whirl of thought, and an unsettling of
old conclusions that was very confusing; but surprised?Gryce's
manner had too well prepared me."This the lady who was married to Mr.I guess
you are mistaken," cried the detective, in a very incredulous tone.Didn't I say I would know her anywhere?This is the lady, if
she is the president's wife herself."Cook leaned over it with a
devouring look that was not without its element of homage.Gryce went on, winking at me in a slow,
diabolical way which in another mood would have aroused my fiercest
anger."Now, if you had said the other lady was the one"--pointing to
the picture on the mantelpiece," I shouldn't have wondered."I never saw that lady before; but this one--would you mind telling
me her name, sirs?""If what you say is true, her name is Mrs."And a very lovely lady," said Mr."Morris, haven't you found
anything yet?"Q, for answer, brought forward glasses and a bottle.I think he was struck with
remorse; for, looking from the picture to Q, and from Q to the picture,
he said:

"If I have done this lady wrong by my talk, I'll never forgive myself.You told me I would help her to get her rights; if you have deceived me
----"

"Oh, I haven't deceived you," broke in Q, in his short, sharp way."Ask
that gentleman there if we are not all interested in Mrs.He had designated me; but I was in no mood to reply.I longed to
have the man dismissed, that I might inquire the reason of the great
complacency which I now saw overspreading Mr.Gryce's frame, to his very
finger-ends.Cook needn't be concerned," remarked Mr."If he will take
a glass of warm drink to fortify him for his walk, I think he may go to
the lodgings Mr.Give the gent
a glass, and let him mix for himself."But it was full ten minutes before we were delivered of the man and his
vain regrets.Mary's image had called up every latent feeling in his
heart, and I could but wonder over a loveliness capable of swaying the
low as well as the high.But at last he yielded to the seductions of the
now wily Q, and departed.Gryce, I must have allowed some of the confused
emotions which filled my breast to become apparent on my countenance;
for after a few minutes of ominous silence, he exclaimed very grimly,
and yet with a latent touch of that complacency I had before noticed:

"This discovery rather upsets you, doesn't it?Well, it don't me,"
shutting his mouth like a trap."Your conclusions must differ very materially from mine," I returned;
"or you would see that this discovery alters the complexion of the whole
affair."Gryce's very legs grew thoughtful; his voice sank to its deepest
tone."Then," said he, "to my notion, the complexion of things has altered,
but very much for the better.As long as Eleanore was believed to be
the wife, her action in this matter was accounted for; but the tragedy
itself was not.Why should Eleanore or Eleanore's husband wish the death
of a man whose bounty they believed would end with his life?But with
Mary, the heiress, proved the wife!--I tell you, Mr.Raymond, it all
hangs together now.You must never, in reckoning up an affair of murder
like this, forget who it is that most profits by the deceased man's
death."her concealment of certain proofs and evidences
in her own breast--how will you account for that?I can imagine a woman
devoting herself to the shielding of a husband from the consequences of
crime; but a cousin's husband, never."Gryce put his feet very close together, and softly grunted.I could only stare at him in my sudden doubt and dread."Why, what else is there to think?You don't--you can't--suspect
Eleanore of having deliberately undertaken to help her cousin out of a
difficulty by taking the life of their mutual benefactor?"Gryce; "no, I do not think Eleanore Leavenworth had any
hand in the business.""Then who--" I began, and stopped, lost in the dark vista that was
opening before me.Why, who but the one whose past deceit and present necessity
demanded his death as a relief?Who but the beautiful, money-loving,
man-deceiving goddess----"

I leaped to my feet in my sudden horror and repugnance.You are wrong; but do not speak the name.""Excuse me," said he; "but it will have to be spoken many times, and we
may as well begin here and now--who then but Mary Leavenworth; or, if
you like it better, Mrs.It
has been my thought from the beginning."GRYCE EXPLAINS HIMSELF


    "Sits the wind in that corner?"I DO not propose to enter into a description of the mingled feelings
aroused in me by this announcement.As a drowning man is said to live
over in one terrible instant the events of a lifetime, so each word
uttered in my hearing by Mary, from her first introduction to me in her
own room, on the morning of the inquest, to our final conversation on
the night of Mr.Clavering's call, swept in one wild phantasmagoria
through my brain, leaving me aghast at the signification which her whole
conduct seemed to acquire from the lurid light which now fell upon it."I perceive that I have pulled down an avalanche of doubts about your
ears," exclaimed my companion from the height of his calm superiority."You never thought of this possibility, then, yourself?""Do not ask me what I have thought.I only know I will never believe
your suspicions true.That, however much Mary may have been benefited by
her uncle's death, she never had a hand in it; actual hand, I mean.""And what makes you so sure of this?""And what makes you so sure of the contrary?It is for you to prove, not
for me to prove her innocence."Gryce, in his slow, sarcastic way, "you recollect that
principle of law, do you?If I remember rightly, you have not always
been so punctilious in regarding it, or wishing to have it regarded,
when the question was whether Mr.It does not seem so dreadful to accuse a man of a
crime.I cannot listen to it; it is
horrible.Nothing short of absolute confession on her part will ever
make me believe Mary Leavenworth, or any other woman, committed this
deed.It was too cruel, too deliberate, too----"

"Read the criminal records," broke in Mr."I do not care for the criminal records.All the
criminal records in the world would never make me believe Eleanore
perpetrated this crime, nor will I be less generous towards her cousin.Mary Leavenworth is a faulty woman, but not a guilty one.""You are more lenient in your judgment of her than her cousin was, it
appears.""I do not understand you," I muttered, feeling a new and yet more
fearful light breaking upon me.have you forgotten, in the hurry of these late events, the
sentence of accusation which we overheard uttered between these ladies
on the morning of the inquest?""No, but----"

"You believed it to have been spoken by Mary to Eleanore?"I left that
baby-play for you.I thought one was enough to follow on that tack."The light, the light that was breaking upon me!"And do you mean to say
it was Eleanore who was speaking at that time?That I have been laboring
all these weeks under a terrible mistake, and that you could have
righted me with a word, and did not?""Well, as to that, I had a purpose in letting you follow your own lead
for a while.In the first place, I was not sure myself which spoke;
though I had but little doubt about the matter.The voices are, as you
must have noticed, very much alike, while the attitudes in which we
found them upon entering were such as to be explainable equally by the
supposition that Mary was in the act of launching a denunciation, or in
that of repelling one.So that, while I did not hesitate myself as to
the true explanation of the scene before me, I was pleased to find you
accept a contrary one; as in this way both theories had a chance of
being tested; as was right in a case of so much mystery.You accordingly
took up the affair with one idea for your starting-point, and I with
another.You saw every fact as it developed through the medium of Mary's
belief in Eleanore's guilt, and I through the opposite.With you, doubt, contradiction, constant unsettlement,
and unwarranted resorts to strange sources for reconcilement between
appearances and your own convictions; with me, growing assurance, and
a belief which each and every development so far has but served to
strengthen and make more probable."Again that wild panorama of events, looks, and words swept before me.Mary's reiterated assertions of her cousin's innocence, Eleanore's
attitude of lofty silence in regard to certain matters which might be
considered by her as pointing towards the murderer."Your theory must be the correct one," I finally admitted; "it was
undoubtedly Eleanore who spoke.She believes in Mary's guilt, and I have
been blind, indeed, not to have seen it from the first.""If Eleanore Leavenworth believes in her cousin's criminality, she must
have some good reasons for doing so.""She did not conceal in her bosom that
telltale key,--found who knows where?--and destroy, or seek to destroy,
it and the letter which introduced her cousin to the public as the
unprincipled destroyer of a trusting man's peace, for nothing.""And yet you, a stranger, a young man who have never seen Mary
Leavenworth in any other light than that in which her coquettish nature
sought to display itself, presume to say she is innocent, in the face of
the attitude maintained from the first by her cousin!""But," said I, in my great unwillingness to accept his conclusions,
"Eleanore Leavenworth is but mortal.She may have been mistaken in her
inferences.She has never stated what her suspicion was founded upon;
nor can we know what basis she has for maintaining the attitude you
speak of.Clavering is as likely as Mary to be the assassin, for all we
know, and possibly for all she knows.""You seem to be almost superstitious in your belief in Clavering's
guilt."Harwell's fanciful conviction in
regard to this man had in any way influenced me to the detriment of my
better judgment?"I do not pretend to be set
in my notions.Future investigation may succeed in fixing something upon
him; though I hardly think it likely.His behavior as the secret husband
of a woman possessing motives for the commission of a crime has been too
consistent throughout.""No exception at all; for he hasn't left her.""I mean that, instead of leaving the country, Mr.Clavering has only
made pretence of doing so.That, in place of dragging himself off to
Europe at her command, he has only changed his lodgings, and can now be
found, not only in a house opposite to hers, but in the window of that
house, where he sits day after day watching who goes in and out of her
front door."I remembered his parting injunction to me, in that memorable interview
we had in my office, and saw myself compelled to put a new construction
upon it."But I was assured at the Hoffman House that he had sailed for Europe,
and myself saw the man who professes to have driven him to the steamer.""In another carriage, and to another house.""And you tell me that man is all right?""No; I only say there isn't the shadow of evidence against him as the
person who shot Mr.Rising, I paced the floor, and for a few minutes silence fell between
us.But the clock, striking, recalled me to the necessity of the hour,
and, turning, I asked Mr."There is but one thing I can do," said he."To go upon such lights as I have, and cause the arrest of Miss
Leavenworth."I had by this time schooled myself to endurance, and was able to hear
this without uttering an exclamation.But I could not let it pass
without making one effort to combat his determination."But," said I, "I do not see what evidence you have, positive enough in
its character, to warrant extreme measures.You have yourself intimated
that the existence of motive is not enough, even though taken with
the fact of the suspected party being in the house at the time of the
murder; and what more have you to urge against Miss Leavenworth?"I said 'Miss Leavenworth'; I should have said 'Eleanore
Leavenworth.'"when you and all unite in thinking that she alone of
all these parties to the crime is utterly guiltless of wrong?""And yet who is the only one against whom positive testimony of any kind
can be brought."Raymond," he remarked very gravely; "the public is becoming
clamorous; something must be done to satisfy it, if only for the moment.Eleanore has laid herself open to the suspicion of the police, and
must take the consequences of her action.I am sorry; she is a noble
creature; I admire her; but justice is justice, and though I think her
innocent, I shall be forced to put her under arrest unless----"

"But I cannot be reconciled to it.It is doing an irretrievable injury
to one whose only fault is an undue and mistaken devotion to an unworthy
cousin."Unless something occurs between now and tomorrow morning," Mr.Gryce
went on, as if I had not spoken.I tried to realize it; tried to face the fact that all my efforts had
been for nothing, and failed."Will you not grant me one more day?"Clavering, and force from him the
truth.""To make a mess of the whole affair!""No, sir; the die is
cast.Eleanore Leavenworth knows the one point which fixes this
crime upon her cousin, and she must tell us that point or suffer the
consequences of her refusal."Having exhausted so much time already in our
inquiries, why not take a little more; especially as the trail is
constantly growing warmer?A little more moleing----"

"A little more folderol!""No,
sir; the hour for moleing has passed; something decisive has got to be
done now; though, to be sure, if I could find the one missing link I
want----"

"Missing link?"The immediate motive of the tragedy; a bit of proof that Mr.Leavenworth threatened his niece with his displeasure, or Mr.Clavering
with his revenge, would place me on the vantage-point at once; no
arresting of Eleanore then!I would walk right into your
own gilded parlors, and when you asked me if I had found the murderer
yet, say 'yes,' and show you a bit of paper which would surprise you!This has been moled for, and
moled for, as you are pleased to call our system of investigation, and
totally without result.Nothing but the confession of some one of these
several parties to the crime will give us what we want.I will tell you
what I will do," he suddenly cried."Miss Leavenworth has desired me to
report to her; she is very anxious for the detection of the murderer,
you know, and offers an immense reward.Well, I will gratify this desire
of hers.The suspicions I have, together with my reasons for them, will
make an interesting disclosure.I should not greatly wonder if they
produced an equally interesting confession."I could only jump to my feet in my horror."At all events, I propose to try it.Eleanore is worth that much risk
any way.""It will do no good," said I."If Mary is guilty, she will never confess
it.If not----"

"She will tell us who is.""Not if it is Clavering, her husband.""Yes; even if it is Clavering, her husband.She has not the devotion of
Eleanore."She would hide no keys for the sake of
shielding another: no, if Mary were accused, she would speak.The future
opening before us looked sombre enough.And yet when, in a short time
from that, I found myself alone in a busy street, the thought that
Eleanore was free rose above all others, filling and moving me till my
walk home in the rain that day has become a marked memory of my life.It was only with nightfall that I began to realize the truly critical
position in which Mary stood if Mr.But,
once seized with this thought, nothing could drive it from my mind.Shrink as I would, it was ever before me, haunting me with the direst
forebodings.Nor, though I retired early, could I succeed in getting
either sleep or rest.All night I tossed on my pillow, saying over to
myself with dreary iteration: "Something must happen, something will
happen, to prevent Mr.Then I would
start up and ask what could happen; and my mind would run over various
contingencies, such as,--Mr.Clavering might confess; Hannah might come
back; Mary herself wake up to her position and speak the word I had more
than once seen trembling on her lips.But further thought showed me how
unlikely any of these things were to happen, and it was with a brain
utterly exhausted that I fell asleep in the early dawn, to dream I saw
Mary standing above Mr.I was awakened
from this pleasing vision by a heavy knock at the door.Hastily rising,
I asked who was there.The answer came in the shape of an envelope
thrust under the door.Raising it, I found it to be a note.Gryce, and ran thus:

"Come at once; Hannah Chester is found.""Sit down, and I will tell you."Drawing up a chair in a flurry of hope and fear, I sat down by Mr."She is not in the cupboard," that person dryly assured me, noting
without doubt how my eyes went travelling about the room in my anxiety
and impatience."We are not absolutely sure that she is anywhere.But
word has come to us that a girl's face believed to be Hannah's has been
seen at the upper window of a certain house in--don't start--R----,
where a year ago she was in the habit of visiting while at the hotel
with the Misses Leavenworth.Now, as it has already been determined that
she left New York the night of the murder, by the ------ ----Railroad,
though for what point we have been unable to ascertain, we consider the
matter worth inquiring into.""But--"

"If she is there," resumed Mr.Gryce, "she is secreted; kept very
close.No one except the informant has ever seen her, nor is there any
suspicion among the neighbors of her being in town.""Hannah secreted at a certain house in R----?Gryce honored me with one of his grimmest smiles."The name of
the lady she's with is given in the communication as Belden; Mrs.the name found written on a torn envelope by Mr."Then we are upon the
verge of some discovery; Providence has interfered, and Eleanore will be
saved!"Last night, or rather this morning; Q brought it.""It was a message, then, to Q?""Yes, the result of his moleings while in R----, I suppose.""A respectable tinsmith who lives next door to Mrs."And is this the first you knew of an Amy Belden living in R----?""Don't know; don't know anything about her but her name.""But you have already sent Q to make inquiries?""No; the affair is a little too serious for him to manage alone.He is
not equal to great occasions, and might fail just for the lack of a keen
mind to direct him.""In short----"

"I wish you to go.Since I cannot be there myself, I know of no one else
sufficiently up in the affair to conduct it to a successful issue.You see, it is not enough to find and identify the girl.The present
condition of things demands that the arrest of so important a witness
should be kept secret.Now, for a man to walk into a strange house in a
distant village, find a girl who is secreted there, frighten her,
cajole her, force her, as the case may be, from her hiding-place to a
detective's office in New York, and all without the knowledge of the
next-door neighbor, if possible, requires judgment, brains, genius.She must have her reasons for doing so; and
they must be known.Altogether, the affair is a delicate one."To think what pleasure I am
losing on your account!"he grumbled, gazing reproachfully at his
helpless limbs.a train leaves the depot at 12.15.Once in R----,
it will be for you to decide upon the means of making Mrs.Belden's
acquaintance without arousing her suspicions.Q, who will follow you,
will hold himself in readiness to render you any assistance you may
require.Only this thing is to be understood: as he will doubtless go in
disguise, you are not to recognize him, much less interfere with him
and his plans, till he gives you leave to do so, by some preconcerted
signal.You are to work in your way, and he in his, till circumstances
seem to call for mutual support and countenance.I cannot even say
whether you will see him or not; he may find it necessary to keep out of
the way; but you may be sure of one thing, that he will know where
you are, and that the display of, well, let us say a red silk
handkerchief--have you such a thing?""Will be regarded by him as a sign that you desire his presence or
assistance, whether it be shown about your person or at the window of
your room.""And these are all the instructions you can give me?""Yes, I don't know of anything else.You must depend largely upon your
own discretion, and the exigencies of the moment.I cannot tell you now
what to do.Only, if possible, let
me either hear from you or see you by to-morrow at this time."And he handed me a cipher in case I should wish to telegraph.HANNAH



XXVII.AMY BELDEN


    "A merrier man
    Within the limits of becoming mirth,
    I never spent an hour's talk withal."I HAD a client in R---- by the name of Monell; and it was from him I
had planned to learn the best way of approaching Mrs.When,
therefore, I was so fortunate as to meet him, almost on my arrival,
driving on the long road behind his famous trotter Alfred, I regarded
the encounter as a most auspicious beginning of a very doubtful
enterprise.was his exclamation as, the first
greetings passed, we drove rapidly into town."Your part in it goes pretty smoothly," I returned; and thinking I could
never hope to win his attention to my own affairs till I had satisfied
him in regard to his, I told him all I could concerning the law-suit
then pending; a subject so prolific of question and answer, that we
had driven twice round the town before he remembered he had a letter to
post.As it was an important one, admitting of no delay, we hasted at
once to the post-office, where he went in, leaving me outside to watch
the rather meagre stream of goers and comers who at that time of day
make the post-office of a country town their place of rendezvous.Among
these, for some reason, I especially noted one middle-aged woman; why, I
cannot say; her appearance was anything but remarkable.And yet when
she came out, with two letters in her hand, one in a large and one in a
small envelope, and meeting my eye hastily drew them under her shawl,
I found myself wondering what was in her letters and who she could be,
that the casual glance of a stranger should unconsciously move her to an
action so suspicious.Monell's reappearance at the same moment,
diverted my attention, and in the interest of the conversation that
followed, I soon forgot both the woman and her letters.For determined
that he should have no opportunity to revert to that endless topic, a
law case, I exclaimed with the first crack of the whip,--"There, I knew
there was something I wanted to ask you.It is this: Are you acquainted
with any one is this town by the name of Belden?""There is a widow Belden in town; I don't know of any other.""Who is she, what is she, and what is the
extent of your acquaintance with her?""Well," said he, " I cannot conceive why you should be interested in
such an antiquated piece of commonplace goodness as she is, but seeing
you ask, I have no objection to telling you that she is the very
respectable relict of a deceased cabinetmaker of this town; that she
lives in a little house down the street there, and that if you have any
forlorn old tramp to be lodged over night, or any destitute family of
little ones to be looked after, she is the one to go to.As to knowing
her, I know her as I do a dozen other members of our church there up
over the hill.When I see her I speak to her, and that is all.""No; lives alone, has a little income, I believe; must have, to put the
money on the plate she always does; but spends her time in plain sewing
and such deeds of charity, as one with small means but willing heart can
find the opportunity of doing in a town like this.But why in the name
of wonders do you ask?"Belden--don't mention it by the
way--has got mixed up in a case of mine, and I felt it due to my
curiosity if not to my purse, to find out something about her.The fact is I would give something, Monell, for the
opportunity of studying this woman's character.Now couldn't you manage
to get me introduced into her house in some way that would make it
possible and proper for me to converse with her at my leisure?"Well, I don't know; I suppose it could be done.She used to take
lodgers in the summer when the hotel was full, and might be induced
to give a bed to a friend of mine who is very anxious to be near the
post-office on account of a business telegram he is expecting, and which
when it comes will demand his immediate attention."Monell gave
me a sly wink of his eye, little imagining how near the mark he had
struck.Tell her I have a peculiar dislike to sleeping
in a public house, and that you know of no one better fitted to
accommodate me, for the short time I desire to be in town, than
herself.""And what will be said of my hospitality in allowing you under these
circumstances to remain in any other house than my own?""I don't know; very hard things, no doubt; but I guess your hospitality
can stand it.""Well, if you persist, we will see what can be done."And driving up to
a neat white cottage of homely, but sufficiently attractive appearance,
he stopped."This is her house," said he, jumping to the ground; "let's go in and
see what we can do."Glancing up at the windows, which were all closed save the two on the
veranda overlooking the street, I thought to myself, "If she has anybody
in hiding here, whose presence in the house she desires to keep secret,
it is folly to hope she will take me in, however well recommended I may
come."But, yielding to the example of my friend, I alighted in my turn
and followed him up the short, grass-bordered walk to the front door."As she has no servant, she will come to the door herself, so be ready,"
he remarked as he knocked.I had barely time to observe that the curtains to the window at my left
suddenly dropped, when a hasty step made itself heard within, and a
quick hand drew open the door; and I saw before me the woman whom I
had observed at the post-office, and whose action with the letters had
struck me as peculiar.I recognized her at first glance, though she
was differently dressed, and had evidently passed through some worry or
excitement that had altered the expression of her countenance, and
made her manner what it was not at that time, strained and a trifle
uncertain.But I saw no reason for thinking she remembered me.On the
contrary, the look she directed towards me had nothing but inquiry in
it, and when Mr.Monell pushed me forward with the remark, "A friend
of mine; in fact my lawyer from New York," she dropped a hurried
old-fashioned curtsey whose only expression was a manifest desire to
appear sensible of the honor conferred upon her, through the mist of a
certain trouble that confused everything about her."We have come to ask a favor, Mrs.Belden; but may we not come in?"said
my client in a round, hearty voice well calculated to recall a person's
thoughts into their proper channel."I have heard many times of your
cosy home, and am glad of this opportunity of seeing it."And with a
blind disregard to the look of surprised resistance with which she met
his advance, he stepped gallantly into the little room whose cheery
red carpet and bright picture-hung walls showed invitingly through the
half-open door at our left.Finding her premises thus invaded by a sort of French _coup d'etat,_
Mrs.Belden made the best of the situation, and pressing me to enter
also, devoted herself to hospitality.Monell, he quite
blossomed out in his endeavors to make himself agreeable; so much so,
that I shortly found myself laughing at his sallies, though my heart was
full of anxiety lest, after all, our efforts should fail of the success
they certainly merited.Belden softened more and more,
joining in the conversation with an ease hardly to be expected from one
in her humble circumstances.Indeed, I soon saw she was no common woman.There was a refinement in her speech and manner, which, combined with
her motherly presence and gentle air, was very pleasing.The last woman
in the world to suspect of any underhanded proceeding, if she had not
shown a peculiar hesitation when Mr.Monell broached the subject of my
entertainment there."I don't know, sir; I would be glad, but," and she turned a very
scrutinizing look upon me, "the fact is, I have not taken lodgers of
late, and I have got out of the way of the whole thing, and am afraid I
cannot make him comfortable.In short, you will have to excuse me.""What, entice a fellow into a room
like this"--and he cast a hearty admiring glance round the apartment
which, for all its simplicity, both its warm coloring and general air of
cosiness amply merited, "and then turn a cold shoulder upon him when he
humbly entreats the honor of staying a single night in the enjoyment
of its attractions?Belden; I know you too well for that.Lazarus himself couldn't come to your door and be turned away; much less
a good-hearted, clever-headed young gentleman like my friend here.""You are very good," she began, an almost weak love of praise showing
itself for a moment in her eyes; "but I have no room prepared.I have
been house-cleaning, and everything is topsy-turvy Mrs.Wright, now,
over the way----"

"My young friend is going to stop here," Mr.Mouell broke in, with frank
positiveness."If I cannot have him at my own house,--and for certain
reasons it is not advisable,--I shall at least have the satisfaction of
knowing he is in the charge of the best housekeeper in R----.""Yes," I put in, but without too great a show of interest; "I should be
sorry, once introduced here, to be obliged to go elsewhere."The troubled eye wavered away from us to the door."I was never called inhospitable," she commenced; "but everything in
such disorder."I was in hopes I might remain now," I replied; "I have some letters
to write, and ask nothing better than for leave to sit here and write
them."At the word letters I saw her hand go to her pocket in a movement which
must have been involuntary, for her countenance did not change, and she
made the quick reply:

"Well, you may.If you can put up with such poor accommodations as I can
offer, it shall not be said I refused you what Mr.Monell is pleased to
call a favor."And, complete in her reception as she had been in her resistance, she
gave us a pleasant smile, and, ignoring my thanks, bustled out with Mr.Monell to the buggy, where she received my bag and what was, doubtless,
more to her taste, the compliments he was now more than ever ready to
bestow upon her."I will see that a room is got ready for you in a very short space of
time," she said, upon re-entering."Meanwhile, make yourself at home
here; and if you wish to write, why I think you will find everything for
the purpose in these drawers."And wheeling up a table to the easy chair
in which I sat, she pointed to the small compartments beneath, with
an air of such manifest desire to have me make use of anything and
everything she had, that I found myself wondering over my position with
a sort of startled embarrassment that was not remote from shame."Thank you; I have materials of my own," said I, and hastened to open my
bag and bring out the writing-case, which I always carried with me."Then I will leave you," said she; and with a quick bend and a short,
hurried look out of the window, she hastily quitted the room.I could hear her steps cross the hall, go up two or three stairs, pause,
go up the rest of the flight, pause again, and then pass on.I was left
on the first floor alone.A WEIRD EXPERIENCE


    "Flat burglary as ever was committed."THE first thing I did was to inspect with greater care the room in which
I sat.It was a pleasant apartment, as I have already said; square, sunny, and
well furnished.On the floor was a crimson carpet, on the walls several
pictures, at the windows, cheerful curtains of white, tastefully
ornamented with ferns and autumn leaves; in one corner an old melodeon,
and in the centre of the room a table draped with a bright cloth, on
which were various little knick-knacks which, without being rich or
expensive, were both pretty and, to a certain extent, ornamental.But
it was not these things, which I had seen repeated in many other country
homes, that especially attracted my attention, or drew me forward in the
slow march which I now undertook around the room.It was the something
underlying all these, the evidences which I found, or sought to find,
not only in the general aspect of the room, but in each trivial object
I encountered, of the character, disposition, and history of the woman
with whom I now had to deal.It was for this reason I studied the
daguerreotypes on the mantel-piece, the books on the shelf, and the
music on the rack; for this and the still further purpose of noting if
any indications were to be found of there being in the house any such
person as Hannah.First then, for the little library, which I was pleased to see occupied
one corner of the room.Composed of a few well-chosen books, poetical,
historical, and narrative, it was of itself sufficient to account
for the evidences of latent culture observable in Mrs.Taking out a well-worn copy of _Byron,_ I opened it.There
were many passages marked, and replacing the book with a mental comment
upon her evident impressibility to the softer emotions, I turned towards
the melodeon fronting me from the opposite wall.It was closed, but on
its neatly-covered top lay one or two hymn-books, a basket of russet
apples, and a piece of half-completed knitting work.I took up the latter, but was forced to lay it down again without a
notion for what it was intended.Proceeding, I next stopped before
a window opening upon the small yard that ran about the house, and
separated it from the one adjoining.The scene without failed to attract
me, but the window itself drew my attention, for, written with a diamond
point on one of the panes, I perceived a row of letters which, as
nearly as I could make out, were meant for some word or words, but which
utterly failed in sense or apparent connection.Passing it by as the
work of some school-girl, I glanced down at the work-basket standing on
a table at my side.It was full of various kinds of work, among which I
spied a pair of stockings, which were much too small, as well as in too
great a state of disrepair, to belong to Mrs.Belden; and drawing them
carefully out, I examined them for any name on them.Do not start when I
say I saw the letter H plainly marked upon them.Thrusting them back,
I drew a deep breath of relief, gazing, as I did so, out of the window,
when those letters again attracted my attention.Idly I began to read them backward, when--But try
for yourself, reader, and judge of my surprise!Elate at the discovery
thus made, I sat down to write my letters.I had barely finished them,
when Mrs.Belden came in with the announcement that supper was ready."As for your room," said she, "I have prepared my own room for your use,
thinking you would like to remain on the first floor."And, throwing
open a door at my side, she displayed a small, but comfortable room,
in which I could dimly see a bed, an immense bureau, and a shadowy
looking-glass in a dark, old-fashioned frame."I live in very primitive fashion," she resumed, leading the way into
the dining-room; "but I mean to be comfortable and make others so.""I should say you amply succeeded," I rejoined, with an appreciative
glance at her well-spread board.She smiled, and I felt I had paved the way to her good graces in a way
that would yet redound to my advantage.its dainties, its pleasant freedom, its
mysterious, pervading atmosphere of unreality, and the constant sense
which every bountiful dish she pressed upon me brought of the shame of
eating this woman's food with such feelings of suspicion in my heart!Shall I ever forget the emotion I experienced when I first perceived
she had something on her mind, which she longed, yet hesitated, to give
utterance to!Or how she started when a cat jumped from the sloping roof
of the kitchen on to the grass-plot at the back of the house; or how my
heart throbbed when I heard, or thought I heard, a board creak overhead!We were in a long and narrow room which seemed, curiously enough, to run
crosswise of the house, opening on one side into the parlor, and on the
other into the small bedroom, which had been allotted to my use."You live in this house alone, without fear?"Belden,
contrary to my desire, put another bit of cold chicken on my plate."Have you no marauders in this town: no tramps, of whom a solitary woman
like you might reasonably be afraid?""No one will hurt me," said she; "and no one ever came here for food or
shelter but got it.""I should think, then, that living as you do, upon a railroad, you would
be constantly overrun with worthless beings whose only trade is to take
all they can get without giving a return."It is the only luxury I have: to feed the
poor.""But the idle, restless ones, who neither will work, nor let others
work----"

"Are still the poor."Mentally remarking, here is the woman to shield an unfortunate who has
somehow become entangled in the meshes of a great crime, I drew back
from the table.As I did so, the thought crossed me that, in case
there was any such person in the house as Hannah, she would take the
opportunity of going up-stairs with something for her to eat; and that
she might not feel hampered by my presence, I stepped out on the veranda
with my cigar.While smoking it, I looked about for Q. I felt that the least token
of his presence in town would be very encouraging at this time.But it
seemed I was not to be afforded even that small satisfaction.If Q was
anywhere near, he was lying very low.Belden (who I know came down-stairs with an
empty plate, for going into the kitchen for a drink, I caught her in
the act of setting it down on the table), I made up my mind to wait a
reasonable length of time for what she had to say; and then, if she did
not speak, make an endeavor on my own part to surprise her secret.But her avowal was nearer and of a different nature from what I
expected, and brought its own train of consequences with it."You are a lawyer, I believe," she began, taking down her knitting work,
with a forced display of industry."Yes," I said; "that is my profession."She remained for a moment silent, creating great havoc in her work I am
sure, from the glance of surprise and vexation she afterwards threw it.Then, in a hesitating voice, remarked:

"Perhaps you may be willing, then, to give me some advice.The truth is,
I am in a very curious predicament; one from which I don't know how to
escape, and yet which demands immediate action.I should like to tell
you about it; may I?""You may; I shall be only too happy to give you any advice in my power."She drew in her breath with a sort of vague relief, though her forehead
did not lose its frown."It can all be said in a few words.I have in my possession a package of
papers which were intrusted to me by two ladies, with the understanding
that I should neither return nor destroy them without the full
cognizance and expressed desire of both parties, given in person or
writing.That they were to remain in my hands till then, and that
nothing or nobody should extort them from me.""That is easily understood," said I; for she stopped."But, now comes word from one of the ladies, the one, too, most
interested in the matter, that, for certain reasons, the immediate
destruction of those papers is necessary to her peace and safety.""And do you want to know what your duty is in this case?"I could not help it: a flood of conjectures rushing in tumult
over me."It is to hold on to the papers like grim death till released from your
guardianship by the combined wish of both parties."Once pledged in that way, you have no choice.It
would be a betrayal of trust to yield to the solicitations of one party
what you have undertaken to return to both.The fact that grief or loss
might follow your retention of these papers does not release you from
your bond.You have nothing to do with that; besides, you are by no
means sure that the representations of the so-called interested party
are true.You might be doing a greater wrong, by destroying in this way,
what is manifestly considered of value to them both, than by preserving
the papers intact, according to compact."Circumstances alter cases; and in short, it
seems to me that the wishes of the one most interested ought to be
regarded, especially as there is an estrangement between these ladies
which may hinder the other's consent from ever being obtained.""No," said I; "two wrongs never make a right; nor are we at liberty to
do an act of justice at the expense of an injustice.The papers must be
preserved, Mrs.Her head sank very despondingly; evidently it had been her wish to
please the interested party."Law is very hard," she said; "very hard.""This is not only law, but plain duty," I remarked."Suppose a case
different; suppose the honor and happiness of the other party depended
upon the preservation of the papers; where would your duty be then?""But----"

"A contract is a contract," said I, "and cannot be tampered with.Having
accepted the trust and given your word, you are obliged to fulfil, to
the letter, all its conditions.It would be a breach of trust for you to
return or destroy the papers without the mutual consent necessary."An expression of great gloom settled slowly over her features."I
suppose you are right," said she, and became silent.Watching her, I thought to myself, "If I were Mr.Gryce, or even Q, I
would never leave this seat till I had probed this matter to the bottom,
learned the names of the parties concerned, and where those precious
papers are hidden, which she declares to be of so much importance."But
being neither, I could only keep her talking upon the subject until
she should let fall some word that might serve as a guide to my further
enlightenment; I therefore turned, with the intention of asking her
some question, when my attention was attracted by the figure of a woman
coming out of the back-door of the neighboring house, who, for general
dilapidation and uncouthness of bearing, was a perfect type of the style
of tramp of whom we had been talking at the supper table.Gnawing a
crust which she threw away as she reached the street, she trudged down
the path, her scanty dress, piteous in its rags and soil, flapping in
the keen spring wind, and revealing ragged shoes red with the mud of the
highway."There is a customer that may interest you," said I.

Mrs.Belden seemed to awake from a trance.Rising slowly, she looked
out, and with a rapidly softening gaze surveyed the forlorn creature
before her.she muttered; "but I cannot do much for her to-night.A
good supper is all I can give her."And, going to the front door, she bade her step round the house to the
kitchen, where, in another moment, I heard the rough creature's voice
rise in one long "Bless you!"that could only have been produced by the
setting before her of the good things with which Mrs.Belden's larder
seemed teeming.After a decent length of time,
employed as I should judge in mastication, I heard her voice rise once
more in a plea for shelter."The barn, ma'am, or the wood-house.Any place where I can lie out of
the wind."And she commenced a long tale of want and disease, so piteous
to hear that I was not at all surprised when Mrs.Belden told me,
upon re-entering, that she had consented, notwithstanding her previous
determination, to allow the woman to lie before the kitchen fire for the
night."She has such an honest eye," said she; "and charity is my only luxury."The interruption of this incident effectually broke up our conversation.Belden went up-stairs, and for some time I was left alone to ponder
over what I had heard, and determine upon my future course of action.I
had just reached the conclusion that she would be fully as liable to
be carried away by her feelings to the destruction of the papers in her
charge, as to be governed by the rules of equity I had laid down to her,
when I heard her stealthily descend the stairs and go out by the front
door.Distrustful of her intentions, I took up my hat and hastily
followed her.She was on her way down the main street, and my first
thought was, that she was bound for some neighbor's house or perhaps for
the hotel itself; but the settled swing into which she soon altered her
restless pace satisfied me that she had some distant goal in prospect;
and before long I found myself passing the hotel with its appurtenances,
even the little schoolhouse, that was the last building at this end of
the village, and stepping out into the country beyond.But still her fluttering figure hasted on, the outlines of her form,
with its close shawl and neat bonnet, growing fainter and fainter in the
now settled darkness of an April night; and still I followed, walking on
the turf at the side of the road lest she should hear my footsteps and
look round.Over this I could hear her
pass, and then every sound ceased.She had paused, and was evidently
listening.It would not do for me to pause too, so gathering myself into
as awkward a shape as possible, I sauntered by her down the road, but
arrived at a certain point, stopped, and began retracing my steps with a
sharp lookout for her advancing figure, till I had arrived once more at
the bridge.Convinced now that she had discovered my motive for being in her house
and, by leading me from it, had undertaken to supply Hannah with an
opportunity for escape, I was about to hasten back to the charge I had
so incautiously left, when a strange sound heard at my left arrested me.It came from the banks of the puny stream which ran under the bridge,
and was like the creaking of an old door on worn-out hinges.Leaping the fence, I made my way as best I could down the sloping field
in the direction from which the sound came.It was quite dark, and my
progress was slow; so much so, that I began to fear I had ventured upon
a wild-goose chase, when an unexpected streak of lightning shot across
the sky, and by its glare I saw before me what seemed, in the momentary
glimpse I had of it, an old barn.From the rush of waters near at hand,
I judged it to be somewhere on the edge of the stream, and consequently
hesitated to advance, when I heard the sound of heavy breathing near me,
followed by a stir as of some one feeling his way over a pile of loose
boards; and presently, while I stood there, a faint blue light flashed
up from the interior of the barn, and I saw, through the tumbled-down
door that faced me, the form of Mrs.Belden standing with a lighted
match in her hand, gazing round on the four walls that encompassed her.Hardly daring to breathe, lest I should alarm her, I watched her while
she turned and peered at the roof above her, which was so old as to be
more than half open to the sky, at the flooring beneath, which was in
a state of equal dilapidation, and finally at a small tin box which she
drew from under her shawl and laid on the ground at her feet.The sight
of that box at once satisfied me as to the nature of her errand.She was
going to hide what she dared not destroy; and, relieved upon this point,
I was about to take a step forward when the match went out in her hand.While she was engaged in lighting another, I considered that perhaps it
would be better for me not to arouse her apprehensions by accosting her
at this time, and thus endanger the success of my main scheme; but
to wait till she was gone, before I endeavored to secure the box.Accordingly I edged my way up to the side of the barn and waited till
she should leave it, knowing that if I attempted to peer in at the
door, I ran great risk of being seen, owing to the frequent streaks of
lightning which now flashed about us on every side.Minute after minute
went by, with its weird alternations of heavy darkness and sudden
glare; and still she did not come.At last, just as I was about to start
impatiently from my hiding-place, she reappeared, and began to withdraw
with faltering steps toward the bridge.When I thought her quite out of
hearing, I stole from my retreat and entered the barn.It was of course
as dark as Erebus, but thanks to being a smoker I was as well provided
with matches as she had been, and having struck one, I held it up; but
the light it gave was very feeble, and as I did not know just where to
look, it went out before I had obtained more than a cursory glimpse of
the spot where I was.I thereupon lit another; but though I confined my
attention to one place, namely, the floor at my feet, it too went out
before I could conjecture by means of any sign seen there where she had
hidden the box.I now for the first time realized the difficulty before
me.She had probably made up her mind, before she left home, in just
what portion of this old barn she would conceal her treasure; but I had
nothing to guide me: I could only waste matches.A
dozen had been lit and extinguished before I was so much as sure the box
was not under a pile of debris that lay in one corner, and I had taken
the last in my hand before I became aware that one of the broken boards
of the floor was pushed a little out of its proper position.and that board was to be raised, the space beneath examined, and the
box, if there, lifted safely out.I concluded not to waste my resources,
so kneeling down in the darkness, I groped for the board, tried it, and
found it to be loose.Wrenching at it with all my strength, I tore it
free and cast it aside; then lighting my match looked into the hole thus
made.Something, I could not tell what, stone or box, met my eye, but
while I reached for it, the match flew out of my hand.Deploring my
carelessness, but determined at all hazards to secure what I had seen,
I dived down deep into the hole, and in another moment had the object of
my curiosity in my hands.Satisfied at this result of my efforts, I turned to depart, my one wish
now being to arrive home before Mrs.She had
several minutes the start of me; I would have to pass her on the road,
and in so doing might be recognized.Regaining the highway, I started at a brisk pace.For some little
distance I kept it up, neither overtaking nor meeting any one.But
suddenly, at a turn in the road, I came unexpectedly upon Mrs.Belden,
standing in the middle of the path, looking back.Somewhat disconcerted,
I hastened swiftly by her, expecting her to make some effort to stop me.Indeed, I doubt now if she even saw
or heard me.Astonished at this treatment, and still more surprised
that she made no attempt to follow me, I looked back, when I saw what
enchained her to the spot, and made her so unmindful of my presence.The
barn behind us was on fire!Instantly I realized it was the work of my hands; I had dropped a
half-extinguished match, and it had fallen upon some inflammable
substance.Aghast at the sight, I paused in my turn, and stood staring.Higher and
higher the red flames mounted, brighter and brighter glowed the clouds
above, the stream beneath; and in the fascination of watching it all,
I forgot Mrs.But a short, agitated gasp in my vicinity soon
recalled her presence to my mind, and drawing nearer, I heard her
exclaim like a person speaking in a dream, "Well, I didn't mean to do
it"; then lower, and with a certain satisfaction in her tone, "But it's
all right, any way; the thing is lost now for good, and Mary will be
satisfied without any one being to blame."I did not linger to hear more; if this was the conclusion she had come
to, she would not wait there long, especially as the sound of distant
shouts and running feet announced that a crowd of village boys was on
its way to the scene of the conflagration.The first thing I did, upon my arrival at the house, was to assure
myself that no evil effects had followed my inconsiderate desertion of
it to the mercies of the tramp she had taken in; the next to retire to
my room, and take a peep at the box.I found it to be a neat tin coffer,
fastened with a lock.Satisfied from its weight that it contained
nothing heavier than the papers of which Mrs.Belden had spoken, I hid
it under the bed and returned to the sitting-room.I had barely taken a
seat and lifted a book when Mrs.cried she, taking off her bonnet and revealing a face much
flushed with exercise, but greatly relieved in expression; "this _is_
a night!It lightens, and there is a fire somewhere down street, and
altogether it is perfectly dreadful out.I hope you have not been
lonesome," she continued, with a keen searching of my face which I
bore in the best way I could."I had an errand to attend to, but didn't
expect to stay so long."I returned some nonchalant reply, and she hastened from the room to
fasten up the house.I waited, but she did not come back; fearful, perhaps, of betraying
herself, she had retired to her own apartment, leaving me to take care
of myself as best I might.I own that I was rather relieved at this.The
fact is, I did not feel equal to any more excitement that night, and was
glad to put off further action until the next day.As soon, then, as
the storm was over, I myself went to bed, and, after several ineffectual
efforts, succeeded in getting asleep.THE MISSING WITNESS


    "I fled and cried out death."The voice was low and searching; it reached me in my dreams, waked me,
and caused me to look up.Morning had begun to break, and by its light I
saw, standing in the open door leading into the dining-room, the forlorn
figure of the tramp who had been admitted into the house the night
before.Angry and perplexed, I was about to bid her be gone, when, to my
great surprise, she pulled out a red handkerchief from her pocket, and I
recognized Q."Read that," said he, hastily advancing and putting a slip of paper into
my hand.And, without another word or look, left the room, closing the
door behind him.Rising in considerable agitation, I took it to the window, and by the
rapidly increasing light, succeeded in making out the rudely scrawled
lines as follows:

"She is here; I have seen her; in the room marked with a cross in the
accompanying plan.Wait till eight o'clock, then go up.I will contrive
some means of getting Mrs.Sketched below this was the following plan of the upper floor:

Hannah, then, was in the small back room over the dining-room, and I had
not been deceived in thinking I had heard steps overhead, the evening
before.Greatly relieved, and yet at the same time much moved at the
near prospect of being brought face to face with one who we had every
reason to believe was acquainted with the dreadful secret involved in
the Leavenworth murder, I lay down once more, and endeavored to catch
another hour's rest.But I soon gave up the effort in despair, and
contented myself with listening to the sounds of awakening life which
now began to make themselves heard in the house and neighborhood.As Q had closed the door after him, I could only faintly hear Mrs.Belden when she came down-stairs.But the short, surprised exclamation
which she uttered upon reaching the kitchen and finding the tramp gone
and the back-door wide open, came plainly enough to my ears, and for a
moment I was not sure but that Q had made a mistake in thus leaving so
unceremoniously.As she came, in the course of her preparations for breakfast, into the
room adjoining mine, I could hear her murmur to herself:

"Poor thing!She has lived so long in the fields and at the roadside,
she finds it unnatural to be cooped up in the house all night."The effort to eat and appear unconcerned,
to chat and make no mistake,--May I never be called upon to go through
such another!But at last it was over, and I was left free to await
in my own room the time for the dreaded though much-to-be-desired
interview.Slowly the minutes passed; eight o'clock struck, when, just
as the last vibration ceased, there came a loud knock at the backdoor,
and a little boy burst into the kitchen, crying at the top of his voice:
"Papa's got a fit!papa's got a fit; do come!"Rising, as was natural, I hastened towards the kitchen, meeting Mrs.Belden's anxious face in the doorway."A poor wood-chopper down the street has fallen in a fit," she said."Will you please watch over the house while I see what I can do for him?I won't be absent any longer than I can help."And almost without waiting for my reply, she caught up a shawl, threw
it over her head, and followed the urchin, who was in a state of great
excitement, out into the street.Instantly the silence of death seemed to fill the house, and a dread the
greatest I had ever experienced settled upon me.To leave the kitchen,
go up those stairs, and confront that girl seemed for the moment beyond
my power; but, once on the stair, I found myself relieved from the
especial dread which had overwhelmed me, and possessed, instead, of a
sort of combative curiosity that led me to throw open the door which
I saw at the top with a certain fierceness new to my nature, and not
altogether suitable, perhaps, to the occasion.I found myself in a large bedroom, evidently the one occupied by Mrs.Barely stopping to note certain evidences of
her having passed a restless night, I passed on to the door leading into
the room marked with a cross in the plan drawn for me by Q. It was a
rough affair, made of pine boards rudely painted.Pausing before it, I
listened.Raising the latch, I endeavored to enter.Pausing again, I bent my ear to the keyhole.Not a
sound came from within; the grave itself could not have been stiller.Awe-struck and irresolute, I looked about me and questioned what I had
best do.Suddenly I remembered that, in the plan Q had given me, I had
seen intimation of another door leading into this same room from the one
on the opposite side of the hall.Going hastily around to it, I tried
it with my hand.Convinced at last that
nothing was left me but force, I spoke for the first time, and, calling
the girl by name, commanded her to open the door.Receiving no response,
I said aloud with an accent of severity:

"Hannah Chester, you are discovered; if you do not open the door, we
shall be obliged to break it down; save us the trouble, then, and open
immediately."Going back a step, I threw my whole weight against the door.It creaked
ominously, but still resisted.Stopping only long enough to be sure no movement had taken place within,
I pressed against it once more, this time with all my strength, when it
flew from its hinges, and I fell forward into a room so stifling, chill,
and dark that I paused for a moment to collect my scattered senses
before venturing to look around me.In another
moment, the pallor and fixity of the pretty Irish face staring upon me
from amidst the tumbled clothes of a bed, drawn up against the wall at
my side, struck me with so deathlike a chill that, had it not been for
that one instant of preparation, I should have been seriously dismayed.As it was, I could not prevent a feeling of sickly apprehension from
seizing me as I turned towards the silent figure stretched so near, and
observed with what marble-like repose it lay beneath the patchwork quilt
drawn across it, asking myself if sleep could be indeed so like death
in its appearance.For that it was a sleeping woman I beheld, I did not
seriously doubt.There were too many evidences of careless life in the
room for any other inference.The clothes, left just as she had stepped
from them in a circle on the floor; the liberal plate of food placed
in waiting for her on the chair by the door, --food amongst which I
recognized, even in this casual glance, the same dish which we had had
for breakfast --all and everything in the room spoke of robust life and
reckless belief in the morrow.And yet so white was the brow turned up to the bare beams of the
unfinished wall above her, so glassy the look of the half-opened eyes,
so motionless the arm lying half under, half over, the edge of the
coverlid that it was impossible not to shrink from contact with a
creature so sunk in unconsciousness.But contact seemed to be necessary;
any cry which I could raise at that moment would be ineffectual enough
to pierce those dull ears.Nerving myself, therefore, I stooped and
lifted the hand which lay with its telltale scar mockingly uppermost,
intending to speak, call, do something, anything, to arouse her.But at
the first touch of her hand on mine an unspeakable horror thrilled me.It was not only icy cold, but stiff.Dropping it in my agitation, I
started back and again surveyed the face.What sleep ever wore such pallid hues, such accusing
fixedness?Bending once more I listened at the lips.Not a breath, nor a
stir.Shocked to the core of my being, I made one final effort.Tearing
down the clothes, I laid my hand upon her heart.BURNED PAPER


    "I could have better spared a better man."I DO not think I called immediately for help.The awful shock of this
discovery, coming as it did at the very moment life and hope were
strongest within me; the sudden downfall which it brought of all the
plans based upon this woman's expected testimony; and, worst of all, the
dread coincidence between this sudden death and the exigency in which
the guilty party, whoever it was, was supposed to be at that hour were
much too appalling for instant action.I could only stand and stare at
the quiet face before me, smiling in its peaceful rest as if death
were pleasanter than we think, and marvel over the providence which
had brought us renewed fear instead of relief, complication instead of
enlightenment, disappointment instead of realization.For eloquent as is
death, even on the faces of those unknown and unloved by us, the causes
and consequences of this one were much too important to allow the mind
to dwell upon the pathos of the scene itself.Hannah, the girl, was lost
in Hannah the witness.But gradually, as I gazed, the look of expectation which I perceived
hovering about the wistful mouth and half-open lids attracted me, and I
bent above her with a more personal interest, asking myself if she were
quite dead, and whether or not immediate medical assistance would be of
any avail.But the more closely I looked, the more certain I became
that she had been dead for some hours; and the dismay occasioned by this
thought, taken with the regrets which I must ever feel, that I had not
adopted the bold course the evening before, and, by forcing my way to
the hiding-place of this poor creature, interrupted, if not prevented
the consummation of her fate, startled me into a realization of my
present situation; and, leaving her side, I went into the next room,
threw up the window, and fastened to the blind the red handkerchief
which I had taken the precaution to bring with me.Instantly a young man, whom I was fain to believe Q, though he bore
not the least resemblance, either in dress or facial expression to
any renderings of that youth which I had yet seen, emerged from the
tinsmith's house, and approached the one I was in.Observing him cast a hurried glance in my direction, I crossed the
floor, and stood awaiting him at the head of the stairs.he whispered, upon entering the house and meeting my glance from
below; "have you seen her?""Yes," I returned bitterly, "I have seen her!""No; I have had no talk with her."Then, as I perceived him growing
alarmed at my voice and manner, I drew him into Mrs.Belden's room and
hastily inquired: "What did you mean this morning when you informed me
you had seen this girl?that she was in a certain room where I might
find her?""You have, then, been to her room?""No; I have only been on the outside of it.Seeing a light, I crawled up
on to the ledge of the slanting roof last night while both you and Mrs.Belden were out, and, looking through the window, saw her moving round
the room."He must have observed my countenance change, for he stopped."Come," I said, "and see for
yourself!"And, leading him to the little room I had just left, I
pointed to the silent form lying within."You told me I should
find Hannah here; but you did not tell me I should find her in this
condition."he cried with a start: "not dead?"It seemed as if he could not realize it."She is in a heavy sleep, has taken a narcotic----"

"It is not sleep," I said, "or if it is, she will never wake.And, taking the hand once more in mine, I let it fall in its stone
weight upon the bed.Calming down, he stood gazing at her
with a very strange expression upon his face.Suddenly he moved and
began quietly turning over the clothes that were lying on the floor."I am looking for the bit of paper from which I saw her take what I
supposed to be a dose of medicine last night.he cried,
lifting a morsel of paper that, lying on the floor under the edge of the
bed, had hitherto escaped his notice.He handed me the paper, on the inner surface of which I could dimly
discern the traces of an impalpable white powder."This is important," I declared, carefully folding the paper together."If there is enough of this powder remaining to show that the contents
of this paper were poisonous, the manner and means of the girl's death
are accounted for, and a case of deliberate suicide made evident.""I am not so sure of that," he retorted."If I am any judge of
countenances, and I rather flatter myself I am, this girl had no more
idea she was taking poison than I had.She looked not only bright but
gay; and when she tipped up the paper, a smile of almost silly triumph
crossed her face.Belden gave her that dose to take, telling her
it was medicine----"

"That is something which yet remains to be learned; also whether the
dose, as you call it, was poisonous or not.It may be she died of heart
disease."He simply shrugged his shoulders, and pointed first at the plate of
breakfast left on the chair, and secondly at the broken-down door."Yes," I said, answering his look, "Mrs.Belden has been in here this
morning, and Mrs.Belden locked the door when she went out; but that
proves nothing beyond her belief in the girl's hearty condition.""A belief which that white face on its tumbled pillow did not seem to
shake?""Perhaps in her haste she may not have looked at the girl, but have set
the dishes down without more than a casual glance in her direction?""I don't want to suspect anything wrong, but it is such a coincidence!"This was touching me on a sore point, and I stepped back."Well,"
said I, "there is no use in our standing here busying ourselves with
conjectures.and I moved hurriedly
towards the door."Have you forgotten this is but
an episode in the one great mystery we are sent here to unravel?If this
girl has come to her death by some foul play, it is our business to find
it out.""I know; but we can at least take full note of the room and everything
in it before throwing the affair into the hands of strangers.Gryce
will expect that much of us, I am sure."I am
only afraid I can never forget it."the lay of the bed-clothes
around it?the lack there is of all signs of struggle or fear?"Yes, yes; don't make me look at it any more."--rapidly pointing out each
object as he spoke.a calico dress, a shawl,--not the
one in which she was believed to have run away, but an old black
one, probably belonging to Mrs.Then this chest,"--opening
it,--"containing a few underclothes marked,--let us see, ah, with the
name of the lady of the house, but smaller than any she ever wore;
made for Hannah, you observe, and marked with her own name to prevent
suspicion.And then these other clothes lying on the floor, all new,
all marked in the same way.Going over to where he stood I stooped down, when a wash-bowl half full
of burned paper met my eye."I saw her bending over something in this corner, and could not think
what it was.Can it be she is a suicide after all?She has evidently
destroyed something here which she didn't wish any one to see.""Not a scrap, not a morsel left to show what it was; how unfortunate!"Belden must solve this riddle," I cried.Belden must solve the whole riddle," he replied; "the secret
of the Leavenworth murder hangs upon it."Then, with a lingering
look towards the mass of burned paper, "Who knows but what that was a
confession?""Whatever it was," said I, "it is now ashes, and we have got to accept
the fact and make the best of it.""Yes," said he with a deep sigh; "that's so; but Mr.Gryce will never
forgive me for it, never.He will say I ought to have known it was a
suspicious circumstance for her to take a dose of medicine at the very
moment detection stood at her back.""But she did not know that; she did not see you.""We don't know what she saw, nor what Mrs.Women are a
mystery; and though I flatter myself that ordinarily I am a match for
the keenest bit of female flesh that ever walked, I must say that in
this case I feel myself thoroughly and shamefully worsted.""Well, well," I said, "the end has not come yet; who knows what a talk
with Mrs.And, by the way, she will be coming
back soon, and I must be ready to meet her.Everything depends upon
finding out, if I can, whether she is aware of this tragedy or not.It
is just possible she knows nothing about it."And, hurrying him from the room, I pulled the door to behind me, and led
the way down-stairs."Now," said I, "there is one thing you must attend to at once.Gryce acquainting him with this unlooked-for
occurrence.""All right, sir," and Q started for the door."I may not have another opportunity to
mention it.Belden received two letters from the postmaster
yesterday; one in a large and one in a small envelope; if you could find
out where they were postmarked----"

Q put his hand in his pocket."I think I will not have to go far to
find out where one of them came from.And
before I knew it, he had returned up-stairs."THEREBY HANGS A TALE.""IT was all a hoax; nobody was ill; I have been imposed upon, meanly
imposed upon!"Belden, flushed and panting, entered the room
where I was, and proceeded to take off her bonnet; but whilst doing so
paused, and suddenly exclaimed: "What is the matter?"Something very serious has occurred," I replied; "you have been gone
but a little while, but in that time a discovery has been made--" I
purposely paused here that the suspense might elicit from her some
betrayal; but, though she turned pale, she manifested less emotion than
I expected, and I went on--"which is likely to produce very important
consequences.""I always said it would be impossible to keep it secret
if I let anybody into the house; she is so restless.But I forget," she
suddenly said, with a frightened look; "you haven't told me what the
discovery was.Perhaps it isn't what I thought; perhaps----"

I did not hesitate to interrupt her.Belden," I said, "I shall not
try to mitigate the blow.A woman who, in the face of the most urgent
call from law and justice, can receive into her house and harbor there a
witness of such importance as Hannah, cannot stand in need of any great
preparation for hearing that her efforts, have been too successful, that
she has accomplished her design of suppressing valuable testimony, that
law and justice are outraged, and that the innocent woman whom this
girl's evidence might have saved stands for ever compromised in the eyes
of the world, if not in those of the officers of the law."Her eyes, which had never left me during this address, flashed wide with
dismay."I have intended no wrong; I have only
tried to save people.What have you got to do
with all this?What is it to you what I do or don't do?Can it be you are come from Mary Leavenworth to see how I
am fulfilling her commands, and----"

"Mrs.Belden," I said, "it is of small importance now as to who I am, or
for what purpose I am here.But that my words may have the more effect,
I will say, that whereas I have not deceived you, either as to my name
or position, it is true that I am the friend of the Misses Leavenworth,
and that anything which is likely to affect them, is of interest to
me.When, therefore, I say that Eleanore Leavenworth is irretrievably
injured by this girl's death----"

"Death?The burst was too natural, the tone too horror-stricken for me to doubt
for another moment as to this woman's ignorance of the true state of
affairs."Yes," I repeated, "the girl you have been hiding so long and so well is
now beyond your control.I shall never lose from my ears the shriek which she uttered, nor the
wild, "I don't believe it!with which she dashed
from the room and rushed up-stairs.Nor that after-scene when, in the presence of the dead, she stood
wringing her hands and protesting, amid sobs of the sincerest grief and
terror, that she knew nothing of it; that she had left the girl in the
best of spirits the night before; that it was true she had locked her
in, but this she always did when any one was in the house; and that if
she died of any sudden attack, it must have been quietly, for she had
heard no stir all night, though she had listened more than once, being
naturally anxious lest the girl should make some disturbance that would
arouse me.I was in a hurry, and thought she was asleep;
so I set the things down where she could get them and came right away,
locking the door as usual.""It is strange she should have died this night of all others."No, sir; she was even brighter than common; more lively.I never
thought of her being sick then or ever.If I had----"

"You never thought of her being sick?""Why,
then, did you take such pains to give her a dose of medicine last
night?"she protested, evidently under the supposition it was I who
had spoken."Did I, Hannah, did I, poor girl?"stroking the hand that
lay in hers with what appeared to be genuine sorrow and regret.Where she did she get it if you didn't give
it to her?"This time she seemed to be aware that some one besides myself was
talking to her, for, hurriedly rising, she looked at the man with a
wondering stare, before replying."I don't know who you are, sir; but I can tell you this, the girl had no
medicine,--took no dose; she wasn't sick last night that I know of.""Saw her!--the world is crazy, or I am--saw her swallow a powder!How
could you see her do that or anything else?Hasn't she been shut up in
this room for twenty-four hours?""Yes; but with a window like that in the roof, it isn't so very
difficult to see into the room, madam.""Oh," she cried, shrinking, "I have a spy in the house, have I?But I
deserve it; I kept her imprisoned in four close walls, and never came
to look at her once all night.I don't complain; but what was it you say
you saw her take?You think she has poisoned herself, and that I had a
hand in it!""No," I hastened to remark, "he does not think you had a hand in it.He
says he saw the girl herself swallow something which he believes to have
been the occasion of her death, and only asks you now where she obtained
it."I never gave her anything; didn't know she had
anything."Somehow, I believed her, and so felt unwilling to prolong the present
interview, especially as each moment delayed the action which I felt it
incumbent upon us to take.So, motioning Q to depart upon his errand, I
took Mrs.Belden by the hand and endeavored to lead her from the
room.But she resisted, sitting down by the side of the bed with the
expression, "I will not leave her again; do not ask it; here is my
place, and here I will stay," while Q, obdurate for the first time,
stood staring severely upon us both, and would not move, though I urged
him again to make haste, saying that the morning was slipping away, and
that the telegram to Mr."Till that woman leaves the room, I don't; and unless you promise to
take my place in watching her, I don't quit the house."Astonished, I left her side and crossed to him."You carry your suspicions too far," I whispered, "and I think you are
too rude.We have seen nothing, I am sure, to warrant us in any such
action; besides, she can do no harm here; though, as for watching her, I
promise to do that much if it will relieve your mind.""I don't want her watched here; take her below."Are you not assuming a trifle the master?"If I am, it is because I have something in my
possession which excuses my conduct."Agitated now in my turn, I held out my hand."Not while that woman remains in the room."Seeing him implacable, I returned to Mrs."I must entreat you to come with me," said I."This is not a common
death; we shall be obliged to have the coroner here and others.You had
better leave the room and go below.""I don't mind the coroner; he is a neighbor of mine; his coming won't
prevent my watching over the poor girl until he arrives."Belden," I said, "your position as the only one conscious of the
presence of this girl in your house makes it wiser for you not to invite
suspicion by lingering any longer than is necessary in the room where
her dead body lies.""As if my neglect of her now were the best surety of my good intentions
towards her in time past!""It will not be neglect for you to go below with me at my earnest
request.You can do no good here by staying; will, in fact, be doing
harm.So listen to me or I shall be obliged to leave you in charge of
this man and go myself to inform the authorities."This last argument seemed to affect her, for with one look of shuddering
abhorrence at Q she rose, saying, "You have me in your power," and then,
without another word, threw her handkerchief over the girl's face and
left the room.In two minutes more I had the letter of which Q had
spoken in my hands."It is the only one I could find, sir.It was in the pocket of the dress
Mrs.The other must be lying around somewhere,
but I haven't had time to find it.Scarcely noticing at the time with what deep significance he spoke, I
opened the letter.It was the smaller of the two I had seen her draw
under her shawl the day before at the post-office, and read as follows:


    "DEAR, DEAR FRIEND:

    "I am in awful trouble.I cannot
    explain, I can only make one prayer.Destroy what you have,
    to-day, instantly, without question or hesitation.The consent
    of any one else has nothing to do with it.I am
    lost if you refuse.Do then what I ask, and save

    "ONE WHO LOVES YOU."Belden; there was no signature or date,
only the postmark New York; but I knew the handwriting.came in the dry tones which Q seemed to think fit to
adopt on this occasion."And a damning bit of evidence against the one
who wrote it, and the woman who received it!""A terrible piece of evidence, indeed," said I, "if I did not happen to
know that this letter refers to the destruction of something radically
different from what you suspect."Quite; but we will talk of this hereafter.It is time you sent your
telegram, and went for the coroner."And with this we parted; he to perform his role and I
mine.Belden walking the floor below, bewailing her situation,
and uttering wild sentences as to what the neighbors would say of her;
what the minister would think; what Clara, whoever that was, would do,
and how she wished she had died before ever she had meddled with the
affair.Succeeding in calming her after a while, I induced her to sit down and
listen to what I had to say."You will only injure yourself by this
display of feeling," I remarked, "besides unfitting yourself for what
you will presently be called upon to go through."And, laying myself out
to comfort the unhappy woman, I first explained the necessities of the
case, and next inquired if she had no friend upon whom she could call in
this emergency.To my great surprise she replied no; that while she had kind neighbors
and good friends, there was no one upon whom she could call in a case
like this, either for assistance or sympathy, and that, unless I would
take pity on her, she would have to meet it alone--"As I have met
everything," she said, "from Mr.Belden's death to the loss of most of
my little savings in a town fire last year."I was touched by this,--that she who, in spite of her weakness and
inconsistencies of character, possessed at least the one virtue of
sympathy with her kind, should feel any lack of friends.Unhesitatingly,
I offered to do what I could for her, providing she would treat me with
the perfect frankness which the case demanded.To my great relief, she
expressed not only her willingness, but her strong desire, to tell all
she knew."I have had enough secrecy for my whole life," she said.And indeed I do believe she was so thoroughly frightened, that if a
police-officer had come into the house and asked her to reveal secrets
compromising the good name of her own son, she would have done so
without cavil or question."I feel as if I wanted to take my stand out
on the common, and, in the face of the whole world, declare what I have
done for Mary Leavenworth.But first," she whispered, "tell me, for
God's sake, how those girls are situated.I have not dared to ask or
write.The papers say a good deal about Eleanore, but nothing about
Mary; and yet Mary writes of her own peril only, and of the danger she
would be in if certain facts were known.I don't want
to injure them, only to take care of myself."Belden," I said, "Eleanore Leavenworth has got into her
present difficulty by not telling all that was required of her.Mary
Leavenworth--but I cannot speak of her till I know what you have to
divulge.Her position, as well as that of her cousin, is too anomalous
for either you or me to discuss.What we want to learn from you is, how
you became connected with this affair, and what it was that Hannah knew
which caused her to leave New York and take refuge here."Belden, clasping and unclasping her hands, met my gaze with one
full of the most apprehensive doubt."You will never believe me," she
cried; "but I don't know what Hannah knew.I am in utter ignorance of
what she saw or heard on that fatal night; she never told, and I never
asked.She merely said that Miss Leavenworth wished me to secrete her
for a short time; and I, because I loved Mary Leavenworth and admired
her beyond any one I ever saw, weakly consented, and----"

"Do you mean to say," I interrupted, "that after you knew of the murder,
you, at the mere expression of Miss Leavenworth's wishes, continued to
keep this girl concealed without asking her any questions or demanding
any explanations?""Yes, sir; you will never believe me, but it is so.I thought that,
since Mary had sent her here, she must have her reasons; and--and--I
cannot explain it now; it all looks so differently; but I did do as I
have said."You must have had strong reason for
obeying Mary Leavenworth so blindly.""Oh, sir," she gasped, "I thought I understood it all; that Mary, the
bright young creature, who had stooped from her lofty position to make
use of me and to love me, was in some way linked to the criminal, and
that it would be better for me to remain in ignorance, do as I was
bid, and trust all would come right.I did not reason about it; I only
followed my impulse.I couldn't do otherwise; it isn't my nature.When I
am requested to do anything for a person I love, I cannot refuse.""And you love Mary Leavenworth; a woman whom you yourself seem to
consider capable of a great crime?""Oh, I didn't say that; I don't know as I thought that.She might be in
some way connected with it, without being the actual perpetrator.She
could never be that; she is too dainty."Belden," I said, "what do you know of Mary Leavenworth which makes
even that supposition possible?"The white face of the woman before me flushed."I scarcely know what to
reply," she cried."It is a long story, and----"

"Never mind the long story," I interrupted."Let me hear the one vital
reason.""Well," said she, "it is this; that Mary was in an emergency from which
nothing but her uncle's death could release her."But here we were interrupted by the sound of steps on the porch, and,
looking out, I saw Q entering the house alone.Belden where
she was, I stepped into the hall."Well," said I, "what is the matter?"No, gone away; off in a buggy to look after a man that was found some
ten miles from here, lying in a ditch beside a yoke of oxen."Then, as
he saw my look of relief, for I was glad of this temporary delay, said,
with an expressive wink: "It would take a fellow a long time to go to
him--if he wasn't in a hurry--hours, I think.""Very; no horse I could get could travel it faster than a walk.""Well," said I, "so much the better for us.Belden has a long story
to tell, and----"

"Doesn't wish to be interrupted."Yes, sir; if he has to hobble on two sticks.""At what time do you look for him?""_You_ will look for him as early as three o'clock.I shall be among the
mountains, ruefully eying my broken-down team."And leisurely donning
his hat he strolled away down the street like one who has the whole day
on his hands and does not know what to do with it.Belden's story, she at once
composed herself to the task, with the following result.BELDEN'S NARRATIVE


    "Cursed, destructive Avarice,
     Thou everlasting foe to Love and Honor.""Mischief never thrives
     Without the help of Woman."IT will be a year next July since I first saw Mary Leavenworth.I
was living at that time a most monotonous existence.Loving what was
beautiful, hating what was sordid, drawn by nature towards all that
was romantic and uncommon, but doomed by my straitened position and the
loneliness of my widowhood to spend my days in the weary round of plain
sewing, I had begun to think that the shadow of a humdrum old age
was settling down upon me, when one morning, in the full tide of my
dissatisfaction, Mary Leavenworth stepped across the threshold of my
door and, with one smile, changed the whole tenor of my life.This may seem exaggeration to you, especially when I say that her errand
was simply one of business, she having heard I was handy with my needle;
but if you could have seen her as she appeared that day, marked the look
with which she approached me, and the smile with which she left, you
would pardon the folly of a romantic old woman, who beheld a fairy queen
in this lovely young lady.The fact is, I was dazzled by her beauty and
her charms.And when, a few days after, she came again, and crouching
down on the stool at my feet, said she was so tired of the gossip and
tumult down at the hotel, that it was a relief to run away and hide with
some one who would let her act like the child she was, I experienced
for the moment, I believe, the truest happiness of my life.Meeting her
advances with all the warmth her manner invited, I found her ere long
listening eagerly while I told her, almost without my own volition, the
story of my past life, in the form of an amusing allegory.The next day saw her in the same place; and the next; always with the
eager, laughing eyes, and the fluttering, uneasy hands, that grasped
everything they touched, and broke everything they grasped.But the fourth day she was not there, nor the fifth, nor the sixth, and
I was beginning to feel the old shadow settling back upon me, when one
night, just as the dusk of twilight was merging into evening gloom, she
came stealing in at the front door, and, creeping up to my side, put her
hands over my eyes with such a low, ringing laugh, that I started."You don't know what to make of me!"she cried, throwing aside her
cloak, and revealing herself in the full splendor of evening attire."I
don't know what to make of myself.Though it seems folly, I felt that
I must run away and tell some one that a certain pair of eyes have been
looking into mine, and that for the first time in my life I feel
myself a woman as well as a queen."And with a glance in which coyness
struggled with pride, she gathered up her cloak around her, and
laughingly cried:

"Have you had a visit from a flying sprite?Has one little ray of
moonlight found its way into your prison for a wee moment, with Mary's
laugh and Mary's snowy silk and flashing diamonds?and she patted
my cheek, and smiled so bewilderingly, that even now, with all the
dull horror of these after-events crowding upon me, I cannot but feel
something like tears spring to my eyes at the thought of it."And so the Prince has come for you?"I whispered, alluding to a story I
had told her the last time she had visited me; a story in which a girl,
who had waited all her life in rags and degradation for the lordly
knight who was to raise her from a hovel to a throne, died just as her
one lover, an honest peasant-lad whom she had discarded in her pride,
arrived at her door with the fortune he had spent all his days in
amassing for her sake.But at this she flushed, and drew back towards the door."I don't know;
I am afraid not.I--I don't think anything about that.Princes are not
so easily won," she murmured.But she only shook her fairy head, and replied: "No, no; that would be
spoiling the romance, indeed.I have come upon you like a sprite, and
like a sprite I will go."And, flashing like the moonbeam she was, she
glided out into the night, and floated away down the street.When she next came, I observed a feverish excitement in her manner,
which assured me, even plainer than the coy sweetness displayed in
our last interview, that her heart had been touched by her lover's
attentions.Indeed, she hinted as much before she left, saying in a
melancholy tone, when I had ended my story in the usual happy way, with
kisses and marriage, "I shall never marry!"finishing the exclamation
with a long-drawn sigh, that somehow emboldened me to say, perhaps
because I knew she had no mother:

"And why?What reason can there be for such rosy lips saying their
possessor will never marry?"She gave me one quick look, and then dropped her eyes.I feared I had
offended her, and was feeling very humble, when she suddenly replied, in
an even but low tone, "I said I should never marry, because the one man
who pleases me can never be my husband."All the hidden romance in my nature started at once into life."There is nothing to tell," said she; "only I have been so weak as
to"--she would not say, fall in love, she was a proud woman--"admire a
man whom my uncle will never allow me to marry."And she rose as if to go; but I drew her back."Whom your uncle will not
allow you to marry!""No; uncle loves money, but not to such an extent as that.He is the owner of a beautiful place in his own
country----"

"Own country?""No," she returned; "he is an Englishman."I did not see why she need say that in just the way she did, but,
supposing she was aggravated by some secret memory, went on to inquire:
"Then what difficulty can there be?Isn't he--" I was going to say
steady, but refrained."He is an Englishman," she emphasized in the same bitter tone as
before."In saying that, I say it all.Uncle will never let me marry an
Englishman."Such a puerile reason as this had never
entered my mind."He has an absolute mania on the subject," resumed she."I might as well
ask him to allow me to drown myself as to marry an Englishman."A woman of truer judgment than myself would have said: "Then, if that is
so, why not discard from your breast all thought of him?Why dance with
him, and talk to him, and let your admiration develop into love?"But
I was all romance then, and, angry at a prejudice I could neither
understand nor appreciate, I said:

"But that is mere tyranny!And why,
if he does, should you feel yourself obliged to gratify him in a whim so
unreasonable?""Yes," I returned; "tell me everything.""Well, then, if you want to know the worst of me, as you already know
the best, I hate to incur my uncle's displeasure, because--because--I
have always been brought up to regard myself as his heiress, and I
know that if I were to marry contrary to his wishes, he would instantly
change his mind, and leave me penniless.""But," I cried, my romance a little dampened by this admission, "you
tell me Mr.Clavering has enough to live upon, so you would not want;
and if you love--"

Her violet eyes fairly flashed in her amazement."You don't understand," she said; "Mr.Clavering is not poor; but uncle
is rich.I shall be a queen--" There she paused, trembling, and falling
on my breast."Oh, it sounds mercenary, I know, but it is the fault of
my bringing up.And yet"--her whole face softening with the light of
another emotion, "I cannot say to Henry Clavering, 'Go!my prospects are
dearer to me than you!'said I, determined to get at the truth of the
matter if possible.If you knew me, you
would say it was."And, turning, she took her stand before a picture
that hung on the wall of my sitting-room.It was one of a pair of good photographs I possessed."Yes," I remarked, "that is why I prize it."She did not seem to hear me; she was absorbed in gazing at the exquisite
face before her."That is a winning face," I heard her say.I wonder if she would ever hesitate between love and money.I
do not believe she would," her own countenance growing gloomy and sad
as she said so; "she would think only of the happiness she would confer;
she is not hard like me.I think she had forgotten my presence, for at the mention of her
cousin's name she turned quickly round with a half suspicious look,
saying lightly:

"My dear old Mamma Hubbard looks horrified.She did not know she had
such a very unromantic little wretch for a listener, when she was
telling all those wonderful stories of Love slaying dragons, and living
in caves, and walking over burning ploughshares as if they were tufts of
spring grass?""No," I said, taking her with an irresistible impulse of admiring
affection into my arms; "but if I had, it would have made no difference.I should still have talked about love, and of all it can do to make this
weary workaday world sweet and delightful."Then you do not think me such a wretch?"I thought her the winsomest being in the world, and
frankly told her so.Instantly she brightened into her very gayest self.Not that I thought then, much less do I think now, she partially
cared for my good opinion; but her nature demanded admiration, and
unconsciously blossomed under it, as a flower under the sunshine."And you will still let me come and tell you how bad I am,--that is, if
I go on being bad, as I doubtless shall to the end of the chapter?"Not if I should do a dreadful thing?Not if I should run away with my
lover some fine night, and leave uncle to discover how his affectionate
partiality had been requited?"It was lightly said, and lightly meant, for she did not even wait for my
reply.But its seed sank deep into our two hearts for all that.And for
the next few days I spent my time in planning how I should manage, if
it should ever fall to my lot to conduct to a successful issue so
enthralling a piece of business as an elopement.You may imagine, then,
how delighted I was, when one evening Hannah, this unhappy girl who
is now lying dead under my roof, and who was occupying the position of
lady's maid to Miss Mary Leavenworth at that time, came to my door with
a note from her mistress, running thus:


    "Have the loveliest story of the season ready for me tomorrow; and
    let the prince be as handsome as--as some one you have heard of,
    and the princess as foolish as your little yielding pet,

    "MARY."Which short note could only mean that she was engaged.But the next day
did not bring me my Mary, nor the next, nor the next; and beyond hearing
that Mr.Leavenworth had returned from his trip I received neither word
nor token.Two more days dragged by, when, just as twilight set in, she
came.It had been a week since I had seen her, but it might have been
a year from the change I observed in her countenance and expression.I
could scarcely greet her with any show of pleasure, she was so unlike
her former self."You
expected revelations, whispered hopes, and all manner of sweet
confidences; and you see, instead, a cold, bitter woman, who for
the first time in your presence feels inclined to be reserved and
uncommunicative.""That is because you have had more to trouble than encourage you in your
love," I returned, though not without a certain shrinking, caused more
by her manner than words.She did not reply to this, but rose and paced the floor, coldly at
first, but afterwards with a certain degree of excitement that proved
to be the prelude to a change in her manner; for, suddenly pausing, she
turned to me and said: "Mr."Yes, my uncle commanded me to dismiss him, and I obeyed."The work dropped from my hands, in my heartfelt disappointment."Yes; he had not been in the house five minutes before Eleanore told
him."I was foolish enough
to give her the cue in my first moment of joy and weakness.I did
not think of the consequences; but I might have known."I do not call it conscientiousness to tell another's secrets," I
returned."That is because you are not Eleanore."Not having a reply for this, I said, "And so your uncle did not regard
your engagement with favor?"Did I not tell you he would never allow me to marry an
Englishman?Let the hard, cruel man have his
way?"She was walking off to look again at that picture which had attracted
her attention the time before, but at this word gave me one little
sidelong look that was inexpressibly suggestive."I obeyed him when he commanded, if that is what you mean."Clavering after having given him your word of honor
to be his wife?""Why not, when I found I could not keep my word.""Then you have decided not to marry him?"She did not reply at once, but lifted her face mechanically to the
picture."My uncle would tell you that I had decided to be governed wholly by
his wishes!"she responded at last with what I felt was self-scornful
bitterness.and instantly blushed, startled that I had called her by her
first name."Is it not my manifest
duty to be governed by my uncle's wishes?Has he not brought me up from
childhood?made me all I am, even to the
love of riches which he has instilled into my soul with every gift he
has thrown into my lap, every word he has dropped into my ear, since I
was old enough to know what riches meant?Is it for me now to turn my
back upon fostering care so wise, beneficent, and free, just because
a man whom I have known some two weeks chances to offer me in exchange
what he pleases to call his love?""But," I feebly essayed, convinced perhaps by the tone of sarcasm in
which this was uttered that she was not far from my way of thinking
after all, "if in two weeks you have learned to love this man more than
everything else, even the riches which make your uncle's favor a thing
of such moment--"

"Well," said she, "what then?""Why, then I would say, secure your happiness with the man of your
choice, if you have to marry him in secret, trusting to your influence
over your uncle to win the forgiveness he never can persistently deny."You should have seen the arch expression which stole across her face
at that."Would it not be better," she asked, creeping to my arms, and
laying her head on my shoulder, "would it not be better for me to make
sure of that uncle's favor first, before undertaking the hazardous
experiment of running away with a too ardent lover?"Struck by her manner, I lifted her face and looked at it."Oh, my darling," said I, "you have not, then dismissed Mr."I have sent him away," she whispered demurely."Oh, you dear old Mamma Hubbard; what a matchmaker you are, to be sure!You appear as much interested as if you were the lover yourself.""He will wait for me," said she.The next day I submitted to her the plan I had formed for her
clandestine intercourse with Mr.It was for them both to
assume names, she taking mine, as one less liable to provoke conjecture
than a strange name, and he that of LeRoy Robbins.The plan pleased
her, and with the slight modification of a secret sign being used on the
envelope, to distinguish her letters from mine, was at once adopted.And so it was I took the fatal step that has involved me in all this
trouble.With the gift of my name to this young girl to use as she
would and sign what she would, I seemed to part with what was left me of
judgment and discretion.Henceforth, I was only her scheming, planning,
devoted slave; now copying the letters which she brought me, and
enclosing them to the false name we had agreed upon, and now busying
myself in devising ways to forward to her those which I received from
him, without risk of discovery.Hannah was the medium we employed, as
Mary felt it would not be wise for her to come too often to my house.To this girl's charge, then, I gave such notes as I could not forward in
any other way, secure in the reticence of her nature, as well as in her
inability to read, that these letters addressed to Mrs.Amy Belden would
arrive at their proper destination without mishap.At all events, no difficulty that I ever heard of arose out
of the use of this girl as a go-between.Clavering, who had left an invalid mother
in England, was suddenly summoned home.He prepared to go, but, flushed
with love, distracted by doubts, smitten with the fear that, once
withdrawn from the neighborhood of a woman so universally courted as
Mary, he would stand small chance of retaining his position in her
regard, he wrote to her, telling his fears and asking her to marry him
before he went."Make me your husband, and I will follow your wishes in all things,"
he wrote."The certainty that you are mine will make parting possible;
without it, I cannot go; no, not if my mother should die without the
comfort of saying good-bye to her only child."By some chance she was in my house when I brought this letter from the
post-office, and I shall never forget how she started when she read it.But, from looking as if she had received an insult, she speedily settled
down into a calm consideration of the subject, writing and delivering
into my charge for copying a few lines in which she promised to accede
to his request, if he would agree to leave the public declaration of the
marriage to her discretion, and consent to bid her farewell at the door
of the church or wherever the ceremony of marriage should take place,
never to come into her presence again till such declaration had been
made.Of course this brought in a couple of days the sure response:
"Anything, so you will be mine."And Amy Belden's wits and powers of planning were all summoned into
requisition for the second time, to devise how this matter could be
arranged without subjecting the parties to the chance of detection.In the first place, it was essential
that the marriage should come off within three days, Mr.Clavering
having, upon the receipt of her letter, secured his passage upon a
steamer that sailed on the following Saturday; and, next, both he and
Miss Leavenworth were too conspicuous in their personal appearance to
make it at all possible for them to be secretly married anywhere within
gossiping distance of this place.And yet it was desirable that the
scene of the ceremony should not be too far away, or the time occupied
in effecting the journey to and from the place would necessitate an
absence from the hotel on the part of Miss Leavenworth long enough to
arouse the suspicions of Eleanore; something which Mary felt it wiser
to avoid.Her uncle, I have forgotten to say, was not here--having gone
away again shortly after the apparent dismissal of Mr.F----, then, was the only town I could think of which combined the two
advantages of distance and accessibility.Although upon the railroad, it
was an insignificant place, and had, what was better yet, a very obscure
man for its clergyman, living, which was best of all, not ten rods from
the depot.Making inquiries, I found that it
could be done, and, all alive to the romance of the occasion, proceeded
to plan the details.And now I am coming to what might have caused the overthrow of the
whole scheme: I allude to the detection on the part of Eleanore of the
correspondence between Mary and Mr.Hannah,
who, in her frequent visits to my house, had grown very fond of my
society, had come in to sit with me for a while one evening.She had not
been in the house, however, more than ten minutes, before there came a
knock at the front door; and going to it I saw Mary, as I supposed, from
the long cloak she wore, standing before me.Thinking she had come with
a letter for Mr.Clavering, I grasped her arm and drew her into the
hall, saying, "Have you got it?I must post it to-night, or he will not
receive it in time."There I paused, for, the panting creature I had by the arm turning upon
me, I saw myself confronted by a stranger."You have made a mistake," she cried."I am Eleanore Leavenworth, and I
have come for my girl Hannah.I could only raise my hand in apprehension, and point to the girl
sitting in the corner of the room before her.Miss Leavenworth
immediately turned back."Hannah, I want you," said she, and would have left the house without
another word, but I caught her by the arm."Oh, miss--" I began, but she gave me such a look, I dropped her arm.And, with a glance to see if Hannah were following her,
she went out.For an hour I sat crouched on the stair just where she had left me.Then
I went to bed, but I did not sleep a wink that night.You can imagine,
then, my wonder when, with the first glow of the early morning light,
Mary, looking more beautiful than ever, came running up the steps and
into the room where I was, with the letter for Mr.I cried in my joy and relief, "didn't she understand me, then?"The gay look on Mary's face turned to one of reckless scorn."If you
mean Eleanore, yes.I couldn't keep it secret after the
mistake you made last evening; so I did the next best thing, told her
the truth.""Not that you were about to be married?""And you did not find her as angry as you expected?""I will not say that; she was angry enough.And yet," continued Mary,
with a burst of self-scornful penitence, "I will not call Eleanore's
lofty indignation anger.She was grieved, Mamma Hubbard, grieved."And
with a laugh which I believe was rather the result of her own relief
than of any wish to reflect on her cousin, she threw her head on one
side and eyed me with a look which seemed to say, "Do I plague you so
very much, you dear old Mamma Hubbard?"She did plague me, and I could not conceal it."And will she not tell
her uncle?"The naive expression on Mary's face quickly changed.I felt a heavy hand, hot with fever, lifted from my heart.The plan agreed upon between us for the carrying out of our intentions
was this.At the time appointed, Mary was to excuse herself to her
cousin upon the plea that she had promised to take me to see a friend
in the next town.She was then to enter a buggy previously ordered, and
drive here, where I was to join her.We were then to proceed immediately
to the minister's house in F----, where we had reason to believe we
should find everything prepared for us.But in this plan, simple as it
was, one thing was forgotten, and that was the character of Eleanore's
love for her cousin.That her suspicions would be aroused we did
not doubt; but that she would actually follow Mary up and demand an
explanation of her conduct, was what neither she, who knew her so well,
nor I, who knew her so little, ever imagined possible.Mary, who had followed out the
programme to the point of leaving a little note of excuse on Eleanore's
dressing-table, had come to my house, and was just taking off her long
cloak to show me her dress, when there came a commanding knock at
the front door.Hastily pulling her cloak about her I ran to open it,
intending, you may be sure, to dismiss my visitor with short ceremony,
when I heard a voice behind me say, "Good heavens, it is Eleanore!"and,
glancing back, saw Mary looking through the window-blind upon the porch
without.why, open the door and let her in; I am not afraid of Eleanore."I immediately did so, and Eleanore Leavenworth, very pale, but with
a resolute countenance, walked into the house and into this room,
confronting Mary in very nearly the same spot where you are now sitting."I have come," said she, lifting a face whose expression of mingled
sweetness and power I could not but admire, even in that moment of
apprehension, "to ask you without any excuse for my request, if you will
allow me to accompany you upon your drive this morning?"Mary, who had drawn herself up to meet some word of accusation or
appeal, turned carelessly away to the glass."I am very sorry," she
said, "but the buggy holds only two, and I shall be obliged to refuse.""But I do not wish your company, Eleanore.We are off on a pleasure
trip, and desire to have our fun by ourselves.""And you will not allow me to accompany you?""I cannot prevent your going in another carriage."Eleanore's face grew yet more earnest in its expression."Mary," said
she, "we have been brought up together.I am your sister in affection
if not in blood, and I cannot see you start upon this adventure with no
other companion than this woman.Then tell me, shall I go with you, as a
sister, or on the road behind you as the enforced guardian of your honor
against your will?""Now is it discreet or honorable in you to do this?"Mary's haughty lip took an ominous curve."The same hand that raised you
has raised me," she cried bitterly."This is no time to speak of that," returned Eleanore.All the antagonism of her nature was
aroused.She looked absolutely Juno-like in her wrath and reckless
menace."Eleanore," she cried, "I am going to F---- to marry Mr._Now_ do you wish to accompany me?"Leaping forward, she grasped her cousin's
arm and shook it."To witness the marriage, if it be a true one; to step between you
and shame if any element of falsehood should come in to affect its
legality."Mary's hand fell from her cousin's arm."I do not understand you,"
said she."I thought you never gave countenance to what you considered
wrong.""Nor do I. Any one who knows me will understand that I do not give my
approval to this marriage just because I attend its ceremonial in the
capacity of an unwilling witness.""Because I value your honor above my own peace.Because I love our
common benefactor, and know that he would never pardon me if I let his
darling be married, however contrary her union might be to his wishes,
without lending the support of my presence to make the transaction at
least a respectable one.""But in so doing you will be involved in a world of deception--which you
hate."Clavering does not return with me, Eleanore."Mary's face crimsoned, and she turned slowly away."What every other girl does under such circumstances, I suppose.The
development of more reasonable feelings in an obdurate parent's heart."Eleanore sighed, and a short silence ensued, broken by Eleanore's
suddenly falling upon her knees, and clasping her cousin's hand."Oh,
Mary," she sobbed, her haughtiness all disappearing in a gush of wild
entreaty, "consider what you are doing!Think, before it is too late, of
the consequences which must follow such an act as this.Marriage founded
upon deception can never lead to happiness.Love would have led you either to have dismissed Mr.Clavering at once,
or to have openly accepted the fate which a union with him would bring.Only passion stoops to subterfuge like this.And you," she continued,
rising and turning toward me in a sort of forlorn hope very touching
to see, "can you see this young motherless girl, driven by caprice, and
acknowledging no moral restraint, enter upon the dark and crooked path
she is planning for herself, without uttering one word of warning and
appeal?Tell me, mother of children dead and buried, what excuse you
will have for your own part in this day's work, when she, with her
face marred by the sorrows which must follow this deception, comes to
you----"

"The same excuse, probably," Mary's voice broke in, chill and strained,
"which you will have when uncle inquires how you came to allow such an
act of disobedience to be perpetrated in his absence: that she could not
help herself, that Mary would gang her ain gait, and every one around
must accommodate themselves to it."It was like a draught of icy air suddenly poured into a room heated up
to fever point.Eleanore stiffened immediately, and drawing back, pale
and composed, turned upon her cousin with the remark:

"Then nothing can move you?"The curling of Mary's lips was her only reply.Raymond, I do not wish to weary you with my feelings, but the first
great distrust I ever felt of my wisdom in pushing this matter so far
came with that curl of Mary's lip.More plainly than Eleanore's words it
showed me the temper with which she was entering upon this undertaking;
and, struck with momentary dismay, I advanced to speak when Mary stopped
me."There, now, Mamma Hubbard, don't you go and acknowledge that you
are frightened, for I won't hear it.I have promised to marry Henry
Clavering to-day, and I am going to keep my word--if I don't love him,"
she added with bitter emphasis.Then, smiling upon me in a way which
caused me to forget everything save the fact that she was going to her
bridal, she handed me her veil to fasten.As I was doing this, with very
trembling fingers, she said, looking straight at Eleanore:

"You have shown yourself more interested in my fate than I had any
reason to expect.Will you continue to display this concern all the way
to F----, or may I hope for a few moments of peace in which to dream
upon the step which, according to you, is about to hurl upon me such
dreadful consequences?""If I go with you to F----," Eleanore returned, "it is as a witness, no
more."Very well, then," Mary said, dimpling with sudden gayety; "I suppose
I shall have to accept the situation.Mamma Hubbard, I am so sorry to
disappoint you, but the buggy _won't_ hold three.If you are good you
shall be the first to congratulate me when I come home to-night."And,
almost before I knew it, the two had taken their seats in the buggy that
was waiting at the door."Good-by," cried Mary, waving her hand from the
back; "wish me much joy--of my ride."I tried to do so, but the words wouldn't come.I could only wave my hand
in response, and rush sobbing into the house.Of that day, and its long hours of alternate remorse and anxiety, I
cannot trust myself to speak.Let me come at once to the time when,
seated alone in my lamp-lighted room, I waited and watched for the token
of their return which Mary had promised me.It came in the shape of Mary
herself, who, wrapped in her long cloak, and with her beautiful face
aglow with blushes, came stealing into the house just as I was beginning
to despair.A strain of wild music from the hotel porch, where they were having a
dance, entered with her, producing such a weird effect upon my fancy
that I was not at all surprised when, in flinging off her cloak, she
displayed garments of bridal white and a head crowned with snowy roses.I cried, bursting into tears; "you are then----"

"Mrs."Without a bridal," I murmured, taking her passionately into my embrace.Nestling close to me, she gave
herself up for one wild moment to a genuine burst of tears, saying
between her sobs all manner of tender things; telling me how she loved
me, and how I was the only one in all the world to whom she dared come
on this, her wedding night, for comfort or congratulation, and of how
frightened she felt now it was all over, as if with her name she had
parted with something of inestimable value."And does not the thought of having made some one the proudest of men
solace you?"I asked, more than dismayed at this failure of mine to make
these lovers happy."I don't know," she sobbed."What satisfaction can it be for him to
feel himself tied for life to a girl who, sooner than lose a prospective
fortune, subjected him to such a parting?""Tell me about it," said I.

But she was not in the mood at that moment.The excitement of the day
had been too much for her.A thousand fears seemed to beset her mind.Crouching down on the stool at my feet, she sat with her hands folded
and a glare on her face that lent an aspect of strange unreality to her
brilliant attire.The thought haunts me
every moment; how can I keep it secret!""Why, is there any danger of its being known?""It all went off well, but----"

"Where is the danger, then?""I cannot say; but some deeds are like ghosts.They will not be laid;
they reappear; they gibber; they make themselves known whether we will
or not.I was mad, reckless, what you
will.But ever since the night has come, I have felt it crushing upon me
like a pall that smothers life and youth and love out of my heart.While
the sunlight remained I could endure it; but now--oh, Auntie, I have
done something that will keep me in constant fear.I have allied myself
to a living apprehension."For two hours I have played at being gay.Dressed in my bridal white,
and crowned with roses, I have greeted my friends as if they were
wedding-guests, and made believe to myself that all the compliments
bestowed upon me--and they are only too numerous--were just so many
congratulations upon my marriage.But it was no use; Eleanore knew it
was no use.She has gone to her room to pray, while I--I have come here
for the first time, perhaps for the last, to fall at some one's feet and
cry,--' God have mercy upon me!'""Oh, Mary, have I only
succeeded, then, in making you miserable?"She did not answer; she was engaged in picking up the crown of roses
which had fallen from her hair to the floor."If I had not been taught to love money so!""If,
like Eleanore, I could look upon the splendor which has been ours from
childhood as a mere accessory of life, easy to be dropped at the call of
duty or affection!If prestige, adulation, and elegant belongings were
not so much to me; or love, friendship, and domestic happiness more!If only I could walk a step without dragging the chain of a thousand
luxurious longings after me.Imperious as she often is in
her beautiful womanhood, haughty as she can be when the delicate quick
of her personality is touched too rudely, I have known her to sit by the
hour in a low, chilly, ill-lighted and ill-smelling garret, cradling a
dirty child on her knee, and feeding with her own hand an impatient old
woman whom no one else would consent to touch.they talk about
repentance and a change of heart!If some one or something would only
change mine!no hope of my ever being
anything else than what I am: a selfish, wilful, mercenary girl."Nor was this mood a mere transitory one.That same night she made a
discovery which increased her apprehension almost to terror.This was
nothing less than the fact that Eleanore had been keeping a diary of
the last few weeks."Oh," she cried in relating this to me the next day,
"what security shall I ever feel as long as this diary of hers remains
to confront me every time I go into her room?And she will not consent
to destroy it, though I have done my best to show her that it is a
betrayal of the trust I reposed in her.She says it is all she has to
show in the way of defence, if uncle should ever accuse her of treachery
to him and his happiness.She promises to keep it locked up; but what
good will that do!A thousand accidents might happen, any of them
sufficient to throw it into uncle's hands.I shall never feel safe for a
moment while it exists."I endeavored to calm her by saying that if Eleanore was without malice,
such fears were groundless.But she would not be comforted, and seeing
her so wrought up, I suggested that Eleanore should be asked to trust it
into my keeping till such time as she should feel the necessity of using
it."O yes," she cried; "and I will
put my certificate with it, and so get rid of all my care at once."And before the afternoon was over, she had seen Eleanore and made her
request.It was acceded to with this proviso, that I was neither to destroy nor
give up all or any of the papers except upon their united demand.A
small tin box was accordingly procured, into which were put all the
proofs of Mary's marriage then existing, viz.Clavering's letters, and such leaves from Eleanore's diary as referred
to this matter.It was then handed over to me with the stipulation
I have already mentioned, and I stowed it away in a certain closet
upstairs, where it has lain undisturbed till last night.Belden paused, and, blushing painfully, raised her eyes to
mine with a look in which anxiety and entreaty were curiously blended."I don't know what you will say," she began, "but, led away by my
fears, I took that box out of its hiding-place last evening and,
notwithstanding your advice, carried it from the house, and it is
now----"

"In my possession," I quietly finished.I don't think I ever saw her look more astounded, not even when I told
her of Hannah's death."I left it last
night in the old barn that was burned down.I merely meant to hide it
for the present, and could think of no better place in my hurry; for the
barn is said to be haunted--a man hung himself there once--and no one
ever goes there.she cried, "unless----"

"Unless I found and brought it away before the barn was destroyed," I
suggested."Yes," said I. Then, as I felt my own countenance redden, hastened to
add: "We have been playing strange and unaccustomed parts, you and I.
Some time, when all these dreadful events shall be a mere dream of the
past, we will ask each other's pardon.The
box is safe, and I am anxious to hear the rest of your story."This seemed to compose her, and after a minute she continued:

Mary seemed more like herself after this.Leavenworth's return and their subsequent preparations for departure,
I saw but little more of her, what I did see was enough to make me
fear that, with the locking up of the proofs of her marriage, she was
indulging the idea that the marriage itself had become void.But I may
have wronged her in this.The story of those few weeks is almost finished.On the eve of the day
before she left, Mary came to my house to bid me good-by.She had a
present in her hand the value of which I will not state, as I did not
take it, though she coaxed me with all her prettiest wiles.But she said
something that night that I have never been able to forget.I had been speaking of my hope that before two months had elapsed she
would find herself in a position to send for Mr.Clavering, and that
when that day came I should wish to be advised of it; when she suddenly
interrupted me by saying:

"Uncle will never be won upon, as you call it, while he lives.If I was
convinced of it before, I am sure of it now.Nothing but his death will
ever make it possible for me to send for Mr.Then, seeing
me look aghast at the long period of separation which this seemed to
betoken, blushed a little and whispered: "The prospect looks somewhat
dubious, doesn't it?"But," said I, "your uncle is only little past the prime of life and
appears to be in robust health; it will be years of waiting, Mary.""I don't know," she muttered, "I think not.Uncle is not as strong as he
looks and--" She did not say any more, horrified perhaps at the turn the
conversation was taking.But there was an expression on her countenance
that set me thinking at the time, and has kept me thinking ever since.Not that any actual dread of such an occurrence as has since happened
came to oppress my solitude during the long months which now intervened.I was as yet too much under the spell of her charm to allow anything
calculated to throw a shadow over her image to remain long in my
thoughts.But when, some time in the fall, a letter came to me
personally from Mr.Clavering, filled with a vivid appeal to tell
him something of the woman who, in spite of her vows, doomed him to a
suspense so cruel, and when, on the evening of the same day, a friend
of mine who had just returned from New York spoke of meeting Mary
Leavenworth at some gathering, surrounded by manifest admirers, I began
to realize the alarming features of the affair, and, sitting down, I
wrote her a letter.Not in the strain in which I had been accustomed to
talk to her,--I had not her pleading eyes and trembling, caressing hands
ever before me to beguile my judgment from its proper exercise,--but
honestly and earnestly, telling her how Mr.Clavering felt, and what a
risk she ran in keeping so ardent a lover from his rights.Robbins out of my calculations for the present, and
advise you to do the same.As for the gentleman himself, I have told him
that when I could receive him I would be careful to notify him."But do not let him be discouraged," she added in a postscript."When he
does receive his happiness, it will be a satisfying one."Ah, it is that _when_ which is likely to ruin all!But, intent only upon fulfilling her will, I sat down and wrote a letter
to Mr.Clavering, in which I stated what she had said, and begged him
to have patience, adding that I would surely let him know if any change
took place in Mary or her circumstances.And, having despatched it to
his address in London, awaited the development of events.In two weeks I heard of the sudden
death of Mr.Stebbins, the minister who had married them; and while
yet laboring under the agitation produced by this shock, was further
startled by seeing in a New York paper the name of Mr.Clavering among
the list of arrivals at the Hoffman House; showing that my letter to
him had failed in its intended effect, and that the patience Mary had
calculated upon so blindly was verging to its end.I was consequently
far from being surprised when, in a couple of weeks or so afterwards,
a letter came from him to my address, which, owing to the careless
omission of the private mark upon the envelope, I opened, and read
enough to learn that, driven to desperation by the constant failures
which he had experienced in all his endeavors to gain access to her in
public or private, a failure which he was not backward in ascribing
to her indisposition to see him, he had made up his mind to risk
everything, even her displeasure; and, by making an appeal to her uncle,
end the suspense under which he was laboring, definitely and at once."I
want you," he wrote; "dowered or dowerless, it makes little difference
to me.If you will not come of yourself, then I must follow the example
of the brave knights, my ancestors; storm the castle that holds you, and
carry you off by force of arms."Neither can I say I was much surprised, knowing Mary as I did, when, in
a few days from this, she forwarded to me for copying, this reply: "If
Mr.Robbins ever expects to be happy with Amy Belden, let him reconsider
the determination of which he speaks.Not only would he by such an
action succeed in destroying the happiness of her he professes to love,
but run the greater risk of effectually annulling the affection which
makes the tie between them endurable."It was the cry of warning
which a spirited, self-contained creature gives when brought to bay.It
made even me recoil, though I had known from the first that her pretty
wilfulness was but the tossing foam floating above the soundless depths
of cold resolve and most deliberate purpose.What its real effect was upon him and her fate I can only conjecture.All I know is that in two weeks thereafter Mr.Leavenworth was found
murdered in his room, and Hannah Chester, coming direct to my door from
the scene of violence, begged me to take her in and secrete her from
public inquiry, as I loved and desired to serve Mary Leavenworth.UNEXPECTED TESTIMONY


    _Pol._ What do you read, my lord?BELDEN paused, lost in the sombre shadow which these words were
calculated to evoke, and a short silence fell upon the room.It was
broken by my asking for some account of the occurrence she had just
mentioned, it being considered a mystery how Hannah could have found
entrance into her house without the knowledge of the neighbors."Well," said she, "it was a chilly night, and I had gone to bed early
(I was sleeping then in the room off this) when, at about a quarter to
one--the last train goes through R---- at 12.50--there came a low knock
on the window-pane at the head of my bed.Thinking that some of the
neighbors were sick, I hurriedly rose on my elbow and asked who
was there.The answer came in low, muffled tones, 'Hannah, Miss
Leavenworth's girl!Startled at
hearing the well-known voice, and fearing I knew not what, I caught up
a lamp and hurried round to the door.But no sooner had she done so than
my strength failed me, and I had to sit down, for I saw she looked very
pale and strange, was without baggage, and altogether had the appearance
of some wandering spirit.what brings you here in this condition and at this time
of night?''Miss Leavenworth has sent me,' she replied, in the low,
monotonous tone of one repeating a lesson by rote.'She told me to come
here; said you would keep me.I am not to go out of the house, and no
one is to know I am here.'I asked, trembling with a thousand
undefined fears; 'what has occurred?''I dare not say,' she whispered;
'I am forbid; I am just to stay here, and keep quiet.''But,' I began,
helping her to take off her shawl,--the dingy blanket advertised for
in the papers--'you must tell me.She surely did not forbid you to tell
_me?_' 'Yes she did; every one,' the girl replied, growing white in her
persistence, 'and I never break my word; fire couldn't draw it out
of me.'She looked so determined, so utterly unlike herself, as I
remembered her in the meek, unobtrusive days of our old acquaintance,
that I could do nothing but stare at her.'You will keep me,' she said;
'you will not turn me away?''No,' I said, 'I will not turn you away.'Thanking me, she quietly followed me
up-stairs.I put her into the room in which you found her, because it
was the most secret one in the house; and there she has remained ever
since, satisfied and contented, as far as I could see, till this very
same horrible day.""Did you have no explanation with her
afterwards?Did she never give you any information in regard to the
transactions which led to her flight?"Neither then nor when,
upon the next day, I confronted her with the papers in my hand, and the
awful question upon my lips as to whether her flight had been occasioned
by the murder which had taken place in Mr.Leavenworth's household, did
she do more than acknowledge she had run away on this account.Some one
or something had sealed her lips, and, as she said, 'Fire and torture
should never make her speak.'"Another short pause followed this; then, with my mind still hovering
about the one point of intensest interest to me, I said:

"This story, then, this account which you have just given me of Mary
Leavenworth's secret marriage and the great strait it put her
into--a strait from which nothing but her uncle's death could relieve
her--together with this acknowledgment of Hannah's that she had left
home and taken refuge here on the insistence of Mary Leavenworth, is the
groundwork you have for the suspicions you have mentioned?""Yes, sir; that and the proof of her interest in the matter which is
given by the letter I received from her yesterday, and which you say you
have now in your possession."Belden went on in a broken voice, "that it is wrong, in a
serious case like this, to draw hasty conclusions; but, oh, sir, how can
I help it, knowing what I do?"I did not answer; I was revolving in my mind the old question: was it
possible, in face of all these later developments, still to believe Mary
Leavenworth's own hand guiltless of her uncle's blood?"It is dreadful to come to such conclusions," proceeded Mrs.Belden,
"and nothing but her own words written in her own hand would ever have
driven me to them, but----"

"Pardon me," I interrupted; "but you said in the beginning of this
interview that you did not believe Mary herself had any direct hand in
her uncle's murder.Whatever I may think of her influence in inducing
it, I never could imagine her as having anything to do with its actual
performance.whatever was done on that dreadful night,
Mary Leavenworth never put hand to pistol or ball, or even stood by
while they were used; that you may be sure of.Only the man who loved
her, longed for her, and felt the impossibility of obtaining her by any
other means, could have found nerve for an act so horrible.""Then you think----"

"Mr.I do: and oh, sir, when you consider that he
is her husband, is it not dreadful enough?""It is, indeed," said I, rising to conceal how much I was affected by
this conclusion of hers.Something in my tone or appearance seemed to startle her."I hope and
trust I have not been indiscreet," she cried, eying me with something
like an incipient distrust."With this dead girl lying in my house, I
ought to be very careful, I know, but----"

"You have said nothing," was my earnest assurance as I edged towards the
door in my anxiety to escape, if but for a moment, from an atmosphere
that was stifling me."No one can blame you for anything you have
either said or done to-day.But"--and here I paused and walked hurriedly
back,--"I wish to ask one question more.Have you any reason, beyond
that of natural repugnance to believing a young and beautiful woman
guilty of a great crime, for saying what you have of Henry Clavering, a
gentleman who has hitherto been mentioned by you with respect?""No," she whispered, with a touch of her old agitation.I felt the reason insufficient, and turned away with something of the
same sense of suffocation with which I had heard that the missing key
had been found in Eleanore Leavenworth's possession."You must excuse
me," I said; "I want to be a moment by myself, in order to ponder over
the facts which I have just heard; I will soon return "; and without
further ceremony, hurried from the room.By some indefinable impulse, I went immediately up-stairs, and took my
stand at the western window of the large room directly over Mrs.The blinds were closed; the room was shrouded in funereal gloom, but
its sombreness and horror were for the moment unfelt; I was engaged in
a fearful debate with myself.Was Mary Leavenworth the principal, or
merely the accessory, in this crime?Gryce, the convictions of Eleanore, the circumstantial evidence even of
such facts as had come to our knowledge, preclude the possibility
that Mrs.That all the detectives
interested in the affair would regard the question as settled, I did not
doubt; but need it be?Was it utterly impossible to find evidence yet
that Henry Clavering was, after all, the assassin of Mr.Filled with the thought, I looked across the room to the closet where
lay the body of the girl who, according to all probability, had known
the truth of the matter, and a great longing seized me.Oh, why could
not the dead be made to speak?Why should she lie there so silent, so
pulseless, so inert, when a word from her were enough to decide the
awful question?Was there no power to compel those pallid lips to move?Carried away by the fervor of the moment, I made my way to her side.With what a mockery the closed lips and lids confronted
my demanding gaze!A stone could not have been more unresponsive.With a feeling that was almost like anger, I stood there, when--what
was it I saw protruding from beneath her shoulders where they crushed
against the bed?Dizzy with the sudden surprise, overcome with the wild hopes this
discovery awakened, I stooped in great agitation and drew the letter
out.Breaking it hastily open, I took
a glance at its contents.it was the work of the girl
herself!--its very appearance was enough to make that evident!Feeling
as if a miracle had happened, I hastened with it into the other room,
and set myself to decipher the awkward scrawl.This is what I saw, rudely printed in lead pencil on the inside of a
sheet of common writing-paper:

"I am a wicked girl.I have knone things all the time which I had ought
to have told but I didn't dare to he said he would kill me if I did I
mene the tall splendud looking gentulman with the black mustash who I
met coming out of Mister Levenworth's room with a key in his hand the
night Mr.He was so scared he gave me money and
made me go away and come here and keep every thing secret but I can't do
so no longer.I seem to see Miss Elenor all the time crying and asking
me if I want her sent to prisun.And this is
the truth and my last words and I pray every body's forgivness and hope
nobody will blame me and that they wont bother Miss Elenor any more but
go and look after the handsome gentulman with the black mushtash."THE PROBLEM SOLVED



XXXIV.GRYCE RESUMES CONTROL


    "It out-herods Herod."--Richard III

A HALF-HOUR had passed.The train upon which I had every reason to
expect Mr.Gryce had arrived, and I stood in the doorway awaiting with
indescribable agitation the slow and labored approach of the motley
group of men and women whom I had observed leave the depot at the
departure of the cars.Was the telegram of a
nature peremptory enough to make his presence here, sick as he was, an
absolute certainty?The written confession of Hannah throbbing against
my heart, a heart all elation now, as but a short half-hour before it
had been all doubt and struggle, seemed to rustle distrust, and the
prospect of a long afternoon spent in impatience was rising before me,
when a portion of the advancing crowd turned off into a side street,
and I saw the form of Mr.Gryce hobbling, not on two sticks, but very
painfully on one, coming slowly down the street.His face, as he approached, was a study."Well, well, well," he exclaimed, as we met at the gate; "this is a
pretty how-dye-do, I must say.and everything turned
topsy-turvy!Humph, and what do you think of Mary Leavenworth now?"It would therefore seem natural, in the conversation which followed his
introduction into the house and installment in Mrs.Belden's parlor,
that I should begin my narration by showing him Hannah's confession; but
it was not so.Whether it was that I felt anxious to have him go through
the same alternations of hope and fear it had been my lot to experience
since I came to R----; or whether, in the depravity of human nature,
there lingered within me sufficient resentment for the persistent
disregard he had always paid to my suspicions of Henry Clavering to make
it a matter of moment to me to spring this knowledge upon him just at
the instant his own convictions seemed to have reached the point of
absolute certainty, I cannot say.Enough that it was not till I had
given him a full account of every other matter connected with my stay in
this house; not till I saw his eye beaming, and his lip quivering with
the excitement incident upon the perusal of the letter from Mary, found
in Mrs.Belden's pocket; not, indeed, until I became assured from such
expressions as "Tremendous!Nothing
like it since the Lafarge affair!"that in another moment he would be
uttering some theory or belief that once heard would forever stand like
a barrier between us, did I allow myself to hand him the letter I had
taken from under the dead body of Hannah.I shall never forget his expression as he received it; "Good heavens!"I found it lying in her bed when
I went up, a half-hour ago, to take a second look at her."Opening it, he glanced over it with an incredulous air that speedily,
however, turned to one of the utmost astonishment, as he hastily perused
it, and then stood turning it over and over in his hand, examining it."A remarkable piece of evidence," I observed, not without a certain
feeling of triumph; "quite changes the aspect of affairs!"he sharply retorted; then, whilst I stood staring at him in
amazement, his manner was so different from what I expected, looked up
and said: "You tell me that you found this in her bed."Under the body of the girl herself," I returned."I saw one corner of
it protruding from beneath her shoulders, and drew it out.""Was it folded or open, when you first
looked at it?""Folded; fastened up in this envelope," showing it to him.He took it, looked at it for a moment, and went on with his questions."This envelope has a very crumpled appearance, as well as the letter
itself."Yes, not only so, but doubled up as you see."Folded, sealed, and then doubled up
as if her body had rolled across it while alive?"No look as if the thing had been insinuated there
since her death?"I should rather say that to every appearance she held it in
her hand when she lay down, but turning over, dropped it and then laid
upon it."Gryce's eyes, which had been very bright, ominously clouded;
evidently he had been disappointed in my answers, paying the letter
down, he stood musing, but suddenly lifted it again, scrutinized the
edges of the paper on which it was written, and, darting me a quick
look, vanished with it into the shade of the window curtain.His manner
was so peculiar, I involuntarily rose to follow; but he waved me back,
saying:

"Amuse yourself with that box on the table, which you had such an ado
over; see if it contains all we have a right to expect to find in it.I
want to be by myself for a moment."Subduing my astonishment, I proceeded to comply with his request, but
scarcely had I lifted the lid of the box before me when he came hurrying
back, flung the letter down on the table with an air of the greatest
excitement, and cried:

"Did I say there had never been anything like it since the Lafarge
affair?I tell you there has never been anything like it in any affair.It is the rummest case on record!Raymond," and his eyes, in his
excitement, actually met mine for the first time in my experience of
him, "prepare yourself for a disappointment.This pretended confession
of Hannah's is a fraud!""Yes; fraud, forgery, what you will; the girl never wrote it."Amazed, outraged almost, I bounded from my chair.Bending forward, he put the letter into my hand."Look at it," said he;
"examine it closely.Now tell me what is the first thing you notice in
regard to it?""Why, the first thing that strikes me, is that the words are printed,
instead of written; something which might be expected from this girl,
according to all accounts.""That they are printed on the inside of a sheet of ordinary paper----"

"Ordinary paper?""That is, a sheet of commercial note of the ordinary quality.""Why, yes; I should say so."Oh, I see, they run up close to the top of the page;
evidently the scissors have been used here.""In short, it is a large sheet, trimmed down to the size of commercial
note?""Don't you perceive what has been lost by means of this trimming down?""No, unless you mean the manufacturer's stamp in the corner.""But I don't see why the loss of that
should be deemed a matter of any importance."Not when you consider that by it we seem to be deprived of
all opportunity of tracing this sheet back to the quire of paper from
which it was taken?"then you are more of an amateur than I thought you.Don't you
see that, as Hannah could have had no motive for concealing where the
paper came from on which she wrote her dying words, this sheet must have
been prepared by some one else?""No," said I; "I cannot say that I see all that."Why should Hannah, a girl about to
commit suicide, care whether any clue was furnished, in her confession,
to the actual desk, drawer, or quire of paper from which the sheet was
taken, on which she wrote it?""Yet especial pains have been taken to destroy that clue.""But----"

"Then there is another thing.Raymond,
and tell me what you gather from it.""Why," said I, after complying, "that the girl, worn out with constant
apprehension, has made up her mind to do away with herself, and that
Henry Clavering----"

"Henry Clavering?"The interrogation was put with so much meaning, I looked up."Ah, I didn't know that Mr.Clavering's name was mentioned there; excuse
me.""His name is not mentioned, but a description is given so strikingly in
accordance----"

Here Mr."Does it not seem a little surprising to
you that a girl like Hannah should have stopped to describe a man she
knew by name?"Belden's story, don't you?""Consider her accurate in her relation of what took place here a year
ago?""Must believe, then, that Hannah, the go-between, was acquainted with
Mr.If her intention was, as she here
professes, to save Eleanore Leavenworth from the false imputation which
had fallen upon her, she would naturally take the most direct method
of doing it.This description of a man whose identity she could have at
once put beyond a doubt by the mention of his name is the work, not of
a poor, ignorant girl, but of some person who, in attempting to play the
_role_ of one, has signally failed.Belden,
according to you, maintains that Hannah told her, upon entering the
house, that Mary Leavenworth sent her here.But in this document, she
declares it to have been the work of Black Mustache.""I know; but could they not have both been parties to the transaction?""Yes," said he; "yet it is always a suspicious circumstance, when there
is a discrepancy between the written and spoken declaration of a person.But why do we stand here fooling, when a few words from this Mrs.Belden, you talk so much about, will probably settle the whole matter!""I have had thousands
from her to-day, and find the matter no nearer settled than in the
beginning.""_You_ have had," said he, "but I have not."One thing," said I, "before I go.What if Hannah had found the
sheet of paper, trimmed just as it is, and used it without any thought
of the suspicions it would occasion!"said he, "that is just what we are going to find out."Belden was in a flutter of impatience when I entered the
sitting-room.and what did I
imagine this detective would do for us?It was dreadful waiting there
alone for something, she knew not what.I calmed her as well as I could, telling her the detective had not yet
informed me what he could do, having some questions to ask her first.Gryce, who in the short interim of my absence had altered his mood
from the severe to the beneficent, received Mrs.Belden with just that
show of respectful courtesy likely to impress a woman as dependent as
she upon the good opinion of others.and this is the lady in whose house this very disagreeable event
has occurred," he exclaimed, partly rising in his enthusiasm to greet
her."May I request you to sit," he asked; "if a stranger may be allowed
to take the liberty of inviting a lady to sit in her own house.""It does not seem like my own house any longer," said she, but in a sad,
rather than an aggressive tone; so much had his genial way imposed upon
her."Little better than a prisoner here, go and come, keep silence or
speak, just as I am bidden; and all because an unhappy creature, whom
I took in for the most unselfish of motives, has chanced to die in my
house!"This sudden death
ought to be easily explained.You say you had no poison in the house?""And that no one has ever been here to see her?""So that she could not have procured any such thing if she had wished?""Unless," he added suavely, "she had it with her when she came here?"She brought no baggage; and as for her
pocket, I know everything there was in it, for I looked.""Some money in bills, more than you would have expected such a girl to
have, some loose pennies, and a common handkerchief.""Well, then, it is proved the girl didn't die of poison, there being
none in the house."He said this in so convinced a tone she was deceived."That is just what I have been telling Mr.Raymond," giving me a
triumphant look."Must have been heart disease," he went on, "You say she was well
yesterday?""I did not say that; she was, sir, very.""What, ma'am, this girl?"I
should think her anxiety about those she had left behind her in the city
would have been enough to keep her from being very cheerful."Belden; "but it wasn't so.On the
contrary, she never seemed to worry about them at all."not about Miss Eleanore, who, according to the papers, stands
in so cruel a position before the world?But perhaps she didn't know
anything about that--Miss Leavenworth's position, I mean?""Yes, she did, for I told her.I was so astonished I could not keep
it to myself.You see, I had always considered Eleanore as one above
reproach, and it so shocked me to see her name mentioned in the
newspaper in such a connection, that I went to Hannah and read the
article aloud, and watched her face to see how she took it."She looked as if she didn't understand; asked me why I
read such things to her, and told me she didn't want to hear any more;
that I had promised not to trouble her about this murder, and that if I
continued to do so she wouldn't listen."She put her hand over her ears and frowned in such a
sullen way I left the room.""She has, however, mentioned the subject since?"not asked what they were going to do with her mistress?""She has shown, however, that something was preying on her mind--fear,
remorse, or anxiety?""No, sir; on the contrary, she has oftener appeared like one secretly
elated."Gryce, with another sidelong look at me, "that was
very strange and unnatural.I used to try to explain it by thinking her sensibilities
had been blunted, or that she was too ignorant to comprehend the
seriousness of what had happened; but as I learned to know her better,
I gradually changed my mind.There was too much method in her gayety for
that.I could not help seeing she had some future before her for which
she was preparing herself.As, for instance, she asked me one day if I
thought she could learn to play on the piano.And I finally came to the
conclusion she had been promised money if she kept the secret intrusted
to her, and was so pleased with the prospect that she forgot the
dreadful past, and all connected with it.At all events, that was the
only explanation I could find for her general industry and desire to
improve herself, or for the complacent smiles I detected now and then
stealing over her face when she didn't know I was looking."Not such a smile as crept over the countenance of Mr.Gryce at that
moment, I warrant.Belden, "which made her death such a
shock to me.I couldn't believe that so cheerful and healthy a creature
could die like that, all in one night, without anybody knowing anything
about it.But----"

"Wait one moment," Mr."You speak of her endeavors
to improve herself."Her desire to learn things she didn't know; as, for instance, to write
and read writing.She could only clumsily print when she came here."Gryce would take a piece out of my arm, he griped it so.Do you mean to say that since she has been with you
she has learned to write?""Yes, sir; I used to set her copies and----"

"Where are these copies?"Gryce, subduing his voice to its
most professional tone.I'd like
to see some of them.I always made it a point to destroy them as soon as
they had answered their purpose.I didn't like to have such things lying
around."Do," said he; "and I will go with you.I want to take a look at things
upstairs, any way."And, heedless of his rheumatic feet, he rose and
prepared to accompany her."This is getting very intense," I whispered, as he passed me.The smile he gave me in reply would have made the fortune of a Thespian
Mephistopheles.Of the ten minutes of suspense which I endured in their absence, I say
nothing.At the end of that time they returned with their hands full of
paper boxes, which they flung down on the table."The writing-paper of the household," observed Mr.Gryce; "every scrap
and half-sheet which could be found.But, before you examine it, look at
this."And he held out a sheet of bluish foolscap, on which were written
some dozen imitations of that time-worn copy, "BE GOOD AND YOU WILL
BE HAPPY"; with an occasional "_Beauty soon fades,"_ and "_Evil
communications corrupt good manners."_

"What do you think of that?"The only specimens of her writing to be found.Not much like some scrawls we have seen, eh?"Belden says this girl has known how to write as good as this for
more than a week.Took great pride in it, and was continually talking
about how smart she was."Leaning over, he whispered in my ear, "This
thing you have in your hand must have been scrawled some time ago, if
she did it."Then aloud: "But let us look at the paper she used to write
on."Dashing open the covers of the boxes on the table, he took out the loose
sheets lying inside, and scattered them out before me.One glance showed
they were all of an utterly different quality from that used in the
confession."This is all the paper in the house," said he.Belden, who stood in
a sort of maze before us."Wasn't there one stray sheet lying around
somewhere, foolscap or something like that, which she might have got
hold of and used without your knowing it?""No, sir; I don't think so.I had only these kinds; besides, Hannah had
a whole pile of paper like this in her room, and wouldn't have been apt
to go hunting round after any stray sheets.""But you don't know what a girl like that might do.Look at this one,"
said I, showing her the blank side of the confession."Couldn't a sheet
like this have come from somewhere about the house?Examine it well; the
matter is important.""I have, and I say, no, I never had a sheet of paper like that in my
house."Gryce advanced and took the confession from my hand.As he did so,
he whispered: "What do you think now?Many chances that Hannah got up
this precious document?"I shook my head, convinced at last; but in another moment turned to him
and whispered back: "But, if Hannah didn't write it, who did?And how
came it to be found where it was?""That," said he, "is just what is left for us to learn."And, beginning
again, he put question after question concerning the girl's life in the
house, receiving answers which only tended to show that she could not
have brought the confession with her, much less received it from a
secret messenger.Belden's word, the mystery
seemed impenetrable, and I was beginning to despair of success, when Mr.Gryce, with an askance look at me, leaned towards Mrs.Belden and said:

"You received a letter from Miss Mary Leavenworth yesterday, I hear.""Now I want to ask you a question.Was the letter, as you see it, the
only contents of the envelope in which it came?Wasn't there one for
Hannah enclosed with it?"There was nothing in my letter for her; but she had a letter
herself yesterday.we both exclaimed; "and in the mail?""Yes; but it was not directed to her.It was"--casting me a look full of
despair, "directed to me.It was only by a certain mark in the corner of
the envelope that I knew----"

"Good heaven!"Why didn't you
speak of it before?What do you mean by allowing us to flounder about
here in the dark, when a glimpse at this letter might have set us right
at once?""I didn't think anything about it till this minute.I didn't know it was
of importance.I----"

But I couldn't restrain myself."No," said she; "I gave it to the girl yesterday; I haven't seen it
since."and I hastened
towards the door."You won't find it," said Mr.There
is nothing but a pile of burned paper in the corner.By the way, what
could that have been?"She hadn't anything to burn unless it was the
letter.""We will see about that," I muttered, hurrying upstairs and bringing
down the wash-bowl with its contents."If the letter was the one I saw
in your hand at the post-office, it was in a yellow envelope.""Yellow envelopes burn differently from white paper.I ought to be able
to tell the tinder made by a yellow envelope when I see it.Ah, the
letter has been destroyed; here is a piece of the envelope," and I drew
out of the heap of charred scraps a small bit less burnt than the rest,
and held it up."Then there is no use looking here for what the letter contained," said
Mr.Gryce, putting the wash-bowl aside."We will have to ask you, Mrs.It was directed to me, to be sure; but Hannah told
me, when she first requested me to teach her how to write, that she
expected such a letter, so I didn't open it when it came, but gave it to
her just as it was.""You, however, stayed by to see her read it?""No, sir; I was in too much of a flurry.Raymond had just come and I
had no time to think of her.My own letter, too, was troubling me.""But you surely asked her some questions about it before the day was
out?""Yes, sir, when I went up with her tea things; but she had nothing
to say.Hannah could be as reticent as any one I ever knew, when she
pleased.She didn't even admit it was from her mistress."then you thought it was from Miss Leavenworth?""Why, yes, sir; what else was I to think, seeing that mark in the
corner?Though, to be sure, it might have been put there by Mr."You say she was cheerful yesterday; was she so after receiving this
letter?""Yes, sir; as far as I could see.I wasn't with her long; the necessity
I felt of doing something with the box in my charge--but perhaps Mr."It was an exhausting evening, and quite put Hannah out of my head,
but----"

"Wait!"Gryce, and beckoning me into a corner, he whispered,
"Now comes in that experience of Q's.While you are gone from the house,
and before Mrs.Belden sees Hannah again, he has a glimpse of the girl
bending over something in the corner of her room which may very fairly
be the wash-bowl we found there.After which, he sees her swallow, in
the most lively way, a dose of something from a bit of paper."Very well, then," he cried, going back to Mrs."But----"

"But when I went upstairs to bed, I thought of the girl, and going to
her door opened it.The light was extinguished, and she seemed asleep,
so I closed it again and came out.""In something of the same position in which she was found this morning?""And that is all you can tell us, either of her letter or her mysterious
death?"Belden," said he, "you know Mr.Clavering's handwriting when _you_
see it?""Now, which of the two was upon the envelope of the letter you gave
Hannah?"It was a disguised handwriting and might have been that
of either; but I think----"

"Well?""That it was more like hers than his, though it wasn't like hers
either."Gryce enclosed the confession in his hand in the
envelope in which it had been found."You remember how large the letter
was which you gave her?""Oh, it was large, very large; one of the largest sort.""O yes; thick enough for two letters.""Large enough and thick enough to contain this?"laying the confession,
folded and enveloped as it was, before her."Yes, sir," giving it a look of startled amazement, "large enough and
thick enough to contain that."Gryce's eyes, bright as diamonds, flashed around the room, and
finally settled upon a fly traversing my coat-sleeve."Do you need to
ask now," he whispered, in a low voice, "where, and from whom, this
so-called confession comes?"He allowed himself one moment of silent triumph, then rising, began
folding the papers on the table and putting them in his pocket.He took me by the arm and led me across the hall into toe sitting-room."I am going back to New York, I am going to pursue this matter.I am
going to find out from whom came the poison which killed this girl, and
by whose hand this vile forgery of a confession was written.""But," said I, rather thrown off my balance by all this, "Q and the
coroner will be here presently, won't you wait to see them?""No; clues such as are given here must be followed while the trail is
hot; I can't afford to wait.""If I am not mistaken, they have already come," I remarked, as a
tramping of feet without announced that some one stood at the door."That is so," he assented, hastening to let them in.Judging from common experience, we had every reason to fear that an
immediate stop would be put to all proceedings on our part, as soon as
the coroner was introduced upon the scene.But happily for us and the
interest at stake, Dr.Fink, of R ----, proved to be a very sensible
man.He had only to hear a true story of the affair to recognize at
once its importance and the necessity of the most cautious action in
the matter.Further, by a sort of sympathy with Mr.Gryce, all the more
remarkable that he had never seen him before, he expressed himself
as willing to enter into our plans, offering not only to allow us the
temporary use of such papers as we desired, but even undertaking to
conduct the necessary formalities of calling a jury and instituting
an inquest in such a way as to give us time for the investigations we
proposed to make.Gryce was enabled to take the 6:30
train for New York, and I to follow on the 10 p.m.,--the calling of a
jury, ordering of an autopsy, and final adjournment of the inquiry till
the following Tuesday, having all taken place in the interim.FINE WORK


    "No hinge nor loop
     To hang a doubt on!""But yet the pity of it, Iago!Oh, Iago, the pity of it, Iago."Gryce before leaving R---- prepared me for
his next move."The clue to this murder is supplied by the paper on which the
confession is written.Find from whose desk or portfolio this especial
sheet was taken, and you find the double murderer," he had said.Consequently, I was not surprised when, upon visiting his house, early
the next morning, I beheld him seated before a table on which lay
a lady's writing-desk and a pile of paper, till told the desk was
Eleanore's."What," said I, "are you not
satisfied yet of her innocence?""O yes; but one must be thorough.No conclusion is valuable which is not
preceded by a full and complete investigation.Why," he cried, casting
his eyes complacently towards the fire-tongs, "I have even been
rummaging through Mr.Clavering's effects, though the confession bears
the proof upon its face that it could not have been written by him.It
is not enough to look for evidence where you expect to find it.You must
sometimes search for it where you don't.Now," said he, drawing the desk
before him, "I don't anticipate finding anything here of a criminating
character; but it is among the possibilities that I may; and that is
enough for a detective.""Did you see Miss Leavenworth this morning?"I asked, as he proceeded
to fulfil his intention by emptying the contents of the desk upon the
table."Yes; I was unable to procure what I desired without it.And she behaved
very handsomely, gave me the desk with her own hands, and never raised
an objection.To be sure, she had little idea what I was looking for;
thought, perhaps, I wanted to make sure it did not contain the letter
about which so much has been said.But it would have made but little
difference if she had known the truth.This desk contains nothing _we_
want.""Was she well; and had she heard of Hannah's sudden death?"I asked, in
my irrepressible anxiety."Yes, and feels it, as you might expect her to.But let us see what we
have here," said he, pushing aside the desk, and drawing towards him the
stack of paper I have already referred to."I found this pile, just as
you see it, in a drawer of the library table at Miss Mary Leavenworth's
house in Fifth Avenue.If I am not mistaken, it will supply us with the
clue we want.""But----"

"But this paper is square, while that of the confession is of the size
and shape of commercial note?I know; but you remember the sheet used in
the confession was trimmed down.Taking the confession from his pocket and the sheet from the pile before
him, he carefully compared them, then held them out for my inspection.A
glance showed them to be alike in color."Hold them up to the light," said he.I did so; the appearance presented by both was precisely alike.And, laying them both down on the
table, he placed the edges of the two sheets together.The lines on the
one accommodated themselves to the lines on the other; and that question
was decided."I was convinced of it," said he."From the
moment I pulled open that drawer and saw this mass of paper, I knew the
end was come.""But," I objected, in my old spirit of combativeness, "isn't there any
room for doubt?Every family on the
block might easily have specimens of it in their library.""It is letter size, and that has gone out.Leavenworth used it for his manuscript, or I doubt if it would have been
found in his library.But, if you are still incredulous, let us see what
can be done," and jumping up, he carried the confession to the window,
looked at it this way and that, and, finally discovering what he wanted,
came back and, laying it before me, pointed out one of the lines of
ruling which was markedly heavier than the rest, and another which was
so faint as to be almost undistinguishable."Defects like these often
run through a number of consecutive sheets," said he."If we could find
the identical half-quire from which this was taken, I might show you
proof that would dispel every doubt," and taking up the one that lay on
top, he rapidly counted the sheets."It might have
been taken from this one," said he; but, upon looking closely at the
ruling, he found it to be uniformly distinct.The remainder of the paper, some dozen or so half-quires, looked
undisturbed.Gryce tapped his fingers on the table and a frown
crossed his face."Such a pretty thing, if it could have been done!"Suddenly he took up the next half-quire."Count the
sheets," said he, thrusting it towards me, and himself lifting another."Go on with the rest," he cried.I counted the sheets in the next; twelve.He counted those in the one
following, and paused.He counted again, and quietly put them aside."I made a mistake," said
he.Taking another half-quire, he went
through with the same operation;--in vain.With a sigh of impatience he
flung it down on the table and looked up.he cried, "what is
the matter?""There are but eleven sheets in this package," I said, placing it in his
hand.The excitement he immediately evinced was contagious.Oppressed as I
was, I could not resist his eagerness.the light on the inside, the heavy one on the
outside, and both in positions precisely corresponding to those on
this sheet of Hannah's."The veriest doubter must succumb before this," returned I.

With something like a considerate regard for my emotion, he turned away."I am obliged to congratulate myself, notwithstanding the gravity of the
discovery that has been made," said he."It is so neat, so very neat,
and so conclusive.I declare I am myself astonished at the perfection
of the thing.he suddenly cried, in a tone
of the greatest admiration.I declare it is almost a pity to entrap a woman who has done
as well as this--taken a sheet from the very bottom of the pile, trimmed
it into another shape, and then, remembering the girl couldn't write,
put what she had to say into coarse, awkward printing, Hannah-like.or would have been, if any other man than myself had
had this thing in charge."And, all animated and glowing with his
enthusiasm, he eyed the chandelier above him as if it were the
embodiment of his own sagacity.Sunk in despair, I let him go on."Watched, circumscribed
as she was, could she have done any better?I hardly think so; the fact
of Hannah's having learned to write after she left here was fatal.No,
she could not have provided against that contingency."Gryce," I here interposed, unable to endure this any longer; "did
you have an interview with Miss Mary Leavenworth this morning?""No," said he; "it was not in the line of my present purpose to do so.I
doubt, indeed, if she knew I was in her house.A servant maid who has a
grievance is a very valuable assistant to a detective.With Molly at my
side, I didn't need to pay my respects to the mistress."Gryce," I asked, after another moment of silent self-congratulation
on his part, and of desperate self-control on mine, "what do you propose
to do now?You have followed your clue to the end and are satisfied.Such knowledge as this is the precursor of action."we will see," he returned, going to his private desk and
bringing out the box of papers which we had no opportunity of looking at
while in R----."First let us examine these documents, and see if they
do not contain some hint which may be of service to us."And taking out
the dozen or so loose sheets which had been torn from Eleanore's Diary,
he began turning them over.While he was doing this, I took occasion to examine the contents of
the box.Belden had led me to
expect,--a certificate of marriage between Mary and Mr.Clavering and
a half-dozen or more letters.While glancing over the former, a short
exclamation from Mr.He thrust into my hand the leaves of Eleanore's Diary."Most of it is a repetition of what you have already heard from Mrs.Belden, though given from a different standpoint; but there is one
passage in it which, if I am not mistaken, opens up the way to an
explanation of this murder such as we have not had yet.Begin at the
beginning; you won't find it dull."Eleanore's feelings and thoughts during that anxious time, dull!Mustering up my self-possession, I spread out the leaves in their order
and commenced:

"R----, July 6,-"

"Two days after they got there, you perceive," Mr.--A gentleman was introduced to us to-day upon the _piazza_ whom
I cannot forbear mentioning; first, because he is the most perfect
specimen of manly beauty I ever beheld, and secondly, because Mary, who
is usually so voluble where gentlemen are concerned, had nothing to say
when, in the privacy of our own apartment, I questioned her as to the
effect his appearance and conversation had made upon her.The fact
that he is an Englishman may have something to do with this; Uncle's
antipathy to every one of that nation being as well known to her as to
me.Her experience with
Charlie Somerville has made me suspicious.What if the story of last
summer were to be repeated here, with an Englishman for the hero!But
I will not allow myself to contemplate such a possibility.Uncle will
return in a few days, and then all communication with one who, however
prepossessing, is of a family and race with whom it is impossible for
us to unite ourselves, must of necessity cease.I doubt if I should have
thought twice of all this if Mr.Clavering had not betrayed, upon his
introduction to Mary, such intense and unrestrained admiration.Mary not only submits to the
attentions of Mr.To-day she sat
two hours at the piano singing over to him her favorite songs, and
to-night--But I will not put down every trivial circumstance that comes
under my observation; it is unworthy of me.And yet, how can I shut my
eyes when the happiness of so many I love is at stake!Clavering is not absolutely in love with Mary, he is on
the verge of it.He is a very fine-looking man, and too honorable to be
trifled with in this reckless fashion.She was absolutely
wonderful to-night in scarlet and silver.I think her smile the sweetest
I ever beheld, and in this I am sure Mr.Clavering passionately agrees
with me; he never looked away from her to-night.But it is not so easy
to read _her_ heart.To be sure, she appears anything but indifferent
to his fine appearance, strong sense, and devoted affection.But did she
not deceive us into believing she loved Charlie Somerville?In her case,
blush and smile go for little, I fear.Would it not be wiser under the
circumstances to say, I hope?Mary came into my room this evening, and
absolutely startled me by falling at my side and burying her face in my
lap.'Oh, Eleanore, Eleanore!'she murmured, quivering with what seemed
to me very happy sobs.But when I strove to lift her head to my breast,
she slid from my arms, and drawing herself up into her old attitude of
reserved pride, raised her hand as if to impose silence, and haughtily
left the room.There is but one interpretation to put upon this.Clavering has expressed his sentiments, and she is filled with that
reckless delight which in its first flush makes one insensible to the
existence of barriers which have hitherto been deemed impassable.Little did I think when I wrote the above that Uncle was
already in the house.He arrived unexpectedly on the last train, and
came into my room just as I was putting away my diary.Looking a little
care-worn, he took me in his arms and then asked for Mary.I dropped my
head, and could not help stammering as I replied that she was in her own
room.Instantly his love took alarm, and leaving me, he hastened to
her apartment, where I afterwards learned he came upon her sitting
abstractedly before her dressing-table with Mr.Clavering's family ring
on her finger.An unhappy scene, I fear,
for Mary is ill this morning, and Uncle exceedingly melancholy and
stern.Uncle not only refuses to consider
for a moment the question of Mary's alliance with Mr.Clavering, but
even goes so far as to demand his instant and unconditional dismissal.The knowledge of this came to me in the most distressing way.Recognizing the state of affairs, but secretly rebelling against a
prejudice which seemed destined to separate two persons otherwise fitted
for each other, I sought Uncle's presence this morning after breakfast,
and attempted to plead their cause.But he almost instantly stopped me
with the remark, 'You are the last one, Eleanore, who should seek to
promote this marriage.'Trembling with apprehension, I asked him
why.'For the reason that by so doing you work entirely for your own
interest.'More and more troubled, I begged him to explain himself.'I
mean,' said he, 'that if Mary disobeys me by marrying this Englishman,
I shall disinherit her, and substitute your name for hers in my will as
well as in my affection.'"For a moment everything swam before my eyes.'You will never make me so
wretched!''I will make you my heiress, if Mary persists
in her present determination,' he declared, and without further word
sternly left the room.What could I do but fall on my knees and pray!Of all in this miserable house, I am the most wretched.But I shall not be called upon to do it; Mary will give up Mr.Isn't it
becoming plain enough what was Mary's motive for this murder?But go on;
let us hear what followed."The next entry is dated July 19, and
runs thus:

"I was right.After a long struggle with Uncle's invincible will, Mary
has consented to dismiss Mr.I was in the room when she
made known her decision, and I shall never forget our Uncle's look of
gratified pride as he clasped her in his arms and called her his own
True Heart.He has evidently been very much exercised over this matter,
and I cannot but feel greatly relieved that affairs have terminated
so satisfactorily.What is there in her manner that vaguely
disappoints me?I only know that I felt a powerful
shrinking overwhelm me when she turned her face to me and asked if I
were satisfied now.But I conquered my feelings and held out my hand.The shadow of our late trial is upon
me yet; I cannot shake it off.Clavering's despairing
face wherever I go.How is it that Mary preserves her cheerfulness?If
she does not love him, I should think the respect which she must feel
for his disappointment would keep her from levity at least.Nothing I could say sufficed to keep him.Mary has only nominally separated from
Mr.Clavering; she still cherishes the idea of one day uniting herself
to him in marriage.The fact was revealed to me in a strange way not
necessary to mention here; and has since been confirmed by Mary herself.'I admire the man,' she declares, 'and have no intention of giving him
up.'Her only answer was a bitter
smile and a short,--'I leave that for you to do.'Worn completely out, but before my blood cools let
me write.I have just returned from seeing her give her
hand to Henry Clavering.Strange that I can write it without quivering
when my whole soul is one flush of indignation and revolt.Having left my room for a few minutes this morning,
I returned to find on my dressing-table a note from Mary in which she
informed me that she was going to take Mrs.Belden for a drive and would
not be back for some hours.Convinced, as I had every reason to be, that
she was on her way to meet Mr.Clavering, I only stopped to put on my
hat--"

There the Diary ceased."She was probably interrupted by Mary at this point," explained Mr."But we have come upon the one thing we wanted to know.Leavenworth threatened to supplant Mary with Eleanore if she persisted
in marrying contrary to his wishes.She did so marry, and to avoid the
consequences of her act she----"

"Say no more," I returned, convinced at last."But the writer of these words is saved," I went on, trying to grasp
the one comfort left me."No one who reads this Diary will ever dare to
insinuate she is capable of committing a crime.""Assuredly not; the Diary settles that matter effectually."I tried to be man enough to think of that and nothing else.To rejoice
in her deliverance, and let every other consideration go; but in this I
did not succeed."But Mary, her cousin, almost her sister, is lost," I
muttered.Gryce thrust his hands into his pockets and, for the first time,
showed some evidence of secret disturbance."Yes, I am afraid she is;
I really am afraid she is."Then after a pause, during which I felt a
certain thrill of vague hope: "Such an entrancing creature too!It is a
pity, it positively is a pity!I declare, now that the thing is worked
up, I begin to feel almost sorry we have succeeded so well.If there was the least loophole out of it," he muttered.The thing is clear as A, B, C."Suddenly he rose, and began
pacing the floor very thoughtfully, casting his glances here, there, and
everywhere, except at me, though I believe now, as then, my face was all
he saw."Would it be a very great grief to you, Mr.Raymond, if Miss Mary
Leavenworth should be arrested on this charge of murder?"he asked,
pausing before a sort of tank in which two or three disconsolate-looking
fishes were slowly swimming about."Yes," said I, "it would; a very great grief.""Yet it must be done," said he, though with a strange lack of his usual
decision."As an honest official, trusted to bring the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth to the notice of the proper authorities, I have got to do
it."Again that strange thrill of hope at my heart induced by his peculiar
manner.I am not so rich or so famous that I can afford to forget all that a
success like this may bring me.No, lovely as she is, I have got to push
it through."But even as he said this, he became still more thoughtful,
gazing down into the murky depths of the wretched tank before him with
such an intentness I half expected the fascinated fishes to rise from
the water and return his gaze.After a little while he turned, his indecision utterly gone.I shall then have my report ready for
the Superintendent.I should like to show it to you first, so don't fail
me."There was something so repressed in his expression, I could not prevent
myself from venturing one question."Yes," he returned, but in a peculiar tone, and with a peculiar gesture."And you are going to make the arrest you speak of?"GATHERED THREADS


    "This is the short and the long of it."PROMPTLY at the hour named, I made my appearance at Mr.I
found him awaiting me on the threshold."I have met you," said he gravely, "for the purpose of requesting you
not to speak during the coming interview.I am to do the talking; you
the listening.Neither are you to be surprised at anything I may do or
say.I am in a facetious mood"--he did not look so--"and may take it
into my head to address you by another name than your own.If I do,
don't mind it.Above all, don't talk: remember that."And without
waiting to meet my look of doubtful astonishment, he led me softly
up-stairs.The room in which I had been accustomed to meet him was at the top of
the first flight, but he took me past that into what appeared to be the
garret story, where, after many cautionary signs, he ushered me into
a room of singularly strange and unpromising appearance.In the first
place, it was darkly gloomy, being lighted simply by a very dim and
dirty skylight.Next, it was hideously empty; a pine table and two
hard-backed chairs, set face to face at each end of it, being the only
articles in the room.Lastly, it was surrounded by several closed doors
with blurred and ghostly ventilators over their tops which, being round,
looked like the blank eyes of a row of staring mummies.Altogether it
was a lugubrious spot, and in the present state of my mind made me
feel as if something unearthly and threatening lay crouched in the very
atmosphere.Nor, sitting there cold and desolate, could I imagine that
the sunshine glowed without, or that life, beauty, and pleasure paraded
the streets below.Gryce's expression, as he took a seat and beckoned me to do the
same, may have had something to do with this strange sensation, it was
so mysteriously and sombrely expectant."You'll not mind the room," said he, in so muffled a tone I scarcely
heard him."It's an awful lonesome spot, I know; but folks with such
matters before them mustn't be too particular as to the places in which
they hold their consultations, if they don't want all the world to know
as much as they do.Smith," and he gave me an admonitory shake of his
finger, while his voice took a more distinct tone, "I have done the
business; the reward is mine; the assassin of Mr.Leavenworth is found,
and in two hours will be in custody.Do you want to know who it
is?"leaning forward with every appearance of eagerness in tone and
expression.any
great change taken place in his conclusions?All this preparation could
not be for the purpose of acquainting me with what I already knew, yet--

He cut short my conjectures with a low, expressive chuckle."It was a
long chase, I tell you," raising his voice still more; "a tight go; a
woman in the business too; but all the women in the world can't pull
the wool over the eyes of Ebenezer Gryce when he is on a trail; and the
assassin of Mr.Leavenworth and"--here his voice became actually shrill
in his excitement--"and of Hannah Chester is found.he went on, though I had neither spoken nor made any move; "you
didn't know Hannah Chester was murdered.Well, she wasn't in one sense
of the word, but in another she was, and by the same hand that killed
the old gentleman.This scrap of paper
was found on the floor of her room; it had a few particles of white
powder sticking to it; those particles were tested last night and found
to be poison.But you say the girl took it herself, that she was a
suicide.You are right, she did take it herself, and it was a suicide;
but who terrified her into this act of self-destruction?Why, the one
who had the most reason to fear her testimony, of course.Well, sir, this girl left a confession behind her, throwing the
onus of the whole crime on a certain party believed to be innocent; this
confession was a forged one, known from three facts; first, that the
paper upon which it was written was unobtainable by the girl in the
place where she was; secondly, that the words used therein were printed
in coarse, awkward characters, whereas Hannah, thanks to the teaching of
the woman under whose care she has been since the murder, had learned to
write very well; thirdly, that the story told in the confession does not
agree with the one related by the girl herself.Now the fact of a forged
confession throwing the guilt upon an innocent party having been found
in the keeping of this ignorant girl, killed by a dose of poison, taken
with the fact here stated, that on the morning of the day on which she
killed herself the girl received from some one manifestly acquainted
with the customs of the Leavenworth family a letter large enough and
thick enough to contain the confession folded, as it was when found,
makes it almost certain to my mind that the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth
sent this powder and this so-called confession to the girl, meaning
her to use them precisely as she did: for the purpose of throwing off
suspicion from the right track and of destroying herself at the same
time; for, as you know, dead men tell no tales."He paused and looked at the dingy skylight above us.Why did the
air seem to grow heavier and heavier?Why did I shudder in vague
apprehension?I knew all this before; why did it strike me, then, as
something new?Ah, that is the secret; that is the bit of
knowledge which is to bring me fame and fortune.But, secret or not,
I don't mind telling you"; lowering his voice and rapidly raising it
again."The fact is, _I_ can't keep it to myself; it burns like a new
dollar in my pocket.Smith, my boy, the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth--but
stay, who does the world say it is?Whom do the papers point at and
shake their heads over?a young, beautiful, bewitching woman!The papers are right; it is a woman; young, beautiful, and
bewitching too.There is more
than one woman in this affair.Since Hannah's death I have heard it
openly advanced that she was the guilty party in the crime: bah!Others
cry it is the niece who was so unequally dealt with by her uncle in his
will: bah!But folks are not without some justification for this
latter assertion.Eleanore Leavenworth did know more of this matter than
appeared.Worse than that, Eleanore Leavenworth stands in a position of
positive peril to-day.If you don't think so, let me show you what the
detectives have against her."First, there is the fact that a handkerchief, with her name on it, was
found stained with pistol grease upon the scene of murder; a place which
she explicitly denies having entered for twenty-four hours previous to
the discovery of the dead body."Secondly, the fact that she not only evinced terror when confronted
with this bit of circumstantial evidence, but manifested a decided
disposition, both at this time and others, to mislead inquiry, shirking
a direct answer to some questions and refusing all answer to others."Thirdly, that an attempt was made by her to destroy a certain letter
evidently relating to this crime."Fourthly, that the key to the library door was seen in her possession."All this, taken with the fact that the fragments of the letter which
this same lady attempted to destroy within an hour after the inquest
were afterwards put together, and were found to contain a bitter
denunciation of one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces, by a gentleman we will
call _X_ in other words, an unknown quantity--makes out a dark case
against _you,_ especially as after investigations revealed the fact that
a secret underlay the history of the Leavenworth family.That, unknown
to the world at large, and Mr.Leavenworth in particular, a marriage
ceremony had been performed a year before in a little town called F----
between a Miss Leavenworth and this same _X._ That, in other words, the
unknown gentleman who, in the letter partly destroyed by Miss Eleanore
Leavenworth, complained to Mr.Leavenworth of the treatment received
by him from one of his nieces, was in fact the secret husband of that
niece.And that, moreover, this same gentleman, under an assumed name,
called on the night of the murder at the house of Mr.Leavenworth and
asked for Miss Eleanore."Now you see, with all this against her, Eleanore Leavenworth is lost
if it cannot be proved, first that the articles testifying against her,
viz.: the handkerchief, letter, and key, passed after the murder through
other hands, before reaching hers; and secondly, that some one else had
even a stronger reason than she for desiring Mr.Leavenworth's death at
this time."Smith, my boy, both of these hypotheses have been established by me.By dint of moleing into old secrets, and following unpromising clues, I
have finally come to the conclusion that not Eleanore Leavenworth, dark
as are the appearances against her, but another woman, beautiful as
she, and fully as interesting, is the true criminal.In short, that her
cousin, the exquisite Mary, is the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth, and by
inference of Hannah Chester also."He brought this out with such force, and with such a look of triumph
and appearance of having led up to it, that I was for the moment
dumbfounded, and started as if I had not known what he was going to say.The stir I made seemed to awake an echo.Something like a suppressed
cry was in the air about me.All the room appeared to breathe horror and
dismay.Yet when, in the excitement of this fancy, I half turned round
to look, I found nothing but the blank eyes of those dull ventilators
staring upon me.Every one
else is engaged in watching the movements of Eleanore Leavenworth; I
only know where to put my hand upon the real culprit.Ebenezer Gryce deceived after a month of hard work!You are as
bad as Miss Leavenworth herself, who has so little faith in my sagacity
that she offered me, of all men, an enormous reward if I would find for
her the assassin of her uncle!But that is neither here nor there;
you have your doubts, and you are waiting for me to solve them.Know first that on the morning of the inquest I made
one or two discoveries not to be found in the records, viz.: that the
handkerchief picked up, as I have said, in Mr.Leavenworth's library,
had notwithstanding its stains of pistol grease, a decided perfume
lingering about it.Going to the dressing-table of the two ladies, I
sought for that perfume, and found it in Mary's room, not Eleanore's.This led me to examine the pockets of the dresses respectively worn by
them the evening before.In that of Eleanore I found a handkerchief,
presumably the one she had carried at that time.But in Mary's there was
none, nor did I see any lying about her room as if tossed down on
her retiring.The conclusion I drew from this was, that she, and
not Eleanore, had carried the handkerchief into her uncle's room, a
conclusion emphasized by the fact privately communicated to me by one of
the servants, that Mary was in Eleanore's room when the basket of clean
clothes was brought up with this handkerchief lying on top."But knowing the liability we are to mistake in such matters as these,
I made another search in the library, and came across a very curious
thing.Lying on the table was a penknife, and scattered on the floor
beneath, in close proximity to the chair, were two or three minute
portions of wood freshly chipped off from the leg of the table; all of
which looked as if some one of a nervous disposition had been sitting
there, whose hand in a moment of self-forgetfulness had caught up the
knife and unconsciously whittled the table.A little thing, you say;
but when the question is, which of two ladies, one of a calm and
self-possessed nature, the other restless in her ways and excitable in
her disposition, was in a certain spot at a certain time, it is these
little things that become almost deadly in their significance.No one
who has been with these two women an hour can hesitate as to whose
delicate hand made that cut in Mr.I distinctly overheard Eleanore accuse her cousin
of this deed.Now such a woman as Eleanore Leavenworth has proved
herself to be never would accuse a relative of crime without the
strongest and most substantial reasons.First, she must have been sure
her cousin stood in a position of such emergency that nothing but
the death of her uncle could release her from it; secondly, that her
cousin's character was of such a nature she would not hesitate to
relieve herself from a desperate emergency by the most desperate of
means; and lastly, been in possession of some circumstantial evidence
against her cousin, seriously corroborative of her suspicions.Smith,
all this was true of Eleanore Leavenworth.As to the character of her
cousin, she has had ample proof of her ambition, love of money, caprice
and deceit, it having been Mary Leavenworth, and not Eleanore, as was
first supposed, who had contracted the secret marriage already spoken
of.Of the critical position in which she stood, let the threat once
made by Mr.Leavenworth to substitute her cousin's name for hers in
his will in case she had married this _x_ be remembered, as well as the
tenacity with which Mary clung to her hopes of future fortune; while for
the corroborative testimony of her guilt which Eleanore is supposed
to have had, remember that previous to the key having been found in
Eleanore's possession, she had spent some time in her cousin's room; and
that it was at Mary's fireplace the half-burned fragments of that letter
were found,--and you have the outline of a report which in an hour's
time from this will lead to the arrest of Mary Leavenworth as the
assassin of her uncle and benefactor."A silence ensued which, like the darkness of Egypt, could be felt;
then a great and terrible cry rang through the room, and a man's form,
rushing from I knew not where, shot by me and fell at Mr.Gryce's feet
shrieking out:

"It is a lie!Mary Leavenworth is innocent as a babe unborn.CULMINATION


    "Saint seducing gold.""When our actions do not,
     Our fears do make us traitors."I NEVER saw such a look of mortal triumph on the face of a man as that
which crossed the countenance of the detective."Well," said he, "this is unexpected, but not wholly unwelcome.I am
truly glad to learn that Miss Leavenworth is innocent; but I must hear
some few more particulars before I shall be satisfied.Leavenworth, how comes it that things look so black against everybody
but yourself?"But in the hot, feverish eyes which sought him from the writhing form at
his feet, there was mad anxiety and pain, but little explanation.Seeing
him making unavailing efforts to speak, I drew near."Lean on me," said I, lifting him to his feet.His face, relieved forever from its mask of repression, turned towards
me with the look of a despairing spirit."Save
her--Mary--they are sending a report--stop it!""If there is a man here who believes in
God and prizes woman's honor, let him stop the issue of that report."And Henry Clavering, dignified as ever, but in a state of extreme
agitation, stepped into our midst through an open door at our right.But at the sight of his face, the man in our arms quivered, shrieked,
and gave one bound that would have overturned Mr.Clavering, herculean
of frame as he was, had not Mr.he cried; and holding back the secretary with one hand--where
was his rheumatism now!--he put the other in his pocket and drew thence
a document which he held up before Mr."It has not gone
yet," said he; "be easy.And you," he went on, turning towards Trueman
Harwell, "be quiet, or----"

His sentence was cut short by the man springing from his grasp."Let me have my revenge on him who, in face of all I
have done for Mary Leavenworth, dares to call her his wife!Let me--"
But at this point he paused, his quivering frame stiffening into stone,
and his clutching hands, outstretched for his rival's throat, falling
heavily back.Clavering's shoulder:
"it is she!she--" a low, shuddering sigh of longing and despair finished the
sentence: the door opened, and Mary Leavenworth stood before us!It was a moment to make young hairs turn gray.To see her face, so pale,
so haggard, so wild in its fixed horror, turned towards Henry Clavering,
to the utter ignoring of the real actor in this most horrible scene!Trueman Harwell could not stand it.cold, cold; not one glance for me,
though I have just drawn the halter from her neck and fastened it about
my own!"And, breaking from the clasp of the man who in his jealous rage would
now have withheld him, he fell on his knees before Mary, clutching her
dress with frenzied hands."You _shall_ look at me," he cried; "you
_shall_ listen to me!I will not lose body and soul for nothing.Mary,
they said you were in peril!I could not endure that thought, so I
uttered the truth,--yes, though I knew what the consequence would
be,--and all I want now is for you to say you believe me, when I swear
that I only meant to secure to you the fortune you so much desired; that
I never dreamed it would come to this; that it was because I loved you,
and hoped to win your love in return that I----"

But she did not seem to see him, did not seem to hear him.Her eyes were
fixed upon Henry Clavering with an awful inquiry in their depths, and
none but he could move her."Ice that you are, you
would not turn your head if I should call to you from the depths of
hell!"Pushing her hands down upon his
shoulders as though she would sweep some impediment from her path, she
endeavored to advance.she cried, indicating
her husband with one quivering hand."What has he done that he should be
brought here to confront me at this awful time?"'"I told her to come here to meet her uncle's murderer," whispered Mr.But before I could reply to her, before Mr.Clavering himself could
murmur a word, the guilty wretch before her had started to his feet.It is because these gentlemen,
chivalrous and honorable as they consider themselves, think that you,
the beauty and the Sybarite, committed with your own white hand the
deed of blood which has brought you freedom and fortune.Yes, yes, this
man"--turning and pointing at me--"friend as he has made himself out to
be, kindly and honorable as you have doubtless believed him, but who in
every look he has bestowed upon you, every word he has uttered in your
hearing during all these four horrible weeks, has been weaving a cord
for your neck--thinks you the assassin of your uncle, unknowing that a
man stood at your side ready to sweep half the world from your path if
that same white hand rose in bidding.now she could see him: now she could hear him!"Yes," clutching her robe again as she hastily recoiled; "didn't you
know it?When in that dreadful hour of your rejection by your uncle, you
cried aloud for some one to help you, didn't you know----"

"Don't!"she shrieked, bursting from him with a look of unspeakable
horror.she gasped, "is the mad cry of a stricken
woman for aid and sympathy the call for a murderer?"And turning away
in horror, she moaned: "Who that ever looks at me now will forget that
a man--such a man!--dared to think that, because I was in mortal
perplexity, I would accept the murder of my best friend as a relief from
it!""Oh, what a chastisement for folly!""What a punishment for the love of money which has always been
my curse!"Henry Clavering could no longer restrain himself, leaping to her side,
he bent over her.Are you guiltless of
any deeper wrong?Is there no link of complicity between you two?Have
you nothing on your soul but an inordinate desire to preserve your place
in your uncle's will, even at the risk of breaking my heart and wronging
your noble cousin?placing
his hand on her head, he pressed it slowly back and gazed into her eyes;
then, without a word, took her to his breast and looked calmly around
him.It was the uplifting of a stifling pall.No one in the room, unless it
was the wretched criminal shivering before us, but felt a sudden influx
of hope.Even Mary's own countenance caught a glow.she whispered,
withdrawing from his arms to look better into his face, "and is this the
man I have trifled with, injured, and tortured, till the very name of
Mary Leavenworth might well make him shudder?Is this he whom I married
in a fit of caprice, only to forsake and deny?Henry, do you declare
me innocent in face of all you have seen and heard; in face of that
moaning, chattering wretch before us, and my own quaking flesh and
evident terror; with the remembrance on your heart and in your mind of
the letter I wrote you the morning after the murder, in which I prayed
you to keep away from me, as I was in such deadly danger the least hint
given to the world that I had a secret to conceal would destroy me?Do
you, can you, will you, declare me innocent before God and the world?"A light such as had never visited her face before passed slowly over it."Then God forgive me the wrong I have done this noble heart, for I can
never forgive myself!"Before I
accept any further tokens of your generous confidence, let me show you
what I am.You shall know the worst of the woman you have taken to your
heart.Raymond," she cried, turning towards me for the first time,
"in those days when, with such an earnest desire for my welfare (you see
I do not believe this man's insinuations), you sought to induce me to
speak out and tell all I knew concerning this dreadful deed, I did not
do it because of my selfish fears.I knew the case looked dark against
me.Eleanore herself--and it was the keenest
pang I had to endure--believed me guilty.She knew
first, from the directed envelope she had found lying underneath my
uncle's dead body on the library table, that he had been engaged at the
moment of death in summoning his lawyer to make that change in his will
which would transfer my claims to her; secondly, that notwithstanding
my denial of the same, I had been down to his room the night before, for
she had heard my door open and my dress rustle as I passed out.But that
was not all; the key that every one felt to be a positive proof of guilt
wherever found, had been picked up by her from the floor of my room; the
letter written by Mr.Clavering to my uncle was found in my fire; and
the handkerchief which she had seen me take from the basket of clean
clothes, was produced at the inquest stained with pistol grease.I could not stir without encountering some new toil.I knew I was
innocent; but if I failed to satisfy my cousin of this, how could I
hope to convince the general public, if once called upon to do so.Worse
still, if Eleanore, with every apparent motive for desiring long life
to our uncle, was held in such suspicion because of a few circumstantial
evidences against her, what would I not have to fear if these evidences
were turned against me, the heiress!The tone and manner of the juryman
at the inquest that asked who would be most benefited by my uncle's will
showed but too plainly.When, therefore, Eleanore, true to her heart's
generous instincts, closed her lips and refused to speak when speech
would have been my ruin, I let her do it, justifying myself with the
thought that she had deemed me capable of crime, and so must bear the
consequences.Nor, when I saw how dreadful these were likely to
prove, did I relent.Fear of the ignominy, suspense, and danger which
confession would entail sealed my lips.That
was when, in the last conversation we had, I saw that, notwithstanding
appearances, you believed in Eleanore's innocence, and the thought
crossed me you might be induced to believe in mine if I threw myself
upon your mercy.Clavering came; and as in a flash I
seemed to realize what my future life would be, stained by suspicion,
and, instead of yielding to my impulse, went so far in the other
direction as to threaten Mr.Clavering with a denial of our marriage if
he approached me again till all danger was over."Yes, he will tell you that was my welcome to him when, with heart
and brain racked by long suspense, he came to my door for one word of
assurance that the peril I was in was not of my own making.That was the
greeting I gave him after a year of silence every moment of which was
torture to him.But he forgives me; I see it in his eyes; I hear it in
his accents; and you--oh, if in the long years to come you can forget
what I have made Eleanore suffer by my selfish fears; if with the shadow
of her wrong before you, you can by the grace of some sweet hope think
a little less hardly of me, do.As for this man--torture could not be
worse to me than this standing with him in the same room--let him
come forward and declare if I by look or word have given him reason to
believe I understood his passion, much less returned it.""Don't you see it was your indifference which
drove me mad?To stand before you, to agonize after you, to follow you
with thoughts in every move you made; to know my soul was welded to
yours with bands of steel no fire could melt, no force destroy, no
strain dissever; to sleep under the same roof, sit at the same table,
and yet meet not so much as one look to show me you understood!It was
that which made my life a hell.If I had to leap into a pit of flame, you should know what I was, and
what my passion for you was.Shrink as you will from my presence, cower as you may to the weak man
you call husband, you can never forget the love of Trueman Harwell;
never forget that love, love, love, was the force which led me down into
your uncle's room that night, and lent me will to pull the trigger which
poured all the wealth you hold this day into your lap.Yes," he went on,
towering in his preternatural despair till even the noble form of Henry
Clavering looked dwarfed beside him, "every dollar that chinks from
your purse shall talk of me.Every gew-gaw which flashes on that haughty
head, too haughty to bend to me, shall shriek my name into your ears.Fashion, pomp, luxury,--you will have them all; but till gold loses its
glitter and ease its attraction you will never forget the hand that gave
them to you!"With a look whose evil triumph I cannot describe, he put his hand into
the arm of the waiting detective, and in another moment would have been
led from the room; when Mary, crushing down the swell of emotions that
was seething in her breast, lifted her head and said:

"No, Trueman Harwell; I cannot give you even that thought for your
comfort.Wealth so laden would bring nothing but torture.I cannot
accept the torture, so must release the wealth.From this day, Mary
Clavering owns nothing but what comes to her from the husband she has so
long and so basely wronged."And raising her hands to her ears, she tore
out the diamonds which hung there, and flung them at the feet of the
unfortunate man.With a yell such as I never thought
to listen to from the lips of a man, he flung up his arms, while all the
lurid light of madness glared on his face."And I have given my soul to
hell for a shadow!""Well, that is the best day's work I ever did!Raymond, upon the success of the most daring game ever played in a
detective's office."I looked at the triumphant countenance of Mr.I cried; "did you plan all this?""Could I stand here, seeing how things
have turned out, if I had not?You
are a gentleman, but we can well shake hands over this.I have never
known such a satisfactory conclusion to a bad piece of business in all
my professional career."We did shake hands, long and fervently, and then I asked him to explain
himself."Well," said he, "there has always been one thing that plagued me, even
in the very moment of my strongest suspicion against this woman, and
that was, the pistol-cleaning business.I could not reconcile it with
what I knew of womankind.I could not make it seem the act of a woman.Did you ever know a woman who cleaned a pistol?They can fire them,
and do; but after firing them, they do not clean them.Now it is a
principle which every detective recognizes, that if of a hundred leading
circumstances connected with a crime, ninety-nine of these are acts
pointing to the suspected party with unerring certainty, but the
hundredth equally important act one which that person could not have
performed, the whole fabric of suspicion is destroyed.Recognizing this
principle, then, as I have said, I hesitated when it came to the point
of arrest.The chain was complete; the links were fastened; but one link
was of a different size and material from the rest; and in this argued a
break in the chain.Harwell, two persons whom I had no reason to suspect,
but who were the only persons beside herself who could have committed
this crime, being the only persons of intellect who were in the house
or believed to be, at the time of the murder, I notified them separately
that the assassin of Mr.Leavenworth was not only found, but was
about to be arrested in my house, and that if they wished to hear
the confession which would be sure to follow, they might have the
opportunity of doing so by coming here at such an hour.They were both
too much interested, though for very different reasons, to refuse; and
I succeeded in inducing them to conceal themselves in the two rooms from
which you saw them issue, knowing that if either of them had committed
this deed, he had done it for the love of Mary Leavenworth, and
consequently could not hear her charged with crime, and threatened
with arrest, without betraying himself.I did not hope much from the
experiment; least of all did I anticipate that Mr.Harwell would prove
to be the guilty man--but live and learn, Mr.A FULL CONFESSION


    "Between the acting of a dreadful thing,
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council; and the state of a man,
    Like to a little Kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection."I AM not a bad man; I am only an intense one.Ambition, love, jealousy,
hatred, revenge--transitory emotions with some, are terrific passions
with me.To be sure, they are quiet and concealed ones, coiled serpents
that make no stir till aroused; but then, deadly in their spring and
relentless in their action.Those who have known me best have not known
this.Often and often have I heard
her say: "If Trueman only had more sensibility!If Trueman were not so
indifferent to everything!In short, if Trueman had more power in him!"They thought me meek;
called me Dough-face.For three years they called me this, then I turned
upon them.Choosing out their ringleader, I felled him to the ground,
laid him on his back, and stamped upon him.He was handsome before
my foot came down; afterwards--Well, it is enough he never called me
Dough-face again.In the store I entered soon after, I met with even
less appreciation.Regular at my work and exact in my performance of it,
they thought me a good machine and nothing more.What heart, soul, and
feeling could a man have who never sported, never smoked, and never
laughed?I could reckon up figures correctly, but one scarcely needed
heart or soul for that.I could even write day by day and month by month
without showing a flaw in my copy; but that only argued I was no more
than they intimated, a regular automaton.I let them think so, with the
certainty before me that they would one day change their minds as others
had done.The fact was, I loved nobody well enough, not even myself,
to care for any man's opinion.Life was well-nigh a blank to me; a dead
level plain that had to be traversed whether I would or not.And such
it might have continued to this day if I had never met Mary Leavenworth.But when, some nine months since, I left my desk in the counting-house
for a seat in Mr.Leavenworth's library, a blazing torch fell into
my soul whose flame has never gone out, and never will, till the doom
before me is accomplished.When, on that first evening, I followed my new
employer into the parlor, and saw this woman standing up before me
in her half-alluring, half-appalling charm, I knew, as by a lightning
flash, what my future would be if I remained in that house.She was
in one of her haughty moods, and bestowed upon me little more than a
passing glance.But her indifference made slight impression upon me
then.It was enough that I was allowed to stand in her presence and look
unrebuked upon her loveliness.To be sure, it was like gazing into the
flower-wreathed crater of an awakening volcano.Fear and fascination
were in each moment I lingered there; but fear and fascination made the
moment what it was, and I could not have withdrawn if I would.Unspeakable pain as well as pleasure was in the
emotion with which I regarded her.Yet for all that I did not cease to
study her hour by hour and day by day; her smiles, her movement, her way
of turning her head or lifting her eyelids.I
wished to knit her beauty so firmly into the warp and woof of my being
that nothing could ever serve to tear it away.For I saw then as plainly
as now that, coquette though she was, she would never stoop to me.No;
I might lie down at her feet and let her trample over me; she would not
even turn to see what it was she had stepped upon.I might spend days,
months, years, learning the alphabet of her wishes; she would not thank
me for my pains or even raise the lashes from her cheek to look at me as
I passed.I was nothing to her, could not be anything unless--and this
thought came slowly--I could in some way become her master.Leavenworth's dictation and pleased him.My
methodical ways were just to his taste.As for the other member of the
family, Miss Eleanore Leavenworth--she treated me just as one of her
proud but sympathetic nature might be expected to do.Not familiarly,
but kindly; not as a friend, but as a member of the household whom she
met every day at table, and who, as she or any one else could see, was
none too happy or hopeful.I had learned two things; first, that Mary
Leavenworth loved her position as prospective heiress to a large fortune
above every other earthly consideration; and secondly, that she was in
the possession of a secret which endangered that position.What this
was, I had for some time no means of knowing.But when later I became
convinced it was one of love, I grew hopeful, strange as it may seem.Leavenworth's disposition almost as
perfectly as that of his niece, and knew that in a matter of this kind
he would be uncompromising; and that in the clashing of these two wills
something might occur which would give me a hold upon her.The only
thing that troubled me was the fact that I did not know the name of the
man in whom she was interested.One
day--a month ago now--I sat down to open Mr.ran thus:

"HOFFMAN HOUSE,

"March 1, 1876."HORATIO LEAVENWORTH:

"DEAR SIR,--You have a niece whom you love and trust, one, too, who
seems worthy of all the love and trust that you or any other man can
give her; so beautiful, so charming, so tender is she in face, form,
manner, and conversation.But, dear sir, every rose has its thorn, and
your rose is no exception to this rule.Lovely as she is, charming as
she is, tender as she is, she is not only capable of trampling on the
rights of one who trusted her, but of bruising the heart and breaking
the spirit of him to whom she owes all duty, honor, and observance."If you don't believe this, ask her to her cruel, bewitching face, who
and what is her humble servant, and yours.If a bombshell had exploded at my feet, or the evil one himself appeared
at my call, I would not have been more astounded.Not only was the name
signed to these remarkable words unknown to me, but the epistle itself
was that of one who felt himself to be her master: a position which, as
you know, I was myself aspiring to occupy.For a few minutes, then, I
stood a prey to feelings of the bitterest wrath and despair; then I grew
calm, realizing that with this letter in my possession I was virtually
the arbitrator of her destiny.Some men would have sought her there and
then and, by threatening to place it in her uncle's hand, won from her
a look of entreaty, if no more; but I--well, my plans went deeper than
that.I knew she would have to be in extremity before I could hope to
win her.She must feel herself slipping over the edge of the precipice
before she would clutch at the first thing offering succor.I decided
to allow the letter to pass into my employer's hands.How could I manage to give it to him in this condition without
exciting his suspicion?I knew of but one way; to let him see me open it
for what he would consider the first time.So, waiting till he came into
the room, I approached him with the letter, tearing off the end of the
envelope as I came.Opening it, I gave a cursory glance at its contents
and tossed it down on the table before him."That appears to be of a private character," said I, "though there is no
sign to that effect on the envelope."At the first word he started, looked
at me, seemed satisfied from my expression that I had not read far
enough to realize its nature, and, whirling slowly around in his chair,
devoured the remainder in silence.I waited a moment, then withdrew to
my own desk.One minute, two minutes passed in silence; he was evidently
rereading the letter; then he hurriedly rose and left the room.As he
passed me I caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror.The expression I
saw there did not tend to lessen the hope that was rising in my breast.By following him almost immediately up-stairs I ascertained that he
went directly to Mary's room, and when in a few hours later the family
collected around the dinner table, I perceived, almost without looking
up, that a great and insurmountable barrier had been raised between him
and his favorite niece.Two days passed; days that were for me one long and unrelieved suspense.Would it all end as it had
begun, without the appearance of the mysterious Clavering on the scene?Meanwhile my monotonous work went on, grinding my heart beneath its
relentless wheel.I wrote and wrote and wrote, till it seemed as if my
life blood went from me with every drop of ink I used.Always alert
and listening, I dared not lift my head or turn my eyes at any unusual
sound, lest I should seem to be watching.The third night I had a dream;
I have already told Mr.Raymond what it was, and hence will not repeat
it here.One correction, however, I wish to make in regard to it.In my
statement to him I declared that the face of the man whom I saw lift his
hand against my employer was that of Mr.The face seen by me in my dream was my own.It was that fact
which made it so horrible to me.In the crouching figure stealing warily
down-stairs, I saw as in a glass the vision of my own form.Otherwise my
account of the matter was true.a
forewarning of the way in which I was to win this coveted creature for
my own?Was the death of her uncle the bridge by which the impassable
gulf between us might be spanned?I began to think it might be; to
consider the possibilities which could make this the only path to
my elysium; even went so far as to picture her lovely face bending
gratefully towards me through the glare of a sudden release from some
emergency in which she stood.One thing was sure; if that was the way I
must go, I had at least been taught how to tread it; and all through the
dizzy, blurred day that followed, I saw, as I sat at my work, repeated
visions of that stealthy, purposeful figure stealing down the stairs
and entering with uplifted pistol into the unconscious presence of my
employer.I even found myself a dozen times that day turning my eyes
upon the door through which it was to come, wondering how long it would
be before my actual form would pause there.That the moment was at hand
I did not imagine.Even when I left him that night after drinking with
him the glass of sherry mentioned at the inquest, I had no idea the hour
of action was so near.But when, not three minutes after going upstairs,
I caught the sound of a lady's dress rustling through the hall, and
listening, heard Mary Leavenworth pass my door on her way to the
library, I realized that the fatal hour was come; that something
was going to be said or done in that room which would make this deed
necessary.Casting about in my mind
for the means of doing so, I remembered that the ventilator running
up through the house opened first into the passage-way connecting Mr.Leavenworth's bedroom and library, and, secondly, into the closet of
the large spare room adjoining mine.Hastily unlocking the door of
the communication between the rooms, I took my position in the closet.Instantly the sound of voices reached my ears; all was open below, and
standing there, I was as much an auditor of what went on between Mary
and her uncle as if I were in the library itself.Enough to assure me my suspicions were correct; that it was a moment of
vital interest to her; that Mr.Leavenworth, in pursuance of a threat
evidently made some time since, was in the act of taking steps to change
his will, and that she had come to make an appeal to be forgiven her
fault and restored to his favor.What that fault was, I did not learn.I only heard her
declare that her action had been the result of impulse, rather than
love; that she regretted it, and desired nothing more than to be free
from all obligations to one she would fain forget, and be again to her
uncle what she was before she ever saw this man.I thought, fool that I
was, it was a mere engagement she was alluding to, and took the insanest
hope from these words; and when, in a moment later I heard her uncle
reply, in his sternest tone, that she had irreparably forfeited her
claims to his regard and favor, I did not need her short and bitter cry
of shame and disappointment, or that low moan for some one to help her,
for me to sound his death-knell in my heart.Creeping back to my own
room, I waited till I heard her reascend, then I stole forth.Calm as
I had ever been in my life, I went down the stairs just as I had seen
myself do in my dream, and knocking lightly at the library door, went
in.Leavenworth was sitting in his usual place writing."Excuse me," said I as he looked up, "I have lost my memorandum-book,
and think it possible I may have dropped it in the passage-way when I
went for the wine."He bowed, and I hurried past him into the closet.Once there, I proceeded rapidly into the room beyond, procured the
pistol, returned, and almost before I realized what I was doing, had
taken up my position behind him, aimed, and fired.Without a groan his head fell forward on his hands, and Mary
Leavenworth was the virtual possessor of the thousands she coveted.My first thought was to procure the letter he was writing.Approaching
the table, I tore it out from under his hands, looked at it, saw that
it was, as I expected, a summons to his lawyer, and thrust it into my
pocket, together with the letter from Mr.Clavering, which I perceived
lying spattered with blood on the table before me.Not till this was
done did I think of myself, or remember the echo which that low, sharp
report must have made in the house.Dropping the pistol at the side of
the murdered man, I stood ready to shriek to any one who entered that
Mr.But I was saved from committing such
a folly.The report had not been heard, or if so, had evidently failed
to create an alarm.No one came, and I was left to contemplate my
work undisturbed and decide upon the best course to be taken to avoid
detection.A moment's study of the wound made in his head by the
bullet convinced me of the impossibility of passing the affair off as
a suicide, or even the work of a burglar.To any one versed in such
matters it was manifestly a murder, and a most deliberate one.My one
hope, then, lay in making it as mysterious as it was deliberate, by
destroying all due to the motive and manner of the deed.Picking up the
pistol, I carried it into the other room with the intention of
cleaning it, but finding nothing there to do it with, came back for the
handkerchief I had seen lying on the floor at Mr.It
was Miss Eleanore's, but I did not know it till I had used it to clean
the barrel; then the sight of her initials in one corner so shocked me
I forgot to clean the cylinder, and only thought of how I could do
away with this evidence of her handkerchief having been employed for a
purpose so suspicious.Not daring to carry it from the room, I sought
for means to destroy it; but finding none, compromised the matter by
thrusting it deep down behind the cushion of one of the chairs, in the
hope of being able to recover and burn it the next day.This done, I
reloaded the pistol, locked it up, and prepared to leave the room.But here the horror which usually follows such deeds struck me like a
thunderbolt and made me for the first time uncertain in my action.I
locked the door on going out, something I should never have done.Not
till I reached the top of the stairs did I realize my folly; and then it
was too late, for there before me, candle in hand, and surprise written
on every feature of her face, stood Hannah, one of the servants, looking
at me."Lor, sir, where have you been?"she cried, but strange to say, in a
low tone."You look as if you had seen a ghost."And her eyes turned
suspiciously to the key which I held in my hand.I felt as if some one had clutched me round the throat.Thrusting the
key into my pocket, I took a step towards her."I will tell you what I
have seen if you will come down-stairs," I whispered; "the ladies will
be disturbed if we talk here," and smoothing my brow as best I could,
I put out my hand and drew her towards me.What my motive was I hardly
knew; the action was probably instinctive; but when I saw the look which
came into her face as I touched her, and the alacrity with which she
prepared to follow me, I took courage, remembering the one or two
previous tokens I had had of this girl's unreasonable susceptibility to
my influence; a susceptibility which I now felt could be utilized and
made to serve my purpose.Taking her down to the parlor floor, I drew her into the depths of
the great drawing-room, and there told her in the least alarming
way possible what had happened to Mr.She was of course
intensely agitated, but she did not scream;--the novelty of her position
evidently bewildering her--and, greatly relieved, I went on to say that
I did not know who committed the deed, but that folks would declare it
was I if they knew I had been seen by her on the stairs with the library
key in my hand."But I won't tell," she whispered, trembling violently
in her fright and eagerness.I will say I
didn't see anybody."But I soon convinced her that she could never keep
her secret if the police once began to question her, and, following
up my argument with a little cajolery, succeeded after a long while in
winning her consent to leave the house till the storm should be blown
over.But that given, it was some little time before I could make her
comprehend that she must depart at once and without going back after her
things.Not till I brightened up her wits by a promise to marry her some
day if she only obeyed me now, did she begin to look the thing in
the face and show any evidence of the real mother wit she evidently
possessed.Belden would take me in," said she, "if I could only
get to R----.She takes everybody in who asks, her; and she would
keep me, too, if I told her Miss Mary sent me.But I can't get there
to-night."I immediately set to work to convince her that she could.The midnight
train did not leave the city for a half-hour yet, and the distance to
the depot could be easily walked by her in fifteen minutes.And she was afraid she couldn't find
her way!She still hesitated, but
at length consented to go, and with some further understanding of the
method I was to employ in communicating with her, we went down-stairs.There we found a hat and shawl of the cook's which I put on her, and in
another moment we were in the carriage yard."Remember, you are to say
nothing of what has occurred, no matter what happens," I whispered in
parting injunction as she turned to leave me."Remember, you are to come
and marry me some day," she murmured in reply, throwing her arms about
my neck.The movement was sudden, and it was probably at this time she
dropped the candle she had unconsciously held clenched in her hand till
now.I promised her, and she glided out of the gate.Of the dreadful agitation that followed the disappearance of this girl
I can give no better idea than by saying I not only committed the
additional error of locking up the house on my re-entrance, but omitted
to dispose of the key then in my pocket by flinging it into the street
or dropping it in the hall as I went up.The fact is, I was so absorbed
by the thought of the danger I stood in from this girl, I forgot
everything else.Hannah's pale face, Hannah's look of terror, as she
turned from my side and flitted down the street, were continually before
me.I could not escape them; the form of the dead man lying below was
less vivid.It was as though I were tied in fancy to this woman of the
white face fluttering down the midnight streets.That she would fail in
something--come back or be brought back--that I should find her standing
white and horror-stricken on the front steps when I went down in the
morning, was like a nightmare to me.I began to think no other result
possible; that she never would or could win her way unchallenged to that
little cottage in a distant village; that I had but sent a trailing flag
of danger out into the world with this wretched girl;--danger that would
come back to me with the first burst of morning light!But even those thoughts faded after a while before the realization
of the peril I was in as long as the key and papers remained in my
possession.I dared not leave my room again,
or open my window.Indeed I was
afraid to move about in my room.Yes, my
morbid terror had reached that point--I was fearful of one whose ears I
myself had forever closed, imagined him in his bed beneath and wakeful
to the least sound.But the necessity of doing something with these evidences of guilt
finally overcame this morbid anxiety, and drawing the two letters from
my pocket--I had not yet undressed--I chose out the most dangerous of
the two, that written by Mr.Leavenworth himself, and, chewing it till
it was mere pulp, threw it into a corner; but the other had blood on it,
and nothing, not even the hope of safety, could induce me to put it
to my lips.I was forced to lie with it clenched in my hand, and the
flitting image of Hannah before my eyes, till the slow morning broke.I
have heard it said that a year in heaven seems like a day; I can easily
believe it.I know that an hour in hell seems an eternity!Whether it was that the sunshine glancing
on the wall made me think of Mary and all I was ready to do for her
sake, or whether it was the mere return of my natural stoicism in the
presence of actual necessity, I cannot say.I only know that I arose
calm and master of myself.The problem of the letter and key had solved
itself also.Instead of that I would
put them in plain sight, trusting to that very fact for their being
overlooked.Making the letter up into lighters, I carried them into the
spare room and placed them in a vase.Then, taking the key in my hand,
went down-stairs, intending to insert it in the lock of the library door
as I went by.But Miss Eleanore descending almost immediately behind me
made this impossible.I succeeded, however, in thrusting it, without
her knowledge, among the filagree work of the gas-fixture in the
second hall, and thus relieved, went down into the breakfast room as
self-possessed a man as ever crossed its threshold.Mary was there,
looking exceedingly pale and disheartened, and as I met her eye, which
for a wonder turned upon me as I entered, I could almost have laughed,
thinking of the deliverance that had come to her, and of the time when I
should proclaim myself to be the man who had accomplished it.Of the alarm that speedily followed, and my action at that time and
afterwards, I need not speak in detail.I behaved just as I would have
done if I had had no hand in the murder.I even forbore to touch the key
or go to the spare room, or make any movement which I was not willing
all the world should see.For as things stood, there was not a shadow
of evidence against me in the house; neither was I, a hard-working,
uncomplaining secretary, whose passion for one of his employer's nieces
was not even mistrusted by the lady herself, a person to be suspected
of the crime which threw him out of a fair situation.So I performed
all the duties of my position, summoning the police, and going for Mr.Veeley, just as I would have done if those hours between me leaving
Mr.Leavenworth for the first time and going down to breakfast in the
morning had been blotted from my consciousness.And this was the principle upon which I based my action at the inquest.Leaving that half-hour and its occurrences out of the question, I
resolved to answer such questions as might be put me as truthfully as
I could; the great fault with men situated as I was usually being that
they lied too much, thus committing themselves on unessential matters.But alas, in thus planning for my own safety, I forgot one thing,
and that was the dangerous position in which I should thus place Mary
Leavenworth as the one benefited by the crime.Not till the inference
was drawn by a juror, from the amount of wine found in Mr.Leavenworth's
glass in the morning, that he had come to his death shortly after my
leaving him, did I realize what an opening I had made for suspicion in
her direction by admitting that I had heard a rustle on the stair a few
minutes after going up.That all present believed it to have been made
by Eleanore, did not reassure me.She was so completely disconnected
with the crime I could not imagine suspicion holding to her for an
instant.But Mary--If a curtain had been let down before me, pictured
with the future as it has since developed, I could not have seen more
plainly what her position would be, if attention were once directed
towards her.So, in the vain endeavor to cover up my blunder, I began
to lie.Forced to admit that a shadow of disagreement had been lately
visible between Mr.Leavenworth and one of his nieces, I threw the
burden of it upon Eleanore, as the one best able to bear it.The
consequences were more serious than I anticipated.Direction had been
given to suspicion which every additional evidence that now came up
seemed by some strange fatality to strengthen.Leavenworth's own pistol had been used in the assassination,
and that too by a person then in the house, but I myself was brought
to acknowledge that Eleanore had learned from me, only a little while
before, how to load, aim, and fire this very pistol--a coincidence
mischievous enough to have been of the devil's own making.Seeing all this, my fear of what the ladies would admit when questioned
became very great.Let them in their innocence acknowledge that, upon my
ascent, Mary had gone to her uncle's room for the purpose of persuading
him not to carry into effect the action he contemplated, and what
consequences might not ensue!But events of which I had at that time no knowledge had occurred to
influence them.Eleanore, with some show of reason, as it seems, not
only suspected her cousin of the crime, but had informed her of the
fact, and Mary, overcome with terror at finding there was more or
less circumstantial evidence supporting the suspicion, decided to deny
whatever told against herself, trusting to Eleanore's generosity not to
be contradicted.Though, by the course
she took, Eleanore was forced to deepen the prejudice already rife
against herself, she not only forbore to contradict her cousin, but when
a true answer would have injured her, actually refused to return any,
a lie being something she could not utter, even to save one especially
endeared to her.This conduct of hers had one effect upon me.It aroused my admiration
and made me feel that here was a woman worth helping if assistance could
be given without danger to myself.Yet I doubt if my sympathy would have
led me into doing anything, if I had not perceived, by the stress laid
upon certain well-known matters, that actual danger hovered about us
all while the letter and key remained in the house.Even before the
handkerchief was produced, I had made up my mind to attempt their
destruction; but when that was brought up and shown, I became so alarmed
I immediately rose and, making my way under some pretence or other to
the floors above, snatched the key from the gas-fixture, the
lighters from the vase, and hastening with them down the hall to Mary
Leavenworth's room, went in under the expectation of finding a fire
there in which to destroy them.But, to my heavy disappointment, there
were only a few smoldering ashes in the grate, and, thwarted in my
design, I stood hesitating what to do, when I heard some one coming
up-stairs.Alive to the consequences of being found in that room at that
time, I cast the lighters into the grate and started for the door.But
in the quick move I made, the key flew from my hand and slid under a
chair.Aghast at the mischance, I paused, but the sound of approaching
steps increasing, I lost all control over myself and fled from the room.I had barely reached my own door when
Eleanore Leavenworth, followed by two servants, appeared at the top of
the staircase and proceeded towards the room I had just left.The sight
reassured me; she would see the key, and take some means of disposing
of it; and indeed I always supposed her to have done so, for no further
word of key or letter ever came to my ears.This may explain why the
questionable position in which Eleanore soon found herself awakened in
me no greater anxiety.I thought the suspicions of the police rested
upon nothing more tangible than the peculiarity of her manner at the
inquest and the discovery of her handkerchief on the scene of the
tragedy.I did not know they possessed what might be called absolute
proof of her connection with the crime.But if I had, I doubt if my
course would have been any different.Mary's peril was the one thing
capable of influencing me, and she did not appear to be in peril.On the
contrary, every one, by common consent, seemed to ignore all appearance
of guilt on her part.Gryce, whom I soon learned to fear, had
given one sign of suspicion, or Mr.Raymond, whom I speedily recognized
as my most persistent though unconscious foe, had betrayed the least
distrust of her, I should have taken warning.But they did not, and,
lulled into a false security by their manner, I let the days go by
without suffering any fears on her account.But not without many
anxieties for myself.Hannah's existence precluded all sense of personal
security.Knowing the determination of the police to find her, I trod
the verge of an awful suspense continually.Meantime the wretched certainty was forcing itself upon me that I had
lost, instead of gained, a hold on Mary Leavenworth.Not only did she
evince the utmost horror of the deed which had made her mistress of
her uncle's wealth, but, owing, as I believed, to the influence of Mr.Raymond, soon gave evidence that she was losing, to a certain extent,
the characteristics of mind and heart which had made me hopeful of
winning her by this deed of blood.Under the terrible restraint forced upon me, I walked my weary
round in a state of mind bordering on frenzy.Many and many a time have
I stopped in my work, wiped my pen and laid it down with the idea that
I could not repress myself another moment, but I have always taken it
up again and gone on with my task.Raymond has sometimes shown his
wonder at my sitting in my dead employer's chair.By keeping the murder constantly before my mind, I
was enabled to restrain myself from any inconsiderate action.At last there came a time when my agony could be no longer suppressed.Raymond, I saw a strange
gentleman standing in the reception room, looking at Mary Leavenworth
in a way that would have made my blood boil, even if I had not heard him
whisper these words: "But you are my wife, and know it, whatever you may
say or do!"It was the lightning-stroke of my life.After what I had done to make
her mine, to hear another claim her as already his own, was stunning,
maddening!I had either to yell in
my fury or deal the man beneath some tremendous blow in my hatred.I did
not dare to shriek, so I struck the blow.Raymond, and hearing that it was, as I expected, Clavering, I flung
caution, reason, common sense, all to the winds, and in a moment of fury
denounced him as the murderer of Mr.The next instant I would have given worlds to recall my words.What had
I done but drawn attention to myself in thus accusing a man against whom
nothing could of course be proved!So, after a night of thought, I did the next best thing: gave a
superstitious reason for my action, and so restored myself to my former
position without eradicating from the mind of Mr.Raymond that vague
doubt of the man which my own safety demanded.But I had no intention of
going any further, nor should I have done so if I had not observed that
for some reason Mr.But
that once seen, revenge took possession of me, and I asked myself if the
burden of this crime could be thrown on this man.Still I do not believe
that any active results would have followed this self-questioning if I
had not overheard a whispered conversation between two of the servants,
in which I learned that Mr.Clavering had been seen to enter the
house on the night of the murder, but was not seen to leave it.With such a fact for a starting-point, what might I not
hope to accomplish?While she remained
alive I saw nothing but ruin before me.I made up my mind to destroy
her and satisfy my hatred of Mr.By what
means could I reach her without deserting my post, or make away with
her without exciting fresh suspicion?The problem seemed insolvable;
but Trueman Harwell had not played the part of a machine so long without
result.Before I had studied the question a day, light broke upon it,
and I saw that the only way to accomplish my plans was to inveigle her
into destroying herself.No sooner had this thought matured than I hastened to act upon it.Knowing the tremendous risk I ran, I took every precaution.Locking
myself up in my room, I wrote her a letter in printed characters--she
having distinctly told me she could not read writing--in which I played
upon her ignorance, foolish fondness, and Irish superstition, by telling
her I dreamed of her every night and wondered if she did of me; was
afraid she didn't, so enclosed her a little charm, which, if she would
use according to directions, would give her the most beautiful visions.These directions were for her first to destroy my letter by burning it,
next to take in her hand the packet I was careful to enclose, swallow
the powder accompanying it, and go to bed.The powder was a deadly dose
of poison and the packet was, as you know, a forged confession falsely
criminating Henry Clavering.Enclosing all these in an envelope in
the corner of which I had marked a cross, I directed it, according to
agreement, to Mrs.Then followed the greatest period of suspense I had yet endured.Though
I had purposely refrained from putting my name to the letter, I felt
that the chances of detection were very great.Let her depart in the
least particular from the course I had marked out for her, and fatal
results must ensue.If she opened the enclosed packet, mistrusted the
powder, took Mrs.Belden into her confidence, or even failed to burn my
letter, all would be lost.I could not be sure of her or know the result
of my scheme except through the newspapers.Do you think I kept watch
of the countenances about me?devoured the telegraphic news, or started
when the bell rang?And when, a few days since, I read that short
paragraph in the paper which assured me that my efforts had at least
produced the death of the woman I feared, do you think I experienced any
sense of relief?In six hours had come the summons from Mr.Gryce,
and--let these prison walls, this confession itself, tell the rest.I am
no longer capable of speech or action.THE OUTCOME OF A GREAT CRIME


    "Leave her to Heaven
    And to those thorns that
    In her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her."--Hamlet

    "For she is wise, if I can judge of her;
    And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true;
    And true she is, as she has proved herself;
    And therefore like herself, wise, fair, and true,
    Shall she be placed in my constant soul."I cried, as I made my way into her presence, "are you
prepared for very good news?News that will brighten these pale cheeks
and give the light back to these eyes, and make life hopeful and sweet
to you once more?Tell me," I urged, stooping over her where she sat,
for she looked ready to faint."I don't know," she faltered; "I fear your idea of good news and mine
may differ.No news can be good but----"

"What?"I asked, taking her hands in mine with a smile that ought to
have reassured her, it was one of such profound happiness."Tell me; do
not be afraid."Her dreadful burden had lain upon her so long it had become
a part of her being.How could she realize it was founded on a mistake;
that she had no cause to fear the past, present, or future?But when the truth was made known to her; when, with all the fervor and
gentle tact of which I was capable, I showed her that her suspicions had
been groundless, and that Trueman Harwell, and not Mary, was accountable
for the evidences of crime which had led her into attributing to her
cousin the guilt of her uncle's death, her first words were a prayer to
be taken to the one she had so wronged.I cannot breathe or think till I have begged pardon of her on my
knees.Seeing the state she was in, I deemed it wise to humor her.So,
procuring a carriage, I drove with her to her cousin's home."Mary will spurn me; she will not even look at me; and she will be
right!"she cried, as we rolled away up the avenue."An outrage like
this can never be forgiven.But God knows I thought myself justified in
my suspicions.If you knew--"

"I do know," I interposed."Mary acknowledges that the circumstantial
evidence against her was so overwhelming, she was almost staggered
herself, asking if she could be guiltless with such proofs against her.But----"

"Wait, oh, wait; did Mary say that?"I did not answer; I wanted her to see for herself the extent of that
change.But when, in a few minutes later, the carriage stopped and I
hurried with her into the house which had been the scene of so much
misery, I was hardly prepared for the difference in her own countenance
which the hall light revealed.Her eyes were bright, her cheeks were
brilliant, her brow lifted and free from shadow; so quickly does the ice
of despair melt in the sunshine of hope.Thomas, who had opened the door, was sombrely glad to see his mistress
again."Miss Leavenworth is in the drawing-room," said he.I nodded, then seeing that Eleanore could scarcely move for agitation,
asked her whether she would go in at once, or wait till she was more
composed."I will go in at once; I cannot wait."And slipping from my grasp, she
crossed the hall and laid her hand upon the drawing-room curtain, when
it was suddenly lifted from within and Mary stepped out.I did not need to glance their
way to know that Eleanore had fallen at her cousin's feet, and that
her cousin had affrightedly lifted her.I did not need to hear: "My sin
against you is too great; you cannot forgive me!"followed by the low:
"My shame is great enough to lead me to forgive anything!"to know that
the lifelong shadow between these two had dissolved like a cloud, and
that, for the future, bright days of mutual confidence and sympathy were
in store.Yet when, a half-hour or so later, I heard the door of the reception
room, into which I had retired, softly open, and looking up, saw Mary
standing on the threshold, with the light of true humility on her face,
I own that I was surprised at the softening which had taken place in
her haughty beauty."Blessed is the shame that purifies," I inwardly
murmured, and advancing, held out my hand with a respect and sympathy I
never thought to feel for her again.Blushing deeply, she came and stood by
my side."I have much to be grateful for; how
much I never realized till to-night; but I cannot speak of it now.What
I wish is for you to come in and help me persuade Eleanore to accept
this fortune from my hands.It is hers, you know; was willed to her, or
would have been if--"

"Wait," said I, in the trepidation which this appeal to me on such a
subject somehow awakened.Is it your
determined purpose to transfer your fortune into your cousin's hands?"Her look was enough without the low, "Ah, how can you ask me?"Clavering was sitting by the side of Eleanore when we entered the
drawing-room.He immediately rose, and drawing me to one side, earnestly
said:

"Before the courtesies of the hour pass between us, Mr.Raymond, allow
me to tender you my apology.You have in your possession a document
which ought never to have been forced upon you.Founded upon a mistake,
the act was an insult which I bitterly regret.If, in consideration of
my mental misery at that time, you can pardon it, I shall feel forever
indebted to you; if not----"

"Mr.The occurrences of that day belong to
a past which I, for one, have made up my mind to forget as soon as
possible.The future promises too richly for us to dwell on bygone
miseries."And with a look of mutual understanding and friendship we hastened to
rejoin the ladies.Of the conversation that followed, it is only necessary to state the
result.Eleanore, remaining firm in her refusal to accept property so
stained by guilt, it was finally agreed upon that it should be devoted
to the erection and sustainment of some charitable institution of
magnitude sufficient to be a recognized benefit to the city and its
unfortunate poor.This settled, our thoughts returned to our friends,
especially to Mr."He has grieved like a father over us."And, in her spirit of penitence, she would have undertaken the unhappy
task of telling him the truth.But Eleanore, with her accustomed generosity, would not hear of this."No, Mary," said she; "you have suffered enough.And leaving them there, with the light of growing hope and confidence on
their faces, we went out again into the night, and so into a dream from
which I have never waked, though the shine of her dear eyes have been
now the load-star of my life for many happy, happy months.Turners
preached a funerall sermon, where he spoke not particularly of him
anything, but that he was one so well known for his honesty, that it spoke
for itself above all that he could say for it.And so made a very good
sermon.Home with some of the company who supped there, and things being
quiet, at night to bed.8th, 9th, Loth, 11th, 12th, 13th.I fell to work, and my father to look
over my uncle's papers and clothes, and continued all this week upon that
business, much troubled with my aunt's base, ugly humours.We had news of
Tom Trice's putting in a caveat against us, in behalf of his mother, to
whom my uncle hath not given anything, and for good reason therein
expressed, which troubled us also.But above all, our trouble is to find
that his estate appears nothing as we expected, and all the world
believes; nor his papers so well sorted as I would have had them, but all
in confusion, that break my brains to understand them.We missed also the
surrenders of his copyhold land, without which the land would not come to
us, but to the heir at law, so that what with this, and the badness of the
drink and the ill opinion I have of the meat, and the biting of the gnats
by night and my disappointment in getting home this week, and the trouble
of sorting all the papers, I am almost out of my wits with trouble, only I
appear the more contented, because I would not have my father troubled.Philips comes home from London, and so we
advised with him and have the best counsel he could give us, but for all
that we were not quiet in our minds.At home, and Robert Barnwell with us, and dined, and
in the evening my father and I walked round Portholme and viewed all the
fields, which was very pleasant.Thence to Hinchingbroke, which is now
all in dirt, because of my Lord's building, which will make it very
magnificent.Back to Brampton, and to supper and to bed.Up by three o'clock this morning, and rode to Cambridge, and was
there by seven o'clock, where, after I was trimmed, I went to Christ
College, and found my brother John at eight o'clock in bed, which vexed
me.Then to King's College chappell, where I found the scholars in their
surplices at the service with the organs, which is a strange sight to what
it used in my time to be here.Fairbrother (whom I met
there) to the Rose tavern, and called for some wine, and there met
fortunately with Mr.Turner of our office, and sent for his wife, and were
very merry (they being come to settle their son here), and sent also for
Mr.Sanchy, of Magdalen, with whom and other gentlemen, friends of his, we
were very merry, and I treated them as well as I could, and so at noon
took horse again, having taken leave of my cozen Angier, and rode to
Impington, where I found my old uncle

     [Talbot Pepys, sixth son of John Pepys of Impington, was born 1583,
     and therefore at this time he was seventy-eight years of age.He
     was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and called to the bar at
     the Middle Temple in 1605.for Cambridge in 1625, and
     Recorder of Cambridge from 1624 to 1660, in which year he was
     succeeded by his son Roger.He died of the plague, March, 1666,
     aged eighty-three.]sitting all alone, like a man out of the world: he can hardly see; but all
things else he do pretty livelyly.John Pepys and him, I
read over the will, and had their advice therein, who, as to the
sufficiency thereof confirmed me, and advised me as to the other parts
thereof.Having done there, I rode to Gravely with much ado to inquire
for a surrender of my uncle's in some of the copyholders' hands there, but
I can hear of none, which puts me into very great trouble of mind, and so
with a sad heart rode home to Brampton, but made myself as cheerful as I
could to my father, and so to bed.16th, 17th, 18th, 19th.These four days we spent in putting things in
order, letting of the crop upon the ground, agreeing with Stankes to have
a care of our business in our absence, and we think ourselves in nothing
happy but in lighting upon him to be our bayly; in riding to Offord and
Sturtlow, and up and down all our lands, and in the evening walking, my
father and I about the fields talking, and had advice from Mr.Moore from
London, by my desire, that the three witnesses of the will being all
legatees, will not do the will any wrong.To-night Serjeant Bernard, I
hear, is come home into the country.My aunt
continuing in her base, hypocritical tricks, which both Jane Perkin (of
whom we make great use), and the maid do tell us every day of.Up to Huntingdon this morning to Sir Robert Bernard, with whom I
met Jaspar Trice.So Sir Robert caused us to sit down together and began
discourse very fairly between us, so I drew out the Will and show it him,
and [he] spoke between us as well as I could desire, but could come to no
issue till Tom Trice comes.Then Sir Robert and I fell to talk about the
money due to us upon surrender from Piggott, L164., which he tells me will
go with debts to the heir at law, which breaks my heart on the other side.Here I staid and dined with Sir Robert Bernard and his lady, my Lady
Digby, a very good woman.After dinner I went into the town and spent the
afternoon, sometimes with Mr.Vinter, Robert Ethell, and many more friends, and at last Mr.Davenport,
Phillips, Jaspar Trice, myself and others at Mother-----over against the
Crown we sat and drank ale and were very merry till 9 at night, and so
broke up.I walked home, and there found Tom Trice come, and he and my
father gone to Goody Gorum's, where I found them and Jaspar Trice got
before me, and Mr.Greene, and there had some calm discourse, but came to
no issue, and so parted.So home and to bed, being now pretty well again
of my left hand, which lately was stung and very much swelled.At home all the morning, putting my papers in order
against my going to-morrow and doing many things else to that end.Had a
good dinner, and Stankes and his wife with us.To my business again in
the afternoon, and in the evening came the two Trices, Mr.Philips, and so we began to argue.At last it came to some agreement that
for our giving of my aunt L10 she is to quit the house, and for other
matters they are to be left to the law, which do please us all, and so we
broke up, pretty well satisfyed.Barnwell and J. Bowles and
supped with us, and after supper away, and so I having taken leave of them
and put things in the best order I could against to-morrow I went to bed.Old William Luffe having been here this afternoon and paid up his bond of
L20, and I did give him into his hand my uncle's surrender of Sturtlow to
me before Mr.Philips, R. Barnwell, and Mr.Pigott, which he did
acknowledge to them my uncle did in his lifetime deliver to him.Up by three, and going by four on my way to London; but the day
proves very cold, so that having put on no stockings but thread ones under
my boots, I was fain at Bigglesworth to buy a pair of coarse woollen ones,
and put them on.So by degrees till I come to Hatfield before twelve
o'clock, where I had a very good dinner with my hostess, at my Lord of
Salisbury's Inn, and after dinner though weary I walked all alone to the
Vineyard, which is now a very beautiful place again; and coming back I met
with Mr.Looker, my Lord's gardener (a friend of Mr.Eglin's), who showed
me the house, the chappell with brave pictures, and, above all, the
gardens, such as I never saw in all my life; nor so good flowers, nor so
great gooseberrys, as big as nutmegs.Back to the inn, and drank with
him, and so to horse again, and with much ado got to London, and set him
up at Smithfield; so called at my uncle Fenner's, my mother's, my Lady's,
and so home, in all which I found all things as well as I could expect.Made visits to Sir W. Pen and Batten.Then to
Westminster, and at the Hall staid talking with Mrs.Michell a good while,
and in the afternoon, finding myself unfit for business, I went to the
Theatre, and saw "Brenoralt," I never saw before.It seemed a good play,
but ill acted; only I sat before Mrs.Palmer, the King's mistress, and
filled my eyes with her, which much pleased me.Then to my father's,
where by my desire I met my uncle Thomas, and discoursed of my uncle's
will to him, and did satisfy [him] as well as I could.So to my uncle
Wight's, but found him out of doors, but my aunt I saw and staid a while,
and so home and to bed.Troubled to hear how proud and idle Pall is
grown, that I am resolved not to keep her.This morning my wife in bed tells me of our being robbed of our
silver tankard, which vexed me all day for the negligence of my people to
leave the door open.My wife and I by water to Whitehall, where I left
her to her business and I to my cozen Thomas Pepys, and discoursed with
him at large about our business of my uncle's will.He can give us no
light at all into his estate, but upon the whole tells me that he do
believe that he has left but little money, though something more than we
have found, which is about L500.Here came Sir G. Lane by chance, seeing
a bill upon the door to hire the house, with whom my coz and I walked all
up and down, and indeed it is a very pretty place, and he do intend to
leave the agreement for the House, which is L400 fine, and L46 rent a year
to me between them.Then to the Wardrobe, but come too late, and so dined
with the servants.And then to my Lady, who do shew my wife and me the
greatest favour in the world, in which I take great content.Home by
water and to the office all the afternoon, which is a great pleasure to me
again, to talk with persons of quality and to be in command, and I give it
out among them that the estate left me is L200 a year in land, besides
moneys, because I would put an esteem upon myself.At night home and to
bed after I had set down my journals ever since my going from London this
journey to this house.This afternoon I hear that my man Will hath lost
his clock with my tankard, at which I am very glad.This morning came my box of papers from Brampton of all my uncle's
papers, which will now set me at work enough.At noon I went to the
Exchange, where I met my uncle Wight, and found him so discontented about
my father (whether that he takes it ill that he has not been acquainted
with things, or whether he takes it ill that he has nothing left him, I
cannot tell), for which I am much troubled, and so staid not long to talk
with him.Thence to my mother's, where I found my wife and my aunt Bell
and Mrs.Ramsey, and great store of tattle there was between the old women
and my mother, who thinks that there is, God knows what fallen to her,
which makes me mad, but it was not a proper time to speak to her of it,
and so I went away with Mr.Moore, and he and I to the Theatre, and saw
"The Jovial Crew," the first time I saw it, and indeed it is as merry and
the most innocent play that ever I saw, and well performed.From thence
home, and wrote to my father and so to bed.Full of thoughts to think of
the trouble that we shall go through before we come to see what will
remain to us of all our expectations.At home all the morning, and walking met with Mr.Hill of Cambridge
at Pope's Head Alley with some women with him whom he took and me into the
tavern there, and did give us wine, and would fain seem to be very knowing
in the affairs of state, and tells me that yesterday put a change to the
whole state of England as to the Church; for the King now would be forced
to favour Presbytery, or the City would leave him: but I heed not what he
says, though upon enquiry I do find that things in the Parliament are in a
great disorder.Moore, and with him to
an ordinary alone and dined, and there he and I read my uncle's will, and
I had his opinion on it, and still find more and more trouble like to
attend it.Back to the office all the afternoon, and that done home for
all night.Having the beginning of this week made a vow to myself to
drink no wine this week (finding it to unfit me to look after business),
and this day breaking of it against my will, I am much troubled for it,
but I hope God will forgive me.Montagu's chamber I heard a Frenchman
play, a friend of Monsieur Eschar's, upon the guitar, most extreme well,
though at the best methinks it is but a bawble.From thence to
Westminster Hall, where it was expected that the Parliament was to have
been adjourned for two or three months, but something hinders it for a day
or two.George Montagu, and advised about a
ship to carry my Lord Hinchingbroke and the rest of the young gentlemen to
France, and they have resolved of going in a hired vessell from Rye, and
not in a man of war.He told me in discourse that my Lord Chancellor is
much envied, and that many great men, such as the Duke of Buckingham and
my Lord of Bristoll, do endeavour to undermine him, and that he believes
it will not be done; for that the King (though he loves him not in the way
of a companion, as he do these young gallants that can answer him in his
pleasures), yet cannot be without him, for his policy and service.From
thence to the Wardrobe, where my wife met me, it being my Lord of
Sandwich's birthday, and so we had many friends here, Mr.Townsend and his
wife, and Captain Ferrers lady and Captain Isham, and were very merry, and
had a good venison pasty.Pargiter, the merchant, was with us also.Townsend was called upon by Captain Cooke: so we three
went to a tavern hard by, and there he did give us a song or two; and
without doubt he hath the best manner of singing in the world.Back to my
wife, and with my Lady Jem.and Pall by water through bridge, and showed
them the ships with great pleasure, and then took them to my house to show
it them (my Lady their mother having been lately all alone to see it and
my wife, in my absence in the country), and we treated them well, and were
very merry.Then back again through bridge, and set them safe at home,
and so my wife and I by coach home again, and after writing a letter to my
father at Brampton, who, poor man, is there all alone, and I have not
heard from him since my coming from him, which troubles me.This morning as my wife and I were going to church,
comes Mrs.Ramsay to see us, so we sent her to church, and we went too,
and came back to dinner, and she dined with us and was wellcome.To
church again in the afternoon, and then come home with us Sir W. Pen, and
drank with us, and then went away, and my wife after him to see his
daughter that is lately come out of Ireland.I staid at home at my book;
she came back again and tells me that whereas I expected she should have
been a great beauty, she is a very plain girl.This evening my wife gives
me all my linen, which I have put up, and intend to keep it now in my own
custody.This morning we began again to sit in the mornings at the office,
but before we sat down.Sir R. Slingsby and I went to Sir R. Ford's to
see his house, and we find it will be very convenient for us to have it
added to the office if he can be got to part with it.Then we sat down
and did business in the office.So home to dinner, and my brother Tom
dined with me, and after dinner he and I alone in my chamber had a great
deal of talk, and I find that unless my father can forbear to make profit
of his house in London and leave it to Tom, he has no mind to set up the
trade any where else, and so I know not what to do with him.After this I
went with him to my mother, and there told her how things do fall out
short of our expectations, which I did (though it be true) to make her
leave off her spending, which I find she is nowadays very free in,
building upon what is left to us by my uncle to bear her out in it, which
troubles me much.While I was here word is brought that my aunt Fenner is
exceeding ill, and that my mother is sent for presently to come to her:
also that my cozen Charles Glassecocke, though very ill himself, is this
day gone to the country to his brother, John Glassecocke, who is a-dying
there.After my singing-master had done with me this morning, I went to
White Hall and Westminster Hall, where I found the King expected to come
and adjourn the Parliament.I found the two Houses at a great difference,
about the Lords challenging their privileges not to have their houses
searched, which makes them deny to pass the House of Commons' Bill for
searching for pamphlets and seditious books.Thence by water to the
Wardrobe (meeting the King upon the water going in his barge to adjourn
the House) where I dined with my Lady, and there met Dr.Thomas Pepys, who
I found to be a silly talking fellow, but very good-natured.So home to
the office, where we met about the business of Tangier this afternoon.Moore, and he and I walked into the City
and there parted.To Fleet Street to find when the Assizes begin at
Cambridge and Huntingdon, in order to my going to meet with Roger Pepys
for counsel.Salisbury, who is now
grown in less than two years' time so great a limner--that he is become
excellent, and gets a great deal of money at it.I took him to Hercules
Pillars to drink, and there came Mr.Whore (whom I formerly have known), a
friend of his to him, who is a very ingenious fellow, and there I sat with
them a good while, and so home and wrote letters late to my Lord and to my
father, and then to bed.Singing-master came to me this morning; then to the office all the
morning.In the afternoon I went to the Theatre, and there I saw "The
Tamer Tamed"  well done.And then home, and prepared to go to Walthamstow
to-morrow.This night I was forced to borrow L40 of Sir W. Batten.DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS.AUGUST
                                   1661

August 1st.This morning Sir Williams both, and my wife and I and Mrs.Margarett Pen (this first time that I have seen her since she came from
Ireland) went by coach to Walthamstow, a-gossiping to Mrs.Browne, where I
did give her six silver spoons--[But not the porringer of silver.See May
29th, 1661.--M.Here we had a venison pasty, brought hot
from London, and were very merry.Only I hear how nurse's husband has
spoken strangely of my Lady Batten how she was such a man's whore, who
indeed is known to leave her her estate, which we would fain have
reconciled to-day, but could not and indeed I do believe that the story is
true.Pepys dined with
me, and after dinner my brother Tom came to me and then I made myself
ready to get a-horseback for Cambridge.So I set out and rode to Ware,
this night, in the way having much discourse with a fellmonger,--[A dealer
in hides.]--a Quaker, who told me what a wicked man he had been all his
life-time till within this two years.Here I lay, and

3rd.Got up early the next morning and got to Barkway, where I staid and
drank, and there met with a letter-carrier of Cambridge, with whom I rode
all the way to Cambridge, my horse being tired, and myself very wet with
rain.I went to the Castle Hill, where the judges were at the Assizes;
and I staid till Roger Pepys rose and went with him, and dined with his
brother, the Doctor, and Claxton at Trinity Hall.Then parted, and I went
to the Rose, and there with Mr.Pechell, Sanchy, and others, sat and drank
till night and were very merry, only they tell me how high the old doctors
are in the University over those they found there, though a great deal
better scholars than themselves; for which I am very sorry, and, above
all, Dr.At night I took horse, and rode with Roger Pepys and
his two brothers to Impington, and there with great respect was led up by
them to the best chamber in the house, and there slept.Got up, and by and by walked into the orchard with my
cozen Roger, and there plucked some fruit, and then discoursed at large
about the business I came for, that is, about my uncle's will, in which he
did give me good satisfaction, but tells me I shall meet with a great deal
of trouble in it.However, in all things he told me what I am to expect
and what to do.To church, and had a good plain sermon, and my uncle
Talbot went with us and at our coming in the country-people all rose with
so much reverence; and when the parson begins, he begins "Right
worshipfull and dearly beloved" to us.Home to dinner, which was very
good, and then to church again, and so home and to walk up and down and so
to supper, and after supper to talk about publique matters, wherein Roger
Pepys--(who I find a very sober man, and one whom I do now honour more
than ever before for this discourse sake only) told me how basely things
have been carried in Parliament by the young men, that did labour to
oppose all things that were moved by serious men.That they are the most
prophane swearing fellows that ever he heard in his life, which makes him
think that they will spoil all, and bring things into a warr again if they
can.Early to Huntingdon, but was fain to stay a great while at Stanton
because of the rain, and there borrowed a coat of a man for 6d., and so he
rode all the way, poor man, without any.Staid at Huntingdon for a
little, but the judges are not come hither: so I went to Brampton, and
there found my father very well, and my aunt gone from the house, which I
am glad of, though it costs us a great deal of money, viz.Here I
dined, and after dinner took horse and rode to Yelling, to my cozen
Nightingale's, who hath a pretty house here, and did learn of her all she
could tell me concerning my business, and has given me some light by her
discourse how I may get a surrender made for Graveley lands.Hence to
Graveley, and there at an alehouse met with Chancler and Jackson (one of
my tenants for Cotton closes) and another with whom I had a great deal of
discourse, much to my satisfaction.Hence back again to Brampton and
after supper to bed, being now very quiet in the house, which is a content
to us.Phillips, but lost my labour, he lying at
Huntingdon last night, so I went back again and took horse and rode
thither, where I staid with Thos.Philips drinking till
noon, and then Tom Trice and I to Brampton, where he to Goody Gorum's and
I home to my father, who could discern that I had been drinking, which he
did never see or hear of before, so I eat a bit of dinner and went with
him to Gorum's, and there talked with Tom Trice, and then went and took
horse for London, and with much ado, the ways being very bad, got to
Baldwick, and there lay and had a good supper by myself.The landlady
being a pretty woman, but I durst not take notice of her, her husband
being there.Before supper I went to see the church, which is a very
handsome church, but I find that both here, and every where else that I
come, the Quakers do still continue, and rather grow than lessen.Called up at three o'clock, and was a-horseback by four; and as I
was eating my breakfast I saw a man riding by that rode a little way upon
the road with me last night; and he being going with venison in his
pan-yards to London, I called him in and did give him his breakfast with
me, and so we went together all the way.At Hatfield we bayted and walked
into the great house through all the courts; and I would fain have stolen
a pretty dog that followed me, but I could not, which troubled me.To
horse again, and by degrees with much ado got to London, where I found all
well at home and at my father's and my Lady's, but no news yet from my
Lord where he is.At my Lady's (whither I went with Dean Fuller, who came
to my house to see me just as I was come home) I met with Mr.Moore, who
told me at what a loss he was for me, for to-morrow is a Seal day at the
Privy Seal, and it being my month, I am to wait upon my Lord Roberts, Lord
Privy Seal, at the Seal.Early in the mornink to Whitehall, but my Lord Privy Seal came not
all the morning.Moore and I to the Wardrobe to dinner, where
my Lady and all merry and well.Back again to the Privy Seal; but my Lord
comes not all the afternoon, which made me mad and gives all the world
reason to talk of his delaying of business, as well as of his severity and
ill using of the Clerks of the Privy Seal.Pierce's brother (the souldier) to the tavern
next the Savoy, and there staid and drank with them.Mage, and discoursing of musique Mons.Eschar spoke so much against the
English and in praise of the French that made him mad, and so he went
away.After a stay with them a little longer we parted and I home.To the office, where word is brought me by a son-in-law of Mr.Pierces; the purser, that his father is a dying and that he desires that I
would come to him before he dies.So I rose from the table and went,
where I found him not so ill as I thought that he had been ill.So I did
promise to be a friend to his wife and family if he should die, which was
all he desired of me, but I do believe he will recover.Back again to the
office, where I found Sir G. Carteret had a day or two ago invited some of
the officers to dinner to-day at Deptford.So at noon, when I heard that
he was a-coming, I went out, because I would see whether he would send to
me or no to go with them; but he did not, which do a little trouble me
till I see how it comes to pass.Although in other things I am glad of it
because of my going again to-day to the Privy Seal.I dined at home, and
having dined news is brought by Mr.Hater that his wife is now falling
into labour, so he is come for my wife, who presently went with him.I to
White Hall, where, after four o'clock, comes my Lord Privy Seal, and so we
went up to his chamber over the gate at White Hall, where he asked me what
deputacon I had from My Lord.I told him none; but that I am sworn my
Lord's deputy by both of the Secretarys, which did satisfy him.Moore to read over all the bills as is the manner, and all
ended very well.So that I see the Lyon is not so fierce as he is
painted.Eschar (who all this afternoon had been
waiting at the Privy Seal for the Warrant for L5,000 for my Lord of
Sandwich's preparation for Portugal) and I took some wine with us and went
to visit la belle Pierce, who we find very big with child, and a pretty
lady, one Mrs.Clifford, with her, where we staid and were extraordinary
merry.From thence I took coach to my father's, where I found him come
home this day from Brampton (as I expected) very well, and after some
discourse about business and it being very late I took coach again home,
where I hear by my wife that Mrs.Hater is not yet delivered, but
continues in her pains.This morning came the maid that my wife hath lately hired for a
chamber maid.She is very ugly, so that I cannot care for her, but
otherwise she seems very good.But however she do come about three weeks
hence, when my wife comes back from Brampton, if she go with my father.By
and by came my father to my house, and so he and I went and found out my
uncle Wight at the Coffee House, and there did agree with him to meet the
next week with my uncle Thomas and read over the Captain's will before
them both for their satisfaction.Having done with him I went to my
Lady's and dined with her, and after dinner took the two young gentlemen
and the two ladies and carried them and Captain Ferrers to the Theatre,
and shewed them "The merry Devill of Edmunton," which is a very merry
play, the first time I ever saw it, which pleased me well.And that being
done I took them all home by coach to my house and there gave them fruit
to eat and wine.So by water home with them, and so home myself.To our own church in the forenoon, and in the
afternoon to Clerkenwell Church, only to see the two

be placed in the pew where they afterwards came to sit, but the pew by
their coming being too full, I went out into the next, and there sat, and
had my full view of them both, but I am out of conceit now with them,
Colonel Dillon being come back from Ireland again, and do still court
them, and comes to church with them, which makes me think they are not
honest.Hence to Graye's-Inn walks, and there staid a good while; where I
met with Ned Pickering, who told me what a great match of hunting of a
stagg the King had yesterday; and how the King tired all their horses, and
come home with not above two or three able to keep pace with him.So to
my father's, and there supped, and so home.At home in the afternoon, and had
notice that my Lord Hinchingbroke is fallen ill, which I fear is with the
fruit that I did give them on Saturday last at my house: so in the evening
I went thither and there found him very ill, and in great fear of the
smallpox.I supped with my Lady, and did consult about him, but we find
it best to let him lie where he do; and so I went home with my heart full
of trouble for my Lord Hinchinabroke's sickness, and more for my Lord
Sandwich's himself, whom we are now confirmed is sick ashore at Alicante,
who, if he should miscarry, God knows in what condition would his family
be.I dined to-day with my Lord Crew, who is now at Sir H. Wright's,
while his new house is making fit for him, and he is much troubled also at
these things.To the Privy Seal in the morning, then to the Wardrobe to dinner,
where I met my wife, and found my young Lord very ill.So my Lady intends
to send her other three sons, Sidney, Oliver, and John, to my house, for
fear of the small-pox.After dinner I went to my father's, where I found
him within, and went up to him, and there found him settling his papers
against his removal, and I took some old papers of difference between me
and my wife and took them away.After that Pall being there I spoke to my
father about my intention not to keep her longer for such and such
reasons, which troubled him and me also, and had like to have come to some
high words between my mother and me, who is become a very simple woman.Cordery to take her leave of my father, thinking
he was to go presently into the country, and will have us to come and see
her before he do go.Then my father and I went forth to Mr.Rawlinson's,
where afterwards comes my uncle Thomas and his two sons, and then my uncle
Wight by appointment of us all, and there we read the will and told them
how things are, and what our thoughts are of kindness to my uncle Thomas
if he do carry himself peaceable, but otherwise if he persist to keep his
caveat up against us.So he promised to withdraw it, and seemed to be
very well contented with things as they are.After a while drinking, we
paid all and parted, and so I home, and there found my Lady's three sons
come, of which I am glad that I am in condition to do her and my Lord any
service in this kind, but my mind is yet very much troubled about my Lord
of Sandwich's health, which I am afeard of.This morning Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen and I, waited upon the
Duke of York in his chamber, to give him an account of the condition of
the Navy for lack of money, and how our own very bills are offered upon
the Exchange, to be sold
