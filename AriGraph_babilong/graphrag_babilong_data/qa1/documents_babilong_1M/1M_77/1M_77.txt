I will therefore only recommend the
strict observation of all these rules, and also of those made by His
Excellency Mr.van Mydregt of November 29, 1690, and those of Mr.Blom
of October 20, with regard to the visits of the clergy to the churches
and the instructions for the Scholarchen in Ceylon generally by His
Excellency the Governor and the Council of December 25, 1663, and
approved by the Council of India with a few alterations in March, 1667.The Consistory consists at present of the four ministers mentioned
above, besides:--


Joan Roos, Elder.To these is added as Commissaris Politicus, the Administrateur Abraham
Michielsz Biermans, in compliance with the orders of December 27, 1643,
issued by His late Excellency the Governor General Antony van Diemen
and the Council of India at Batavia.Further information relating
to the churches may be found in the resolutions of the Political
Council and the College of the Scholarchen of Ceylon from March 13,
1668, to April 3 following.I think that in these documents will be
found all measures calculated to advance the prosperity of the church
in Jaffnapatam, and to these may be added the instructions for the
clergy passed at the meeting of January 11, 1651.(38)

The churches and the buildings attached to the churches are in many
places greatly decayed.I found to my regret that some churches
look more like stables than buildings where the Word of God is to be
propagated among the Mallabaars.It is evident that for some years
very little has been done in regard to this matter, and as this is a
work particularly within the province of the Dessave, I have no doubt
that he will take the necessary measures to remedy the evil; so that
the natives may not be led to think that even their rulers do not have
much esteem for the True Religion.It would be well for the Dessave
to go on circuit and himself inspect all the churches.Until he can
do so he may be guided by the reports with regard to these buildings
made by Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz on March 19 and April 4, 1696.He
must also be aware that the schoolmasters and merinhos have neglected
the gardens attached to the houses, which contain many fruit trees and
formerly yielded very good fruit, especially grapes, which served for
the refreshment of the clergymen and Scholarchen on their visits.(39)

The Civil Court or Land Raad has been instituted on account of the
large population, and because of the difficulty of settling their
disagreements, which cannot always be done by the Commandeur or the
Court of Justice, nor by the Dessave, because his jurisdiction is
limited to the amount of 100 Pordaus.[45] The sessions held every
Wednesday must not be omitted again, as happened during my absence
in Colombo on account of the indisposition of the President.This
Court consists at present of the following persons:--


Abraham Michielsz Biermans, Administrateur.Jan Fransz, Vryburger, Vice-President.Jan Lodewyk Stumphuis, Paymaster.Lucas de Lange, Vryburger.Louis Verwyk, Vryburger.J. L. Stumphuis, mentioned above, Secretary.The native members are Don Louis Poeder and Don Denis Nitsingeraye.The instructions issued for the guidance of the Land Raad may be found
with the documents relating to this college of 1661, in which are also
contained the various Ordinances relating to the official Secretaries
in this Commandement, all which must be strictly observed.As there is
no proper place for the assembly of the Land Raad nor for the meeting
of the Scholarchen, and as both have been held so far in the front room
of the house of the Dessave, where there is no privacy for either,
it will be necessary to make proper provision for this.The best
place would be in the town behind the orphanage, where the Company
has a large plot of land and could acquire still more if a certain
foul pool be filled up as ordered by His Excellency van Mydregt.A
building ought to be put up about 80 or 84 feet by 30 feet, with a
gallery in the centre of about 10 or 12 feet, so that two large rooms
could be obtained, one on either side of the gallery, the one for the
assembly of the Land Raad and the other for that of the Scholarchen.It
would be best to have the whole of the ground raised about 5 or 6
feet to keep it as dry as possible during the rainy season, while
at the entrance, in front of the gallery, a flight of stone steps
would be required.In order, however, that it may not seem as if I am
unaware of the order contained in the letter from Their Excellencies
of November 23, 1695, where the erection of no public building is
permitted without authority from Batavia, except at the private cost
of the builder, I wish to state here particularly that I have merely
stated the above by way of advice, and that Your Honours must wait for
orders from Batavia for the erection of such a building.I imagine
that Their Excellencies will give their consent when they consider
that masonry work costs the Company but very little in Jaffnapatam,
as may be seen in the expenditure on the fortifications, which was
met entirely by the chicos or fines, imposed on those who failed to
attend for the Oely service.Lime, stone, cooly labour, and timber
are obtained free, except palmyra rafters, which, however, are not
expensive.The chief cost consists in the wages for masonry work and
the iron, so that in respect of building Jaffnapatam has an advantage
over other places.Further instructions must however be awaited, as
none of the Company's servants is authorized to dispense with them.(40)

The Weesmeesteren (guardians of the orphans) will find the regulations
for their guidance in the Statutes of Batavia, which were published
on July 1, 1642, [46] by His Excellency the Governor-General Antonis
van Diemen and the Council of India by public placaat.This college
consists at present of the following persons:--


Pieter Chr.Joan Roos, Onderkoopman.Johannes Huysman, Boekhouder.Jan Baptist Verdonk, Vryburger.the Government of India has been pleased to send
to Ceylon by letter of May 3, 1695, a special Ordinance for the
Orphan Chamber and its officials with regard to their salaries,
I consider it necessary to remind you of it here and to recommend
its strict observance, as well also of the resolution of March 20,
1696, whereby the Orphan Chamber is instructed that all such money
as is placed under their administration which is derived from the
estates of deceased persons who had invested money on interest with
the Company, and whose heirs were not living in the same place, must
be remitted to the Orphan Chamber at Batavia with the interest due
within a month or six weeks.(41)

The Commissioners of Marriage Causes will also find their instructions
in the Statutes of Batavia, mentioned above, which must be carefully
observed.Nothing need be said with regard to this College, but that
it consists of the following persons:--


Claas Isaacsz, Lieutenant, President.Lucas Langer, Vryburger, Vice-President.Joan Roos, Onderkoopman.[42]


The officers of the Burgery, [47] the Pennisten, [48] and the
Ambachtsgezellen [49] will likewise find their instructions and
regulations in the Statutes of Batavia, and apply them as far as
applicable.[43]

The Superintendent of the Fire Brigade and the Wardens of the Town
(Brand and Wyk Meesteren) have their orders and distribution of work
publicly assigned to them by the Regulation of November 8, 1691,
upon which I need not remark anything, except that the following
persons are the present members of this body:--


Jan van Croenevelt, Fiscaal, President.Jan Baptist Verdonk, Vryburger, Vice-President.Lucas de Langer, Vryburger.[44]


The deacons, as caretakers of the poor, have been mentioned already
under the heading of the Consistory.During the last five and half
years they have spent Rds.1,145.3.7 more than they received.As I
apprehended this would cause inconvenience, I proposed in my letter
of December 1, 1696, to Colombo that the Poor House should be endowed
with the Sicos money for the year 1695, which otherwise would have
been granted to the Seminary, which did not need it then, as it had
received more than it required.Meantime orders were received from
Batavia that the funds of the said Seminary should be transferred
to the Company, so that the Sicos money could not be disposed of in
that way.As the deficit is chiefly due to the purchase, alteration,
and repairing of an orphanage and the maintenance of the children,
as may be seen from the letters to Colombo of December 12 and 17,
1696, to which expenditure the Deaconate had not been subject before
the year 1690, other means will have to be considered to increase
its funds in order to prevent the Deaconate from getting into further
arrears.It would be well therefore if Your Honours would carefully
read the Instructions of His late Excellency van Mydregt of November
29, 1690, and ascertain whether alimentation given to the poor by
the Deaconate has been well distributed and whether it really was of
the nature of alms and alimentation as it should be.A report of the
result of your inquiry should be sent to His Excellency the Governor
and the Council of Colombo.You might also state therein whether the
orphanage has not been sufficiently enlarged yet, for it seems to me
that the expenditure is too great for only 14 children, as there are
at present.It might also be considered whether the Company could not
find some source of income for the Deaconate in case this orphanage
is not quite completed without further expenditure, and care must be
taken that the deacons strictly observe the rules laid down for them
in the Regulation of His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Ceylon of January 2, 1666.The present matron, Catharina Cornelisz,
widow of the late Krankbezoeker Dupree, must be directed to follow
the rules laid down for her by the Governor here on November 4, 1694,
and approved in Colombo.That all the inferior colleges mentioned
here successively have to be renewed yearly by the Political Council
is such a well-known matter that I do not think it would escape
your attention; but, as approbation from Colombo has to be obtained
for the changes made they have to be considered early, so that the
approbation may be received here in time.The usual date is June 23,
the day of the conquest of this territory, but this date has been
altered again to June 13, 1696, by His Excellency the Governor and
the Council of Colombo.[45]

The assessment of all measures and weights must likewise be renewed
every year, in the presence of the Fiscaal and Commissioners;
because the deceitful nature of these inhabitants is so great that
they seem not to be able to help cheating each other.The proceeds
of this marking, which usually amounts to Rds.70 or 80, are for the
largest part given to some deserving person as a subsistence.On my
arrival here I found that it had been granted to the Vryburger Jurrian
Verwyk, who is an old man and almost unable to serve as an assayer.The
post has, however, been left to him, and his son-in-law Jan Fransz,
also a Vryburger, has been appointed his assistant.The last time
the proceeds amounted to 80 rds.3 fannums, 8 tammekassen and 2 1/2
duyten, as may be seen from the report of the Commissioners bearing
date December 13, 1696.This amount has been disposed of as follows:--


        For the Assizer                      Rds.60.0.0.0
        For the assistant to the Assizer      "    6.0.0.0
        Balance to the Company's account      "   14.3.8.2 1/2
                                                  ============
                                    Total    Rds.80.3.8.2 1/2


It must be seen to that the Assizer, having been sworn, observes
his instructions as extracted from the Statutes of Batavia, as made
applicable to the customs of this country by the Government here on
March 3, 1666.In compliance with orders from Batavia contained in the letter of June
24, 1696, sums on interest may not be deposited with the Company here,
as may be seen also from a letter sent from here to Batavia on August
18 following, where it is stated that all money deposited thus must
be refunded.This order has been carried out, and the only deposits
retained are those of the Orphan Chamber, the Deaconate, the Seminary,
and the Widows' fund, for which permission had been obtained by letter
of December 15 of the same year.As the Seminary no longer possesses
any fund of its own, no deposit on that account is now left with
the Company.Your Honours must see that no other sums on interest
are accepted in deposit, as this Commandement has more money than
is necessary for its expenditure and even to assist other stations,
such as Trincomalee, &c., for which yearly Rds.16,000 to 18,000
are required, and this notwithstanding that Coromandel receives the
proceeds from the sale of elephants here, while we receive only the
money drafts.[46]

No money drafts are to be passed here on behalf of private persons,
whether Company's servants or otherwise, in any of the outstations,
but in case any person wishes to remit money to Batavia, this may be
done only after permission and consent obtained from His Excellency
the Governor at Colombo.When this is obtained, the draft is prepared
at Colombo and only signed here by the Treasurer on receipt of the
amount.This is specially mentioned here in order that Your Honours may
also remember in such cases the Instructions sent by the Honourable the
Government of India in the letters of May 3, 1695, and June 3, 1696,
in the former of which it is stated that no copper coin, and in the
latter that Pagodas are to be received here on behalf of the Company
for such drafts, each Pagoda being counted at Rds.[47]

The golden Pagoda is a coin which was never or seldom known to be
forged, at least so long as the King of Golconda or the King of the
Carnatic was sovereign in Coromandel.But the present war, which has
raged for the last ten years in that country, seems to have taken away
to some extent the fear of evil and the disgrace which follows it,
and to have given opportunity to some to employ cunning in the pursuit
of gain.It has thus happened that on the coast beyond Porto Novo,
in the domain of these lords of the woods (Boschheeren) or Paligares,
Pagodas have been made which, although not forged, are yet inferior
in quality; while the King of Sinsi Rama Ragie is so much occupied
with the present war against the Mogul, that he has no time to pay
attention to the doings of these Paligares.According to a statement
made by His Excellency the Governor Laurens Pyl and the Council of
Negapatam in their letter of November 4, 1695, five different kinds
of such inferior Pagodas have been received, valued at 7 3/8, 7 1/8,
7 5/8, 7 7/8, and 8 3/4 of unwrought gold.A notice was published
therefore on November 18, following, to warn the people against the
acceptance of such Pagodas, and prohibiting their introduction into
this country.When the Company's Treasury was verified by a Committee,
1,042 of these Pagodas were found.Intimation was sent to Colombo on
December 31, 1695.The Treasurer informed me when I was in Colombo
that he had sent them to Trincomalee, and as no complaints have been
received, it seems that the Sinhalese in that quarter did not know
how to distinguish them from the current Pagodas.As I heard that
the inferior Pagodas had been already introduced here, while it was
impossible to get rid of them, as many of the people of Jaffnapatam
and the merchants made a profit on them by obtaining them at a lower
rate in Coromandel and passing them here to ignorant people at the
full value, a banker from Negapatam able to distinguish the good from
the inferior coins has been asked to test all Pagodas, so that the
Company may not suffer a loss.But in spite of this I receive daily
complaints from Company's servants, including soldiers and sailors,
that they always have to suffer loss on the Pagodas received from
the Company in payment of their wages, when they present them at the
bazaar; while the chetties and bankers will never give them 24 fanums
for a Pagoda.This matter looks very suspicious, and may have an evil
influence on the Company's servants, because it is possible that the
chetties have agreed among themselves never to pay the full value
for Pagodas, whether they are good or bad.It is also possible that
the Company's cashier or banker is in collusion with the chetties,
or perhaps there is some reason for this which I am not able to
make out.However this may be, Your Honours must try to obtain as
much information as possible on this subject and report on it to
His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo.All inferior
Pagodas found in the Company's Treasury will have to be made good by
the cashier at Coromandel, as it was his business to see that none
were accepted.With a view to prevent discontent among the Company's
servants the tax collectors must be made to pay only in copper and
silver coin for the poll tax and land rent, and out of this the
soldiers, sailors, and the lower grades of officials must be paid,
as I had already arranged before I left.I think that they can easily
do this, as they have to collect the amount in small instalments from
all classes of persons.The poor people do not pay in Pagodas, and the
collectors might make a profit by changing the small coin for Pagodas,
and this order will be a safeguard against loss both to the Company
and its servants.It would be well if Your Honours could find a means
of preventing the Pagodas being introduced and to discard those that
are in circulation already, which I have so far not been able to
do.Perhaps on some occasion you might find a suitable means.[48]

The demands received here from out-stations in this Commandement must
be met as far as possible, because it is a rule with the Company that
one district must accommodate another, which, I suppose, will be
the practice everywhere.Since His Excellency the Governor and the
Council of Colombo have authorized Your Honours in their letter of
June 13,1696, to draw directly from Coromandel the goods required from
those places for the use of this Commandement, Your Honours must avail
yourselves of this kind permission, which is in agreement with the
intention of the late Commissioner van Mydregt, who did not wish that
the order should pass through various hands.Care must be taken to send
the orders in due time, so that the supplies may not run out of stock
when required for the garrisons.The articles ordered from Jaffnapatam
for Manaar must be sent only in instalments, and no articles must be
sent but those that are really required, as instructed; because it
has occurred more than once that goods were ordered which remained
in the warehouses, because they could not be sold, and which, when
going bad, had to be returned here and sold by public auction, to
the prejudice of the Company.To give an idea of the small sale in
Manaar, I will just state here that last year various provisions and
other articles from the Company's warehouses were sent to the amount
of Fl.1,261.16.6--cost price--which were sold there at Fl.2,037,
so that only a profit of Fl.775.3.10 was made, which did not include
any merchandise, but only articles for consumption and use.[49]

The Company's chaloups [50] and other vessels kept here for the
service of the Company are the following:--


            The chaloup "Kennemerland.""'t Wapen van Friesland."The small chaloup "Manaar."Further, 14 tonys [51] and manschouwers, [52] viz.:--


            4 tonys for service in the Fort.1 tony  in Isle de Vacoa.in the islands "De Twee Gebroeders."Three manschouwers for the three largest chaloups, one manschouwer for
the ponton "De Hoop," one manschouwer for the ferry at Colombogamme,
one manschouwer for the ferry between the island Leiden and the fort
Kayts or Hammenhiel.The chaloups "Kennemerland" and "Friesland" are used mostly for the
passage between Coromandel and Jaffnapatam, and to and fro between
Jaffnapatam and Manaar, because they sink too deep to pass the river
of Manaar to be used on the west coast of Ceylon between Colombo and
Manaar.They are therefore employed during the northern monsoon to
fetch from Manaar such articles as have been brought there from Colombo
for this Commandement, and also to transport such things as are to
be sent from here to Colombo and Manaar, &c. They also serve during
the southern monsoon to bring here from Negapatam nely, cotton goods,
coast iron, &c., and they take back palmyra wood, laths, jagerbollen,
[53] coral stone, also palmyra wood for Trincomalee, and corsingos,
oil, cayro, [54] &c. The sloop "Jaffnapatam" has been built more
for convenience, and conveys usually important advices and money, as
also the Company's servants.As this vessel can be made to navigate
the Manaar river, it is also used as a cruiser at the pearl banks,
during the pearl fishery.It is employed between Colombo, Manaar,
Jaffnapatam, Negapatam, and Trincomalee, wherever required.The small
sloops "Manaar" and "De Visser," which are so small that they might
sooner be called boats than sloops, are on account of their small
size usually employed between Manaar and Jaffnapatam, and also for
inland navigation between the Passes and Kayts for the transport of
soldiers, money, dye-roots from The Islands, timber from the borders
of the Wanni, horses from The Islands; while they are also useful
for the conveyance of urgent advices and may be used also during the
pearl fishery.The sloop "Hammenhiel," being still smaller than the
two former, is only used for convenience of the garrison at Kayts,
the fort being surrounded by water.This and a tony are used to
bring the people across, and also to fetch drinking water and fuel
from the "Barren Island."The three pontons are very useful here,
as they have daily to bring fuel and lime for this Castle, and they
are also used for the unloading of the sloops at Kayts, where they
bring charcoal and caddegans, [55] and fetch lunt from the Passes,
and palmyra wood from the inner harbours for this place as well
as for Manaar and Colombo.They also bring coral stone from Kayts,
and have to transport the nely and other provisions to the redoubts
on the borders of the Wanni, so that they need never be unemployed
if there is only a sufficient number of carreas or fishermen for the
crew.At present there are 72 carreas who have to perform oely service
on board of these vessels or on the four tonies mentioned above.(50)

In order that these vessels may be preserved for many years, it
is necessary that they be keelhauled at least twice a year, and
rubbed with lime and margosa oil to prevent worms from attacking
them, which may be easily done by taking them all in turn.It must
also be remembered to apply to His Excellency the Governor and the
Council for a sufficient quantity of pitch, tar, sail cloth, paint,
and linseed oil, because I have no doubt that it will be an advantage
to the Company if the said vessels are kept constantly in repair.As
stated under the heading of the felling of timber, no suitable wood
is found in the Wanni for the parts of the vessels that remain under
water, and therefore no less than 150 or 200 kiate or angely boards of
2 1/2, 2, and 1 1/2 inches thickness are required yearly here for this
purpose.His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo have
promised to send this yearly, in answer to the request from Jaffnapatam
of February 17, 1692, and since this timber has to be obtained from
Mallabaar I will see whether I cannot send it directly by a private
vessel in case it cannot be obtained from Colombo.Application must be
made for Dutch sailors from Colombo to man the said sloops, which are
at present partly manned by natives for want of Europeans.According to
the latest regulation, 95 sailors are allowed for this Commandement,
while at present we have not even half that number, as only 46 are
employed, which causes much inconvenience in the service.The fortifications of the Castle have now for a few years been
complete, except the moat, which is being dug and has advanced to the
peculiar stratum of rocks which is found only in this country.All
matters relating to this subject are to be found in the Compendiums
for 1693, 1694, and 1695.Supposing that the moat could be dug to the
proper depth without danger to the fort, it could not be done in less
than a few years, and it cannot very well be accomplished with the
services of the ordinary oeliaars, so that other means will have to be
considered.If, on the other hand, the moat cannot be deepened without
danger to the foundations of the fort, as stated in the Compendium
for 1694, it is apparent that the project ought to be abandoned.In
that case the fort must be secured in some other way.The most natural
means which suggests itself is to raise the wall on all sides except
on the river side by 6 or 8 feet, but this is not quite possible,
because the foundation under the curtains of the fortification, the
faces of the bastion, and the flanks have been built too narrow,
so that only a parapet of about 11 feet is left, which is already
too small, while if the parapet were extended inward there would not
be sufficient space for the canons and the military.The best plan
would therefore be to cut away the hills that are found between the
Castle and the town.The earth might be thrown into the tank found
eastward of the Castle, while part of it might be utilized to fill
up another tank in the town behind the orphanage.This was the plan
of His Excellency van Mydregt, although it was never put down in
writing.Meantime care must be taken that the slaves and other native
servants of persons residing in the Castle do not through laziness
throw the dirt which they are supposed to carry away from the fort on
the opposite bank of the moat, and thus raise a space which the Company
would much rather lower, and gradually and imperceptibly prepare a
suitable place for the battery of an enemy.I have had notices put
up against this practice, under date July 18, 1695, and these must be
maintained and the offenders prosecuted.Considering the situation of
the Castle and the present appearance of the moat, I think that the
latter is already sufficiently deep if always four or five feet water
be kept in it.In order to do this two banks would have to be built,
as the moat has communication in two places with the river, while the
river also touches the fort at two points.This being done I think
the moat could be kept full of water by two or three water mills
driven by wind and pumps, especially during the south-west monsoon
or the dry season, when an attack would be most likely to occur,
and there is always plenty of wind to keep these mills going both
by night and day.A sluice would be required in the middle of these
banks so that the water may be let out whenever it became offensive
by the river running dry, to be filled again when the water rose.It
would have to be first ascertained whether the banks could really
be built in such a way that they would entirely stop the water in
the moat, because they would have to be built on one side against
the foundations of the fort, which I have been told consist of large
irregular rocks.An experiment could be made with a small mill of the
kind used in Holland in the ditches along bleaching fields.They are
quite inexpensive and easily erected and not difficult to repair,
as they turn on a dovetail.The late Commandeur Anthony Paviljoen
also appears to have thought of this plan even before this Castle was
built, when the Portuguese fort was occupied by the Company, as may
be seen from his instructions of December 19, 1665.[56] This would,
in my opinion, be the course to follow during the south-west monsoon,
while during the north-east monsoon there is usually so much rain that
neither the salt river nor the water mills would be required, while
moreover during that time there is little danger of an attack.These
three plans being adopted, the banks of the moat could be protected by
a wall of coral stone to prevent the earth being washed away by the
water, as the present rocky bed of the moat is sufficiently strong
to serve as a foundation for it.The moat has already been dug to
its proper breadth, which is 10 roods.In my opinion there are two other defects in this Castle: the one
is as regards the embrazures, the other is in the new horse stable
and carpenters' yard, which are on the south side just outside the
opposite bank of the moat.I think these ought to be altered, for
the reasons stated in our letter to Colombo of November 30, 1695.I
was however opposed by the Constable-Major Toorse in his letter of
December 16 next, and his proposal was approved in Batavia by letter
of July 3 following.This work will therefore have to remain as it is,
although it appears that we did not explain ourselves sufficiently;
because Their Excellencies seem to think that this yard and stable
were within the knowledge of His Excellency van Mydregt.It is true
that the plan for them was submitted to His Excellency, as may be seen
from the point submitted by the late Mr.Blom on February 17, 1692,
and April 29, 1691, but no answer was ever received with regard to
this matter, on account of the death of His Excellency van Mydregt,
[57] and I have an idea that they were not at all according to his
wish.However, the yard and stable will have to remain, and with
regard to the embrazures the directions of the Constable-Major must
be followed.If it be recommended that the deepening of the moat is possible
without danger to the fort, and if the plan of the water mills and
banks be not approved, so that a dry moat would have to suffice,
I think the outer wall might be completed and the ground between
the rocks be sown with a certain kind of thorn called in Mallabaar
Oldeaalwelam and in Dutch Hane sporen (cock spurs), on account of
their resemblance to such spurs in shape and stiffness.This would
form a covering of natural caltrops, because these thorns are so sharp
that they will penetrate even the soles of shoes, which, besides,
all soldiers in this country do not wear.Another advantage in these
thorns is that they do not easily take fire and do not grow higher
than 2 or 2 1/2 feet above the ground, while the plants grow in quite
a tangled mass.I thought it might be of some use to mention this here.The present bridge of the fort is built of palmyra wood, as I found
on my arrival from Batavia; but as the stone pillars have already
been erected for the construction of a drawbridge, this work must be
completed as soon as the timber that I ordered from the Wanni for this
purpose arrives.In the carpenters' yard some timber will be found that
was prepared three years ago for the frame of this drawbridge, which,
perhaps, could yet be utilized if it has been well preserved.This
work will have to be hurried on, for the present bridge is dangerous
for anything heavy to pass over it, such as elephants, &c. It will
also be much better to have a drawbridge for the fortification.The
bridge must be built as broad as the space between the pillars and
the opposite catches will permit, and it must have a strong wooden
railing on either side, which may be preserved for many years by
the application of pitch and tar, while iron is soon wasted in this
country unless one always has a large quantity of paint and linseed
oil.Yet, an iron railing is more ornamental, so I leave this matter
to Your Honours.[51]

The fortress Hammenhiel is in good condition, but the sand bank
upon which it is built has been undermined by the last storm in the
beginning of December during the north-east monsoon.The damage must
be remedied with stones.In this fortress a reservoir paved with
Dutch bricks has been built to collect and preserve the rain water,
but it has been built so high that it reaches above the parapets
and may thus be easily ruined by an enemy, as I have pointed out in
my letter to Colombo of September 8, 1694.As this is a new work it
will have to remain as present, until such time as alterations can
be made.The ramparts of this fortress, which are hollow, have been
roofed with beams, over which a floor of stone and chunam has been
laid, with a view to the space below being utilized for the storing
of provisions and ammunition.This is a mistake, as the beams are
liable to decay and the floor has to support the weight of the canon,
so that there would be danger in turning the guns round for fear of
the floor breaking down.So far back as the time of Commandeur Blom
a beginning was made to replace this roof by an entire stone vault,
which is an important work.The gate of the fortress, which is still
covered with beams, must also be vaulted.[52]

Ponneryn and the passes Pyl, Elephant, and Buschutter only
require a stone water tank, but they must not be as high as that of
Hammenhiel.Dutch bricks were applied for from Jaffnapatam on February
17, 1692, and His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo
promised to send them here as soon as they should arrive from the
Fatherland, so that Your Honours must wait for these.Ponneryn is
not so much in want of a reservoir, as it has a well with fairly good
drink water.[53]

The work that demands the chief attention in Manaar is the deepening
of the moat, as the fortifications, dwelling houses, and stores are
completed.But since this work has to be chiefly carried out by the
Company's slaves, it will take some time to complete it.There are
also several elevations near the fort which will have to be reduced,
so that they may not at any time become a source of danger.During
my circuit on two or three occasions the Opperhoofd and the Council
at Manaar applied for lime to be sent from here, as no more coral
stone for the burning of lime was to be found there.This takes
away the Company's sloops from their usual employment, and the
officials have been informed that they must get the lime made
from the pearl shells which are found in abundance in the bay of
Condaatje as remains of the fishery.It makes very good lime, and
the forests in the neighbourhood provide the fuel, and the lime can
then be brought to Manaar in pontons and tonys.Information on this
subject may be found in the correspondence between this station and
Jaffnapatam.Care must be taken that the lime of the pearl shells
is used for nothing but the little work that has yet to be done in
the fort, such as the pavements for the canons and the floors of the
galleries in the dwelling houses.The Opperhoofd and other officers
who up to now have been living outside the fort must now move into
it, as there are many reasons why it is undesirable that they should
reside outside--a practice, besides, which is against the Company's
rules with regard to military stations in India.(54)

Provisions and ammunition of war are matters of foremost consideration
if we desire to have our minds at ease with regard to these stations,
for the one is necessary for the maintenance of the garrison and the
officials, while the other is the instrument of defence.These two
things ought at all times to be well provided.His late Excellency
van Mydregt for this reason very wisely ordered that every station
should be stocked with provisions for two years, as may be seen in
the letter sent from Negapatam bearing date March 17, 1688.This is
with regard to the Castle, but as regards the outstations it will be
sufficient if they are provided with rice for six or eight months.On
account of the great expense the Castle has not of late been provided
for two years, but this will soon be changed now that the passage to
Trincomalee and Batticaloa has been opened, even if the scarcity in
Coromandel should continue, or if the Theuver should still persist in
his prohibition of the importation of nely from Tondy.I have heard,
however, that this veto has been withdrawn, and that vessels with this
grain will soon arrive here.If this rumour be true and if a good
deal of rice is sent here from Cotjaar, Tammelegan, and Batticaloa,
a large quantity of it might be purchased on behalf of the Company
with authority of His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Colombo, which might be obtained by means of our sloops.Perhaps
also the people of Jaffnapatam who come here with their grain may be
prevailed upon to deliver it to the Company at 50 per cent.or so
less, as may be agreed upon.This they owe to their lawful lords,
since the Company has to spend so much in governing and protecting
them.Sanction to this measure was granted by His Excellency van
Mydregt in his letter from Negapatam to Jaffnapatam of June 12, 1688,
which may be looked up.If a calculation be made of the quantity of
provisions required for two years, I think it would be found that it
is no less than 300 lasts of rice a year.This includes provisions
for the garrison and those who would have to come into the fort in
case of a siege, so that 600 lasts would be required for two years,
a last being equal to 3,000 lb.or 75 Ceylon parras, thus in all
45,000 parras.At the rate of one parra per month for each person,
1,875 people could be maintained for two years with this store of
rice.This would be about the number of people the Company would
have to provide for in case of necessity, considering that there are
according to the latest regulations 600 Company's servants, while
there are according to the latest enumeration 1,212 women, children,
and slaves in the town, making a total of 1,812 persons who have to be
fed; so that the above calculation is fairly correct.Sometimes also
Manaar will have to be provided, because Mantotte does not yield a
sufficient quantity of nely to supply that fort for two years.This
must also be included in the calculation, and if Your Honours are
well provided in this manner you will be in a position to assist some
of the married soldiers, the orphanage, and the poor house with rice
from the Company's stores in times of scarcity, and will be able to
prevent the sale in rice being monopolized again.It was the intention
of His Excellency van Mydregt that at such times the Company's stores
should be opened and the rice sold below the bazaar price.Care must
be taken that this favour is not abused, because it has happened
that some of the Company's servants sent natives on their behalf,
who then sold the rice in small quantities at the market price.This
was mentioned in our letter to Colombo of October 1 and December 12,
1695.The Company can hardly have too much rice in store, for it can
always be disposed of with profit when necessary, and therefore I think
600 lasts need not be the limit, so long as there is a sufficient
number of vessels available to bring it.But as rice alone will not
suffice, other things, such as salt, pepper, bacon, meat, &c., must
also be considered.Salt may be obtained in sufficient quantities
in this Commandement, but pepper has to be obtained from Colombo,
and therefore this spice must never be sold or issued from the store
houses until the new supply arrives, keeping always 3,000 or 4,000
lb.Bacon and meat also have to be obtained from Colombo,
and His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo were kind
enough to send us on my verbal request ten kegs of each from Galle
last August by the ship "Nederland."But I find that it has become
stale already, and it must be changed for new as soon as possible,
with authority of His Excellency and the Council, in order that it may
not go further bad.In compliance with the orders of His Excellency
van Mydregt in his letter of November 23, 1687, the old meat and
bacon must be returned to Colombo, and a new supply sent here every
three or four years, the stale meat being supplied in Colombo to
some of the Company's vessels.But considering that His Excellency
the Governor and the Council of Colombo are not always in a position
to supply Jaffnapatam with a sufficient quantity of meat and bacon,
as there are so many other stations in Ceylon to be provided for,
it would be well to keep in mind the advice of the late Mr.Paviljoen
that in emergencies 1,000 or 1,200 cattle could be captured and kept
within the fort, where they could be made to graze on the large plain,
while as much straw from the nely would have to be collected as could
be got together to feed these animals as long as possible.This
small loss the inhabitants would have to bear, as the Company has to
protect them and their lands, and if we are victorious a recompense
could be made afterwards.I would also advise that as much carrawaat
[58] as could be found in the quarters of the Carreas, Palwelys,
[59] and other fishermen should be brought into the fort; because
this dried fish makes a very good and durable provision, except
for the smell.The provision of arrack must also not be forgotten,
because used moderately this drink does as much good to our people as
it does harm when taken in large quantities.As I have heard so many
complaints about the arrack here, as well as in Trincomalee, at the
pearl fishery, at Coromandel, &c., it is apparent that the Company is
not properly served in this respect.On this account also some arrack
was returned from Negapatam and the Bay of Condaatje.Henceforth
no arrack must be accepted which has not been tested by experts,
neither for storing in the warehouses nor for sending to the different
stations, because at present I cannot say whether it is adulterated by
the people who deliver it to the Company or by those who receive it
in the stores, or even by those who transport it in the sloops.With
regard to the munitions of war, I think nothing need be stated here,
but that there is a sufficient stock of it, because by the last stock
taking on August 31, 1696, it appears that there is a sufficient
store of canons, gun-carriages, gunpowder, round and long grenades,
instruments for storming, filled fire bombs, caseshot-bags, martavandes
for the keeping of gunpowder, and everything that pertains to the
artillery.The Arsenal is likewise sufficiently provided with guns,
muskets, bullets, native side muskets, &c. I would only recommend that
Your Honours would continue to have ramrods made for all the musket
barrels which are still lying there, suitable timber for which may be
found in the Wanni.It is from there also that the boards are obtained
for gun-carriages.And as I found that some had not been completed,
I think this work ought to be continued, so that they may be ready
when wanted.No doubt His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Colombo will be willing to send a sufficient quantity of pitch and
tar for the preservation both of the sloops and the gun-carriages,
which otherwise will soon decay during the heavy rains which we have
here in India.Although the Arsenal is at present well provided with
guns and muskets, it is possible that half of them may be found unfit
for use.I have therefore given orders to examine them all carefully,
so that those that are unfit may be sent to Colombo and from there to
the Fatherland, and new ones returned.Water and fuel are also two of
the most important things to think of for the defence of a fortress,
and I had therefore a large room built behind the smith's shop where
fuel could be stored away.This room must be stocked and closed, and
no fuel issued from it to any one.Those who receive firewood from
the Company may be supplied from that which is daily brought from the
forest.With regard to the water which is found within this Castle,
it is drinkable in cases of emergency, especially in some of the
wells found there.[55]

The military and garrison would be sufficiently strong if the full
number of Europeans allowed for this Commandement by the latest
Batavian regulation of December 29, 1692, could be obtained, which
could not be considered too strong for a Commandement numbering
608 men in all, including those for commercial, civil, judicial,
ecclesiastical, naval, and military services.At present we have only
the following number of persons in the Company's service, who have
to be classified, as they are of different colour and descent, viz.:--


                            Europeans.In the Castle              287         56        7       350
    In Manaar                   52          2        9        63
    In Hammenhiel               21          4        1        26
    In Ponneryn                  1          1       21        23
    In the redoubts the
    "Pyl," "Beschutter,"
    and "Elephant"              11          3       45        59
    For various services,
    also in the Island,
    for  surveying, wood
    felling, &c.13         10        2        25
                               ===        ===      ===       ===
                    Total      385         76       85       546


In the number of Europeans is included, as stated above, all manner
of Company's servants employed in the Trade, Church, Navigation,
Military Duties, &c., all of which together number 385 men.The 76
mestises and the 85 toepasses will therefore have to be retained until
this Commandement can have its full number of Europeans, and it would
be well if Your Honours would continue to engage a few more toepasses
when they offer themselves, because the Passes are hardly sufficiently
guarded; about which matter communication has been made in our letter
to Colombo of March 5, 1695.Your Honours must also keep in mind the
recommendation of His Excellency van Mydregt in his letter of March
27, 1688, wherein he suggests that a close watch should be kept on
the Wannias, as they are not to be trusted in a case of treason on
the part of the Sinhalese; and on this account the advanced guards
must be always well provided with ammunition and provisions, while
discipline and drill must be well attended to, so that as far as lies
in our power we may be prepared for emergencies.I have been rather prolix in treating of the fortifications and all
that pertains thereto, not so much because I am ignorant of the fact
that the Company's power in India depends more on her naval force
than on her fortresses, but because I consider that since the latter
are in our possession it is our duty to preserve them, as otherwise
the large amount expended on them at the beginning of the Government
in Ceylon would have been spent in vain.[56]

The public works are carried out here without expenditure to the
Company by the Oeliaars, because, as stated before, no cooly wages
are paid here, payment being made only to the native artisans, such
as smiths, carpenters, and masons.The number of men employed is
daily entered in a book by one of the Pennisten of the Comptoirs,
which he has to hand over in the evening to the person whose turn
it will be the next day to do this work.Care must be taken that
these assistants personally see and count the men, and the payments
must be made according to their list and not according to those of
the Dutch foremen or the native Cannecappuls.This is in compliance
with the orders from Batavia.The foremen of the carpenters' yard,
the smiths' shop, the gunpowder mill, and the masonry works must
also every evening, at sunset, bring in their reports with regard to
the progress of the work.This is to be done by the sergeant Hendrik
Rademaker, who, for some years, has been acting as overseer of the
Oeliaars.The Oeliaars are changed on Mondays and Thursdays, each
of them working only for three days at a time, which suffices for
three months, as they owe twelve days of service in the year.Those
who have performed their labour receive an ola from the Cannecappul,
which is called a Sito, and is marked with a steel stamp thus: I-VOC,
which serves them as a receipt.The names of those who fail to appear
are written down by the Cannecappul and by the Majoraal, and they
have to pay a fine which is called sicos.[60] The stamp is in the
custody of the Chief, who also arranges and divides the work among
the Oeliaars.He must see that the sergeant does not allow any of
the coolies to depart before the three days have expired, and making
a profit for himself and causing loss to the Company.Care must also
be taken that no more than 18 persons are employed as Pandarepulles
or native cooly drivers, who are each in charge of 16 to 30 men,
whom they have to keep to their work.These 18 Pandarepulles must be
appointed by written documents, otherwise the sergeant appoints such
officers on his own authority and thus also makes a profit.Then
also it must be seen that the materials, such as timber, bricks,
lime, &c., are not taken to other places than they have been ordered
for by the person in authority, for all these are tricks to which
the Company is subject on the part of the overseers when they see
that no regard is taken of their doings.The principal of the public
works at present in progress is the building of the church within the
fort, [61] which has advanced to 8 feet above the ground, and may be
completed during the southern season, if there is only a sufficient
quantity of bricks.According to my calculation about 1,000,000 more
will be required, which is a large quantity, but will not cost more
than 3 fannums per thousand, and even this expense does not fall to
the Company, but may be found out of the sicos or fines.The Dessave
has the best opportunity for seeing that the work at the brickworks
at Iroewale is pushed on as quickly as possible, so that there may
be no waiting for bricks or tiles, which are also baked there and
paid at the rate of 3 1/2 fannums a thousand.I consider it a shame
that in a country where the cost of building is so small, and where
religion is to be promoted, there should not even be a church in
the fort, a state of things that has existed these last four years,
during which the warehouses had to be used for this purpose, while
many old and infirm people could not attend the services because of
the inconvenience of the steps that lead to them.It would have been
better if the old Portuguese church had not been broken down before
the building of the new church was commenced, because an old proverb
says: "That one must not cast away old shoes till one has got new
ones."[62] However, for the present we must row with the oars we
possess, until the new church is completed, the plan for which is in
the hands of the surveyor Martinus Leusekam.The sergeant in the Wanni,
Harmen Claasz, had already on my orders felled the necessary beams,
and now the rafters must be thought of, which would be best made
of palmyra wood, if they could be obtained sufficiently long.The
timber for the pulpit I hope to send from Mallabaar, but as ebony is
also found in the Wanni, some trees might be felled also there and be
brought down here without expenditure to the Company.As may be seen
in the answers to the questions from Jaffnapatam of March 12, 1691,
and February 17, 1692, authority for the building of this church was
obtained long ago.The only other works required within the Castle
at present are the barracks for the married soldiers; which may be
found indicated in the map, and the rebuilding of the four dwelling
houses yet remaining of the Portuguese buildings which are old and
decayed.They are no longer worth repairing, and it would be best
if they were broken down and new and better houses built on their
site.But before this is done it will be necessary to rebuild the
Armoury, which fell into ruins last December.This building also
remained from the Portuguese.Some new tiles are also required for
the Company's building at Anecatte where the red-dyeing is done,
the cross-beams of which building I had renewed.Likewise a number
of tiles is required for the new warehouses in the island Leyden,
which have been built there in compliance with the orders of His
late Excellency van Mydregt.This was when it was intended to provide
Ceylon with grain from Tansjouwer, [63] which was to be laid up there
before the northern season.These warehouses may yet come in useful
if the Moorish trade flourishes.[57]

The horse stable within the fort has been built in a bad place,
and is very close and unhealthy; so that the animals die one after
another.It would therefore be better if the stable referred to
under the heading of "fortification" and situated outside the fort be
used.If this is done it must be provided with the necessary cribs,
&c., and not more than seven horses have been allowed by the last
regulation.The supervision of the stable has been entrusted for some
time to the Captain Jan van der Bruggen, but I could not approve of
this, and consider it better that this supervision be also left to
the chief person in authority, the more so as the said Captain has
been troubled for the last five years with gout and gravel; so that
he has often to remain at home for weeks, while, even when he is well,
it is impossible for him to go about much, in consequence of weakness
arising from the pain.For this reason he cannot properly supervise
the stable; and this is not the first time he is excused from his
duty, as it was done also during the time of Commandeur Cornelis van
der Duyn, who also considered that it was more in the interest of
the Company that this and other duties should be performed by the
chief instead of by private persons.The Dessave is best aware if
the hides of the stags and elks sent to this stable from the Wanny
and the Passes are properly utilized for saddles, carriages, &c.,
in the said stable, and also in the Arsenal for cartridge cases,
bandoleers, sword-belts, &c.[58]

The hospital was built too low, so that the patients had to lie in
damp places during the northern monsoon.I therefore had the floor
raised, in view of the fact that this is a place where the Company
shows its sympathy with its suffering servants and wishes them to have
every comfort.For this reason also regents are appointed to see that
nothing wrong is done by the doctor or the steward.For some time this
supervision was entrusted to Captain Jan van der Bruggen, but for the
reason stated above I cannot approve of the arrangement any longer,
while moreover, his daughter is the wife of the Chief Surgeon Hendrick
Warnar, who has a very large family, and suspicious people might try to
find fault with the arrangement.The supervision of the hospital must
therefore be entrusted every alternate month to the Administrateur
Biermans and the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, as it is against the
principles of the Company to entrust such work to one person only.[59]

The Company's slaves here are few in number, consisting of 82
individuals, including men, boys, women, and children.But no more are
required, as the Oeliaars perform many of the duties for which slaves
would be otherwise required.They are employed in the stable, the
warehouses, the arsenal, the hospital, and with the shipbuilders and
masons.The only pay they receive is 3 fannums and a parra of rice per
month, except some of the masons.This payment is sufficient for some
of them, but not for all, as there are some employed in masonry work
who do their work as well as any of the natives, and, as they have to
maintain a wife and children, the master mason has often recommended
higher pay for them.There is one among the masons who receives
6 fannums a month, another gets 4, and two others 3 fannums.This
might be raised from 6 to 10, from 4 to 8, and from 3 to 6 fannums
respectively, so that these poor people may not be discouraged; and on
the other hand increased pay often produces increased labour, and thus
the Company would perhaps not lose by the extra expense.The matter
must, however, be submitted to His Excellency the Governor, as also
the request of one of the masons that his daughter may be emancipated,
in order to marry a native who has proposed to her.The father offers
in her place as a slave another young and capable woman.There is also
another application for emancipation from a dyer who is now, he says,
60 years of age.The Company would lose nothing in granting this
request, because all he delivers is two or three pieces of ordinary
chintz a year.All these matters must be submitted to His Excellency
the Governor and the Council.[60]

Having now treated of the Wanny, of the lands of Ponneryn and Mantotte
within the Province of Jaffnapatam, and of the fort, we must see what
is to be said with regard to the seacoast, and also if any important
matter has been forgotten.Manaar is the last island on this side, and the banks and islets near
it form together what is called "Adam's Bridge," which closes the
passage between Ceylon and Coromandel.This island also protects
Jaffnapatam on the south, as no vessel could come here without
passing Manaar.The passage through the river is so inconvenient on
account of its shallowness that no vessel can pass without being first
unloaded.Therefore no vessel is able to pass nor any smuggling take
place without its being known in Manaar.It is on this account that
an order was issued by His Excellency the Governor and the Council
in their letter of March 5, 1695, to Jaffnapatam, to the effect that
no smuggled areca-nut from Colombo or Calpentyn must be allowed to
pass there.This was when the trade in these waters was re-opened
for private enterprise from Coromandel, and the order was conveyed
by us to Manaar by letter of March 11.A close watch must be kept,
but so long as the passage of Ramacoil or Lembe in the domain of the
Teuver is so well known by some people as it is said to be, it is
not likely that attempts at smuggling would be made in Manaar.[61]

Manaar not only protects Jaffnapatam, but it also yields to the
Company the profits of Mantotte, Moesely, and Setticoulang, and of
the capture of elephants.The latter might be more if not for the
death of the animals, as, for instance, last year, when not a single
animal delivered by the hunters survived.The hunters must therefore
be encouraged to bring as many as possible.[62]

About 50 or 60 bharen of dye-roots are also yearly obtained from
Manaar, which cultivation must also be attended to, in order that
the Company may be in a position to deliver the red cloths ordered
from this Commandement.[63]

Some revenue is also obtained from taxes and rents.These are yearly
sold to the highest bidder.Last year they were sold for 1 1/2 year,
like those in Jaffnapatam.2,268, as also
Rds.879.7.8 for poll tax and land rent in Manaar.The tithes of the
harvest in Mantotte are paid in grain, which is usually issued to the
Company's servants.This amounted on the last occasion to 1,562 1/2
paras of rice.The tax in cooking butter in Mantotte is also paid
in kind and likewise issued to the Company's servants.Besides,
there are 3,000 or 4,000 paras of salt and 10,000 or 12,000 coils
of straw or bark lunt which the inhabitants of the opposite lands
have to deliver, as also chanks from the divers; but these do not
amount to much, for, in 1695, were dived five kinds of cauries to
the amount of 204 5/8 paras, and in 1696 only 94 7/8 paras; so that
the amount for two years was only 299 1/2 paras of cauries.For this
reason I submitted on May 10, 1695, to His Excellency the Governor
and the Council, a proposal from the Moor Perietamby, who offered to
pay the Company yearly Rds.8,000 for the license to dive for chanks
between Manaar and Calpentyn.This was refused by the reply received
from Colombo on the 17th of the same month.[64]

From the Instructions to Commandeur Blom sent from Colombo on February
17, 1692, it may be seen what prices are paid to the divers for the
chanks, mentioned already under the subject of the Moorish trade,
so that it is not necessary to enter into detail on the subject here.I think that I have now sufficiently explained all matters relating to
this station, and would refer for further information to the report
compiled by Mr.Blom for Governor van Mydregt, which is kept here at
the Secretariate, [64] as also the answers thereto of September 13 and
October 7, 1690.Jorephaas
Vosch for the Opperkoopman Jan de Vogel, bearing date August 30, 1666,
[65] which may also be read, but I think that I have mentioned all
the most important matters with regard to Manaar appearing therein.The pearl fishery is an extraordinary enterprise, the success of
which depends on various circumstances; as there are various causes
by which the banks or the oysters may be destroyed.It would take too
long to mention here all that may be said on the subject, and as it
would be tiresome to read it all, I will merely state here that the
usual place for the fishery is near Aripo in the Bay of Condaatje,
where the banks lie, and if no untoward events take place, a fishery
may be held for several years in succession; because the whole bay
is covered with different banks, the oysters of which will become
successively matured.But sometimes they are washed away and completely
destroyed within a very short time.The banks are to be inspected in
November by a Commission sent for this purpose, who come in tonys from
Jaffnapatam, Manaar, and Madura, and with them also some Patangatyns
and other native chiefs who understand this work.The chief points to
be considered when a pearl fishery has been authorized are the lodgings
for the Commissioners appointed in Colombo; the inclosure of the tanks
in Mantotte with banks for obtaining good drinking water; the supply
of poultry, butter, oil, rice, sheep, cattle, &c., for provisions;
Lascoreens and servants; military men, if they can be spared from
the garrison, &c. The fishery usually takes place in the months of
March, April, and May.I will not enter into detail on this matter,
as it would not be in agreement with the nature of these instructions;
while the Commissioners will be able to find ample information in the
various documents of the years 1666 and 1667, but especially in those
of 1694, 1695, and 1696, including reports, journals, and letters, in
case they have not gained sufficient experience yet.These documents
relate to the fishery, the collection of the Company's duties, the
purchase and valuation of pearls, &c. I will therefore only state
here the successive profits derived from the pearl fishery by the
Company, viz.:--


                   Rds.1666       19,655    91/980       58,965.11.6
        1667       24,641   461/968       73,924.8.13
        1694       21,019    19/60        63,057.13.0
        1695       24,708    11/12        74,126.15.0
        1696       25,327    43/60        75,983.0
                  =======   =======      =============
           Total  115,352   499/960      346,057.11.3 [66]


This is a considerable amount, and it is expected, according to the
reports of the Commissioners, that the fishery now authorized for
December 31, 1697, will yield still greater profits.I have already
given orders for the repair of the banks of the tanks in Mantotte,
which were damaged during the last storm, in order that there may
be no want of drinking water, which is one of the most important
points.Whether the prohibition to export coconuts from this Province
applies also to the pearl fishery is a matter to be submitted to
His Excellency the Governor and the Council; because many people use
this fruit as food.This subject has been already dealt with under
the head of Coconuts.[65]

The inhabited little islands are considered as the fifth Province
of the Commandement, the others being Walligammo, Waddemoraatsche,
Timmeraatsche, and Patchelepalle.Taxes, &c., are levied in these
islands in the same way as in the other Provinces, the revenue
amounting last time to Rds.2,767.2.5 1/2, viz.:--


                                              Rds.Land rent                                1,190.11.3

                                             ==============
                               Total         2,767.2.5 1/2 [67]


The islands are named as follows:--

Carredive, called by us Amsterdam; Tamiedive, Leyden; Pongedive,
Middleburg; Nerendive, Delft; Neynadive, Haarlem; Aneledive, Rotterdam;
Remedive, "de Twee Gebroeders," or Hoorn and Enkhuisen.Besides the revenue stated above, Carredive yields the best dye-roots
in this Commandement, although the quantity is no more than 10 or
12 bharen a year.The dye-roots from Delft are just as good, but it
yields only 4 or 5 bharen a year.Salt, lime, and coral stone are
also obtained from these islands, but particulars with regard to these
matters have been stated at length in the report by the late Commandeur
Blom to His late Excellency van Mydregt, to which I would refer.[66]

Horse-breeding is an enterprise of which much was expected, but so far
the Company has not made much profit by it.Yet there is no reason
to despair, and better results may be hoped for.Your Honours must
remember that formerly in the islands Delft, Hoorn, and Enkhuizen all
kinds of horses were bred together; so that but few good animals were
obtained.In 1690 and 1691 orders were given to shoot all horses that
were too small or defective, and to capture the rest and send them to
Colombo and Coromandel.The latter were sold at Negapatam by public
auction, while the rest were given to soldiers on the opposite coast
in the Company's service, who used the animals so badly that they were
soon unfit for work.In this way the islands have become destitute
of horses, and the only thing to be done was to send there some good
mares and two or three Persian stallions for breeding purposes.So
far no good horses could be obtained, because a foal has to be 4 or
3 1/2 years old before it is fit for use.It is only since 1692,
1693, and 1694 that we had good stallions, and this accounts for
the fact that no foals have yet been obtained.8,982.9, so that it would seem as if expenditure and
trouble are the only results to be expected from this enterprise;
but it must be remembered that at present there are on the island of
Delft alone about 400 or 500 foals of 1, 1 1/2, 2, and 2 1/2 years
old, while there are also a number of horses on the island "de Twee
Gebroeders."The expenditure was incurred mostly in the purchase of the
Persian stallions, and this expenditure has not been in vain, because
we possess now more than 400 horses, each of which will be worth about
a hundred guilders, so that the whole number will be worth about 40,000
guilders.In compliance with the orders by His Excellency van Mydregt
of November 29, 1690, these animals must be sold at Coromandel on
account of this Commandement, and the valuation of the horses may be
determined from the fact that the Prince of Tansjour has accepted one
or two of them in lieu of the recognition which the Company owes him
yearly for two Arabian horses.For this reason and in compliance with
the said orders the first horses captured must be sent to Negapatam,
so that the account in respect of horse-breeding may be balanced.As
the stallions kept on the islands have become too old, application
has been made for younger animals, and also for five or six mares
from Java, which have been granted by His Excellency the Governor
and the Council in their letter of April 29, 1695.Your Honours are
further advised not to sell any horses from the island of Delft for
less than Rds.25 and from the islands "de Twee Gebroeders" for less
than Rds.35 to the Company's servants, as they fetch more than that
at the public auctions in Negapatam.Even this is a favour to them;
but I noticed that the horses from Delft have been sold at 15 and
those from Hoorn and Enkhuisen at Rds.20, which I think cannot be
done in future, since the destruction of the defective animals has
improved the race.I hope that this will clear up the passage with
regard to the horse-breeding in the letter from Batavia to Ceylon of
July 3, 1696, as also that Their Excellencies may be satisfied with
the result.I think expectations were raised too high at first; as
the real advantage could only be known in course of time; while, on
the other hand, the capital expended must be looked upon as standing
out on interest.[67]

The Passes of this Commandement are various, but all are guarded in
such a way that no goods can be brought in or taken out without a
license, nor are people able to go through without a passport.At
Kayts and Point Pedro passports are issued in the usual way to
those who come or go by sea; while to those who travel by land an
Acte of Permission is issued, which is written in Mallabaar on ola,
and is called Cayoppe.These are issued both by the Dessave and by
the Commandeur, but as so many thousands of people come and go, and
the signing of these Cayoppes occupies so much of the time of the
Commandeurs, a steel stamp is used now by the Dessave to mark these
also.I have followed the same practice, and used a seal with the
letters H. Z., [68] which I handed over shortly before my departure for
Colombo in February, 1696, to the Political Council, together with the
seal for the oely service, with instructions that these seals were to
be used just as if I were still on the spot, because the Dessave was
absent at the pearl fishery, and I was commissioned by the Supreme
Government of India to proceed to Mallabaar without being formally
relieved of my office in this Commandement.On my return from Colombo
in August I found that this order had not been carried out, but that
the Captain Jan van der Bruggen had thought it well to have another
seal specially made, with the monogram VOC, not only suppressing my
order given to him in full Council, but also having a new seal made,
which was beyond his authority and seemed to me quite out of place.I
cannot account for his extraordinary conduct in any other way than by
supposing that he desired to confirm the rumour which had been spread
among the natives and Europeans during the time of the Commissioners
Messrs.Jan van Keulen and Pieter Petitfilz, that I would never return
to this Commandement to rule, and thus by suppressing my seal to give
public confirmation to this rumour, and so make it appear to the world
that it was no longer legal.I therefore order again that this seal is
not to be suppressed, but used for the stamping of the Cayoppes at the
Passes in case the Dessave should be absent from this Commandement,
it being his province alone to issue and sign such olas.This order
is to be carried out as long as no contrary orders are received from
higher authorities.Colomboture and Catsay are two Passes on the inner boundary of this
Commandement at the river leading to Ponneryn and the Wanny, and
in order to prevent any one passing without a passport a guard is
stationed there.The duties on goods are also collected there, being
leased out, but they do not amount to much.These Passes, however,
must be properly guarded, and care taken that the people stationed
there submit their reports regularly.One of these may be found in
a letter from here to Colombo of December 12 last.Ponneryn, a good redoubt, serves as a place from where to watch the
doings of the Wannias and to protect the inhabitants from invasions.It
is garrisoned by Toepasses under the command of a Dutch Sergeant.The Passes Pyl, Elephant, and Beschutter serve chiefly to close this
Province against the Wannias and to protect the inhabitants from
invasions of the Sinhalese, and also to prevent persons passing in
or out without a passport, or goods being taken in or out without a
license, as also to prevent the theft of slaves and the incursions of
elephants and other wild animals into the Provinces.A difficulty is
that the earth mounds are not close together, so that notwithstanding
the continual patrol of the militia, now and again a person passes
through unnoticed.Means of drawing these redoubts together, or at
least of making a trench to prevent persons or goods from passing
without a license, have often been considered.Some have proposed
a hedge of palmyra trees, others a fence of thorns, others a moat,
others again a wall, because at this point the Commandement measures
only two miles in breadth.But none of these proposals have been
adopted all these years, as stated in our letter of August 24, 1695,
to Batavia.Their Excellencies replied in their letter of July 3,
1696, that this is a good work, but as it is entirely to the advantage
of the inhabitants it must be carried out without expense to the
Company.This, in my humble opinion, is quite fair, and the Dessave,
whom this matter principally concerns, will have to consider in what
way such a trench as proposed could be made.The yearly Compendium
will give much information on this subject, and will show what defects
and obstacles have been met with.It has been stated already how the
Passes are garrisoned, and they are commanded by an Ensign according
to the regulations.Point Pedro, on the outer boundary of this Commandement, has resident
only one Corporal and four Lascoreens, who are chiefly employed in
the sending and receiving of letters to and from Coromandel and
Trincomalee, in the loading of palmyra wood and other goods sent
from there to the said two places, and in the search of departing
and arriving private vessels, and the receipt of passports.These men
also supervise the Oeliaars who have to work at the church which was
commenced during the time of Commandeur Blom, and also those who have
to burn lime or break coral stone from the old Portuguese fortress.The fortress Kayts or Hammenhiel serves on the north, like Manaar
in the south, to guard the passage by water to this Castle, and
also serves the same purposes as Point Pedro, viz., the searching of
private vessels, &c. Next to this fort is the island Leyden, where is
stationed at present the Assistant Jacob Verhagen, who performs the
same duties as the Corporal at Point Pedro, which may be found stated
more in detail in the Instructions of January 4, 1696, compiled and
issued by me for the said Assistant.The Ensign at the Passes received
his instructions from Commandeur Blom, all of which must be followed.As the Dessave is Commander over the military scattered in the
country, and therefore also over those stationed at the said Passes
and stations, it will chiefly be his duty to see that they are
properly guarded so far as the small garrison here will permit,
and also that they are provided with sufficient ammunition and
provisions.The latter consist mostly of grain, oil, pepper, and
arrack.This is mostly meant for Hammenhiel, as the other places can
always be provided from the land side, but rice and ammunition must be
always kept in store.Hammenhiel must be specially garrisoned during
the southern monsoon, and be manned as much as possible by Dutchmen,
who, if possible, must be transferred every three months, because many
of these places are very unhealthy and others exceedingly lonesome,
for which reasons it is not good to keep the people very long in one
place.The chief officers are transferred every six months, which also
must not be neglected, as it is a good rule in more than one respect.Aripo, Elipoecarrewe, and Palmeraincattoe were formerly fortresses
garrisoned like the others, but since the revolution of the Sinhalese
and the Wannias of 1675, under the Dessave Tinnekon, these have
become unnecessary and are only guarded now by Lascoreens, who are
mostly kept on for the transport of letters between Colombo, Manaar,
and Jaffnapatam.[68]

Water tanks are here very necessary, because the country has no fresh
water rivers, and the water for the cultivation of lands is that which
is collected during the rainfall.Some wealthy and influential natives
contrived to take possession of the tanks during the time the Company
sold lands, with a view of thus having power over their neighbours
and of forcing them to deliver up to them a large proportion of their
harvests.They had to do this if they wished to obtain water for
the cultivation of their fields, and were compelled thus to buy at
high price that which comes as a blessing from the Lord to all men,
plants, and animals in general.His Excellency Laurens Pyl, then
Governor of Ceylon, issued an order in June, 1687, on his visit to
this Commandement, that for these reasons no tanks should be private
property, but should be left for common use, the owners being paid
by those who require to water their fields as much as they could
prove to have spent on these tanks.I found that this good order
has not been carried out, because the family of Sangere Pulle alone
possesses at present three such tanks, one of which is the property
of Moddely Tamby.Before my departure to Colombo I had ordered that
it should be given over to the surrounding landowners, who at once
offered to pay the required amount, but I heard on my return that
the conveyance had not been made yet by that unbearably proud and
obstinate Bellale caste, they being encouraged by the way their patron
Moddely Tamby had been favoured in Colombo, and the Commandeur is
not even recognized and his orders are passed by.Your Honours must
therefore see that my instructions with regard to these tanks are
carried out, and that they are paid for by those interested, or that
they are otherwise confiscated, in compliance with the Instructions
of 1687 mentioned above, which Instructions may be found among the
papers in the Mallabaar language kept by the schoolmasters of the
parishes.Considering that many of the Instructions are preserved in
the native language only, they ought to be collected and translated
into our Dutch language.[69]

The public roads must be maintained at a certain breadth, and the
natives are obliged to keep them in order.But their meanness and
impudence is so great that they have gradually, year by year, extended
the fences along their lands on to these roads, thus encroaching
upon the high road.They see more and more that land is valuable on
account of the harvests, and therefore do not leave a foot of ground
uncultivated when the time of the rainy season is near.This is quite
different from formerly; so much so, that the lands are worth not
only thrice but about four or five times as much as formerly.This
may be seen when the lands are sold by public auction, and it may
be also considered whether the people of Jaffnapatam are really so
badly off as to find it necessary to agitate for an abatement of the
tithes.The Dessave must therefore see that these roads are extended
again to their original breadth and condition, punishing those who
may have encroached on the roads.[70]

The Company's elephant stalls have been allowed to fall into decay
like the churches, and they must be repaired as soon as possible,
which is also a matter within the province of the Dessave.[71]

Great expectations were cherished by some with regard to the thornback
skins, Amber de gris, Besoar stones, Carret, and tusks from the
elephants that died in the Company's stalls, but experience did
not justify these hopes.As these points have been dealt with in the
Compendium of November 26, 1693, by Commandeur Blom, I would here refer
to that document.I cannot add anything to what is stated there.[72]

The General Paresse is a ceremony which the Mudaliyars, Collectors,
Majoraals, Aratchchies, &c., have to perform twice a year on behalf
of the whole community, appearing together before the Commandeur in
the fort.This is an obligation to which they have been subject from
heathen times, partly to show their submission, partly to report on
the condition of the country, and partly to give them an opportunity
to make any request for the general welfare.As this Paresse tends
to the interest of the Company as Sovereign Power on the one hand
and to that of the inhabitants on the other hand, the custom must be
kept up.When the Commandeur is absent at the time of this Paresse
Your Honours could meet together and receive the chiefs.It is held
once during the northern and once during the southern monsoon, without
being bound to any special day, as circumstances may require it to be
held earlier or later.During my absence the day is to be fixed by the
Dessave, as land regent.Any proposal made by the native chiefs must
be carefully written down by the Secretary, so that it may be possible
to send a report of it to His Excellency the Governor and the Council
if it should be of importance.All transactions must be carefully
noted down and inserted in the journal, so that it may be referred to
whenever necessary.The practice introduced by the Onderkoopman William
de Ridder in Manaar of requiring the Pattangatyns from the opposite
coast to attend not twice but twelve times a year or once a month is
unreasonable, and the people have rightly complained thereof.De Ridder also appointed
a second Cannekappul, which seems quite unnecessary, considering the
small amount of work to be done there for the natives.Jeronimo could
be discharged and Gonsalvo retained, the latter having been specially
sent from Calpentyn by His Excellency Governor Thomas van Rhee and
being the senior in the service.Of how little consequence the work
at Manaar was considered by His Excellency Governor van Mydregt may
be seen from the fact that His Excellency ordered that no Opperhoofd
should be stationed there nor any accounts kept, but that the fort
should be commanded by an Ensign as chief of the military.A second
Cannekappul is therefore superfluous, and the Company could be saved
the extra expense.[73]

I could make reference to a large number of other matters, but it
would be tedious to read and remember them all.I will therefore now
leave in Your Honours' care the government of a Commandement from which
much profit may be derived for the Company, and where the inhabitants,
though deceitful, cunning, and difficult to rule, yet obey through
fear; as they are cowardly, and will do what is right more from fear of
punishment than from love of righteousness.I hope that Your Honours
may have a more peaceful time than I had, for you are well aware
how many difficulties, persecutions, and public slights I have had to
contend with, and how difficult my government was through these causes,
and through continual indisposition, especially of late.However,
Jaffnapatam has been blessed by God during that period, as may be seen
from what has been stated in this Memoir.I hope that Your Honours'
dilligence and experience may supplement the defects in this Memoir,
and, above all, that you will try to live and work together in harmony,
for in that way the Company will be served best.There are people who
will purposely cause dissension among the members of the Council,
with a view to further their own ends or that of some other party,
much to the injury of the person who permits them to do so.[74]

The Political Council consists at present of the following members:--


Ryklof de Bitter, Dessave, Opperkoopman.Abraham M. Biermans, Administrateur.Pieter Boscho, Onderkoopman, Store- and Thombo-keeper.Johannes van Groenevelde, Fiscaal.Pieter Bout, Cashier and Secretary.With a view to enable His Excellency the Governor and the Council to
alter or amplify this Memoir in compliance with the orders from Their
Excellencies at Batavia, cited at the commencement of this document,
I have purposely written on half of the pages only, so that final
instructions might be added, as mine are only provisional.In case
Your Honours should require any of the documents cited which are
not kept here at the Secretariate, they may be applied for from His
Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo.Wishing Your
Honours God's blessing, and all prosperity in the administration of
this extensive Commandement,


I remain, Sirs,
Yours faithfully,
H. ZWAARDECROON.Jaffnapatam, January 1, 1697.A.--The above Instructions were ready for Your Honours when, on
January 31 last, the yacht "Bekenstyn" brought a letter from Colombo
dated January 18, in which we were informed of the arrival of our new
Governor, His Excellency Gerrit de Heere.By the same vessel an extract
was sent from a letter of the Supreme Government of India of October
19 last, in which my transfer to Mallabaar has been ordered.But,
much as I had wished to serve the Company on that coast, I could
not at once obey the order owing to a serious illness accompanied
by a fit, with which it pleased the Lord to afflict me on January
18.Although not yet quite recovered, I have preferred to undertake
the voyage to Mallabaar without putting it off for another six months,
trusting that God will help me duly to serve my superiors, although
the latter course seemed more advisable on account of my state of
health.As some matters have occurred and some questions have arisen
since the writing of my Memoir, I have to add here a few explanations.B.--Together with the above-mentioned letter from Colombo, of January
18, we also received a document signed by both Their Excellencies
Governors Thomas van Rhee and Gerrit de Heere, by which all trade
in Ceylon except that of cinnamon is made open and free to every
one.Since no extract from the letter from Batavia with regard to this
matter was enclosed, I have been in doubt as to how far the permission
spoken of in that document was to be extended.As I am setting down
here my doubt on this point, His Excellency the Governor and the
Council of Colombo will, I have no doubt, give further information
upon it.I suppose that the trade in elephants is excepted as well
as that in cinnamon, and that it is still prohibited to capture,
transport, or sell these animals otherwise than on behalf of the
Company, either directly or indirectly, as has been the usage so far.C.--I suppose there will be no necessity now to obtain the areca-nuts
as ordered in the Instructions from Colombo of March 23, 1695, but
that these nuts are included among the articles open to free trade,
so that they may be now brought from Jaffnapatam through the Wanni to
Tondy, Madura, and Coromandel, as well as to other places in Ceylon,
provided the payment of the usual Customs duty of the Alphandigo,
[69] which is 7 1/2 per cent.for export, and that it may also be
freely transported through the Passes on the borders of the Wanni, and
that no Customs duty is to be paid except when it is sent by sea.I
understand that the same will be the rule for cotton, pepper, &c.,
brought from the Wanni to be sent by sea.This will greatly increase
the Alphandigo, so that the conditions for the farming of these must
be altered for the future accordingly.If the Customs duty were also
charged at the Passes, the farming out of these would still increase,
but I do not think that it would benefit the Company very much, because
there are many opportunities for smuggling beyond these three Passes,
and the expenditure of keeping guards would be far too great.The
duty being recovered as Alphandigo, there is no chance of smuggling,
as the vessels have to be provided with proper passports.All vessels
from Jaffnapatam are inspected at the Waterfort, Hammenhiel and at
the redoubt Point Pedro.D.--In my opinion the concession of free trade will necessitate the
remission of the duty on the Jaffnapatam native and foreign cloths,
because otherwise Jaffnapatam would be too heavily taxed compared
with other places, as the duty is 20 and 25 per cent.I think both
the cloths made here and those imported from outside ought to be
taxed through the Alphandigo of 7 1/2 per cent.This would still more
increase the duty, and this must be borne in mind when these revenues
are farmed out next December, if His Excellency the Governor and the
Council approve of my advice.is far too
high, and it must be remembered that this was a duty imposed with a
view to prevent the weaving of cloths and to secure the monopoly of
the trade to the Company, and not in order to make a revenue out of
it.This project did not prove a success; but I will not enter into
details about it, as these may be found in the questions submitted
by me to the Council of Ceylon on January 22, 1695, and I have also
mentioned them in this Memoir under the heading of Rents.E.--It seems to me that henceforth the people of Jaffnapatam would,
as a result of this free trade, be no longer bound to deliver to the
Company the usual 24 casks of coconut oil yearly before they are
allowed to export their nuts.This rule was laid down in a letter
from Colombo of October 13, 1696, with a view to prevent Ceylon being
obliged to obtain coconut oil from outside.This duty was imposed
upon Jaffnapatam, because the trees in Galle and Matura had become
unfruitful from the Company's elephants having to be fed with the
leaves.The same explanation was not urged with regard to Negombo,
which is so much nearer to Colombo than Galle, Matura, or Jaffnapatam,
and it is a well-known fact that many of the ships from Jaffnapatam
and other places are sent with coconuts from Negombo to Coromandel
or Tondel, while the nuts from the lands of the owners there are held
back.I expect therefore that the new Governor His Excellency Gerrit
de Heere and the Council of Colombo will give us further instructions
with regard to this matter.More details may be found in this Memoir
under the heading of Coconut Trees.F.--A letter was received from Colombo, bearing date March 4 last,
in which was enclosed a form of a passport which appears to have been
introduced there after the opening of the free trade, with orders to
introduce the same here.This has been done already during my presence
here and must be continued.G.--In the letter of the 9th instant we received various and important
instructions which must be carried out.An answer to this letter was
sent by us on the 22nd of the same month.One of these instructions is
to the effect that a new road should be cut for the elephants which are
to be sent from Colombo.Another requires the compilation of various
lists, one of which is to be a list of all lands belonging to the
Company or given away on behalf of it, with a statement showing by
whom, to whom, when, and why they were granted.I do not think this
order refers to Jaffnapatam, because all fields were sold during the
time of Commandeur Vosch and others.Only a few small pieces of land
were discovered during the compilation of the new Land Thombo, which
some of the natives had been cultivating.A few wild palmyra trees
have been found in the Province of Patchelepalle, but these and the
lands have been entered in the new Thombo.We cannot therefore very
well furnish such a list of lands as regards Jaffnapatam, because
the Company does not possess any, but if desired a copy of the new
Land Thombo (which will consist of several reams of imperial paper)
could be sent.I do not, however, think this is meant, since there is
not a single piece of land in Jaffnapatam for which no taxes are paid,
and it is for the purpose of finding this out that the new Thombo is
being compiled.H.--The account between the Moorish elephant purchasers and the
Company through the Brahmin Timmerza as its agent, about which so
much has been written, was settled on August 31 last, and so also
was the account of the said Timmerza himself and the Company.A
difficulty arises now as to how the business with these people is
to be transacted; because three of the principal merchants from
Galconda arrived here the other day with three cheques to the amount
of 7,145 Pagodas in the name of the said Timmerza.According to the
orders by His Excellency Thomas van Rhee the latter is no longer to
be employed as the Company's agent, so there is some irregularity
in the issue of these cheques and this order, in which it is stated
that the cheques must bear the names of the purchasers themselves,
while on the other hand the purchasers made a special request that
the amount due to them might be paid to their attorneys in cash or
elephants through the said Timmerza.However this may be, I do not
wish to enter into details, as these matters, like many others, had
been arranged by His Excellency the Governor and the Council without
my knowledge or advice.Your Honours must await an answer from His
Excellency the Governor Gerrit de Heere and the Council of Colombo,
and follow the instructions they will send with regard to the said
cheques; and the same course may be followed as regards the cheques
of two other merchants who may arrive here just about the time of my
departure.I cannot specify the amount here, as I did not see these
people for want of time.The merchants of Golconda have also requested
that, as they have no broker to deal with, they may be allowed an
advance by the Company in case they run short of cash, which request
has been communicated in our letter to Colombo of the 4th instant.I.--As we had only provision of rice for this Commandement for
about nine months, application has been made to Negapatam for 20,000
paras of rice, but a vessel has since arrived at Kayts from Bengal,
belonging to the Nabob of Kateck, by name Kaimgaarehen, and loaded as
I am informed with very good rice.If this be so, the grain might be
purchased on behalf of the Company, and in that case the order for
nely from Negapatam could be countermanded.It must be remembered,
however, that the rice from Bengal cannot be stored away, but must
be consumed as soon as possible, which is not the case with that of
Negapatam.The people from Bengal must be well treated and assisted
wherever possible without prejudice to the Company; so that they
may be encouraged to come here more often and thus help us to make
provision for the need of grain, which is always a matter of great
concern here.I have already treated of the Moorish trade and also
of the trade in grain between Trincomalee and Batticaloa, and will
only add here that since the arrival of the said vessel the price
has been reduced from 6 to 5 and 4 fannums the para.K.--On my return from Colombo last year the bargemen of the Company's
pontons submitted a petition in which they complained that they had
been obliged to make good the value of all the rice that had been lost
above 1 per cent.from the cargoes that had been transported from
Kayts to the Company's stores.They complained that the measuring
had not been done fairly, and that a great deal had been blown away
by the strong south-west winds; also that there had been much dust in
the nely, and that besides this it was impossible for them to prevent
the native crew who had been assigned to them from stealing the grain
both by day and night, especially since rice had become so expensive
on account of the scarcity.I appointed a Committee to investigate
this matter, but as it has been postponed through my illness, Your
Honours must now take the matter in hand and have it decided by
the Council.In future such matters must always be brought before
the Council, as no one has the right to condemn others on his own
authority.The excuse of the said bargemen does not seem to carry
much weight, but they are people who have served the Company for 30
or 40 years and have never been known to commit fraud.It must also
be made a practice in future that these people are held responsible
for their cargo only till they reach the harbour where it is unloaded,
as they can only guard it on board of their vessels.L.--I have spoken before of the suspicion I had with regard to the
changing of golden Pagodas, and with a view to have more security in
future I have ordered the cashier Bout to accept no Pagodas except
directly from the Accountant at Negapatam, who is responsible for the
value of the Pagodas.He must send them to the cashier in packets of
100 at a time, which must be sealed.M.--The administration of the entire Commandement having been left by
me to the Opperkoopman and Dessave Mr.Ryklof de Bitter and the other
members of the Council, this does not agree with the orders from the
Supreme Government of India contained in their letter of October 19
last year, but since the Dessave de Bitter has since been appointed as
the chief of the Committee for the pearl fishery and has left already,
it will be for His Excellency the Governor and the Council to decide
whether the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz is to be entrusted with the
administration, as was done last year.Wishing Your Honours for the second time God's blessing,


I remain,
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) H. ZWAARDECROON.On board the yacht "Bekenstyn," in the harbour of
Manaar, March 29, 1697.SHORT NOTES by Gerrit de Heere, Governor of the Island of Ceylon,
    on the chief points raised in these Instructions of Commandeur
    Hendrick Zwaardecroon, for the guidance of the Opperkoopman
    Mr.Ryklof de Bitter, Second in authority and Dessave of the
    Commandement, and the other members of the Political Council of
    Jaffnapatam.Where the notes contradict the Instructions the orders
    conveyed by the former are to be followed.In other respects the
    Instructions must be observed, as approved by Their Excellencies
    the Governor-General and the Council of India.The form of Government, as approved at the time mentioned here, must
be also observed with regard to the Dessave and Secunde, Mr.Ryklof
de Bitter, as has been confirmed by the Honourable the Government of
Batavia in their special letter of October 19 last.What is stated here is reasonable and in compliance with the
Instructions, but with regard to the recommendation to send to
Mr.Zwaardecroon by Manaar and Tutucorin advices and communications
of all that transpires in this Commandement, I think it would be
sufficient, as Your Honours have also to give an account to us, and
this would involve too much writing, to communicate occasionally
and in general terms what is going on, and to send him a copy of
the Compendium which is yearly compiled for His Excellency the
Governor.de Bitter and the other members of
Council to do.The Wanni, the largest territory here, has been divided by the
Company into several Provinces, which have been given in usufruct to
some Majoraals, who bear the title of Wannias, on the condition that
they should yearly deliver to the Company 42 1/2 alias (elephants).The
distribution of these tributes is as follows:--


                                                        Alias.Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarenne,

                                                                 ======

The accumulated arrears from the years 1680 to 1694, of which they
were discharged, amounted to 333 1/2 elephants.From that time up to
the present day the arrears have again accumulated to 86 3/4 alias,
namely:--


                                                   Alias.Don Philip Nellamapane                        57 1/2

        Chedoega Welemapane                            1 1/2
                                                      ======
                     Total                            86 3/4


The result proves that all the honour and favours shown to these people
do not induce them to pay up their tribute; but on the contrary,
as has been shown in the annexed Memoir, they allow them to go on
increasing.This is the reason I would not suffer the indignity of
requesting payment from them, but told them seriously that this would
be superfluous in the case of men of their eminence; which they,
however, entirely ignored.I then exhorted them in the most serious
terms to pay up their dues, saying that I would personally come within
a year to see whether they had done so.As this was also disregarded,
I dismissed them.Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarenne,
who owed 57 1/2 alias, made the excuse that these arrears were caused
by the bad terms on which they were with each other, and asked that
I would dissociate them, so that each could pay his own tribute.I
agreed that they should arrange with the Dessave about the different
lands, writing down on ola the arrangements made, and submitting them
to me for approval; but as I have heard no more about the matter up
to the present day, I fear that they only raised these difficulties
to make believe that they were unable to pay, and to try to get the
Company again to discharge them from the delivery of their tribute
of 21 elephants for next year.It would perhaps be better to do this
than to be continually fooled by these people.But you have all
seen how tremblingly they appeared before me (no doubt owing to a
bad conscience), and how they followed the palanquin of the Dessave
like boys, all in order to obtain more favourable conditions; but I
see no reason why they should not pay, and think they must be urged
to do so.They have promised however to pay up their arrears as soon
as possible, so that we will have to wait and see; while Don Diogo
Poevenelle Mapane also has to deliver his 23 alias.In compliance with
the orders from Colombo of May 11, 1696, Don Philip Nellamapane will be
allowed to sell one elephant yearly to the Moors, on the understanding
that he had delivered his tribute, and not otherwise; while the sale
must be in agreement with the orders of Their Excellencies at Batavia,
contained in their letter of November 13, 1683.The other Provinces,
Carnamelpattoe, Tinnemerwaddoe, and Moeliawalle are doing fairly well,
and the tribute for these has been paid; although it is rather small
and consists only of 9 1/2 alias (elephants), which the Wannias there,
however, deliver regularly, or at least do not take very long in
doing so.Perhaps they could furnish more elephants in lieu of the
tithes of the harvest, and it would not matter if the whole of it
were paid in this way, because this amount could be made up for by
supplies from the lands of Colombo, Galle, and Matara, or a larger
quantity could be ordered overland.That the Master of the Hunt, Don Gasper Nitchenchen Aderayen, should,
as if he were a sovereign, have put to death a Lascoreen and a hunter
under the old Don Gaspar on his own responsibility, is a matter which
will result in very bad consequences; but I have heard rumours to
the effect that it was not his work, but his father's (Don Philip
Nellamapane).With regard to these people Your Honours must observe
the Instructions of Mr.Zwaardecroon, and their further actions must be
watched; because of their conspiracies with the Veddas, in one of which
the brother of Cottapulle Odiaar is said to have been killed.Time
does not permit it, otherwise I would myself hold an inquiry.Mantotte, Moesely, and Pirringaly, which Provinces are ruled by
officers paid by the Company, seem to be doing well; because the
Company received from there a large number of elephants, besides the
tithes of the harvest, which are otherwise drawn by the Wannias.The
two Wannias, Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar, complain that
they do not receive the tribute of two elephants due to them from the
inhabitants of Pirringaly, but I do not find in the decree published
by Commandeur Blom on June 11, 1693, in favour of the inhabitants,
any statement that they owe such tribute for liberation from the rule
of the Wannias, but only that they (these Wannias) will be allowed
to capture elephants.These Wannias, however, sent me a dirty little
document, bearing date May 12, 1694, in which it is stated that the
hunters of Pirringaly had delivered at Manaar for Pannengamo in the
year 1693 two alias, each 4-3/8 cubits high.If more evidence could be
found, it might be proved that such payment of 2 alias yearly really
had to be made, and it would be well for Your Honours to investigate
this matter, because it is very necessary to protect and assist the
hunters as much as possible, as a reward for their diligence in the
capture of elephants.Payment must be made to them in compliance with
the orders of His Excellency van Mydregt.Ponneryn, the third Province from which elephants should
be obtained, and which, like Illepoecarwe, Polweraincattoe, and
Mantotte, was ruled formerly by an Adigar or Lieutenant-Dessave,
was doing fairly well; because the Company received yearly on an
average no less than 25 alias, besides the tithes of the harvest,
until in 1690 the mode of government was changed, and the revenue of
Ponneryn was granted by public decree to the young Don Gaspar by the
Lord Commissioner van Mydregt, while those of the other two Provinces
were granted to the old Don Gaspar, on condition that the young Don
Gaspar would capture and deliver to the Company all elephants which
could be obtained in the said Provinces, while the inhabitants of
Ponneryn would be obliged to obey the Master of the Hunt as far as
their services should be required by the Company and as they had been
accustomed to render.This new arrangement did not prove a success;
because, during seven years, he only delivered 44 elephants, although
in the annexed Memoir it is stated that he delivered 74.Of these 44
animals, 7 were tuskers and 37 alias, viz.:--


                                    Elephants.For 1690                4

                             Total     44


During the last two years he did not deliver a single animal,
so that the Company lost on account of this Master of the Hunt,
131 elephants.He only appropriated the tithes of the harvest, and
did not care in the least about the hunt, so that the Company is even
prevented from obtaining what it would have received by the old method;
and, I must say, I do not understand how these privileges have been
granted so long where they are so clearly against the interest of the
Company, besides being the source of unlawful usurpation practised
over the inhabitants, which is directly against the said deeds of
gift.The elephant hunters have repeatedly applied to be relieved of
their authority and to be allowed to serve again under the Company.For
these reasons, as Your Honour is aware, I have considered it necessary
for the service of the Company to provisionally appoint the sergeant
Albert Hendriksz, who, through his long residence in these Provinces,
has gained a great deal of experience, Adigar over Ponneryn; which
was done at the request of the elephant hunters.He will continue the
capture of elephants with the hunters without regard to the Master of
the Hunt, and Your Honour must give him all the assistance required,
because the hunt has been greatly neglected.Your Honour may allow
both the Don Gaspars to draw the tithes of the harvest until our
authorities at Batavia will have disposed of this matter.The trade in elephants is undoubtedly the most important, as
the rest does not amount to much more than Rds.7,000 to 9,000 a
year.During the year 1695-1696 the whole of the sale amounted to
Fl.33,261.5, including a profit of Fl.We find it stated
in the annexed Memoir that the merchants spoilt their own market by
bidding against each other at the public auctions, but whether this
was really the case we will not discuss here.I positively disapprove
of the complicated and impractical way in which this trade has been
carried on for some years, and which was opposed to the interests
of the Company.I therefore considered it necessary to institute
the public auctions, by which, compared with the former method, the
Company has already gained a considerable amount; which is, however,
no more than what it was entitled to, without it being of the least
prejudice to the trade.I will not enlarge on this subject further,
as all particulars relating to it and everything connected with it may
be found in our considerations and speculations and in the decisions
arrived at in accordance therewith, which are contained in the daily
resolutions from July 24 to August 20 inclusive, a copy of which was
left with Your Honours, and to which I refer you.As to the changed
methods adopted this year, these are not to be altered by any one
but Their Excellencies at Batavia, whose orders I will be obliged
and pleased to receive.As a number of elephants was sold last year
for the sum of Rds.53,357, it was a pity that they could not all
be transported at once, without a number of 126 being left behind on
account of the northern winds.We have therefore started the sale a
little earlier this year, and kept the vessels in readiness, so that
all the animals may be easily transported during August next.On the
20th of this month all purchasers were, to their great satisfaction,
ready to depart, and requested and obtained leave to do so.This year
the Company sold at four different auctions the number of 86 elephants
for the sum of Rds.36,950, 16 animals being left unsold for want of
cash among the purchasers, who are ready to depart with about 200
animals which they are at present engaged in putting on board.The
practice of the early preparation of vessels and the holding of
public auctions must be always observed, because it is a great loss
to the merchants to have to stay over for a whole year, while the
Company also suffers thereby, because in the meantime the animals
do not change masters.It is due to this reason and to the want of
ready cash that this year 16 animals were left unsold.In future it
must be a regular practice in Ceylon to have all the elephants that
are to be sold brought to these Provinces before July 1, so that all
preparations may be made to hold the auctions about the middle of July,
or, if the merchants do not arrive so soon, on August 1.Meanwhile
all the required vessels must be got ready, so that no animals need be
left behind on account of contrary winds.As we have now cut a road,
by which the elephants may be led from Colombo, Galle, and Matura,
as was done successfully one or two months ago, when in two trips
from Matura, Galle, Colombo, Negombo, and Putulang were brought here
with great convenience the large number of 63 elephants, the former
plan of transporting the animals in native vessels from Galle and
Colombo can be dropped now, a few experiments having been made and
proving apparently unsuccessful.It must be seen that at least 12 or
15 elephants are trained for the hunt, as a considerable number is
always required, especially if the animals from Putulang have to be
fetched by land.For this reason I have ordered that two out of the 16
animals that were left from the sale and who have some slight defects,
but which do not unfit them for this work, should be trained, viz.,
No 22, 5 3/8 cubits high, and No.72, 5 1/2 cubits high, which may
be employed to drive the other animals.Meanwhile the Dessave must
see that the two animals which, as he is aware, were lent to Don
Diogo, are returned to the Company.These animals were not counted
among those belonging to the Company, which was very careless.As is
known to Your Honours, we have abolished the practice of branding the
animals twice with the mark circled V, as was done formerly, once when
they were sent to these Provinces and again when they were sold, and
consider it better to mark them only once with a number, beginning
with No.1, 2, 3, &c., up to No.Ten iron brand numbers have
been made for this purpose.If there are more than 100 animals, they
must begin again with number 1, and as a mark of distinction a cross
must be put after each number, which rule must be observed in future,
especially as the merchants were pleased with it and as it is the best
way of identifying the animals.We trust that with the opening of the
King's harbours the plan of obtaining the areca-nut from the King's
territory by water will be unnecessary, but the plan of obtaining
these nuts by way of the Wanni will be dealt with in the Appendix.The trade with the Moors from Bengal must be protected, and these
people fairly and reasonably dealt with, so that we may secure the
necessary supply of grain and victuals.We do not see any reason
why these and other merchants should not be admitted to the sale of
elephants, as was done this year, when every one was free to purchase
as he pleased.The people of Dalpatterau only spent half of their
cash, because they wished to wait till next year for animals which
should be more to their liking.His Excellency the High Commissioner
informed me that he had invited not only the people from Golconda,
but also those of Tanhouwer, [70] &c., to take part in that trade,
and this may be done, especially now that the prospects seem to all
appearances favourable; while from the districts of Colombo, Galle,
and Matura a sufficient number of elephants may be procured to make
up for the deficiency in Jaffnapatam, if we only know a year before
what number would be required, which must be always inquired into.As the Manaar chanks are not in demand in Bengal, we have kept here a
quantity of 36 1/2 Couren of different kinds, intending to sell in the
usual commercial way to the Bengal merchants here present; but they
did not care to take it, and said plainly that the chanks were not of
the required size or colour; they must therefore be sent to Colombo by
the first opportunity, to be sent on to Bengal next year to be sold at
any price, as this will be better than having them lying here useless.The subject of the inhabitants has been treated of in such a way
that it is unnecessary for me to add anything.With regard to the tithes, I agree with Mr.Zwaardecroon that
the taxes need not be reduced, especially as I never heard that the
inhabitants asked for this to be done.It will be the duty of the
Dessave to see that the tenth of the harvest of the waste lands,
which were granted with exemption of taxes for a certain period, is
brought into the Company's stores after the stated period has expired.Poll tax.--It is necessary that a beginning should be made with
the work of revising the Head Thombo, and that the names of the old
and infirm people and of those that have died should be taken off the
list, while the names of the youths who have reached the required age
are entered.This renovation should take place once in three years,
and the Dessave as Land Regent should sometimes assist in this work.Officie Gelden.--It will be very well if this be divided according
to the number of people in each caste, so that each individual pays
his share, instead of the amount being demanded from each caste as
a whole, because it is apparent that the Majoraals have profited by
the old method.No remarks are at present necessary with regard to the Adigary.The Oely service, imposed upon those castes which are bound to
serve, must be looked after, as this is the only practicable means
of continuing the necessary works.The idea of raising the fine for
non-attendance from 2 stivers, which they willingly pay, to 4 stivers
or one fanam, [71] is not bad, but I found this to be the practise
already for many years, as may be seen from the annexed account of two
parties of men who had been absent, which most likely was overlooked
by mistake.This is yet stronger evidence that the circumstances
of the inhabitants have improved, and I therefore think it would be
well to raise the chicos from 4 stivers to 6 stivers or 1 1/2 fanam,
with a view to finding out whether the men will then be more diligent
in the performance of their duty; because the work must be carried on
by every possible means.Your Honours are again seriously recommended
to see that the sicos or fines specified in the annexed Memoir are
collected without delay, and also the amount still due for 1693,
because such delay cannot but be prejudicial to the Company.The old
and infirm people whose names are not entered in the new Thombo must
still deliver mats, and kernels for coals for the smith's shop.No
objections will be raised to this if they see that we do not slacken
in our supervision.Tax Collectors and Majoraals.--The payment of the taxes does not
seem satisfactory, because only Rds.180 have been paid yet out of
the Rds.2,975.1 due as sicos for the year 1695.It would be well
if these officers could be transferred according to the Instructions
of 1673 and 1675.It used to be the practice to transfer them every
three years; but I think it will be trouble in vain now, because when
an attempt was made to have these offices filled by people of various
castes, it caused such commotion and uproar that it was not considered
advisable to persist in this course except where the interest of the
Company made it strictly necessary.Perhaps a gradual change could
be brought about by filling the places of some of the Bellales when
they die by persons of other castes, which I think could be easily
done.Zwaardecroon seems to think it desirable that
the appointment of new officials for vacancies and the issuing of
the actens should be deferred till his return from Mallabaar or
until another Commandeur should come over, we trust that he does
not mean that these appointments could not be made by the Governor
of the Island or by the person authorized by him to do so.If the
Commandeur were present, such appointment should not be made without
his knowledge, especially after the example of the commotion caused
by the transfer of these officers in this Commandement, but in order
that Your Honours may not be at a loss what to do, it will be better
for you not to wait for the return of Mr.Zwaardecroon from Mallabaar,
nor for the arrival of any other Commandeur, but to refer these and
all other matters concerning this Commandement, which is subordinate
to us, to Colombo to the Governor and Council, so that proper advice
in debita forma may be given.The Lascoreens certainly make better messengers than soldiers.The
Dessave must therefore maintain discipline among them, and take
care that no men bound to perform other duties are entered as
Lascoreens.This they often try to bring about in order to be
excused from labour, and the Company is thus deprived of labourers
and is put to great inconvenience.I noticed this to be the case in
Colombo during the short time I was in Ceylon, when the labour had to
be supplied by the Company's slaves.There seems to be no danger of
another famine for some time, as the crop in Coromandel has turned out
very well.We cannot therefore agree to an increase of pay, although
it is true that the present wages of the men are very low.It must
be remembered, however, that they are also very simple people, who
have but few wants, and are not always employed in the service of
the Company; so that they may easily earn something besides if they
are not too lazy.We will therefore keep their wages for the present
at the rate they have been at for so many years; especially because
it is our endeavour to reduce the heavy expenditure of the Company
by every practicable means.We trust that there was good reason why
the concession made by His Excellency the Extraordinary Councillor
of India, Mr.Laurens Pyl, in favour of the Lascoreens has not been
executed, and we consider that on account of the long interval that
has elapsed it is no longer of application.The proposal to transfer
the Lascoreens in this Commandement twice, or at least once a year,
will be a good expedient for the reasons stated.The importation of slaves from the opposite coast seems to be most
profitable to the inhabitants of Jaffnapatam, as no less a number
than 3,584 were brought across in two years' time, for which they
paid 9,856 guilders as duty.It would be better if they imported a
larger quantity of rice or nely, because there is so often a scarcity
of food supplies here.It is also true that the importation of so many
slaves increases the number of people to be fed, and that the Wannias
could make themselves more formidable with the help of these men, so
that there is some reason for the question whether the Company does
not run the risk of being put to inconvenience with regard to this
Commandement.Considering also that the inhabitants have suffered
from chicken-pox since the importation of slaves, which may endanger
whole Provinces, I think it will be well to prevent the importation of
slaves.As to the larger importation on account of the famine on the
opposite coast, where these creatures were to be had for a handful of
rice, this will most likely cease now, after the better harvest.The
danger with regard to the Wannias I do not consider so very great, as
the rule of the Company is such that the inhabitants prefer it to the
extreme hardships they had to undergo under the Wannia chiefs, and they
would kill them if not for fear of the power of the Company.Therefore
I think it unnecessary to have any apprehension on this score.Rice and nely are the two articles which are always wanting,
not only in Jaffnapatam, but throughout Ceylon all over the Company's
territory, and therefore the officers of the Government must constantly
guard against a monopoly being made of this grain.This opportunity
is taken to recommend the matter to Your Honours as regards this
Commandement.I do not consider any remarks necessary with regard to the
native trade.I agree, however, with the method practised by
Mr.Zwaardecroon in order to prevent the monopoly of grain, viz.,
that all vessels returning with grain, which the owners take to Point
Pedro, Tellemanaar, and Wallewitteture, often under false pretexts,
in order to hide it there, should be ordered to sail to Kayts.This
matter is recommended to Your Honours' attention.With regard to the coconut trees, we find that more difficulties
are raised about the order from Colombo of October 13 last, for the
delivery of 24 casks of coconut oil, than is necessary, considering
the large number of trees found in this country.It seems to me that
this could be easily done; because, according to what is published from
time to time, and from what is stated in the Pass Book, it appears that
during the period of five years 1692 to 1696 inclusive, a number of
5,397,800 of these nuts were exported, besides the quantity smuggled
and the number consumed within this Commandement.Calculating that
one cask, or 400 cans of 10 quarterns, of oil can be easily drawn from
5,700 coconuts (that is to say, in Colombo: in this Commandement 6,670
nuts would be required for the same quantity, and thus, for the whole
supply of 24 casks, 160,080 nuts would be necessary), I must say I do
not understand why this order should be considered so unreasonable,
and why the Company's subjects could not supply this quantity for
good payment.Instead of issuing licenses for the export of the nuts
it will be necessary to prohibit it, because none of either of the
kinds of oil demanded has been delivered.I do not wish to express
my opinion here, but will only state that shortly after my arrival,
I found that the inhabitants on their own account gladly delivered the
oil at the Company's stores at the rate of 3 fanams or Rd.1/4 per
marcal of 36 quarterns, even up to 14 casks, and since then, again,
10 casks have been delivered, and they still continue to do so.They
also delivered 3 amen of margosa oil, while the Political Council
were bold enough to assert in their letter of April 4 last that it
was absolutely impossible to send either of the two kinds of oil,
the excuse being that they had not even sufficient for their own
requirements.How far this statement can be relied upon I will not
discuss here; but I recommend to Your Honours to be more truthful
and energetic in future, and not to trouble us with unnecessary
correspondence, as was done lately; although so long as the Dessave
is present I have better expectations.No remarks are necessary on the subject of the iron and steel
tools, except that there is the more reason why what is recommended
here must be observed; because the free trade with Coromandel and
Palecatte has been opened this year by order of the Honourable the
Supreme Government of India.It is very desirable that the palmyra planks and laths should
be purchased by the Dessave.As reference is made here to the large
demand for Colombo and Negapatam, I cannot refrain from remarking
that the demand from Negapatam has been taken much more notice of
than that from Colombo; because, within a period of four years, no
more than 1,970 planks and 19,652 laths have been sent here, which was
by no means sufficient, and in consequence other and far less durable
wood had to be used.We also had to obtain laths from private persons
at Jaffnapatam at a high rate and of inferior quality.I therefore
specially request that during the next northern monsoon the following
are sent to this Commandement of Colombo, [72] where several necessary
building operations are to be undertaken:--4,000 palmyra planks in
two kinds, viz., 2,000 planks, four out of one tree; 2,000 planks,
three out of one tree; 20,000 palmyra laths.Your Honour must see that
this timber is sent to Colombo by any opportunity that offers itself.It will be necessary to train another able person for the
supervision of the felling of timber, so that we may not be put to
any inconvenience in case of the death of the old sergeant.Such
a person must be well acquainted with the country and the forests,
and the advice here given must be followed.Charcoal, which is burnt from kernels, has been mentioned under
the heading of the Oely service, where it is stated who are bound
to deliver it.These persons must be kept up to the mark, but as
a substitute in times of necessity 12 hoeden [73] of coals were
sent last January as promised to Your Honour.This must, however,
be economically used.As stated here, the bark-lunt is more a matter of convenience
than of importance.It is, however, necessary to continue exacting
this duty, being an old right of the lord of the land; but on the
other hand it must be seen that too much is not extorted.The coral stone is a great convenience, and it would be well
if it could be found in more places in Ceylon, when so many hoekers
would not be required to bring the lime from Tutucorin.The lime found here is also a great convenience and profit,
as that which is required in this Commandement is obtained free of
cost.When no more lime is required for Coromandel, the 8,000 or 9,000
paras from Cangature must be taken to Kayts as soon as possible in
payment of what the lime-burners still owe.If it can be proved that
any amount is still due, they must return it in cash, as proposed
by Commandeur Zwaardecroon, which Your Honour is to see to.But as
another order has come from His Excellency the Governor of Coromandel
for 100 lasts of lime, it will be easier to settle this account.The dye-roots have been so amply treated of here and in such a way
that I recommend to Your Honour to follow the advice given.I would
add some remarks on the subject if want of time did not prevent my
doing so.The farming out of the duties, including those on the import of
foreign cloth of 20 per cent., having increased by Rds.4,056 1/2,
must be continued in the same way.The stamping of native cloth
(included in the lease) must be reduced, from September 1 next, to 20
per cent.The farmers must also be required to pay the monthly term
at the beginning of each month in advance, which must be stipulated
in the lease, so that the Company may not run any risks.There are
prospects of this lease becoming more profitable for the Company in
future, on account of the passage having been opened.With regard to the Trade Accounts, such good advice has been
given here, that I fully approve of it and need not make any further
comments, but only recommend the observance of the rules.The debts due to the Company, amounting to 116,426.11.14 guilders
at the end of February, 1694, were at the departure of Mr.Zwaardecroon
reduced to 16,137.8 guilders.This must no doubt be attributed
to the greater vigilance exercised, in compliance with the orders
from the Honourable the Supreme Government of India by resolution
of 1693.This order still holds good and seems to be still obeyed;
because, since the date of this Memoir, the debt has been reduced to
14,118.11.8 guilders.The account at present is as follows:--


                                                     Guilders.[74]
    The Province of Timmoraatsche                    376.2.8
    The Province of Patchelepalle                    579.10.0
    Tandua Moeti and Nagachitty (weavers)          2,448.13.0
    Manuel of Anecotta                             8,539.6.0
    The Tannecares caste                           1,650.0.0
    Don Philip Nellamapane                           375.0.0
    Ambelewanner                                     150.0.0
                                                  ===========
                                      Total       14,118.11.8


Herein is not included the Fl.167.15 which again has been paid to
the weavers Tandua Moeti and Naga Chitty on account of the Company for
the delivery of Salampoeris, while materials have been issued to them
later on.It is not with my approval that these poor people continue
to be employed in the weaving of cloth, because the Salampoeris which I
have seen is so inferior a quality and uneven that I doubt whether the
Company will make any profit on it; especially if the people should
get into arrears again as usual on account of the thread and cash
issued to them.I have an idea that I read in one of the letters from
Batavia, which, however, is not to be found here at the Secretariate,
that Their Excellencies forbid the making of the gingams spoken of
by Mr.Zwaardecroon, as there was no profit to be made on these,
but I am not quite sure, and will look for the letter in Colombo,
and inform Their Excellencies at Batavia of this matter.Meantime,
Your Honours must continue the old practice as long as it does not
act prejudicially to the Company.At present their debt is 2,448.13
guilders, from which I think it would be best to discharge them,
and no advance should be given to them in future, nor should they be
employed in the weaving of cloth for the Company.I do not think they
need be sent out of the country on account of their idolatry on their
being discharged from their debt; because I am sure that most of the
natives who have been baptized are more heathen than Christian, which
would be proved on proper investigation.Besides, there are still so
many other heathen, as, for instance, the Brahmin Timmerza and his
large number of followers, about whom nothing is said, and who also
openly practise idolatry and greatly exercise their influence to aid
the vagabonds (land-loopers) dependent on him, much to the prejudice of
Christianity.I think, therefore, that it is a matter of indifference
whether these people remain or not, the more so as the inhabitants of
Jaffnapatam are known to be a perverse and stiff-necked generation,
for whom we can only pray that God in His mercy will graciously
enlighten their understanding and bless the means employed for their
instruction to their conversion and knowledge of their salvation.It is to be hoped that the debt of the dyers, amounting to 8,539.6
guilders, may yet be recovered by vigilance according to the
instructions.The debt of the Tannekares, who owe 1,650 guilders for 11
elephants, and the amount of 375 guilders due by Don Gaspar advanced
to him for the purchase of nely, as also the amount of Fl.150 from
the Ambelewanne, must be collected as directed here.With regard to the pay books nothing need be observed here but
that the instructions given in the annexed Memoir be carried out.What is said here with regard to the Secretariate must be observed,
but with regard to the proposed means of lessening the duties of
the Secretary by transferring the duties of the Treasurer to the
Thombo-keeper, Mr.Bolscho (in which work the latter is already
employed), I do not know whether it would be worth while, as it is
best to make as few changes as possible.The instructions with regard
to the passports must be followed pending further orders.I will not comment upon what is stated here with regard to the
Court of Justice, as these things occurred before I took up the reins
of Government, and that was only recently.I have besides no sufficient
knowledge of the subject, while also time does not permit me to peruse
the documents referred to.Zwaardecroon's advice must be followed,
but in case Mr.Bolscho should have to be absent for a short time
(which at present is not necessary, as it seems that the preparation
of the maps and the correction of the Thombo is chiefly left to the
surveyors), I do not think the sittings of the Court need be suspended,
but every effort must be made to do justice as quickly as possible.In
case of illness of some of the members, or when the Lieutenant Claas
Isaacsz has to go to the interior to relieve the Dessave of his duties
there, Lieut.van Loeveningen, and, if necessary, the Secretary of the
Political Council, could be appointed for the time; because the time
of the Dessave will be taken up with the supervision of the usual work
at the Castle.I think that there are several law books in stock in
Colombo, of which some will be sent for the use of the Court of Justice
by the first opportunity; as it appears that different decisions have
been made in similar cases among the natives.Great precaution must
be observed, and the documents occasionally submitted to us.I think
that the number of five Lascoreens and six Caffirs will be sufficient
for the assistance of the Fiscaal.I will not make any remarks here on the subject of religion, but
will refer to my annotations under the heading of Outstanding Debts.I agree with all that has been stated here with regard to the
Seminary and need not add anything further, except that I think this
large school and church require a bell, which may be rung on Sundays
for the services and every day to call the children to school and
to meals.As there are bells in store, the Dessave must be asked to
see that one is put up, either at the entrance of the church on some
steps, or a little more removed from the door, or wherever it may be
considered to be most convenient and useful.All that is said here with regard to the Consistory I can only
confirm.I approve of the advice given to the Dessave to see to the
improvement of the churches and the houses belonging thereto; but I
have heard that the neglect has extended over a long period and the
decay is very serious.It should have been the duty of the Commandeur
to prevent their falling into ruin.The Civil or Landraad ought to hold its sittings as stated in the
Memoir.I am very much surprised to find that this Court is hardly
worthy of the name of Court any more, as not a single sitting has been
held or any case heard since March 21, 1696.It appears that these
sittings were not only neglected during the absence of the Commandeur
in Colombo, but even after his return and since his departure for
Mallabaar, and it seems that they were not even thought of until my
arrival here.This shows fine government indeed, considering also
that the election of the double number of members for this College had
twice taken place, the members nominated and the list sent to Colombo
without a single meeting being held.It seems to me incomprehensible,
and as it is necessary that this Court should meet again once every
week without fail, the Dessave, as chief in this Commandement when the
Commandeur is absent, is entrusted with the duty of seeing that this
order is strictly observed.As Your Honours are aware, I set apart a
meeting place both for this Court as well as the Court of Justice,
namely, the corner house next to the house of the Administrateur
Biermans, consisting of one large and one small room, while a roof has
been built over the steps.This, though not of much pretension, will
quite do, and I consider it unnecessary to build so large a building as
proposed either for this Court or for the Scholarchen.The scholarchial
meetings can be held in the same place as those of the Consistory,
as is done in Colombo and elsewhere, and a large Consistory has been
built already for the new church.As it is not necessary now to put up
a special building for those assemblies, I need not point out here the
errors in the plan proposed, nor need I state how I think such a place
should be arranged.I have also been averse to such a building being
erected so far outside the Castle and in a corner where no one comes
or passes, and I consider it much better if this is done within the
Castle.There is a large square adjoining the church, where a whole
row of buildings might be put up.It is true that no one may erect
new buildings on behalf of the Company without authority and special
orders from Batavia.I have to recommend that this order be strictly
observed.Whether or not the said foul pool should be filled up I
cannot say at present, as it would involve no little labour to do so.I approve of the advice given in the annexed Memoir with regard
to the Orphan Chamber.I agree with this passage concerning the Commissioners of Marriage
Causes, except that some one else must be appointed in the place of
Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz if necessary.Superintendent of the Fire Brigade and Wardens of the Town.As stated here, the deacons have a deficit of Rds.1,145.3.7 over
the last five and half years, caused by the building of an Orphanage
and the maintenance of the children.At present there are 18 orphans,
10 boys and 8 girls, and for such a small number certainly a large
building and great expenditure is unnecessary.As the deficit has been
chiefly caused by the building of the Orphanage, which is paid for
now, and as the Deaconate has invested a large capital, amounting to
Fl.40,800, on interest in the Company, I do not see the necessity of
finding it some other source of income, as it would have to be levied
from the inhabitants or paid by the Company in some way or other.No more sums on interest are to be received in deposit on behalf
of the Company, in compliance with the instructions referred to.What is stated here with regard to the money drafts must be
observed.Golden Pagodas.--I find a notice, bearing date November 18,
1695, giving warning against the introduction of Pagodas into this
country.It does not seem to have had much effect, as there seems
to be a regular conspiracy and monopoly among the chetties and other
rogues.This ought to be stopped, and I have therefore ordered that
none but the Negapatam and Palliacatte Pagodas will be current at 24
fannums or Rds.2, while it will be strictly prohibited to give in
payment or exchange any other Pagodas, whether at the boutiques or
anywhere else, directly or indirectly, on penalty of the punishment
laid down in the statutes.Your Honours must see that this rule
is observed, and care must be taken that no payment is made to the
Company's servants in coin on which they would have to lose.The applications from outstations.--The rules laid down in the
annexed Memoir must be observed.With regard to the Company's sloops and other vessels, directions
are given here as to how they are employed, which directions must be
still observed.Further information or instructions may be obtained
from Colombo.The Fortifications.--I think it would be preferable to leave the
fortifications of the Castle of Jaffnapatam as they are, instead
of raising any points or curtains.But improvements may be made,
such as the alteration of the embrazures, which are at present on the
outside surrounded by coral stone and chunam, and are not effective,
as I noticed that at the firing of the salute on my arrival, wherever
the canons were fired the coral stone had been loosened and in some
places even thrown down.The sentry boxes also on the outer points
of the flank and face had been damaged.These embrazures would be
very dangerous for the sentry in case of an attack, as they would
not stand much firing.I think also that the stone flooring for the
artillery ought to be raised a little, or, in an emergency, boards
could be placed underneath the canon, which would also prevent the
stones being crushed by the wheels.I noticed further that each canon
stands on a separate platform, which is on a level with the floor of
the curtain, so that if the carriage should break when the canon are
fired, the latter would be thrown down, and it would be with great
difficulty only that they could be replaced on their platform.It
would be much safer if the spaces between these platforms were filled
up.The ramparts are all right, but the curtain <DW72>s too much;
this was done most likely with a view of permitting the shooting with
muskets at even a closer range than half-way across the moat.This
deficiency might be rectified by raising the earthen wall about
half a foot.These are the chief deficiencies I noticed, which could
be easily rectified.With regard to the embrazures, I do not know at
present whether it would be safer to follow the plan of the Commandeur
or that of the Constable-Major Toorse.For the present I have ordered
the removal of the stones and their replacement by grass sods, which
can be fixed on the earthen covering of the ramparts.Some of the
soldiers well experienced in this work are employed in doing this,
and I think that it will be far more satisfactory than the former plan,
which was only for show.The sentry boxes had better be built inside,
and the present passage to them from the earthen wall closed up, and
they must be built so that they would not be damaged by the firing of
the canon.The Dessave has been instructed to see that the different
platforms for the artillery are made on one continuous floor, which
can be easily done, as the spaces between them are but very small
and the materials are at hand.I wish the deficiencies outside the fort could be remedied as well
as those within it.The principal defect is that the moat serves as
yet very little as a safeguard, and it seems as if there is no hope
of its being possible to dig it sufficiently deep, considering that
experiments have been made with large numbers of labourers and yet the
work has advanced but little.When His Excellency the Honourable the
Commissioner van Mydregt was in Jaffnapatam in 1690, he had this work
continued for four or five weeks by a large number of people, but he
had to give it up, and left no instructions as far as is known.The
chief difficulty is the very hard and large rocks enclosed in the
coral stone, which cannot be broken by any instrument and have to
be blasted.This could be successfully done in the upper part, but
lower down beneath the water level the gunpowder cannot be made to
take fire.As this is such an important work, I think orders should
be obtained from Batavia to carry on this work during the dry season
when the water is lowest; because at that time also the people are
not engaged in the cultivation of fields, so that a large number
of labourers could be obtained.The blasting of the rocks was not
undertaken at first for fear of damage to the fortifications, but
as the moat has been dug at a distance of 10 roods from the wall,
it may be 6 or 7 roods wide and a space would yet remain of 3 or
4 roods.This, in my opinion, would be the only effectual way of
completing the work, provision being made against the rushing in of the
water, while a sufficient number of tools, such as shovels, spades,
&c., must be kept at hand for the breaking of the coral stones.It
would be well for the maintenance of the proper depth to cover both
the outer and inner walls with coral stone, as otherwise this work
would be perfectly useless.With regard to the high grounds northward and southward of the town,
this is not very considerable, and thus not a source of much danger.I
admit, however, that it would be better if they were somewhat lower,
but the surface is so large that I fear it would involve a great
deal of labour and expenditure.In case this were necessary, it would
be just as important that the whole row of buildings right opposite
the fort in the town should be broken down.I do not see the great
necessity for either, while moreover, the soil consists of sand and
stone, which is not easily dug.With regard to the horse stables and
the carpenters' yard just outside the gate of the Castle, enclosed
by a wall, the river, and the moat of the Castle, which is deepest
in that place (although I did not see much water in it), I think it
would have been better if they had been placed elsewhere; but yet I
do not think they are very dangerous to the fort, especially as that
corner can be protected from the points Hollandia and Gelria; while,
moreover, the roof of the stable and the walls towards the fort could
be broken down on the approach of an enemy; for, surely no one could
come near without being observed.As these buildings have been only
newly erected, they will have to be used, in compliance with the
orders from Batavia.Thus far as to my advice with regard to this fort; but I do not mean to
oppose the proposals of the Commandeur.I will only state here that I
found the moat of unequal breadth, and in some places only half as wide
as it ought to be, of which no mention is made here.In some places
also it is not sufficiently deep to turn the water by banks or keep it
four or five feet high by water-mills.Even if this were so, I do not
think the water could be retained on account of the sandy and stony
soil, especially as there are several low levels near by.Supposing
even that it were possible, the first thing an enemy would do would be
to direct a few shots of the canon towards the sluices, and thus make
them useless.I would therefore recommend that, if possible, the moat
be deepened so far during the south-west monsoon that it would be on a
level with the river, by which four or six feet of water would always
stand in it.With regard to the sowing of thorns, I fear that during
the dry season they would be quite parched and easily take fire.This
proposal shows how little the work at the moat has really advanced,
in fact, when I saw it it was dry and overgrown with grass.So long
as the fort is not surrounded by a moat, I cannot see the necessity
for a drawbridge, but the Honourable the Government of India will
dispose of this matter.Meantime I have had many improvements made,
which I hope will gain the approval of Their Excellencies.The fortress Hammenhiel is very well situated for the protection
of the harbour and the river of Kaits.The sand bank and the wall
damaged by the storm have been repaired.The height of the reservoir
is undoubtedly a mistake, which must be altered.The gate and the part
of the rampart are still covered with the old and decayed beams, and
it would be well if the project of Mr.This is a
very necessary work, which must be hurried on as much as circumstances
permit, and it is recommended to Your Honours' attention, because
the old roof threatens to break down.As I have not seen any of these places, I cannot say whether the
water tanks are required or not.As the work has to wait for Dutch
bricks, it will be some time before it can be commenced, because
there are none in store here.Manaar is a fortress with four entire bastions.I found that the
full garrison, including Europeans and Mixties, [75] consists of 44
men, twelve or fifteen of whom are moreover usually employed in the
advanced guard or elsewhere.I do not therefore see the use of this
fortress, and do not understand why instead of this fortress a redoubt
was not built.Having been built the matter cannot now be altered.It
has been stated that Manaar is an island which protects Jaffnapatam
on the south, but I cannot see how this is so.The deepening of
the moat cannot be carried out so soon, but the elevations may be
removed.Lime I consider can be burnt there in sufficient quantities,
and my verbal orders to the Resident have been to that effect.The
pavement for the canons I found quite completed, but the floors of
the galleries of the dwelling houses not yet.The water reservoir
of brick, which is on a level with the rampart, I have ordered to be
surrounded with a low wall, about 3 or 3 1/2 feet high, with a view
to prevent accidents to the sentinels at night, which are otherwise
likely to occur.The Dessave must see whether this has been done,
as it is not likely that I would go there again, because I intend
returning to Colombo by another route.Great attention should be paid to the provisions and
ammunition.The order of His Excellency van Mydregt was given as a
wise precaution, but has proved impracticable after many years of
experience, as His Excellency himself was also aware, especially
with regard to grain and rice, on account of the variable crops to
which we are subject here.However, the plan must be carried out as
far as possible in this Commandement, with the understanding that
no extraordinary prices are paid for the purchase of rice; while, on
the other hand, care must be taken that the grain does not spoil by
being kept too long; because we do not know of any kind of rice except
that from Coromandel which can be kept even for one year.At present
rice and nely are easily obtained, and therefore I do not consider it
necessary that the people of Jaffnapatam should be obliged to deliver
their rice at half per cent.The ten kegs of meat
and ten kegs of bacon must be sent to Colombo by the first opportunity,
to be disposed of there, if it is not spoilt (which is very much to
be feared).In case it is unfit for use the loss will be charged to
the account of this Commandement, although it has to be borne by the
Company all the same.Greater discrimination should be exercised in
future to prevent such occurrences, and I think it would be well in
emergencies to follow the advice of the late Mr.Paviljoen, viz., to
capture 1,000 or 1,200 cattle around the fort and drive them inside it,
while dry burs, &c., may also be collected to feed them.The arrack
must never be accepted until it has been proved to be good.In Batavia
it is tested by burning it in a silver bowl, and the same ought to be
done here, it being tested by two Commissioners and the dispenser.In
future bad arrack will be charged to the account of the person who
accepted it.The acceptance of inferior goods proves great negligence,
to say the least, and Your Honours are recommended to see that these
orders are observed.It is a satisfaction to know that there is a
sufficient stock of ammunition.An attempt must be made to repair
the old muskets, and those which are unfit for use must be sent to
Colombo.The storing away of fuel is a
praiseworthy precaution; but on my arrival I found only very little
kept here, and the space for the greater part empty.The military and the garrison are proportionately as strong here as
in other places, the want of men being a general complaint.However,
in order to meet this defect in some way, 34 of the military men who
came here with me are to remain, and also the three men whom I left
at Manaar and appointed to that station.I therefore do not think it
necessary to employ any more oepasses, [76] especially as we intend to
reduce the number of these people in Colombo to a great extent, so that
if they are really required, which I cannot see yet, some of them might
be sent here.At present we have nothing to fear from the Sinhalese.We
are on good terms with them, and it would be inexcusable to employ
any new men whose maintenance would be a heavy expenditure.Strict
discipline and continual military drill are very important points,
specially recommended to the attention of the Dessave.Public Works.--Care must be taken that no more native artisans
are employed than is necessary, as this means a considerable daily
expenditure.The various recommendations on this subject must be
observed.The four old and decayed Portuguese houses, which I found
to be in a bad condition, must be rebuilt when circumstances permit,
and may then serve as dwellings for the clergy and other qualified
officers, [77] but orders from Batavia must be awaited.John travelled to the bathroom.Meantime
I authorize Your Honours to have the armoury rebuilt, as this is
indispensable.I agree with the recommendations with regard to the horse stables,
and also think that they could very well be supervised by the Chief,
and that it is undesirable for private overseers to be employed
for this purpose.The stable outside the fort has been brought into
readiness, and it may now be considered for what purpose the stable
in the Castle could be utilized.It is well that the floor of the hospital has been raised,
but the floor of the back gallery is also too low, so that it is
always wet whenever it rains, the water both rising from the ground
and coming down from the roof, which has been built too flat.It is
also necessary that a door be made in the ante-room and the entrance
of the gallery, in order to shut out the cold north winds, which are
very strong here and cause great discomfort to the patients.I also
think that the half walls between the rooms should be raised by a half
stone wall up to the roof, because it is too cold as it is at present
for such people.These and other improvements are also recommended
to the attention of the Dessave.It is always the case with the Company's slaves, to ask for
higher pay as soon as they learn a trade.I cannot countenance this
on my part, because I consider that they already receive the highest
pay allowed for a slave.They deserve no more than others who have
to do the heaviest and dirtiest work.These also if put to the test
would do higher work, as experience has proved.It is true that the
number here is small, but I think the rules should be the same in
all places.As there are, however, some slaves in Colombo also who
receive higher pay, the wages of the man who draws 6 fanams might be
raised to 8, 4 to 6, and 3 to 5 fanams, on the understanding that no
increase will be given hereafter.The emancipation of slaves and the
intermarrying with free people has also been practised and tolerated
in Ceylon, but whatever may be the pretext, I think it is always
to the prejudice of the Company in the case of male slaves.In the
case of women without children the matter is not quite so important,
and I would consent to it in the present case of the woman whom a
native proposes to marry, provided she has no children and is willing
to place a strong and healthy substitute.Until further orders no
more slaves are to be emancipated or allowed to intermarry with
free people.Those who are no longer able to work must be excused,
but those who have been receiving higher pay because they know some
trade will, in that case, receive no more than ordinary slaves.It
is not wise to emancipate slaves because they are old, as it might
have undesirable consequences, while also they might in that case
very soon have to be maintained by the Deaconate.It is in compliance with our orders that close regard should
be paid to all that passes at Manaar.This has been confirmed again
by our letter of June 1, especially with a view to collect the duty
from the vessels carrying cloth, areca-nut, &c., as was always done
by the Portuguese, and formerly also by the Company during the time
of the free trade.Further orders with regard to this matter must be
awaited from Batavia.Meantime our provisional orders must be observed,
and in case these are approved, it will have to be considered whether
it would not be better to lease the Customs duty.Personally I think
that this would be decidedly more profitable to the Company.With regard to the ill-fated elephants, I have to seriously
recommend better supervision.It is unaccountable how so many of
these animals should die in the stables.Out of three or four animals
sent to Jaffnapatam in 1685, and once even out of ten animals sent,
only one reached the Castle alive.If such be the case, what use is
it to the Company for efforts to be made for the delivery of a large
number of elephants?Moreover, experience proves that this need not
be looked upon as inevitable, because out of more than 100 elephants
kept in the lands of Matura hardly two or three died in a whole year,
while two parties of 63 animals each had been transported for more than
120 miles by land and reached their destination quite fresh and well,
although there were among these six old and decrepit and thirteen baby
elephants, some only 3 cubits high and rather delicate.It is true, as
has been said, that the former animals had been captured with nooses,
which would tire and harm them more than if they were caught in kraals,
but even then they make every effort to regain their liberty, and,
moreover, the kraals were in use here also formerly, and even then
a large number of the animals died.These are only vain excuses,
for I have been assured by the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz and others
who have often assisted in the capture of elephants, both with nooses
and in kraals, that these animals (which are very delicate and must
be carefully tended, as they cannot be without food for 24 hours)
were absolutely neglected both in the stables at Manaar and on the
way.An animal of 5 or 6 cubits high is fed and attended there by only
one cooly, while each animal requires at least three coolies.They
are only fed on grass, if it is to be had, and at most 10, 12, or
15 olas or coconut leaves, whereas they require at least 50 or 60,
and it is very likely that those that are being transported get still
less, while the journey itself also does them a great deal of harm.How
little regard is paid to these matters I have seen myself in the lands
of Mantotte and elsewhere, and the Chief of Manaar, Willem de Ridder,
when questioned about it, had to admit that none of the keepers or
those who transported the animals, who are usually intemperate and
inexperienced toepas soldiers or Lascoreens, had ever been questioned
or even suspected in this matter.This is neglect of the Company's
interests, and in future only trustworthy persons should be employed,
and fines or corporal punishment ordered in case of failure, as the
death of such a large number of elephants causes considerable loss
to the Company.I think it would be best if the Chief of Manaar were
held mostly responsible for the supervision and after him the Adigar of
Mantotte.They must see that the animals are fed properly when kept in
the stalls during the rainy season; and these animals must always have
more than they eat, as they tread upon and waste part of it.During
the dry season the animals must be distributed over the different
villages in the Island, some also being sent to Carsel.Care must be
taken that besides the cornak [78] there are employed three parrias
[79] for each animal to provide its food, instead of one only as at
present, and besides the Chief and the Adigar a trustworthy man should
be appointed, either a Dutch sergeant or corporal or a reliable native,
to supervise the stalls.His duty will be to improve the stables,
and see that they are kept clean, and that the animals are properly
fed.The tank of Manaar, which is shallow and often polluted by
buffaloes, must be cleaned, deepened, and surrounded with a fence,
and in future only used for the elephants.The Adigar must supervise
the transport of the elephants from Mantotte and Manaar to the Castle,
and he must be given for his assistance all such men as he applies
for.At the boundary of the district of Mantotte he must give over his
charge to the Adigar of Pringaly, and the latter transporting them to
the boundary of Ponneryn must give them over to the Adigar of Ponneryn,
and he again at the Passes to the Ensign there, who will transport them
to the Castle.Experience will prove that in this way nearly all the
animals will arrive in good condition.The Dessave de Bitter is to see
that these orders are carried out, and he may suggest any improvements
he could think of, which will receive our consideration.This is
all I have to say on the subject.It seems that the Castle, &c.,
are mostly kept up on account of the elephants, and therefore the
sale of these animals must counterbalance the expenditure.The cultivation of dye-roots is dealt with under the heading of
the Moorish Trade.I approve the orders from Colombo of May 17, 1695, with regard
to the proposal by Perie Tamby, for I think that he would have looked
for pearl oysters more than for chanks.With regard to the pearl fishery, some changes will have to be
made.The orders will be sent in time from Colombo before the next
fishery.In my Memoir, left at Colombo, I have ordered with regard
to the proposal of the Committee that four buoys should be made as
beacons for the vessels, each having a chain of 12 fathoms long, with
the necessary adaptations in the links for turning.With regard to the
question as to the prohibition of the export of coconuts on account
of the large number of people that will collect there, I cannot see
that it would be necessary.When the time arrives, and it is sure
that a fishery will be held, Your Honours may consider the question
once more, and if you think it to be so, the issue of passports may
be discontinued for the time.Most likely a fishery will be held
in the beginning of next year, upon which we hope God will give His
blessing, the Company having made a profit of Fl.77,435.12 1/2 last
time, when only three-fourths of the work could be done on account
of the early south-west monsoon.All particulars having been stated here with regard to the
inhabited islets, I do not consider it necessary to make any remarks
about them.Horse breeding surely promises good results as stated in the
annexed Memoir.I visited the islands De Twee Gebroeders, and saw
about 200 foals of one, two, and three years old.I had some caught
with nooses, and they proved to be of good build and of fairly
good race.On the island of Delft there are no less than 400 or 500
foals.Many of those on the islands De Twee Gebroeders will soon be
large enough to be captured and trained, when 15 animals, or three
teams, must be sent to Colombo to serve for the carriages with four
horses in which it is customary to receive the Kandyan ambassadors
and courtiers.They must be good animals, and as much as possible
alike in colour.At present we have only ten of these horses, many
of which are too old and others very unruly, so that they are almost
useless.Besides these, 15 riding horses are required for the service
of the Company in Colombo and Galle, as not a single good saddle
horse is to be found in either of these Commandements.Besides these,
25 or 30 horses must be sent for sale to private persons by public
auction, which I trust will fetch a good deal more than Rds.25 or 35,
as they do in Coromandel.The latter prices are the very lowest at
which the animals are to be sold, and none must be sold in private,
but always by public auction.This, I am sure, will be decidedly in the
interest of the Company and the fairest way of dealing.I would further
recommend that, as soon as possible, a stable should be built on the
islands De Twee Gebroeders like that in Delft, or a little smaller,
where the animals could be kept when captured until they are a little
tamed, as they remain very wild for about two months.Next to this
stable a room or small house should be built for the Netherlander to
whom the supervision is entrusted.At present this person, who is
moreover married, lives in a kind of Hottentot's lodging, which is
very unseemly.The Dessave must see that the inhabitants of the island
Delft are forbidden to cultivate cotton, and that the cotton trees now
found there are destroyed; because the number of horses is increasing
rapidly.The Dessave noticed only lately that large tracts of land of
two, three, and more miles are thus cultivated, in direct opposition
to the Company's orders.It seems they are not satisfied to be allowed
to increase the number of their cattle by thousands, all of which have
to derive their food from the island as well as the Company's horses,
but they must also now cultivate cotton, which cannot be tolerated
and must be strictly prohibited.Once the horses perished for want of
water; on one occasion they were shot on account of crooked legs; and
it would be gross carelessness if now they had to perish by starvation.The Passes of Colomboture, Catsjay, Ponneryn, Pyl, Elephant, and
Beschutter; Point Pedro; the Water fortress, Kayts or Hammenhiel;
Aripo; Elipoecareve; and Palwerain-cattoe.No particular remarks
are necessary with regard to these Passes and stations, except that
I would recommend the Dessave, when he has an opportunity to visit
the redoubts Pyl, Elephant, and Beschutter with an expert, to see in
what way they could be best connected.I think that out of all the
different proposals that of a strong and high wall would deserve
preference, if it be possible to collect the required materials,
as it would have to be two miles long.As to the other proposals,
such as that of making a fence of palmyra trees or thorns, or to
dig a moat, I think it would be labour in vain; but whatever is
done must be carried out without expense or trouble to the Company,
in compliance with the orders from the Supreme Government of India.The instructions with regard to the water tanks must be carried
out as far as possible.I agree with what is said here with regard to the public roads.That the elephant stalls and the churches should have been allowed
to fall into decay speaks badly for the way in which those concerned
have performed their duty; and it is a cause of dissatisfaction.The
orders for the stalls in Manaar must also be applied for here,
and repairs carried out as soon as possible.I have been informed
that there are many elephants scattered here and there far from each
other, while only one Vidana acts as chief overseer, so that he cannot
possibly attend to his duty properly.It has been observed that the
elephants should have more parias or men who provide their food.These
and other orders with regard to the animals should be carried out.No remarks are required with regard to this subject of thornback
skins, Amber de gris, Carret, and elephants' tusks.The General Paresse [80] has been held upon my orders on the last
of July.Three requests were made, two of which were so frivolous and
unimportant that I need not mention them here.The
third and more important one was that the duty on native cloth,
which at present is 25 per cent., might be reduced.It was agreed
that from the 31st December it would be only 20 per cent.I was in a
position to settle this matter at once, because orders had been already
received from Batavia that they could be reduced to 20 per cent.,
but no more.As shown in the annexed Memoir, the inhabitants are not
so badly off as they try to make us believe.The further instructions
in the annexed Memoir must be observed; and although I have verbally
ordered the Onderkoopman De Bitter to have the Pattangatyns appear
only twice instead of twelve times a year, as being an unbearable
inconvenience, the Dessave must see that this order is obeyed.He must
also make inquiries whether the work could be done by one Cannekappul,
and, if so, Jeronimus must be discharged.Conclusion.--The advice in this conclusion may be useful to Your
Honours.I confirm the list of members of the Political Council,
to whom the rule of this Commandement in the interest of the Company
is seriously recommended.Reports of all transactions must be sent
to Colombo.A.--No remarks are necessary in regard to the introduction.B.--In elucidation of the document sent by us with regard to the
opening of the harbours of the Kandyan King, as to how far the
instructions extend and how they are to be applied within the Company's
jurisdiction, nothing need be said here, as this will be sufficiently
clear from our successive letters from Colombo.We would only state
that it would seem as if Mr.Zwaardecroon had forgotten that the
prohibition against the clandestine export of cinnamon applies also
to the export of elephants, and that these may not be sold either
directly or indirectly by any one but the Company.C.--It is not apparent that our people would be allowed to
purchase areca-nut in Trincomalee on account of the opening of
the harbours.Zwaardecroon's plan has been submitted to Their
Excellencies at Batavia, who replied in their letters of December 12,
1695, and July 3, 1696, that some success might be obtained by getting
the nuts through the Wanny from the King's territory.An experiment
might be made (provided Their Excellencies approve) charging Rds.1/3
per ammunam, as is done in Colombo, Galle, Matura, &c. This toll could
be farmed out, and the farmers authorized to collect the duty at the
passes, no further duties being imposed whether the nuts are exported
or not.If the duty were levied only on the nuts that are exported,
the inhabitants who now buy them from the Company at Rds.6 per ammunam
would no longer do so, and this profit would be lost.Whether the
duty ought to be higher than Rds.The same
rule must be applied to pepper, cotton, &c., imported at the passes,
7 1/2 per cent.[81] This being paid,
the articles may be sold here, exported, or anything done as the
inhabitants please, without further liability to duty.D.--In the proclamation referred to here, in which free trade is
permitted at all harbours in Ceylon in the Company's territory,
it is clearly stated that the harbours may be freely entered with
merchandise, provided the customary duties are paid, and that only
the subjects of the Kandyan King are exempted from the payment of
these.It does not seem to me that this rule is in agreement with
the supposition that because of this free trade the duty on foreign
and native cloth would be abolished.Zwaardecroon had made
inquiries he would have been informed that, as far as the import of
foreign cloth is concerned, the duty is the same as that in Colombo and
Galle.The proposed change would apparently bring about an increase of
the alphandigo, but where then would be found the Rds.7,1 0 as duty
on the native and foreign cloths?I cannot see on what basis this
proposal is founded, and I therefore think that the Customs duty of
20 per cent.on the imported foreign cloths and the 20 per cent.for
the stamping of native cloths must be continued when, on the 31st
December next, the lease for the duty of 25 per cent.expires, the
more so as it has been pointed out in this Memoir wherever possible
that the inhabitants are increasing in prosperity.This agrees with
what was discussed at the general Paresse.With regard to the Moorish
merchants from Bengal, there would be no objection to the duty on the
cloths imported by them being fixed at 7 1/2 per cent., because they
have to make a much longer voyage than the merchants from Coromandel
and other places on the opposite coast; while we have to humour them
in order to induce them to provide us with rice.Moreover the Bengal
cloths are not very much in demand, and these people usually ask to
be paid in elephants, which do not cost the Company very much, rather
than in cash, as has been done again by the owner of the ship that is
here at present on behalf of the Bengal Nabob Caungaarekan.He also
complained of the duty of 20 per cent.and said he would pay no more
than the Company pays in Bengal.He said his master the Nabob would
be very angry, &c. We therefore considered whether the duty could not
be reduced to 7 1/2 per cent., as may be seen in the resolutions of
June 4 last.On December 12, 1695, a letter was received from Batavia
in answer to the difficulties raised by Mr.Zwaardecroon with regard
to these impositions, in which it is said that the Customs duty for
Bengal from the date of the license for free trade should be regulated
as it had been in olden times, with authority to remove difficulties
in their way and to give them redress where necessary.I found that
the duty paid by them formerly on these cloths was 7 1/2 per cent.,
both in Galle and here, and I therefore authorize Your Honours to
levy from them only that amount.This must be kept in mind at the
farming out of these revenues at the end of the year, in order to
prevent difficulties with the farmer, as happened only lately.I
trust, however, that the farming out will not yield less than other
years.Meantime, and before any other vessels from Bengal arrive, the
approbation of Their Excellencies at Batavia must be obtained with
regard to this matter, so that alterations may be made according to
their directions without any difficulty.E.--I must confess that I do not understand how the subject of
free trade can be brought forward again as being opposed to the
Company's interests, as is done again with regard to the 24 casks
of coconut oil which the inhabitants have to deliver to the Company,
which are properly paid for and are not required for the purpose of
sale but for the use of the Company's servants, or how any one dares
to maintain that the lawful sovereign who extends his graciousness
and favours over his subjects and neighbours would be tied down and
prejudiced by such rules.It is true that the coconut trees in Matura
are required for the elephants, but in Galle and Colombo it is not so;
but the largest number of trees there is utilized for the drawing of
surie [82] for arrack, &c. It is true that some nuts are exported,
but only a small quantity, while the purchasers or transporters have
to sell one-third of what they export to the Company at Rds.2 a
thousand, while they must cost them at least Rds.Out of these we
had the oil pressed ourselves, and this went largely to supplement
the requirements for local consumption, which are very large, since
the vessels also have to be supplied, because as a matter of economy
the native harpuis (resin) has been largely used for rubbing over
the ships, so as to save the Dutch resin as much as possible, and
for the manufacture of this native resin a large quantity of oil is
required.Your Honours must therefore continue to have all suitable
casks filled with oil, and send to Colombo all that can be spared
after the required quantity has been sent to Coromandel, Trincomalee,
and Batticaloa, reserving what is necessary for the next pearl fishery
and the use of the Commandement.In order to avoid difficulties, Your
Honours are required to send to Colombo yearly (until we send orders
to the contrary) 12 casks of coconut oil and 2 casks of margosa oil,
which are expected without failure.For the rest we refer to what is
said under the heading of Coconut Trees.F.--This form for a passport was sent for no other purpose but that
it should be introduced according to instructions.G.--There is sufficient time yet for the opening of the road from
Putulang to Mantotte.I am well pleased with the work of the Dessave,
and approve of the orders given by him to the Toepas Adigar Rodrigo,
and the various reports submitted by him.In these he states that the
roads are now in good condition, while on June 5, when 34 elephants
arrived from Colombo, on this side of Putulang nothing had been done
yet, and even on July 16 and 17 when His Excellency the Governor
passed part of that road the work had advanced but very little.I
therefore sent on the 14th instant the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, who
had successfully transported the animals from Colombo to Putulang,
and is a man who can be depended upon, with two surveyors to see
that the roads, which were narrow and extraordinary crooked, were
widened to 2 roods and straightened somewhat in the forest, and to
cut roads leading to the water tanks.Sixty Wallias or wood-cutters,
150 coolies, and 25 Lascoreens were sent to complete this work, so
that in future there will be no difficulties of this kind, except
that the dry tanks must be deepened.Isaacsz on this
subject on my return.On account of his shameful neglect and lying
and for other well-known reasons I have dismissed the Adigar Domingo
Rodrigo as unworthy to serve the Company again anywhere or at any
time, and have appointed in his place Alexander Anamale, who has
been an Adigar for many years in the same place.In giving him this
appointment I as usual obtained the verbal and written opinions of
several of the Commandeurs, who stated that he had on the whole been
vigilant and diligent in his office, but was discharged last year
by the Commission from Colombo without any reasons being known here,
to make room for the said incapable Domingo Rodrigo, who was Adigar of
Ponneryn at the time.I suppose he was taken away from there to please
the Wannia chiefs Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarene,
whose eldest son Gaspar, junior, was appointed Master of the Hunt,
as stated under the heading of the Wanny and Ponneryn.With regard to
the instructions to compile various lists, this order must be carried
out in so far as they are now complete.With regard to the significant
statement that the Honourable Company does not possess any lands in
Jaffnapatam, and that there is not the smallest piece of land known
of which the Company does not receive taxes, and that it therefore
would be impossible to compile a list of lands belonging to or given
away on behalf of the Company, and in case of the latter by whom, to
whom, when, why, &c., I am at a loss to follow the reasoning, and it
seems to me that there is something wrong in it, because the protocols
at the Secretariate here show that during the years 1695, 1696, and
1697 five pieces of land were given away by Mr.Zwaardecroon himself,
and this without the least knowledge or consent of His Excellency the
Governor; while, on the other hand, I know that there are still many
fields in the Provinces which are lying waste and have never been
cultivated; so that they belong to the Company and no one else.At
present the inhabitants send their cattle to these lands to graze,
as the animals would otherwise destroy their cultivated fields,
but in the beginning all lands were thus lying waste.With a view
to find out how many more of these lands there are here, and where
they are situated, I have instructed the Thombo-keeper, Mr.Bolscho,
to draw up a list of them from the newly compiled Thombo, beginning
with the two Provinces Willigamme and Waddamoraatschie, the Thombo of
which is completed; the other three Provinces must be taken up later
on.Perhaps the whole thing could be done on one sheet of paper, and
it need not take two years, nor do we want the whole Thombo in several
reams of imperial paper.Bolscho
return from their work at the road to Putulang, this work must be
taken in hand and the list submitted as soon as possible.I also do
not see the difficulty of compiling a list of all the small pieces
of land which, in the compiling of the new Thombo, were discovered on
re-survey to have been unlawfully taken possession of.Since my arrival
here I had two such lists prepared for the Provinces Willigamme and
Waddamoraatschie covering two sheets of paper each.This work was well
worth the trouble, as the pieces of cultivated land in the Province
of Willigamme amounted to 299,977 1/2 and in Waddamoraatschie to
128,013 roods, making altogether 427,990 1/2 roods.These, it is
said, might be sold to the present owners for about Rds.I
think it would be best if these lands were publicly leased out, so
that the people could show their deeds.I think this would not be
unreasonable, and consider it would be sufficient favour to them,
since they have had the use of the lands for so many years without
ever paying taxes.When the new Thombo is compiled for the Provinces
of Patchelepalle and Timmeraatsche and the six inhabited islands,
some lands will surely be discovered there also.H.--It is in compliance with instructions, and with my approbation,
that the accounts with the purchasers of elephants in Golconda and
with the Brahmin Timmerza have been settled.For various reasons which
it is not necessary to state here he is never to be employed as the
Company's broker again, the more so as the old custom of selling the
elephants by public auction has been reintroduced this year, as has
been mentioned in detail under the heading of Trade.Your Honours must comply with our orders contained in the letter
of May 4 last from Colombo, as to how the cheques from Golconda are
to be drawn up and entered in the books.With regard to the special
request of the merchants that the amount due to them might be paid in
cash or elephants through the said Timmerza to their attorneys, this
does not appear in their letter of December 7, 1696, from Golconda,
but the principal purchasers of elephants request that the Company
may assist the people sent by them in the obtaining of vessels, and,
if necessary, give them an advance of 300 or 400 Pagodas, stating
that these had been the only reasons why they had consented to deal
with the said Timmerza.In our letter of May 4 Your Honours have been
informed that His Excellency Laurens Pit, Governor of Coromandel, has
consented at our request to communicate with you whenever necessary, as
the means of the Golconda merchants who desire to obtain advances from
the Company, and how much could be advanced to their attorneys.Such
cases must be carefully dealt with, but up to the present no such
request has been made, which is so much the better.I.--The 20,000 paras or 866 2/3 lasts of nely applied for from
Negapatam will come in useful here, although since the date of this
Memoir or the 6th of June the Council agreed to purchase on behalf
of the Company the 125 1/5 lasts of rice brought here in the Bengal
ship of the Nabob of Kateck Caim Caareham, because even this does
not bring the quantity in store to the 600 lasts which are considered
necessary for Jaffnapatam, as is shown under the heading of provisions
and ammunition.It will be necessary to encourage the people from
Bengal in this trade, as has been repeatedly stated.K.--The petition mentioned here, submitted by the bargemen of the
Company's pontons, stating that they have been made to pay all that
had been lost on various cargoes of rice above one per cent., that they
had not been fairly dealt with in the measuring, &c., deserves serious
investigation.It must be seen to that these people are not made to
refund any loss for which they are not responsible and which they could
not prevent, and the annexed recommendation should be followed as far
as reasonable.The point of the unfair measuring must be especially
attended to, since such conduct would deserve severe correction.L.--The instructions given here with regard to the receipt of Pagodas
must be carried out, but none but Negapatam or Palicatte Pagodas
must be received or circulated.Our instructions under the heading
of Golden Pagodas must be observed.M.--The Dessave de Bitter is to employ the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz
in the Public Works Department on his return from Putulang after the
transport of the elephants, being a capable man for this work.The most
necessary work must be carried out first.van Keulen and Petitfilz, presented the son of the deceased
Don Philip Sangerepulle with a horse and a sombreer [83] by order
of His Excellency the Governor, apparently because he was the chief
of the highest caste, or on account of his father's services.Much
has been said against the father, but nothing has been proved, and
indeed greater scoundrels might be found on investigation.Zwaardecroon, because no act of authority was shown
to him, has rejected this presentation and ordered the Political
Council here from the yacht "Bekenstyn" on March 29 of this year to
demand back from the youth this horse and sombreer.This having been
done without my knowledge and consent, I countermand this order, and
expect Your Honours to carry out the orders of His late Excellency the
Governor.[84] With regard to the administration of this Commandement,
I have stated what was necessary under the heading of the Form of
Government at the conclusion of the Memoir to which I herewith refer.I
will only add here that since then I have had reason to doubt whether
my instructions with regard to the Political Council and the manner
in which the administration is to be carried out has been properly
understood.I reiterate therefore that the Dessave de Bitter will be
looked upon and respected as the Chief in the Commandement during
the absence of the Commandeur, and that to him is entrusted the
duty of convening the meetings both of the Political Council and of
the Court of Justice.Also that he will pass and sign all orders,
such as those for the Warehouses, the Treasury, the Workshop, the
Arsenal, and other of the Company's effects.Further, that when he
stays over night in the Castle, he is to give out the watch-word and
see to the opening and the closing of the gates, which, in the event
of his absence, is deputed to the Captain.The Dessave will see that
order and discipline are maintained, especially among the military,
and also that they are regularly drilled.He is further to receive
the daily reports, not only of the military but also of all master
workmen, &c.; in short, he is to carry out all work just as if the
Commandeur were present.Recommending thus far and thus briefly these
instructions as a guidance to the Administrateur and the Political
Council, and praying God's blessing--


I remain, Sirs, etc.,

boiada, a herd of oxen.[14] Palm leaves dressed for thatching or matting, from the Malay
kajang, palm leaves.[16] These figures are taken from the original MS.It is difficult
to explain the discrepancy in the total.[17] This is the pure Arabic word, from which the word Shroff in our
local vocabulary is derived.[20] A variation in spelling of chicos.[21] Commandeur Floris Blom died at Jaffna on July 3, 1694, and is
buried inside the church.[22] Kernels of the palmyra nut.[23] An irrigation headman in the Northern and Southern Province.[24] Probably from kaiya, a party of workman doing work without wages
for common advantage.[25] A corruption of the Tamil word pattankatti.The word is applied
to certain natives in authority at the pearl fisheries.[27] From Tamil tarahu, brokerage.Here applied apparently to the
person employed in the transaction.[28] The juice of the palmyra fruit dried into cakes.[34] Bananas: the word is in use in Java.[36] This has been translated into English, and forms an Appendix to
the Memoir of Governor Ryckloff van Goens, junior, to be had at the
Government Record Office, Colombo.[37] The full value of the rix-dollar was 60 Dutch stivers; but in
the course of time its local value appears to have depreciated, and as
a denomination of currency it came to represent only 48 stivers.Yet
to preserve a fictitious identity with the original rix-dollar, the
local mint turned out stivers of lower value, of which 60 were made
to correspond to 48 of the Dutch stivers.[38] In China a picol is equal to 133-1/3 lb.[39] Probably the Malay word bahar.The
word is also found spelt baar, plural baren, in the Dutch Records.A
baar is equal to 600 lb.[40] Florins, stivers, abassis.[41] These are now known as cheniyas.[42] Plural of onderkoopman.[45] Pardao, a popular name among the Portuguese for a gold and
afterwards for a silver coin.That here referred to was perhaps the
pagoda, which Valentyn makes equal to 6 guilders.[46] A copy of these is among the Archives in Colombo.[47] The Militia, composed of Vryburgers as officers, and townsmen
of a certain age in the ranks.[48] Pen-men, who also had military duties to perform.[49] The Artisan class in the Company's service.These were probably small boats rowed
by men.[53] Cakes of palmyra sugar.[56] This is what he says: "It was my intention to have a new
drawbridge built before the Castle, with a small water mill on one
side to keep the canals always full of sea water; and a miniature
model has already been made."[57] He died on December 15, 1691, on board the ship Drechterland on
a voyage from Ceylon to Surat.[61] The church was completed in 1706, during the administration of
Commandeur Adam van der Duyn.[62] "Van geen oude schoenen te verwerpen, voor dat men met nieuwe
voorsien is."[64] This is unfortunately no longer forthcoming, having probably been
destroyed or lost with the rest of the Jaffna records; and there is
no copy in the Archives at Colombo.But an older report of Commandeur
Blom dated 1690 will be translated for this series.[66] The figures are as given in the MS.It is difficult to reconcile
these equivalents with the rate of 3 guilders to the rix-dollar.The
denominations given under florins (guilders) are as follows:--16
abassis = 1 stiver; 20 stivers = 1 florin.[68] Hendrick Zwaardecroon.[71] A fanam, according to Valentyn's table, was equal to 5 stivers.[72] During the early years of the Dutch rule in Ceylon there was,
besides the Governor, a Commandeur resident in Colombo.[73] An old Dutch measure for coal and lime, equal to 32 bushels.[75] A mixties was one of European paternity and native on the
mother's side.[76] Portuguese descendants of the lower class.[77] The term "qualified officers," here and elsewhere, probably
refers to those who received their appointment direct from the supreme
authorities at Batavia.[79] The men who attend on the elephants, feed them, &c.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Memoir of Hendrick Zwaardecroon,

there's no hurry with you Scotchmen.My boy has been sick all night, and
I've never had one wink of sleep.You might have come a little quicker,
that's all I've got to say.'"We've mair tae dae in Drumtochty than attend tae every bairn that hes a
sair stomach,' and a' saw MacLure wes roosed.Our doctor at home always says to
Mrs.'Opps "Look on me as a family friend, Mrs.'Opps, and send for me
though it be only a headache."'"'He'd be mair sparin' o' his offers if he hed four and twenty mile tae
look aifter.There's naethin' wrang wi' yir laddie but greed.Gie him a
gude dose o' castor oil and stop his meat for a day, an' he 'ill be a'
richt the morn.'"'He 'ill not take castor oil, doctor.We have given up those barbarous
medicines.'"'Whatna kind o' medicines hae ye noo in the Sooth?'MacLure, we're homoeopathists, and I've my little
chest here,' and oot Hopps comes wi' his boxy."'Let's see't,' an' MacLure sits doon and taks oot the bit bottles, and
he reads the names wi' a lauch every time."'Belladonna; did ye ever hear the like?Weel, ma mannie,' he says tae Hopps, 'it's a fine
ploy, and ye 'ill better gang on wi' the Nux till it's dune, and gie him
ony ither o' the sweeties he fancies."'Noo, Hillocks, a' maun be aff tae see Drumsheugh's grieve, for he's
doon wi' the fever, and it's tae be a teuch fecht.A' hinna time tae
wait for dinner; gie me some cheese an' cake in ma haund, and Jess 'ill
tak a pail o' meal an' water."'Fee; a'm no wantin' yir fees, man; wi' that boxy ye dinna need a
doctor; na, na, gie yir siller tae some puir body, Maister Hopps,' an'
he was doon the road as hard as he cud lick."His fees were pretty much what the folk chose to give him, and he
collected them once a year at Kildrummie fair."Well, doctor, what am a' awin' ye for the wife and bairn?Ye 'ill need
three notes for that nicht ye stayed in the hoose an' a' the veesits.""Havers," MacLure would answer, "prices are low, a'm hearing; gie's
thirty shillings.""No, a'll no, or the wife 'ill tak ma ears off," and it was settled for
two pounds.Lord Kilspindie gave him a free house and fields, and one
way or other, Drumsheugh told me, the doctor might get in about L150.a year, out of which he had to pay his old housekeeper's wages and a
boy's, and keep two horses, besides the cost of instruments and books,
which he bought through a friend in Edinburgh with much judgment.There was only one man who ever complained of the doctor's charges, and
that was the new farmer of Milton, who was so good that he was above
both churches, and held a meeting in his barn.(It was Milton the Glen
supposed at first to be a Mormon, but I can't go into that now.)He
offered MacLure a pound less than he asked, and two tracts, whereupon
MacLure expressed his opinion of Milton, both from a theological and
social standpoint, with such vigor and frankness that an attentive
audience of Drumtochty men could hardly contain themselves.Jamie Soutar
was selling his pig at the time, and missed the meeting, but he hastened
to condole with Milton, who was complaining everywhere of the doctor's
language.[Illustration]

"Ye did richt tae resist him; it 'ill maybe roose the Glen tae mak a
stand; he fair hands them in bondage."Thirty shillings for twal veesits, and him no mair than seeven mile
awa, an' a'm telt there werena mair than four at nicht."Ye 'ill hae the sympathy o' the Glen, for a' body kens yir as free wi'
yir siller as yir tracts."Wes't 'Beware o' gude warks' ye offered him?Man, ye choose it weel,

an' the Pharisees didna think muckle o' his chance aither in this warld
or that which is tae come."Joe's response showed his entire self-engrossment."If he dies, I'm a murderer.""He's not going to die," said K. stoutly.At four o'clock in the morning he left the car at the garage and walked
around to the little house.He had had no sleep for forty-five hours;
his eyes were sunken in his head; the skin over his temples looked drawn
and white.His clothes were wrinkled; the soft hat he habitually wore
was white with the dust of the road.As he opened the hall door, Christine stirred in the room beyond.Why in the world aren't you in bed?""Palmer has just come home in a terrible rage.He says he's been robbed
of a thousand dollars.""He doesn't know, or says he doesn't.In the dim hall light he realized that her face was strained and set.The tender words broke down the last barrier of her self-control.She held her arms out to him, and because he was very tired and lonely,
and because more than anything else in the world just then he needed a
woman's arms, he drew her to him and held her close, his cheek to her
hair.Surely there must be some
happiness for us somewhere."But the next moment he let her go and stepped back."I shouldn't have
done that--You know how it is with me.""I'm afraid it will always be Sidney."CHAPTER XXVIII


Johnny Rosenfeld was dead.'s skill had not sufficed to save
him.The operation had been a marvel, but the boy's long-sapped strength
failed at the last.K., set of face, stayed with him to the end.The boy did not know he was
going.He roused from the coma and smiled up at Le Moyne."I've got a hunch that I can move my right foot," he said."Brake foot, clutch foot," said Johnny, and closed his eyes again.K. had forbidden the white screens, that outward symbol of death.So the ward had no suspicion, nor had the boy.It was Sunday, and from the chapel far below
came the faint singing of a hymn.When Johnny spoke again he did not
open his eyes.I'll put in a word for you whenever
I get a chance.""Yes, put in a word for me," said K. huskily.He felt that Johnny would be a good mediator--that whatever he, K., had
done of omission or commission, Johnny's voice before the Tribunal would
count.The lame young violin-player came into the ward.She had cherished a
secret and romantic affection for Max Wilson, and now he was in the
hospital and ill.So she wore the sacrificial air of a young nun and
played "The Holy City."Johnny was close on the edge of his long sleep by that time, and very
comfortable."Tell her nix on the sob stuff," he complained."Ask her to play 'I'm
twenty-one and she's eighteen.'"'s quick explanation she changed to
the staccato air."Ask her if she'll come a little nearer; I can't hear her."So she moved to the foot of the bed, and to the gay little tune Johnny
began his long sleep.But first he asked K. a question: "Are you sure
I'm going to walk, Mr."I give you my solemn word," said K. huskily, "that you are going to be
better than you have ever been in your life."It was K. who, seeing he would no longer notice, ordered the screens to
be set around the bed, K. who drew the coverings smooth and folded the
boy's hands over his breast."It was the result of a man's damnable folly," said K. grimly.The immediate result of his death was that K., who had gained some of
his faith in himself on seeing Wilson on the way to recovery, was beset
by his old doubts.What right had he to arrogate to himself again powers
of life and death?Over and over he told himself that there had been no
carelessness here, that the boy would have died ultimately, that he
had taken the only chance, that the boy himself had known the risk and
begged for it.And now came a question that demanded immediate answer.Wilson would
be out of commission for several months, probably.And he wanted K. to take over his work.You're not thinking about going back to that
ridiculous gas office, are you?""I had some thought of going to Cuba."You've done a marvelous thing; I lie
here and listen to the staff singing your praises until I'm sick of your
name!And now, because a boy who wouldn't have lived anyhow--"

"That's not it," K. put in hastily.I guess I could do
it and get away with it as well as the average.All that deters me--I've
never told you, have I, why I gave up before?"K. was walking restlessly about the
room, as was his habit when troubled."I've heard the gossip; that's all.""When you recognized me that night on the balcony, I told you I'd lost
my faith in myself, and you said the whole affair had been gone over
at the State Society.As a matter of fact, the Society knew of only two
cases."Even at that--"

"You know what I always felt about the profession, Max.We went into
that more than once in Berlin.When I left Lorch and built my own hospital, I hadn't
a doubt of myself.And because I was getting results I got a lot of
advertising.I found I was making
enough out of the patients who could pay to add a few free wards.I want
to tell you now, Wilson, that the opening of those free wards was the
greatest self-indulgence I ever permitted myself.I'd seen so much
careless attention given the poor--well, never mind that.It was almost
three years ago that things began to go wrong.All this doesn't influence me, Edwardes."We had a system in the operating-room as perfect as I
could devise it.I never finished an operation without having my first
assistant verify the clip and sponge count.But that first case died
because a sponge had been left in the operating field.You know how
those things go; you can't always see them, and one goes by the count,
after reasonable caution.Then I lost another case in the same way--a
free case."As well as I could tell, the precautions had not been relaxed.I was
doing from four to six cases a day.After the second one I almost went
crazy.I made up my mind, if there was ever another, I'd give up and go
away."When the last case died, a free case again, I
performed my own autopsy.I allowed only my first assistant in the room.He was almost as frenzied as I was.When I
told him I was going away, he offered to take the blame himself, to
say he had closed the incision.He tried to make me think he was
responsible.I've sent them money from time to time.I used to sit and think
about the children he left, and what would become of them.The ironic
part of it was that, for all that had happened, I was busier all the
time.Men were sending me cases from all over the country.It was either
stay and keep on working, with that chance, or--quit."But if
you had stayed, and taken extra precautions--"

"We'd taken every precaution we knew."K. stood, his tall figure outlined
against the window.Far off, in the children's ward, children were
laughing; from near by a very young baby wailed a thin cry of protest
against life; a bell rang constantly.'s mind was busy with the
past--with the day he decided to give up and go away, with the months of
wandering and homelessness, with the night he had come upon the Street
and had seen Sidney on the doorstep of the little house.You had an enemy somewhere--on your
staff, probably.This profession of ours is a big one, but you know its
jealousies.Let a man get his shoulders above the crowd, and the pack
is after him.""Mixed figure, but you know what I
mean."He had had that gift of the big man everywhere, in
every profession, of securing the loyalty of his followers.He would
have trusted every one of them with his life."You're going to do it, of course."To stay on, to be near Sidney, perhaps to stand
by as Wilson's best man when he was married--it turned him cold.But he
did not give a decided negative.The sick man was flushed and growing
fretful; it would not do to irritate him."Give me another day on it," he said at last.Max's injury had been productive of good, in one way.It had brought the
two brothers closer together.In the mornings Max was restless until
Dr.When he came, he brought books in the shabby bag--his
beloved Burns, although he needed no book for that, the "Pickwick
Papers," Renan's "Lives of the Disciples."Very often Max world doze
off; at the cessation of Dr.Ed's sonorous voice the sick man would stir
fretfully and demand more.But because he listened to everything without
discrimination, the older man came to the conclusion that it was the
companionship that counted.It reminded him of
Max's boyhood, when he had read to Max at night.For once in the last
dozen years, he needed him.What in blazes makes you stop every five minutes?"Ed, who had only stopped to bite off the end of a stogie to hold in
his cheek, picked up his book in a hurry, and eyed the invalid over it.Have you any idea what I'm
reading?"For ten minutes I've been reading across both pages!"Max laughed, and suddenly put out his hand.Demonstrations of affection
were so rare with him that for a moment Dr.Then, rather
sheepishly, he took it."When I get out," Max said, "we'll have to go out to the White Springs
again and have supper."Morning and evening, Sidney went to Max's room.In the morning she only
smiled at him from the doorway.In the evening she went to him after
prayers.The shooting had been a closed book between them.At first, when he
began to recover, he tried to talk to her about it.She was very gentle with him, but very firm."I know how it happened, Max," she said--"about Joe's mistake and all
that.The rest can wait until you are much better."If there had been any change in her manner to him, he would not
have submitted so easily, probably.But she was as tender as ever,
unfailingly patient, prompt to come to him and slow to leave.After a
time he began to dread reopening the subject.She seemed so effectually
to have closed it.And, after all, what good could he
do his cause by pleading it?The fact was there, and Sidney knew it.On the day when K. had told Max his reason for giving up his work, Max
was allowed out of bed for the first time.A box of
red roses came that day from the girl who had refused him a year or more
ago.He viewed them with a carelessness that was half assumed.The news had traveled to the Street that he was to get up that day.Early that morning the doorkeeper had opened the door to a gentleman
who did not speak, but who handed in a bunch of early chrysanthemums and
proceeded to write, on a pad he drew from his pocket:--

"From Mrs.McKee's family and guests, with their congratulations on your
recovery, and their hope that they will see you again soon.If their
ends are clipped every day and they are placed in ammonia water, they
will last indefinitely."Sidney spent her hour with Max that evening as
usual.His big chair had been drawn close to a window, and she found him
there, looking out.But this time, instead of letting
her draw away, he put out his arms and caught her to him."Very glad, indeed," she said soberly.You ought to smile; your
mouth--"

"I am almost always tired; that's all, Max.""Aren't you going to let me make love to you at all?"I was looking for the paper to read to you.""You don't like me to touch you any more.The fear of agitating him brought her quickly.For a moment he was
appeased.He lifted first one
hand and then the other to his lips."If you mean about Carlotta, I forgave that long ago."Many a woman would have held that over him for years--not that
he had done anything really wrong on that nightmare excursion.But so
many women are exigent about promises."We needn't discuss that to-night, Max."Let me tell Ed
that you will marry me soon.Then, when I go away, I'll take you with
me.""Can't we talk things over when you are stronger?"Her tone caught his attention, and turned him a little white.He faced
her to the window, so that the light fell full on her.She had meant to wait; but, with his keen eyes
on her, she could not dissemble."I am going to make you very unhappy for a little while.""I've had a lot of time to think.If you had really wanted me, Max--"

"My God, of course I want you!"I think you care for me--"

"I love you!I swear I never loved any other woman as I love you."Suddenly he remembered that he had also sworn to put Carlotta out of his
life.He knew that Sidney remembered, too; but she gave no sign.But there would always be other women, Max."If you loved me you could do anything with me."By the way her color leaped, he knew he had struck fire.All
his conjectures as to how Sidney would take the knowledge of his
entanglement with Carlotta had been founded on one major premise--that
she loved him."But, good Heavens, Sidney, you do care for me, don't you?""I'm afraid I don't, Max; not enough."After one look at his face, she
spoke to the window.To me you were the best
and greatest man that ever lived.I--when I said my prayers, I--But that
doesn't matter.When the Lamb--that's one
of the internes, you know--nicknamed you the 'Little Tin God,' I was
angry.You could never be anything little to me, or do anything that
wasn't big."No man could live up to that, Sidney."Now I know that I
didn't care for you, really, at all.I built up an idol and worshiped
it.I always saw you through a sort of haze.You were operating, with
everybody standing by, saying how wonderful it was.Or you were coming
to the wards, and everything was excitement, getting ready for you.It isn't that I think you
are wicked.It's just that I never loved the real you, because I never
knew you."When he remained silent, she made an attempt to justify herself."I'd known very few men," she said."I came into the hospital, and for
a time life seemed very terrible.There were wickednesses I had never
heard of, and somebody always paying for them.Then you would come in, and a lot of them you cured and sent out.You gave them their chance, don't you see?Until I knew about Carlotta,
you always meant that to me.In the nurses' parlor, a few feet down the
corridor, the nurses were at prayers."The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want," read the Head, her voice
calm with the quiet of twilight and the end of the day."He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the
still waters."The nurses read the response a little slowly, as if they, too, were
weary."Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death--"

The man in the chair stirred.He had come through the valley of the
shadow, and for what?He said to himself savagely
that they would better have let him die."You say you never loved me
because you never knew me.Isn't it possible
that the man you, cared about, who--who did his best by people and all
that--is the real me?"He missed something out of her eyes, the
sort of luminous, wistful look with which she had been wont to survey
his greatness.Measured by this new glance, so clear, so appraising, he
sank back into his chair."The man who did his best is quite real.You have always done the best
in your work; you always will.But the other is a part of you too, Max.Even if I cared, I would not dare to run the risk."Under the window rang the sharp gong of a city patrol-wagon.It rumbled
through the gates back to the courtyard, where its continued clamor
summoned white-coated orderlies.Sidney, chin lifted, listened
carefully.If it was a case for her, the elevator would go up to the
operating-room.With a renewed sense of loss, Max saw that already she
had put him out of her mind.The call to service was to her a call to
battle.Her sensitive nostrils quivered; her young figure stood erect,
alert.She took a step toward the door, hesitated, came back, and put a light
hand on his shoulder.She had kissed him lightly on the cheek before he knew what she intended
to do.So passionless was the little caress that, perhaps more than
anything else, it typified the change in their relation.When the door closed behind her, he saw that she had left her ring
on the arm of his chair.He held it to his lips with a quick gesture.In all his
successful young life he had never before felt the bitterness of
failure.He didn't want to live--he wouldn't live.He would--

His eyes, lifted from the ring, fell on the red glow of the roses that
had come that morning.Even in the half light, they glowed with fiery
color.With the left he settled his collar and
soft silk tie.K. saw Carlotta that evening for the last time.Katie brought word to
him, where he was helping Harriet close her trunk,--she was on her way
to Europe for the fall styles,--that he was wanted in the lower hall.she said, closing the door behind her by way of caution."And
a good thing for her she's not from the alley.The way those people beg
off you is a sin and a shame, and it's not at home you're going to be to
them from now on."So K. had put on his coat and, without so much as a glance in Harriet's
mirror, had gone down the stairs.She
stood under the chandelier, and he saw at once the ravages that trouble
had made in her.She was a dead white, and she looked ten years older
than her age.Now and then, when some one came to him for help, which was generally
money, he used Christine's parlor, if she happened to be out.So now,
finding the door ajar, and the room dark, he went in and turned on the
light."Come in here; we can talk better."She did not sit down at first; but, observing that her standing kept him
on his feet, she sat finally."You were to come," K. encouraged her, "to see if we couldn't plan
something for you."If it's another hospital--and I don't want to stay here, in the city.""You like surgical work, don't you?""Before we settle this, I'd better tell you what I'm thinking of.You know, of course, that I closed my hospital.I--a series of things
happened, and I decided I was in the wrong business.That wouldn't be
important, except for what it leads to.They are trying to persuade me
to go back, and--I'm trying to persuade myself that I'm fit to go back.You see,"--his tone was determinedly cheerful, "my faith in myself has
been pretty nearly gone.When one loses that, there isn't much left.""Well, I had and I hadn't.I'm not going to worry you about that.My
offer is this: We'll just try to forget about--about Schwitter's and all
the rest, and if I go back I'll take you on in the operating-room.""Well, I can ask you to come back, can't I?"He smiled at her
encouragingly."Are you sure you understand about Max Wilson and myself?""Don't you think you are taking a risk?""Every one makes mistakes now and then, and loving women have made
mistakes since the world began.Most people live in glass houses, Miss
Harrison.And don't make any mistake about this: people can always come
back.But the offer
he made was too alluring.It meant reinstatement, another chance, when
she had thought everything was over.After all, why should she damn
herself?She would work her finger-ends off for him.She would make it up to him in other ways.But she could not tell him
and lose everything."Shall we go back and start over again?"CHAPTER XXIX


Late September had come, with the Street, after its summer indolence
taking up the burden of the year.At eight-thirty and at one the school
bell called the children.Little girls in pig-tails, carrying freshly
sharpened pencils, went primly toward the school, gathering, comet
fashion, a tail of unwilling brothers as they went.Le Moyne had promised
the baseball club a football outfit, rumor said, but would not coach
them himself this year.Le Moyne
intended to go away.The Street had been furiously busy for a month.The cobblestones had
gone, and from curb to curb stretched smooth asphalt.The fascination
of writing on it with chalk still obsessed the children.Every few yards
was a hop-scotch diagram.Generally speaking, too, the Street had put up
new curtains, and even, here and there, had added a coat of paint.To this general excitement the strange case of Mr.One day he was in the gas office, making out statements that
were absolutely ridiculous.(What with no baking all last month, and
every Sunday spent in the country, nobody could have used that amount of
gas.They could come and take their old meter out!)And the next there
was the news that Mr.Le Moyne had been only taking a holiday in the
gas office,--paying off old scores, the barytone at Mrs.McKee's
hazarded!--and that he was really a very great surgeon and had saved Dr.The Street, which was busy at the time deciding whether to leave the old
sidewalks or to put down cement ones, had one evening of mad excitement
over the matter,--of K., not the sidewalks,--and then had accepted the
new situation.What was
the matter with things, anyhow?Here was Christine's marriage, which had
promised so well,--awnings and palms and everything,--turning out badly.True, Palmer Howe was doing better, but he would break out again.And
Johnny Rosenfeld was dead, so that his mother came on washing-days,
and brought no cheery gossip; but bent over her tubs dry-eyed and
silent--even the approaching move to a larger house failed to thrill
her.She was
married now, of course; but the Street did not tolerate such a reversal
of the usual processes as Tillie had indulged in.McKee
severely for having been, so to speak, and accessory after the fact.The Street made a resolve to keep K., if possible.If he had shown
any "high and mightiness," as they called it, since the change in his
estate, it would have let him go without protest.But when a man is the
real thing,--so that the newspapers give a column to his having been
in the city almost two years,--and still goes about in the same shabby
clothes, with the same friendly greeting for every one, it demonstrates
clearly, as the barytone put it, that "he's got no swelled head on him;
that's sure.""Anybody can see by the way he drives that machine of Wilson's that he's
been used to a car--likely a foreign one.Still the barytone, who was almost as fond of conversation as
of what he termed "vocal."Do you notice the way
he takes Dr.The old boy's
tickled to death."A little later, K., coming up the Street as he had that first day, heard
the barytone singing:--

      "Home is the hunter, home from the hill,
       And the sailor, home from sea."The Street seemed to stretch out its arms to
him.The ailanthus tree waved in the sunlight before the little house.Tree and house were old; September had touched them.Christine sat
sewing on the balcony.A boy with a piece of chalk was writing something
on the new cement under the tree.He stood back, head on one side, when
he had finished, and inspected his work.K. caught him up from behind,
and, swinging him around--

"Hey!""Don't you know better than to write all over
the street?"Aw, lemme down, Mr."You tell the boys that if I find this street scrawled over any more,
the picnic's off."Go and spend some of that chalk energy of yours in school."There was a certain tenderness in his hands, as in
his voice, when he dealt with children.'s eye fell on what he had written on the cement.At a certain part of his career, the child of such a neighborhood as the
Street "cancels" names.He does it as he
whittles his school desk or tries to smoke the long dried fruit of the
Indian cigar tree.So K. read in chalk an the smooth street:--

     Max Wilson Marriage.[Note: the a, l, s, and n of "Max Wilson" are crossed through, as are
the S, d, n, and a of "Sidney Page"]

The childish scrawl stared up at him impudently, a sacred thing profaned
by the day.The barytone was still singing;
but now it was "I'm twenty-one, and she's eighteen."It was a cheerful
air, as should be the air that had accompanied Johnny Rosenfeld to his
long sleep.After all, the
Street meant for him not so much home as it meant Sidney.And now,
before very long, that book of his life, like others, would have to be
closed.He turned and went heavily into the little house.Christine called to him from her little balcony:--

"I thought I heard your step outside.K. went through the parlor and stood in the long window.His steady eyes
looked down at her."I see very little of you now," she complained.And, when he did not
reply immediately: "Have you made any definite plans, K.?""I shall do Max's work until he is able to take hold again.After
that--"

"You will go away?"I am getting a good many letters, one way and another.I
suppose, now I'm back in harness, I'll stay.I'd
go back there--they want me.But it seems so futile, Christine, to leave
as I did, because I felt that I had no right to go on as things were;
and now to crawl back on the strength of having had my hand forced, and
to take up things again, not knowing that I've a bit more right to do it
than when I left!"He took an uneasy turn up and down the balcony.I tell you,
Christine, it isn't possible."Her thoughts had flown ahead to the
little house without K., to days without his steps on the stairs or the
heavy creak of his big chair overhead as he dropped into it.But perhaps it would be better if he went.She had no expectation of happiness, but, somehow or other, she must
build on the shaky foundation of her marriage a house of life, with
resignation serving for content, perhaps with fear lurking always.Misery implied affection, and her
love for Palmer was quite dead."Sidney will be here this afternoon.""Has it occurred to you, K., that Sidney is not very happy?""I'm not quite sure, but I think I know.She's lost faith in Max, and
she's not like me.I--I knew about Palmer before I married him.It's all rather hideous--I needn't go into it.I was afraid to
back out; it was just before my wedding.But Sidney has more character
than I have.Max isn't what she thought he was, and I doubt whether
she'll marry him."K. glanced toward the street where Sidney's name and Max's lay open to
the sun and to the smiles of the Street.Christine might be right, but
that did not alter things for him.Christine's thoughts went back inevitably to herself; to Palmer, who was
doing better just now; to K., who was going away--went back with an ache
to the night K. had taken her in his arms and then put her away."When you go away," she said at last, "I want you to remember this.I'm
going to do my best, K. You have taught me all I know.All my life I'll
have to overlook things; I know that.But, in his way, Palmer cares for
me.He will always come back, and perhaps sometime--"

Her voice trailed off.Far ahead of her she saw the years stretching
out, marked, not by days and months, but by Palmer's wanderings away,
his remorseful returns."Do a little more than forgetting," K. said."Try to care for him,
Christine.It's always a
woman's strongest weapon."I shall try, K.," she answered obediently.But he turned away from the look in her eyes.She had sent cards from Paris to her "trade."The two or three people on the Street who received her
engraved announcement that she was there, "buying new chic models
for the autumn and winter--afternoon frocks, evening gowns, reception
dresses, and wraps, from Poiret, Martial et Armand, and others," left
the envelopes casually on the parlor table, as if communications from
Paris were quite to be expected.So K. lunched alone, and ate little.After luncheon he fixed a broken
ironing-stand for Katie, and in return she pressed a pair of trousers
for him.He had it in mind to ask Sidney to go out with him in Max's
car, and his most presentable suit was very shabby."I'm thinking," said Katie, when she brought the pressed garments up
over her arm and passed them in through a discreet crack in the door,
"that these pants will stand more walking than sitting, Mr."I'll take a duster along in case of accident," he promised her; "and
to-morrow I'll order a suit, Katie.""I'll believe it when I see it," said Katie from the stairs."Some fool
of a woman from the alley will come in to-night and tell you she can't
pay her rent, and she'll take your suit away in her pocket-book--as like
as not to pay an installment on a piano.There's two new pianos in the
alley since you came here.""Show it to me," said Katie laconically."And don't go to picking up
anything you drop!"Sidney came home at half-past two--came delicately flushed, as if she
had hurried, and with a tremulous smile that caught Katie's eye at once."There's no need to ask how he is to-day."Katie, some one has written my name out on the street, in chalk."I'm about crazy with their old chalk.But when she learned that K. was upstairs, oddly enough, she did not go
up at once.Her lips parted slightly as she
listened.Christine, looking in from her balcony, saw her there, and, seeing
something in her face that she had never suspected, put her hand to her
throat."Won't you come and sit with me?""I haven't much time--that is, I want to speak to K.""You can see him when he comes down."Sidney came slowly through the parlor.It occurred to her, all at once,
that Christine must see a lot of K., especially now.No doubt he was
in and out of the house often.All that seemed to be necessary to win K.Well, surely, in that case--

"How is Max?"Sidney sat down on the edge of the railing; but she was careful,
Christine saw, to face the staircase.Christine sewed; Sidney sat and swung her feet idly.Ed says Max wants you to give up your training and marry him now.""I'm not going to marry him at all, Chris."It was one of his failings that he always
slammed doors.Harriet used to be quite disagreeable about it.Perhaps, in all her frivolous, selfish life, Christine had never had a
bigger moment than the one that followed.She could have said nothing,
and, in the queer way that life goes, K. might have gone away from the
Street as empty of heart as he had come to it."Be very good to him, Sidney," she said unsteadily.CHAPTER XXX


K. was being very dense.For so long had he considered Sidney as
unattainable that now his masculine mind, a little weary with much
wretchedness, refused to move from its old attitude."It was glamour, that was all, K.," said Sidney bravely."But, perhaps," said K., "it's just because of that miserable incident
with Carlotta.That wasn't the right thing, of course, but Max has told
me the story.She fainted in the yard,
and--"

Sidney was exasperated."Do you want me to marry him, K.?""I want you to be happy, dear."They were on the terrace of the White Springs Hotel again.K. had
ordered dinner, making a great to-do about getting the dishes they both
liked.But now that it was there, they were not eating.K. had placed
his chair so that his profile was turned toward her.He had worn the
duster religiously until nightfall, and then had discarded it.It hung
limp and dejected on the back of his chair.'s profile Sidney
could see the magnolia tree shaped like a heart."It seems to me," said Sidney suddenly, "that you are kind to every one
but me, K."He fairly stammered his astonishment:--

"Why, what on earth have I done?""You are trying to make me marry Max, aren't you?"She was very properly ashamed of that, and, when he failed of reply out
of sheer inability to think of one that would not say too much, she went
hastily to something else:

"It is hard for me to realize that you--that you lived a life of your
own, a busy life, doing useful things, before you came to us.I wish you
would tell me something about yourself.If we're to be friends when you
go away,"--she had to stop there, for the lump in her throat--"I'll want
to know how to think of you,--who your friends are,--all that."He was thinking, of course, that he would be
visualizing her, in the hospital, in the little house on its side
street, as she looked just then, her eyes like stars, her lips just
parted, her hands folded before her on the table."I shall be working," he said at last."Does that mean you won't have time to think of me?""I'm afraid I'm stupider than usual to-night.You can think of me as
never forgetting you or the Street, working or playing."Of course he would not work all the time.And he was going back
to his old friends, to people who had always known him, to girls--

He did his best then.He told her of the old family house, built by one
of his forebears who had been a king's man until Washington had put the
case for the colonies, and who had given himself and his oldest son then
to the cause that he made his own.He told of old servants who had wept
when he decided to close the house and go away.When she fell silent, he
thought he was interesting her.He told her the family traditions that
had been the fairy tales of his childhood.He described the library, the
choice room of the house, full of family paintings in old gilt frames,
and of his father's collection of books.Because it was home, he waxed
warm over it at last, although it had rather hurt him at first to
remember.It brought back the other things that he wanted to forget.Side by side with the
wonders he described so casually, she was placing the little house.What
an exile it must have been for him!How hopelessly middle-class they
must have seemed!How idiotic of her to think, for one moment, that she
could ever belong in this new-old life of his!None, of course, save to be honest and good
and to do her best for the people around her.Her mother's people, the
Kennedys went back a long way, but they had always been poor.She remembered the lamp with the blue-silk
shade, the figure of Eve that used to stand behind the minister's
portrait, and the cherry bookcase with the Encyclopaedia in it and
"Beacon Lights of History."When K., trying his best to interest her and
to conceal his own heaviness of spirit, told her of his grandfather's
old carriage, she sat back in the shadow."Fearful old thing," said K.,--"regular cabriolet.I can remember yet
the family rows over it.But the old gentleman liked it--used to have
it repainted every year.Strangers in the city used to turn around and
stare at it--thought it was advertising something!""When I was a child," said Sidney quietly, "and a carriage drove up and
stopped on the Street, I always knew some one had died!"K., whose ear was attuned to
every note in her voice, looked at her quickly."My great-grandfather,"
said Sidney in the same tone, "sold chickens at market.He didn't do it
himself; but the fact's there, isn't it?"But Sidney's agile mind had already traveled on.This K. she had never
known, who had lived in a wonderful house, and all the rest of it--he
must have known numbers of lovely women, his own sort of women, who had
traveled and knew all kinds of things: girls like the daughters of the
Executive Committee who came in from their country places in summer
with great armfuls of flowers, and hurried off, after consulting their
jeweled watches, to luncheon or tea or tennis."Tell me about the women you have known,
your friends, the ones you liked and the ones who liked you.""I've always been so busy," he confessed."I know a lot, but I don't
think they would interest you.They don't do anything, you know--they
travel around and have a good time.They're rather nice to look at, some
of them.But when you've said that you've said it all."Of course they would be, with nothing else to think of
in all the world but of how they looked.She wanted to go back to the hospital,
and turn the key in the door of her little room, and lie with her face
down on the bed."Would you mind very much if I asked you to take me back?"He had a depressed feeling that the evening had failed.And his depression grew as he brought the car around.After all, a girl couldn't care as
she had for a year and a half, and then give a man up because of another
woman, without a wrench."Do you really want to go home, Sidney, or were you tired of sitting
there?In that case, we could drive around for an hour or two.I'll not
talk if you'd like to be quiet."Being with K. had become an agony, now
that she realized how wrong Christine had been, and that their worlds,
hers and K.Soon they would be separated
by as wide a gulf as that which lay between the cherry bookcase--for
instance,--and a book-lined library hung with family portraits.But she
was not disposed to skimp as to agony.She would go through with it,
every word a stab, if only she might sit beside K. a little longer,
might feel the touch of his old gray coat against her arm."I'd like to
ride, if you don't mind."K. turned the automobile toward the country roads.He was remembering
acutely that other ride after Joe in his small car, the trouble he
had had to get a machine, the fear of he knew not what ahead, and his
arrival at last at the road-house, to find Max lying at the head of the
stairs and Carlotta on her knees beside him."Was there anybody you cared about,--any girl,--when you left home?""I was not in love with anyone, if that's what you mean.""You knew Max before, didn't you?""If you knew things about him that I should have known, why didn't you
tell me?""I couldn't do that, could I?It seemed to me that the mere
fact of your caring for him--" That was shaky ground; he got off it
quickly.Schwitter's had closed up, indeed.The lanterns had been taken down,
and in the dusk they could see Tillie rocking her baby on the porch.As
if to cover the last traces of his late infamy, Schwitter himself was
watering the worn places on the lawn with the garden can.Above the low hum of the engine they could hear
Tillie's voice, flat and unmusical, but filled with the harmonies of
love as she sang to the child.When they had left the house far behind, K. was suddenly aware that
Sidney was crying.She sat with her head turned away, using her
handkerchief stealthily.He drew the car up beside the road, and in a
masterful fashion turned her shoulders about until she faced him."Now, tell me about it," he said.I'm--I'm a little bit lonely.""Aunt Harriet's in Paris, and with Joe gone and everybody--"

"Aunt Harriet!"If she had said she was lonely
because the cherry bookcase was in Paris, he could not have been more
bewildered."And with you going away and never coming back--"

"I'll come back, of course.I'll promise to come back when
you graduate, and send you flowers.""I think," said Sidney, "that I'll become an army nurse.""You won't know, K. You'll be back with your old friends.You'll have
forgotten the Street and all of us.""Girls who have been everywhere, and have lovely clothes, and who won't
know a T bandage from a figure eight!""There will never be anybody in the world like you to me, dear."I--who have wanted you so long that it hurts even to
think about it!Ever since the night I came up the Street, and you were
sitting there on the steps--oh, my dear, my dear, if you only cared a
little!"Because he was afraid that he would get out of hand and take her in his
arms,--which would be idiotic, since, of course, she did not care for
him that way,--he gripped the steering-wheel.It gave him a curious
appearance of making a pathetic appeal to the wind-shield."I have been trying to make you say that all evening!""I
love you so much that--K., won't you take me in your arms?"He held her to him and
muttered incoherencies until she gasped.It was as if he must make up
for long arrears of hopelessness.He held her off a bit to look at her,
as if to be sure it was she and no changeling, and as if he wanted her
eyes to corroborate her lips.There was no lack of confession in her
eyes; they showed him a new heaven and a new earth."It was you always, K.," she confessed.But
now, when you look back, don't you see it was?"He looked back over the months when she had seemed as unattainable as
the stars, and he did not see it."Not when I came to you with everything?I brought you all my troubles,
and you always helped."She bent down and kissed one of his hands.He was so
happy that the foolish little caress made his heart hammer in his ears."I think, K., that is how one can always tell when it is the right one,
and will be the right one forever and ever.It is the person--one goes
to in trouble."He had no words for that, only little caressing touches of her arm, her
hand.Perhaps, without knowing it, he was formulating a sort of prayer
that, since there must be troubles, she would, always come to him and he
would always be able to help her.She was recalling the day she became
engaged to Max, and the lost feeling she had had.She did not feel the
same at all now.She felt as if she had been wandering, and had come
home to the arms that were about her.She would be married, and take the
risk that all women took, with her eyes open.She would go through the
valley of the shadow, as other women did; but K. would be with her.Looking into his steady eyes, she knew that she
was safe.Where before she had felt the clutch of inexorable destiny, the woman's
fate, now she felt only his arms about her, her cheek on his shabby
coat."I shall love you all my life," she said shakily.The little house was dark when they got back to it.The Street, which
had heard that Mr.Le Moyne approved of night air, was raising its
windows for the night and pinning cheesecloth bags over its curtains to
keep them clean.In the second-story front room at Mrs.McKee's, the barytone slept
heavily, and made divers unvocal sounds.He was hardening his throat,
and so slept with a wet towel about it.Wagner sat and made love with
the aid of a lighted match and the pencil-pad.The car drew up at the little house, and Sidney got out.Then it drove
away, for K. must take it to the garage and walk back.Sidney sat on the doorstep and waited.If one did one's best by life, it did its best too.She saw the flicker of the match across the
street, and knew what it meant.Once she would have thought that that
was funny; now it seemed very touching to her.Katie had heard the car, and now she came heavily along the hall."If you think it's a begging
letter, you'd better keep it until he's bought his new suit to-morrow.Almost any moment he's likely to bust out."K. read it in the hall, with Sidney's
shining eyes on him.It began abruptly:--

"I'm going to Africa with one of my cousins.It is a bad station on
the West Coast.I am not going because I feel any call to the work, but
because I do not know what else to do."You were kind to me the other day.I believe, if I had told you then,
you would still have been kind.I tried to tell you, but I was so
terribly afraid."If I caused death, I did not mean to.You will think that no excuse,
but it is true.In the hospital, when I changed the bottles on Miss
Page's medicine-tray, I did not care much what happened.I had been careless about a sponge
count.I made up my mind to get back at you.It seemed hopeless--you
were so secure.For two or three days I tried to think of some way to
hurt you."You remember the packets of gauze sponges we made and used in the
operating-room?When we counted them
as we got them out, we counted by packages.On the night before I left,
I went to the operating-room and added one sponge every here and there.Out of every dozen packets, perhaps, I fixed one that had thirteen.I had meant to give you
trouble, so you would have to do certain cases a second time.I was so frightened that I went down sick over it.When
I got better, I heard you had lost a case and the cause was being
whispered about."I tried to get back into the hospital one night.I went up the
fire-escape, but the windows were locked."I am not going to sign this letter.And I am
not going to ask your forgiveness, or anything of that sort.But one thing hurt me more than anything else, the other
night.You said you'd lost your faith in yourself.This is to tell you
that you need not.And you said something else--that any one can 'come
back.'K. stood in the hall of the little house with the letter in his hand.Just beyond on the doorstep was Sidney, waiting for him.His arms were
still warm from the touch of her.Beyond lay the Street, and beyond that
lay the world and a man's work to do.Work, and faith to do it, a good
woman's hand in the dark, a Providence that made things right in the
end.And, when he was beside her, his long figure folded
to the short measure of the step, he stooped humbly and kissed the hem
of her soft white dress.Wagner wrote something in the dark and then
lighted a match."So K. is in love with Sidney Page, after all!""She
is a sweet girl, and he is every inch a man.But, to my mind, a certain
lady--"

Mrs.McKee flushed and blew out the match.Late September now on the Street, with Joe gone and his mother eyeing
the postman with pitiful eagerness; with Mrs.Rosenfeld moving heavily
about the setting-up of the new furniture; and with Johnny driving
heavenly cars, brake and clutch legs well and Strong.Late September,
with Max recovering and settling his tie for any pretty nurse who
happened along, but listening eagerly for Dr.Ed's square tread in the
hall; with Tillie rocking her baby on the porch at Schwitter's, and
Carlotta staring westward over rolling seas; with Christine taking up
her burden and Grace laying hers down; with Joe's tragic young eyes
growing quiet with the peace of the tropics."The Lord is my shepherd," she reads."Yea, though
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil."Sidney, on her knees in the little parlor, repeats the words with the
others.K. has gone from the Street, and before long she will join him.With the vision of his steady eyes before her, she adds her own prayer
to the others--that the touch of his arms about her may not make her
forget the vow she has taken, of charity and its sister, service, of a
cup of water to the thirsty, of open arms to a tired child.FOOTNOTES:

[7] De Maistre found a curiously characteristic kind of support for this
view in the fact that evils are called _fleaux_: flails are things to
beat with: so evils must be things with which men are beaten; and as we
should not be beaten if we did not deserve it, _argal_, suffering is a
merited punishment.Apart from that common infirmity which leads people
after they have discovered an analogy between two things, to argue from
the properties of the one to those of the other, as if, instead of being
analogous, they were identical, De Maistre was particularly fond of
inferring moral truths from etymologies.He has an argument for the
deterioration of man, drawn from the fact that the Romans expressed in
the same word, _supplicium_, the two ideas of prayer and punishment

III.When the waters of the deluge of '89 began to assuage, the best minds
soon satisfied themselves that the event which Bonaparte's restoration
of order enabled them to look back upon with a certain tranquillity and
a certain completeness, had been neither more nor less than a new
irruption of barbarians into the European world.The monarchy, the
nobles, and the Church, with all the ideas that gave each of them life
and power, had fallen before atheists and Jacobins, as the ancient
empire of Rome had fallen before Huns and Goths, Vandals and Lombards.The leaders of the revolution had succeeded one another, as Attila had
come after Alaric, and as Genseric had been followed by Odoacer.The
problem which presented itself was not new in the history of western
civilisation; the same dissolution of old bonds which perplexed the
foremost men at the beginning of the nineteenth century, had distracted
their predecessors from the fifth to the eighth, though their conditions
and circumstances were widely different.The practical question in both
cases was just the same--how to establish a stable social order which,
resting on principles that should command the assent of all, might
secure the co-operation of all for its harmonious and efficient
maintenance, and might offer a firm basis for the highest and best life
that the moral and intellectual state of the time allowed.There were
two courses open, or which seemed to be open, in this gigantic
enterprise of reconstructing a society.One of them was to treat the
case of the eighteenth century as if it were not merely similar to, but
exactly identical with, the case of the fifth, and as if exactly the
same forces which had knit Western Europe together into a compact
civilisation a thousand years before, would again suffice for a second
consolidation.Christianity, rising with the zeal and strength of youth
out of the ruins of the Empire, and feudalism by the need of
self-preservation imposing a form upon the unshapen associations of the
barbarians, had between them compacted the foundations and reared the
fabric of mediaeval life.Why, many men asked themselves, should not
Christian and feudal ideas repeat their great achievement, and be the
means of reorganising the system which a blind rebellion against them
had thrown into deplorable and fatal confusion?Let the century which
had come to such an end be regarded as a mysteriously intercalated
episode, and no more, in the long drama of faith and sovereign order.Let it pass as a sombre and pestilent stream, whose fountains no man
should discover, whose waters had for a season mingled with the mightier
current of the divinely allotted destiny of the race, and had then
gathered themselves apart and flowed off, to end as they had begun, in
the stagnation and barrenness of the desert.Philosophers and men of
letters, astronomers and chemists, atheists and republicans, had shown
that they were only powerful to destroy, as the Goths and the Vandals
had been.They had shown that they were impotent, as the Goths and the
Vandals had been, in building up again.Let men turn their faces, then,
once more to that system by which in the ancient times Europe had been
delivered from a relapse into eternal night.The minds to whom it
commended itself were cast in a different mould and drew their
inspiration from other traditions.In their view the system which the
Church had been the main agency in organising, had fallen quite as much
from its own irremediable weakness as from the direct onslaughts of
assailants within and without.The barbarians had rushed in, it was
true, in 1793; but this time it was the Church and feudalism which were
in the position of the old empire on whose ruins they had built.What
had once restored order and belief to the West, was now in its own turn
overtaken by decay and dissolution.To look to them to unite these new
barbarians in a stable and vigorous civilisation, because they had
organised Europe of old, was as infatuated as it would have been to
expect the later emperors to equal the exploits of the Republic and
their greatest predecessors in the purple.To despise philosophers and
men of science was only to play over again in a new dress the very part
which Julian had enacted in the face of nascent Christianity.The
eighteenth century, instead of being that home of malaria which the
Catholic and Royalist party represented, was in truth the seed-ground of
a new and better future.Its ideas were to furnish the material and the
implements by which should be repaired the terrible breaches and chasms
in European order that had been made alike by despots and Jacobins, by
priests and atheists, by aristocrats and sans-culottes.Amidst all the
demolition upon which its leading minds had been so zealously bent, they
had been animated by the warmest love of social justice, of human
freedom, of equal rights, and by the most fervent and sincere longing to
make a nobler happiness more universally attainable by all the children
of men.It was to these great principles that we ought eagerly to turn,
to liberty, to equality, to brotherhood, if we wished to achieve before
the new invaders a work of civilisation and social reconstruction, such
as Catholicism and feudalism had achieved for the multitudinous invaders
of old.Such was the difference which divided opinion when men took heart to
survey the appalling scene of moral desolation that the cataclysm of '93
had left behind.For if the
conscience of the Liberals was oppressed by the sanguinary tragedy in
which freedom and brotherhood and justice had been consummated, the
Catholic and the Royalist were just as sorely burdened with the weight
of kingly basenesses and priestly hypocrisies.If the one had some
difficulty in interpreting Jacobinism and the Terror, the other was
still more severely pressed to interpret the fact and origin and meaning
of the Revolution; if the Liberal had Marat and Hebert, the Royalist had
Lewis XV., and the Catholic had Dubois and De Rohan.Each school could
intrepidly hurl back the taunts of its enemy, and neither of them did
full justice to the strong side of the other.Yet we who are, in England
at all events, removed a little aside from the centre of this great
battle, may perceive that at that time both of the contending hosts
fought under honourable banners, and could inscribe upon their shields a
rational and intelligible device.Indeed, unless the modern Liberal
admits the strength inherent in the cause of his enemies, it is
impossible for him to explain to himself the duration and obstinacy of
the conflict, the slow advance and occasional repulse of the host in
which he has enlisted, and the tardy progress that Liberalism has made
in that stupendous reconstruction which the Revolution has forced the
modern political thinker to meditate upon, and the modern statesman to
further and control.De Maistre, from those general ideas as to the method of the government
of the world, of which we have already seen something, had formed what
he conceived to be a perfectly satisfactory way of accounting for the
eighteenth century and its terrific climax.The will of man is left
free; he acts contrary to the will of God; and then God exacts the
shedding of blood as the penalty.The only hope of
the future lay in an immediate return to the system which God himself
had established, and in the restoration of that spiritual power which
had presided over the reconstruction of Europe in darker and more
chaotic times than even these.Though, perhaps, he nowhere expresses
himself on this point in a distinct formula, De Maistre was firmly
impressed with the idea of historic unity and continuity.He looked upon
the history of the West in its integrity, and was entirely free from
anything like that disastrous kind of misconception which makes the
English Protestant treat the long period between St.Paul and Martin
Luther as a howling waste, or which makes some Americans omit from all
account the still longer period of human effort from the crucifixion of
Christ to the Declaration of Independence.The rise of the vast
structure of Western civilisation during and after the dissolution of
the Empire, presented itself to his mind as a single and uniform
process, though marked in portions by temporary, casual, parenthetical
interruptions, due to depraved will and disordered pride.All the
dangers to which this civilisation had been exposed in its infancy and
growth were before his eyes.First, there were the heresies with which
the subtle and debased ingenuity of the Greeks had stained and distorted
the great but simple mysteries of the faith.Then came the hordes of
invaders from the North, sweeping with irresistible force over regions
that the weakness or cowardice of the wearers of the purple left
defenceless before them.Before the northern tribes had settled in their
possessions, and had full time to assimilate the faith and the
institutions which they had found there, the growing organisation was
menaced by a more deadly peril in the incessant and steady advance of
the bloody and fanatical tribes from the East.And in this way De
Maistre's mind continued the picture down to the latest days of all,
when there had arisen men who, denying God and mocking at Christ, were
bent on the destruction of the very foundations of society, and had
nothing better to offer the human race than a miserable return to a
state of nature.As he thus reproduced this long drama, one benign and central figure was
ever present, changeless in the midst of ceaseless change; laboriously
building up with preterhuman patience and preterhuman sagacity, when
other powers, one after another in evil succession, were madly raging to
destroy and to pull down; thinking only of the great interests of order
and civilisation, of which it had been constituted the eternal
protector, and showing its divine origin and inspiration alike by its
unfailing wisdom and its unfailing benevolence.It is the Sovereign
Pontiff who thus stands forth throughout the history of Europe, as the
great Demiurgus of universal civilisation.If the Pope had filled only
such a position as the Patriarch held at Constantinople, or if there had
been no Pope, and Christianity had depended exclusively on the East for
its propagation, with no great spiritual organ in the West, what would
have become of Western development?It was the energy and resolution of
the Pontiffs which resisted the heresies of the East, and preserved to
the Christian religion that plainness and intelligibility, without which
it would never have made a way to the rude understanding and simple
hearts of the barbarians from the North.It was their wise patriotism
which protected Italy against Greek oppression, and by acting the part
of mayors of the palace to the decrepit Eastern emperors, it was they
who contrived to preserve the independence and maintain the fabric of
society until the appearance of the Carlovingians, in whom, with the
rapid instinct of true statesmen, they at once recognised the founders
of a new empire of the West.If the Popes, again, had possessed over the
Eastern empire the same authority that they had over the Western, they
would have repulsed not only the Saracens, but the Turks too, and none
of the evils which these nations have inflicted on us would ever have
taken place.[10] Even as it was, when the Saracens threatened the West,
the Popes were the chief agents in organising resistance, and giving
spirit and animation to the defenders of Europe.Their alert vision saw
that to crush for ever that formidable enemy, it was not enough to
defend ourselves against his assaults; we must attack him at home.The
Crusades, vulgarly treated as the wars of a blind and superstitious
piety, were in truth wars of high policy.From the Council of Clermont
down to the famous day of Lepanto, the hand and spirit of the Pontiff
were to be traced in every part of that tremendous struggle which
prevented Europe from being handed over to the tyranny, ignorance, and
barbarism that have always been the inevitable fruits of Mahometan
conquest, and had already stamped out civilisation in Asia Minor and
Palestine and Greece, once the very garden of the universe.This admirable and politic heroism of the Popes in the face of foes
pressing from without, De Maistre found more than equalled by their
wisdom, courage, and activity in organising and developing the elements
of a civilised system within.The maxim of old societies had been that
which Lucan puts into the mouth of Caesar--_humanum paucis vivit genus_.A vast population of slaves had been one of the inevitable social
conditions of the period: the Popes never rested from their endeavours
to banish servitude from among Christian nations.Women in old
societies had filled a mean and degraded place: it was reserved for the
new spiritual power to rescue the race from that vicious circle in which
men had debased the nature of women, and women had given back all the
weakness and perversity they had received from men, and to perceive that
'the most effectual way of perfecting the man is to ennoble and exalt
the woman.'The organisation of the priesthood, again, was a masterpiece
of practical wisdom.Such an order, removed from the fierce or selfish
interests of ordinary life by the holy regulation of celibacy, and by
the austere discipline of the Church, was indispensable in the midst of
such a society as that which it was the function of the Church to guide.Who but the members of an order thus set apart, acting in strict
subordination to the central power, and so presenting a front of
unbroken spiritual unity, could have held their way among tumultuous
tribes, half-barbarous nobles, and proud and unruly kings, protesting
against wrong, passionately inculcating new and higher ideas of right,
denouncing the darkness of the false gods, calling on all men to worship
the cross and adore the mysteries of the true God?Compare now the
impotency of the Protestant missionary, squatting in gross comfort with
wife and babes among the savages he has come to convert, preaching a
disputatious doctrine, wrangling openly with the rival sent by some
other sect--compare this impotency with the success that follows the
devoted sons of the Church, impressing their proselytes with the
mysterious virtue of their continence, the self-denial of their lives,
the unity of their dogma and their rites; and then recognise the wisdom
of these great churchmen who created a priesthood after this manner in
the days when every priest was as the missionary is now.Finally, it was
the occupants of the holy chair who prepared, softened, one might almost
say sweetened, the occupants of thrones; it was to them that Providence
had confided the education of the sovereigns of Europe.The Popes
brought up the youth of the European monarchy; they made it precisely in
the same way in which Fenelon made the Duke of Burgundy.In each case
the task consisted in eradicating from a fine character an element of
ferocity that would have ruined all.'Everything that constrains a man
strengthens him.He cannot obey without perfecting himself; and by the
mere fact of overcoming himself he is better.Any man will vanquish the
most violent passion at thirty, because at five or six you have taught
him of his own will to give up a plaything or a sweetmeat.That came to
pass to the monarchy, which happens to an individual who has been well
brought up.The continued efforts of the Church, directed by the
Sovereign Pontiff, did what had never been seen before, and what will
never be seen again where that authority is not recognised.Insensibly,
without threats or laws or battles, without violence and without
resistance, the great European charter was proclaimed, not on paper nor
by the voice of public criers; but in all European hearts, then all
Catholic Kings surrender the power of judging by themselves, and nations
in return declare kings infallible and inviolable.Such is the
fundamental law of the European monarchy, and it is the work of the
Popes.'[11]

All this, however, is only the external development of De Maistre's
central idea, the historical corroboration of a truth to which he
conducts us in the first instance by general considerations.Assuming,
what it is less and less characteristic of the present century at any
rate to deny, that Christianity was the only actual force by which the
regeneration of Europe could be effected after the decline of the Roman
civilisation, he insists that, as he again and again expresses it,
'without the Pope there is no veritable Christianity.'What he meant by
this condensed form needs a little explanation, as is always the case
with such simple statements of the products of long and complex
reasoning.In saying that without the Pope there is no true
Christianity, what he considered himself as having established was, that
unless there be some supreme and independent possessor of authority to
settle doctrine, to regulate discipline, to give authentic counsel, to
apply accepted principles to disputed cases, then there can be no such
thing as a religious system which shall have power to bind the members
of a vast and not homogeneous body in the salutary bonds of a common
civilisation, nor to guide and inform an universal conscience.In each
individual state everybody admits the absolute necessity of having some
sovereign power which shall make, declare, and administer the laws, and
from whose action in any one of these aspects there shall be no appeal;
a power that shall be strong enough to protect the rights and enforce
the duties which it has authoritatively proclaimed and enjoined.In free
England, as in despotic Turkey, the privileges and obligations which the
law tolerates or imposes, and all the benefits which their existence
confers on the community, are the creatures and conditions of a supreme
authority from which there is no appeal, whether the instrument by which
this authority makes its will known be an act of parliament or a ukase.This conception of temporal sovereignty, especially familiarised to our
generation by the teaching of Austin, was carried by De Maistre into
discussions upon the limits of the Papal power with great ingenuity and
force, and, if we accept the premisses, with great success.It should be said here, that throughout his book on the Pope, De Maistre
talks of Christianity exclusively as a statesman or a publicist would
talk about it; not theologically nor spiritually, but politically and
socially.The question with which he concerns himself is the utilisation
of Christianity as a force to shape and organise a system of civilised
societies; a study of the conditions under which this utilisation had
taken place in the earlier centuries of the era; and a deduction from
them of the conditions under which we might ensure a repetition of the
process in changed modern circumstance.In the eighteenth century men
were accustomed to ask of Christianity, as Protestants always ask of so
much of Catholicism as they have dropped, whether or no it is true.But
after the Revolution the question changed, and became an inquiry whether
and how Christianity could contribute to the reconstruction of society.People asked less how true it was, than how strong it was; less how many
unquestioned dogmas, than how much social weight it had or could
develop; less as to the precise amount and form of belief that would
save a soul, than as to the way in which it might be expected to assist
the European community.It was the strength of this temper in him which led to his extraordinary
detestation and contempt for the Greeks.Their turn for pure speculation
excited all his anger.In a curious chapter, he exhausts invective in
denouncing them.[12] The sarcasm of Sallust delights him, that the
actions of Greece were very fine, _verum aliquanto minores quam fama
feruntur_.Their military glory was only a flash of about a hundred and
fourteen years from Marathon; compare this with the prolonged splendour
of Rome, France, and England.In philosophy they displayed decent
talent, but even here their true merit is to have brought the wisdom of
Asia into Europe, for they invented nothing.Greece was the home of
syllogism and of unreason.'Read Plato: at every page you will draw a
striking distinction.As often as he is Greek, he wearies you.He is
only great, sublime, penetrating, when he is a theologian; in other
words, when he is announcing positive and everlasting dogmas, free from
all quibble, and which are so clearly marked with the eastern cast, that
not to perceive it one must never have had a glimpse of Asia.... There
was in him a sophist and a theologian, or, if you choose, a Greek and a
Chaldean.'The Athenians could never pardon one of their great leaders,
all of whom fell victims in one shape or another to a temper frivolous
as that of a child, ferocious as that of men,--'_espece de moutons
enrages, toujours menes par la nature, et toujours par nature devorant
leurs bergers_.'As for their oratory, 'the tribune of Athens would have
been the disgrace of mankind if Phocion and men like him, by
occasionally ascending it before drinking the hemlock or setting out for
their place of exile, had not in some sort balanced such a mass of
loquacity, extravagance, and cruelty.'[13]

It is very important to remember this constant solicitude for ideas that
should work well, in connection with that book of De Maistre's which
has had most influence in Europe, by supplying a base for the theories
of ultramontanism.Unless we perceive very clearly that throughout his
ardent speculations on the Papal power his mind was bent upon enforcing
the practical solution of a pressing social problem, we easily
misunderstand him and underrate what he had to say.A charge has been
forcibly urged against him by an eminent English critic, for example,
that he has confounded supremacy with infallibility, than which, as the
writer truly says, no two ideas can be more perfectly distinct, one
being superiority of force, and the other incapacity of error.[14] De
Maistre made logical blunders in abundance quite as bad as this, but he
was too acute, I think, deliberately to erect so elaborate a structure
upon a confusion so very obvious, and that must have stared him in the
face from the first page of his work to the last.If we look upon his
book as a mere general defence of the Papacy, designed to investigate
and fortify all its pretensions one by one, we should have great right
to complain against having two claims so essentially divergent, treated
as though they were the same thing, or could be held in their places by
the same supports.But let us regard the treatise on the Pope not as
meant to convince free-thinkers or Protestants that divine grace
inspires every decree of the Holy Father, though that would have been
the right view of it if it had been written fifty years earlier.It was
composed within the first twenty years of the present century, when the
universe, to men of De Maistre's stamp, seemed once more without form
and void.His object, as he tells us more than once, was to find a way
of restoring a religion and a morality in Europe; of giving to truth the
forces demanded for the conquests that she was meditating; of
strengthening the thrones of sovereigns, and of gently calming that
general fermentation of spirit which threatened mightier evils than any
that had yet overwhelmed society.From this point of view we shall see
that the distinction between supremacy and infallibility was not worth
recognising.Practically, he says, 'infallibility is only a consequence of supremacy,
or rather it is absolutely the same thing under two different names....
In effect it is the same thing, _in practice_, not to be subject to
error, and not to be liable to be accused of it.Thus, even if we should
agree that no divine promise was made to the Pope, he would not be less
infallible or deemed so, as the final tribunal; for every judgment from
which you cannot appeal is and must be (_est et doit etre_) held for
just in every human association, under any imaginable form of
government; and every true statesman will understand me perfectly, when
I say that the point is to ascertain not only if the Sovereign Pontiff
is, but if he must be, infallible.'[15] In another place he says
distinctly enough that the infallibility of the Church has two aspects;
in one of them it is the object of divine promise, in the other it is a
human implication, and that in the latter aspect infallibility is
supposed in the Church, just 'as we are absolutely bound to suppose it,
even in temporal sovereignties (where it does not really exist), under
pain of seeing society dissolved.'The Church only demands what other
sovereignties demand, though she has the immense superiority over them
of having her claim backed by direct promise from heaven.[16] Take away
the dogma, if you will, he says, and only consider the thing
politically, which is exactly what he really does all through the book.The pope, from this point of view, asks for no other infallibility than
that which is attributed to all sovereigns.[17] Without either
vindicating or surrendering the supernatural side of the Papal claims,
he only insists upon the political, social, or human side of it, as an
inseparable quality of an admitted supremacy.[18] In short, from
beginning to end of this speculation, from which the best kind of
ultramontanism has drawn its defence, he evinces a deprecatory
anxiety--a very rare temper with De Maistre--not to fight on the issue
of the dogma of infallibility over which Protestants and unbelievers
have won an infinite number of cheap victories; that he leaves as a
theme more fitted for the disputations of theologians.My position, he
seems to keep saying, is that if the Pope is spiritually supreme, then
he is virtually and practically _as if he were_ infallible, just in the
same sense in which the English Parliament and monarch, and the Russian
Czar, are as if they were infallible.But let us not argue so much about
this, which is only secondary.The main question is whether without the
Pope there can be a true Christianity, 'that is to say, a Christianity,
active, powerful, converting, regenerating, conquering, perfecting.'De Maistre was probably conducted to his theory by an analogy, which he
tacitly leaned upon more strongly than it could well bear, between
temporal organisation and spiritual organisation.In inchoate
communities, the momentary self-interest and the promptly stirred
passions of men would rend the growing society in pieces, unless they
were restrained by the strong hand of law in some shape or other,
written or unwritten, and administered by an authority, either
physically too strong to be resisted, or else set up by the common
consent seeking to further the general convenience.To divide this
authority, so that none should know where to look for a sovereign
decree, nor be able to ascertain the commands of sovereign law; to
embody it in the persons of many discordant expounders, each assuming
oracular weight and equal sanction; to leave individuals to administer
and interpret it for themselves, and to decide among themselves its
application to their own cases; what would this be but a deliberate
preparation for anarchy and dissolution?For it is one of the clear
conditions of the efficacy of the social union, that every member of it
should be able to know for certain the terms on which he belongs to it,
the compliances which it will insist upon in him, and the compliances
which it will in turn permit him to insist upon in others, and therefore
it is indispensable that there should be some definite and admitted
centre where this very essential knowledge should be accessible.Some such reflections as these must have been at the bottom of De
Maistre's great apology for the Papal supremacy, or at any rate they may
serve to bring before our minds with greater clearness the kind of
foundations on which his scheme rested.For law substitute Christianity,
for social union spiritual union, for legal obligations the obligations
of the faith.Instead of individuals bound together by allegiance to
common political institutions, conceive communities united in the bonds
of religious brotherhood into a sort of universal republic, under the
moderate supremacy of a supreme spiritual power.As a matter of fact, it
was the intervention of this spiritual power which restrained the
anarchy, internal and external, of the ferocious and imperfectly
organised sovereignties that figure in the early history of modern
Europe.And as a matter of theory, what could be more rational and
defensible than such an intervention made systematic, with its
rightfulness and disinterestedness universally recognised?Grant
Christianity as the spiritual basis of the life and action of modern
communities; supporting both the organised structure of each of them,
and the interdependent system composed of them all; accepted by the
individual members of each, and by the integral bodies forming the
whole.But who shall declare what the Christian doctrine is, and how its
maxims bear upon special cases, and what oracles they announce in
particular sets of circumstances?Amid the turbulence of popular
passion, in face of the crushing despotism of an insensate tyrant,
between the furious hatred of jealous nations or the violent ambition of
rival sovereigns, what likelihood would there be of either party to the
contention yielding tranquilly and promptly to any presentation of
Christian teaching made by the other, or by some suspected neutral as a
decisive authority between them?Obviously there must be some supreme
and indisputable interpreter, before whose final decree the tyrant
should quail, the flood of popular lawlessness flow back within its
accustomed banks, and contending sovereigns or jealous nations
fraternally embrace.Again, in those questions of faith and discipline,
which the ill-exercised ingenuity of men is for ever raising and
pressing upon the attention of Christendom, it is just as obvious that
there must be some tribunal to pronounce an authoritative judgment.Otherwise, each nation is torn into sects; and amid the throng of sects
where is unity?'To maintain that a crowd of independent churches form a
church, one and universal, is to maintain in other terms that all the
political governments of Europe only form a single government, one and
universal.'There could no more be a kingdom of France without a king,
nor an empire of Russia without an emperor, than there could be one
universal church without an acknowledged head.That this head must be
the successor of St.Peter, is declared alike by the voice of tradition,
the explicit testimony of the early writers, the repeated utterances of
later theologians of all schools, and that general sentiment which
presses itself upon every conscientious reader of religious history.The argument that the voice of the Church is to be sought in general
councils is absurd.To maintain that a council has any other function
than to assure and certify the Pope, when he chooses to strengthen his
judgment or to satisfy his doubts, is to destroy visible unity.Suppose
there to be an equal division of votes, as happened in the famous case
of Fenelon, and might as well happen in a general council, the doubt
would after all be solved by the final vote of the Pope.And 'what is
doubtful for twenty selected men is doubtful for the whole human race.Those who suppose that by multiplying the deliberating voices doubt is
lessened, must have very little knowledge of men, and can never have sat
in a deliberative body.'Again, supposing there to present itself one of
those questions of divine metaphysics that it is absolutely necessary to
refer to the decision of the supreme tribunal.Then our interest is not
that it should be decided in such or such a manner, but that it should
be decided without delay and without appeal.Besides, the world is now
grown too vast for general councils, which seem to be made only for the
youth of Christianity.In fine, why pursue futile or mischievous
discussions as to whether the Pope is above the Council or the Council
above the Pope?In ordinary questions in which a king is conscious of
sufficient light, he decides them himself, while the others in which he
is not conscious of this light, he transfers to the States-General
presided over by himself, but he is equally sovereign in either case.Let us be content to know, in the words
of Thomassin,[19] that 'the Pope in the midst of his Council is above
himself, and that the Council decapitated of its chief is below him.'The point so constantly dwelt upon by Bossuet, the obligation of the
canons upon the Pope, was of very little worth in De Maistre's judgment,
and he almost speaks with disrespect of the great Catholic defender for
being so prolix and pertinacious in elaborating it.Here again he finds
in Thomassin the most concise statement of what he held to be the true
view, just as he does in the controversy as to the relative superiority
of the Pope or the Council.'There is only an apparent contradiction,'
says Thomassin, 'between saying that the Pope is above the canons, and
that he is bound by them; that he is master of the canons, or that he is
not.Those who place him above the canons or make him their master, only
pretend that he _has a dispensing power over them_; while those who deny
that he is above the canons or is their master, mean no more than that
_he can only exercise a dispensing power for the convenience and in the
necessities of the Church_.'This is an excellent illustration of the
thoroughly political temper in which De Maistre treats the whole
subject.He looks at the power of the Pope over the canons much as a
modern English statesman looks at the question of the coronation oath,
and the extent to which it binds the monarch to the maintenance of the
laws existing at the time of its imposition.In the same spirit he
banishes from all account the crowd of nonsensical objections to Papal
supremacy, drawn from imaginary possibilities.Suppose a Pope, for
example, were to abolish all the canons at a single stroke; suppose him
to become an unbeliever; suppose him to go mad; and so forth.'Why,' De
Maistre says, 'there is not in the whole world a single power in a
condition to bear all possible and arbitrary hypotheses of this sort;
and if you judge them by what they can do, without speaking of what they
have done, they will have to be abolished every one.'[20] This, it may
be worth noticing, is one of the many passages in De Maistre's writings
which, both in the solidity of their argument and the direct force of
their expression, recall his great predecessor in the anti-revolutionary
cause, the ever-illustrious Burke.The vigour with which De Maistre sums up all these pleas for supremacy
is very remarkable; and to the crowd of enemies and indifferents, and
especially to the statesmen who are among them, he appeals with
admirable energy.Do you mean that the nations
should live without any religion, and do you not begin to perceive that
a religion there must be?And does not Christianity, not only by its
intrinsic worth but because it is in possession, strike you as
preferable to every other?Have you been better contented with other
attempts in this way?Peradventure the twelve apostles might please you
better than the Theophilanthropists and Martinists?Does the Sermon on
the Mount seem to you a passable code of morals?And if the entire
people were to regulate their conduct on this model, should you be
content?I fancy that I hear you reply affirmatively.Well, since the
only object now is to maintain this religion for which you thus declare
your preference, how could you have, I do not say the stupidity, but the
cruelty, to turn it into a democracy, and to place this precious deposit
in the hands of the rabble?'You attach too much importance to the dogmatic part of this religion.By what strange contradiction would you desire to agitate the universe
for some academic quibble, for miserable wranglings about mere words
(these are your own terms)?Will you
call the Bishop of Quebec and the Bishop of Lucon to interpret a line of
the Catechism?That believers should quarrel about infallibility is what
I know, for I see it; but that statesmen should quarrel in the same way
about this great privilege, is what I shall never be able to
conceive.... That all the bishops in the world should be convoked to
determine a divine truth necessary to salvation--nothing more natural,
if such a method is indispensable; for no effort, no trouble, ought to
be spared for so exalted an aim.But if the only point is the
establishment of one opinion in the place of another, then the
travelling expenses of even one single Infallible are sheer waste.If
you want to spare the two most valuable things on earth, time and money,
make all haste to write to Rome, in order to procure thence a lawful
decision which shall declare the unlawful doubt.Nothing more is needed;
policy asks no more.'[21]

Definitely, then, the influence of the Popes restored to their ancient
supremacy would be exercised in the renewal and consolidation of social
order resting on the Christian faith, somewhat after this manner.The
anarchic dogma of the sovereignty of peoples, having failed to do
anything beyond showing that the greatest evils resulting from obedience
do not equal the thousandth part of those which result from rebellion,
would be superseded by the practice of appeals to the authority of the
Holy See.Do not suppose that the Revolution is at an end, or that the
column is replaced because it is raised up from the ground.A man must
be blind not to see that all the sovereignties in Europe are growing
weak; on all sides confidence and affection are deserting them; sects
and the spirit of individualism are multiplying themselves in an
appalling manner.There are only two alternatives: you must either
purify the will of men, or else you must enchain it; the monarch who
will not do the first, must enslave his subjects or perish; servitude or
spiritual unity is the only choice open to nations.On the one hand is
the gross and unrestrained tyranny of what in modern phrase is styled
Imperialism, and on the other a wise and benevolent modification of
temporal sovereignty in the interests of all by an established and
accepted spiritual power.No middle path lies before the people of
Europe.Temporal absolutism we must have.The only question is whether
or no it shall be modified by the wise, disinterested, and moderating
counsels of the Church, as given by her consecrated chief.*       *       *       *       *

There can be very little doubt that the effective way in which De
Maistre propounded and vindicated this theory made a deep impression on
the mind of Comte.Very early in his career this eminent man had
declared: 'De Maistre has for me the peculiar property of helping me to
estimate the philosophic capacity of people, by the repute in which they
hold him.'Among his other reasons at that time for thinking well of M.
Guizot was that, notwithstanding his transcendent Protestantism, he
complied with the test of appreciating De Maistre.[22] Comte's rapidly
assimilative intelligence perceived that here at last there was a
definite, consistent, and intelligible scheme for the reorganisation of
European society, with him the great end of philosophic endeavour.Its
principle of the division of the spiritual and temporal powers, and of
the relation that ought to subsist between the two, was the base of
Comte's own scheme.In general form the plans of social reconstruction are identical; in
substance, it need scarcely be said, the differences are fundamental.The temporal power, according to Comte's design, is to reside with
industrial chiefs, and the spiritual power to rest upon a doctrine
scientifically established.De Maistre, on the other hand, believed that
the old authority of kings and Christian pontiffs was divine, and any
attempt to supersede it in either case would have seemed to him as
desperate as it seemed impious.In his strange speculation on _Le
Principe Generateur des Constitutions Politiques_, he contends that all
laws in the true sense of the word (which by the way happens to be
decidedly an arbitrary and exclusive sense) are of supernatural origin,
and that the only persons whom we have any right to call legislators,
are those half-divine men who appear mysteriously in the early history
of nations, and counterparts to whom we never meet in later days.Elsewhere he maintains to the same effect, that royal families in the
true sense of the word 'are growths of nature, and differ from others,
as a tree differs from a shrub.'People suppose a family to be royal because it reigns; on the contrary,
it reigns because it is royal, because it has more life, _plus d'esprit
royal_--surely as mysterious and occult a force as the _virtus
dormitiva_ of opium.The common life of man is about thirty years; the
average duration of the reigns of European sovereigns, being Christian,
is at the very lowest calculation twenty.How is it possible that 'lives
should be only thirty years, and reigns from twenty-two to twenty-five,
if princes had not more common life than other men?'Mark again, the
influence of religion in the duration of sovereignties.All the
Christian reigns are longer than all the non-Christian reigns, ancient
and modern, and Catholic reigns have been longer than Protestant reigns.The reigns in England, which averaged more than twenty-three years
before the Reformation, have only been seventeen years since that, and
those of Sweden, which were twenty-two, have fallen to the same figure
of seventeen.Denmark, however, for some unknown cause does not appear
to have undergone this law of abbreviation; so, says De Maistre with
rather unwonted restraint, let us abstain from generalising.As a matter
of fact, however, the generalisation was complete in his own mind, and
there was nothing inconsistent with his view of the government of the
universe in the fact that a Catholic prince should live longer than a
Protestant; indeed such a fact was the natural condition of his view
being true.Many differences among the people who hold to the
theological interpretation of the circumstances of life arise from the
different degrees of activity which they variously attribute to the
intervention of God, from those who explain the fall of a sparrow to the
ground by a special and direct energy of the divine will, up to those
at the opposite end of the scale, who think that direct participation
ended when the universe was once fairly launched.De Maistre was of
those who see the divine hand on every side and at all times.If, then,
Protestantism was a pernicious rebellion against the faith which God had
provided for the comfort and salvation of men, why should not God be
likely to visit princes, as offenders with the least excuse for their
backslidings, with the curse of shortness of days?In a trenchant passage De Maistre has expounded the Protestant
confession of faith, and shown what astounding gaps it leaves as an
interpretation of the dealings of God with man.'By virtue of a terrible
anathema,' he supposes the Protestant to say, 'inexplicable no doubt,
but much less inexplicable than incontestable, the human race lost all
its rights.Plunged in mortal darkness, it was ignorant of all, since it
was ignorant of God; and, being ignorant of him, it could not pray to
him, so that it was spiritually dead without being able to ask for life.Arrived by rapid degradation at the last stage of debasement, it
outraged nature by its manners, its laws, even by its religions.It
consecrated all vices, it wallowed in filth, and its depravation was
such that the history of those times forms a dangerous picture, which it
is not good for all men so much as to look upon.God, however, _having
dissembled for forty centuries_, bethought him of his creation.At the
appointed moment announced from all time, he did not despise a virgin's
womb; he clothed himself in our unhappy nature, and appeared on the
earth; we saw him, we touched him, he spoke to us; he lived, he taught,
he suffered, he died for us.He arose from his tomb according to his
promise; he appeared again among us, solemnly to assure to his Church a
succour that would last as long as the world.'But, alas, this effort of almighty benevolence was a long way from
securing all the success that had been foretold.For lack of knowledge,
or of strength, or by distraction maybe, God missed his aim, and could
not keep his word.Less sage than a chemist who should undertake to shut
up ether in canvas or paper, he only confided to men the truth that he
had brought upon the earth; it escaped, then, as one might have
foreseen, by all human pores; soon, this holy religion revealed to man
by the Man-God, became no more than an infamous idolatry, which would
remain to this very moment if Christianity after sixteen centuries had
not been suddenly brought back to its original purity by a couple of
sorry creatures.'[23]

Perhaps it would be easier than he supposed to present his own system in
an equally irrational aspect.If you measure the proceedings of
omnipotence by the uses to which a wise and benevolent man would put
such superhuman power, if we can imagine a man of this kind endowed with
it, De Maistre's theory of the extent to which a supreme being
interferes in human things, is after all only a degree less ridiculous
and illogical, less inadequate and abundantly assailable, than that
Protestantism which he so heartily despised.Would it be difficult,
after borrowing the account, which we have just read, of the tremendous
efforts made by a benign creator to shed moral and spiritual light upon
the world, to perplex the Catholic as bitterly as the Protestant, by
confronting him both with the comparatively scanty results of those
efforts, and with the too visible tendencies of all the foremost
agencies in modern civilisation to leave them out of account as forces
practically spent?*       *       *       *       *

De Maistre has been surpassed by no thinker that we know of as a
defender of the old order.If anybody could rationalise the idea of
supernatural intervention in human affairs, the idea of a Papal
supremacy, the idea of a spiritual unity, De Maistre's acuteness and
intellectual vigour, and, above all, his keen sense of the urgent social
need of such a thing being done, would assuredly have enabled him to do
it.In 1817, when he wrote the work in which this task is attempted, the
hopelessness of such an achievement was less obvious than it is now.The Revolution lay in a deep slumber that
many persons excusably took for the quiescence of extinction.Legitimacy
and the spiritual system that was its ally in the face of the
Revolution, though mostly its rival or foe when they were left alone
together, seemed to be restored to the fulness of their power.Fifty
years have elapsed since then, and each year has seen a progressive
decay in the principles which then were triumphant.It was not,
therefore, without reason that De Maistre warned people against
believing '_que la colonne est replacee, parcequ'elle est relevee_.'The
solution which he so elaborately recommended to Europe has shown itself
desperate and impossible.Catholicism may long remain a vital creed to
millions of men, a deep source of spiritual consolation and refreshment,
and a bright lamp in perplexities of conduct and morals; but resting on
dogmas which cannot by any amount of compromise be incorporated with the
daily increasing mass of knowledge, assuming as the condition of its
existence forms of the theological hypothesis which all the
preponderating influences of contemporary thought concur directly or
indirectly in discrediting, upheld by an organisation which its history
for the last five centuries has exposed to the distrust and hatred of
men as the sworn enemy of mental freedom and growth, the pretensions of
Catholicism to renovate society are among the most pitiable and impotent
that ever devout, high-minded, and benevolent persons deluded themselves
into maintaining or accepting.Over the modern invader it is as
powerless as paganism was over the invaders of old.The barbarians of
industrialism, grasping chiefs and mutinous men, give no ear to priest
or pontiff, who speak only dead words, who confront modern issues with
blind eyes, and who stretch out a palsied hand to help.Christianity,
according to a well-known saying, has been tried and failed; the
religion of Christ remains to be tried.One would prefer to qualify the
first clause, by admitting how much Christianity has done for Europe
even with its old organisation, and to restrict the charge of failure
within the limits of the modern time.Whether in changed forms and with new supplements the teaching of its
founder is destined to be the chief inspirer of that social and human
sentiment which seems to be the only spiritual bond capable of uniting
men together again in a common and effective faith, is a question which
it is unnecessary to discuss here.'_They talk about the first centuries
of Christianity_,' said De Maistre, '_I would not be sure that they are
over yet_.'Perhaps not; only if the first centuries are not yet over,
it is certain that the Christianity of the future will have to be so
different from the Christianity of the past, as to demand or deserve
another name.Even if Christianity, itself renewed, could successfully encounter the
achievement of renewing society, De Maistre's ideal of a spiritual power
controlling the temporal power, and conciliating peoples with their
rulers by persuasion and a coercion only moral, appears to have little
chance of being realised.The separation of the two powers is sealed,
with a completeness that is increasingly visible.The principles on
which the process of the emancipation of politics is being so rapidly
carried on, demonstrate that the most marked tendencies of modern
civilisation are strongly hostile to a renewal in any imaginable shape,
or at any future time, of a connection whether of virtual subordination
or nominal equality, which has laid such enormous burdens on the
consciences and understandings of men.If the Church has the uppermost
hand, except in primitive times, it destroys freedom; if the State is
supreme, it destroys spirituality.The free Church in the free State is
an idea that every day more fully recommends itself to the public
opinion of Europe, and the sovereignty of the Pope, like that of all
other spiritual potentates, can only be exercised over those who choose
of their own accord to submit to it; a sovereignty of a kind which De
Maistre thought not much above anarchy.To conclude, De Maistre's mind was of the highest type of those who fill
the air with the arbitrary assumptions of theology, and the abstractions
of the metaphysical stage of thought.At every point you meet the
peremptorily declared volition of a divine being, or the ontological
property of a natural object.The French Revolution is explained by the
will of God; and the kings reign because they have the _esprit royal_.Every truth is absolute, not relative; every explanation is universal,
not historic.These differences in method and point of view amply
explain his arrival at conclusions that seem so monstrous to men who
look upon all knowledge as relative, and insist that the only possible
road to true opinion lies away from volitions and abstractions in the
positive generalisations of experience.There can be no more
satisfactory proof of the rapidity with which we are leaving these
ancient methods, and the social results which they produced, than the
willingness with which every rightly instructed mind now admits how
indispensable were the first, and how beneficial the second.Those can
best appreciate De Maistre and his school, what excellence lay in their
aspirations, what wisdom in their system, who know most clearly why
their aspirations were hopeless, and what makes their system an
anachronism.FOOTNOTES:

[10] De Maistre forgot or underestimated the services of Leo the
Isaurian whose repulse of the Caliph's forces at Constantinople (A.D.717) was perhaps as important for Europe as the more renowned victory of
Charles Martel.But then Leo was an Iconoclast and heretic.Finlay's
_Byzantine Empire_, pp.[11] _Du Pape_, bk.[12] _Du Pape_, bk.'The Greeks,' he
says, 'had at times only a secondary share in the ecclesiastical
controversies in the Eastern Church, though the circumstance of these
controversies having been carried on in the Greek language has made the
natives of Western Europe attribute them to a philosophic, speculative,
and polemic spirit, inherent in the Hellenic mind.A very slight
examination of history is sufficient to prove that several of the
heresies which disturbed the Eastern Church had their origin in the more
profound religious ideas of the oriental nations, and that many of the
opinions called heretical were in a great measure expressions of the
mental nationality of the Syrians, Armenians, Egyptians, and Persians,
and had no conception whatever with the Greek mind.'--_Byzantine Empire,
from 716 to 1057_, p.263) remarks very truly, that 'the religious or
theological portion of Popery, as a section of the Christian Church, is
really Greek; and it is only the ecclesiastical, political, and
theoretic peculiarities of the fabric which can be considered as the
work of the Latin Church.'[14] Sir J. Fitzjames Stephen in the _Saturday Review_, Sept.[15] _Du Pape_, bk.[16] _Ib._ bk.[17] _Ib._ bk.[18] '_Il n'y a point de souverainete qui pour le bonheur des hommes, et
pour le sien surtout, ne soit bornee de quelque maniere, mais dans
l'interieur de ces bornes, placees comme il plait a Dieu, elle est
toujours et partout absolue et tenue pour infaillible.Et quand je parle

pas de ses attributions, est toujours juste_; car c'est la meme chose
DANS LA PRATIQUE, d'etre infaillible, ou de se tromper sans appel.'--Bk.[19] Thomassin, the eminent French theologian, flourished from the
middle to the end of the seventeenth century.The aim of his writings
generally was to reconcile conflicting opinions on discipline or
doctrine by exhibiting a true sense in all.In this spirit he wrote on
the Pope and the Councils, and on the never-ending question of Grace.Among other things, he insisted that all languages could be traced to
the Hebrew.He wrote a defence of the edict in which Lewis XIV.revoked
the Edict of Nantes, contending that it was less harsh than some of the
decrees of Theodosius and Justinian, which the holiest fathers of the
Church had not scrupled to approve--an argument which would now be
thought somewhat too dangerous for common use, as cutting both ways.Gibbon made use of his _Discipline de l'Eglise_ in the twentieth
chapter, and elsewhere.[20] _Du Pape_, bk.[22] Littre, _Auguste Comte et la Phil.[23] _Du Pape_, Conclusion, p.*       *       *       *       *

End of Project Gutenberg's Critical Miscellanies (Vol.Sir Purbeck Temple, uncle to my
son Draper, died suddenly.His lady being
own aunt to my son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no
heir.There had been a new meeting of the commissioners about Greenwich
hospital, on the new commission, where the Lord Mayor, etc.appeared,
but I was prevented by indisposition from attending.The weather very
sharp, winter approaching apace.The King went a progress into the
north, to show himself to the people against the elections, and was
everywhere complimented, except at Oxford, where it was not as he
expected, so that he hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the
theater, did not receive the banquet proposed.Paul's school, who showed me many curious passages out of some
ancient Platonists' MSS.concerning the Trinity, which this great and
learned person would publish, with many other rare things, if he was
encouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.The Archbishop and myself went to Hammersmith, to
visit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a very mortifying
sight.He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious;
also his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling; and other
pretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, etc., and the pump he had
erected that serves water to his garden, and to passengers, with an
inscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most
perfect and pure water.He had newly buried L200 worth of music books
six feet under ground, being, as he said, love songs and vanity.He
plays himself psalms and religious hymns on the theorbo.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th November, 1695.Stanhope, Vicar of Lewisham, preached at
Whitehall.He is one of the most accomplished preachers I ever heard,
for matter, eloquence, action, voice, and I am told, of excellent
conversation.Famous fireworks and very chargeable, the King
being returned from his progress.He stayed seven or eight days at Lord
Sunderland's at Althorpe, where he was mightily entertained.These
fireworks were shown before Lord Romney, master of the ordnance, in St.James's great square, where the King stood.I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury to interest
himself for restoring a room belonging to St.James's library, where the
books want place.Williams continued in Boyle's
lectures another year.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, now the great favorite
and underhand politician, but not adventuring on any character, being
obnoxious to the people for having twice changed his religion.The Parliament wondrously intent on ways to reform
the coin; setting out a Proclamation prohibiting the currency of
half-crowns, etc., which made much confusion among the people.Hitherto mild, dark, misty, weather.Great confusion and distraction by reason of the
clipped money, and the difficulty found in reforming it.An extraordinary wet season, though temperate as to
cold.The "Royal Sovereign" man-of-war burned at Chatham.It was built
in 1637, and having given occasion to the levy of ship money was perhaps
the cause of all the after troubles to this day.An earthquake in
Dorsetshire by Portland, or rather a sinking of the ground suddenly for
a large space, near the quarries of stone, hindering the conveyance of
that material for the finishing St.There was now a conspiracy of about thirty
knights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English <DW7>s,
and Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the
first opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or
to the chapel; and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to
Calais, an invasion was designed.In order to it there was a great army
in readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection
here, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,
King James attending at Calais with the French army.It was discovered
by some of their own party.L1,000 reward was offered to whoever could
apprehend any of the thirty named.Most of those who were engaged in it,
were taken and secured.The Parliament, city, and all the nation,
congratulate the discovery; and votes and resolutions were passed that,
if King William should ever be assassinated, it should be revenged on
the <DW7>s and party through the nation; an Act of Association drawing
up to empower the Parliament to sit on any such accident, till the Crown
should be disposed of according to the late settlement at the
Revolution.All <DW7>s, in the meantime, to be banished ten miles from
London.This put the nation into an incredible disturbance and general
animosity against the French King and King James.The militia of the
nation was raised, several regiments were sent for out of Flanders, and
all things put in a posture to encounter a descent.This was so timed by
the enemy, that while we were already much discontented by the greatness
of the taxes, and corruption of the money, etc., we had like to have had
very few men-of-war near our coasts; but so it pleased God that Admiral
Rooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,
with others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,
and were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could
be got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken.I look
on it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of
God.Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design
of assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many oL his
friends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King
William.The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so
many of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding
their design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and
Dunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they
were so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their
masts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels.French were to
have invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples.Three of the unhappy wretches,
whereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate
the King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of
inciting them to it, and died very penitent.Divers more in danger, and
some very considerable persons.[Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.][Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1696.The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John
Friend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at
Temple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied.I think there never was
such at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles
II., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]

    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into
    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684.Great offense taken at the three ministers who
absolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn.One of them (Snatt)
was a son of my old schoolmaster.This produced much altercation as to
the canonicalness of the action.We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee
about settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years
a more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson.I went to see the
King's House at Kensington.The
gallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of
Titian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,
Tintoretto, and others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty
private library.His prayer before
the sermon was one of the most excellent compositions I ever heard.The Venetian Ambassador made a stately entry with
fifty footmen, many on horseback, four rich coaches, and a numerous
train of gallants.Oates
dedicated a most villainous, reviling book against King James, which he
presumed to present to King William, who could not but abhor it,
speaking so infamously and untruly of his late beloved Queen's own
father.I dined at Lambeth, being summoned to meet my co-trustees,
the Archbishop, Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr.Serjeant Rotheram, to consult
about settling Mr.Boyle's lecture for a perpetuity; which we concluded
upon, by buying a rent charge of L50 per annum, with the stock in our
hands.I went to Lambeth, to meet at dinner the Countess of
Sunderland and divers ladies.We dined in the Archbishop's wife's
apartment with his Grace, and stayed late; yet I returned to Deptford at
night.I went to London to meet my son, newly come from
Ireland, indisposed.Money still continuing exceedingly scarce, so that
none was paid or received, but all was on trust, the mint not supplying
for common necessities.The Association with an oath required of all
lawyers and officers, on pain of _praemunire_, whereby men were obliged
to renounce King James as no rightful king, and to revenge King
William's death, if happening by assassination.This to be taken by all
the Counsel by a day limited, so that the Courts of Chancery and King's
Bench hardly heard any cause in Easter Term, so many crowded to take the
oath.This was censured as a very entangling contrivance of the
Parliament in expectation, that many in high office would lay down, and
others surrender.Many gentlemen taken up on suspicion of the late plot,
were now discharged out of prison.We settled divers offices, and other matters relating to
workmen, for the beginning of Greenwich hospital.[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]

1st June, 1696.I went to Deptford to dispose of our goods, in order to
letting the house for three years to Vice Admiral Benbow, with condition
to keep up the garden.A committee met at Whitehall about Greenwich Hospital,
at Sir Christopher Wren's, his Majesty's Surveyor-General.We made the
first agreement with divers workmen and for materials; and gave the
first order for proceeding on the foundation, and for weekly payments to
the workmen, and a general account to be monthly.Dined at Lord Pembroke's, Lord Privy Seal, a very
worthy gentleman.He showed me divers rare pictures of very many of the
old and best masters, especially one of M. Angelo of a man gathering
fruit to give to a woman, and a large book of the best drawings of the
old masters.Sir John Fenwick, one of the conspirators, was taken.Great
subscriptions in Scotland to their East India Company.Want of current
money to carry on the smallest concerns, even for daily provisions in
the markets.Guineas lowered to twenty-two shillings, and great sums
daily transported to Holland, where it yields more, with other treasure
sent to pay the armies, and nothing considerable coined of the new and
now only current stamp, cause such a scarcity that tumults are every day
feared, nobody paying or receiving money; so imprudent was the late
Parliament to condemn the old though clipped and corrupted, till they
had provided supplies.To this add the fraud of the bankers and
goldsmiths, who having gotten immense riches by extortion, keep up their
treasure in expectation of enhancing its value.Duncombe, not long since
a mean goldsmith, having made a purchase of the late Duke of
Buckingham's estate at nearly L90,000, and reputed to have nearly as
much in cash.Banks and lotteries every day set up.The famous trial between my Lord Bath and Lord Montague
for an estate of L11,000 a year, left by the Duke of Albemarle, wherein
on several trials had been spent,L20,000 between them.The Earl of Bath
was cast on evident forgery.I made my Lord Cheney a visit at Chelsea, and saw those
ingenious waterworks invented by Mr.Winstanley, wherein were some
things very surprising and extraordinary.An exceedingly rainy, cold, unseasonable summer, yet
the city was very healthy.A trial in the Common Pleas between the Lady Purbeck
Temple and Mr.Temple, a nephew of Sir Purbeck, concerning a deed set up
to take place of several wills.The
cause went on my lady's side.This concerning my son-in-law, Draper, I
stayed almost all day at Court.A great supper was given to the jury,
being persons of the best condition in Buckinghamshire.I went with a select committee of the Commissioners for
Greenwich Hospital, and with Sir Christopher Wren, where with him I laid
the first stone of the intended foundation, precisely at five o'clock in
the evening, after we had dined together.Flamstead, the King's
Astronomical Professor, observing the punctual time by instruments.Note that my Lord Godolphin was the first of the
subscribers who paid any money to this noble fabric.A northern wind altering the weather with a continual
and impetuous rain of three days and nights changed it into perfect
winter.So little money in the nation that Exchequer Tallies,
of which I had for L2,000 on the best fund in England, the Post Office,
nobody would take at 30 per cent discount.The Bank lending the L200,000 to pay the array in
Flanders, that had done nothing against the enemy, had so exhausted the
treasure of the nation, that one could not have borrowed money under 14
or 15 per cent on bills, or on Exchequer Tallies under 30 per cent.I went to Lambeth and dined with the
Archbishop, who had been at Court on the complaint against Dr.David's, who was suspended for simony.The
Archbishop told me how unsatisfied he was with the Canon law, and how
exceedingly unreasonable all their pleadings appeared to him.Fine seasonable weather, and a great harvest after a
cold, wet summer.I went to congratulate the marriage of a daughter
of Mr.Boscawen to the son of Sir Philip Meadows; she is niece to my
Lord Godolphin, married at Lambeth by the Archbishop, 30th of August.After above six months' stay in London about Greenwich Hospital, I
returned to Wotton.Unseasonable stormy weather, and an ill seedtime.Lord Godolphin retired from the Treasury, who was the
first Commissioner and most skillful manager of all.The first frost began fiercely, but lasted not long.15th-23d November, 1696.Very stormy weather, rain, and inundations.The severe frost and weather relented, but again
froze with snow.Sir John
Fenwick was beheaded.Soldiers in the
armies and garrison towns frozen to death on their posts.I came to Wotton after three months' absence.Very bright weather, but with sharp east wind.My son
came from London in his melancholy indisposition.Duncombe, the rector, came and preached after
an absence of two years, though only living seven or eight miles off [at
Ashted].So great were the storms all this week, that near a
thousand people were lost going into the Texel.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th November, 1697.The King's entry very pompous; but is nothing
approaching that of King Charles II.Thanksgiving Day for the Peace, the King and a great
Court at Whitehall.The Bishop of Salisbury preached, or rather made a
florid panegyric, on 2 Chron.The evening concluded with
fireworks and illuminations of great expense.Paul's had had service
performed in it since it was burned in 1666.I went to Kensington with the Sheriff, Knights, and
chief gentlemen of Surrey, to present their address to the King.The
Duke of Norfolk promised to introduce it, but came so late, that it was
presented before be came.This insignificant ceremony was brought in in
Cromwell's time, and has ever since continued with offers of life and
fortune to whoever happened to have the power.I dined at Sir Richard
Onslow's, who treated almost all the gentlemen of Surrey.When we had
half dined, the Duke of Norfolk came in to make his excuse.At the Temple Church; it was very long before the
service began, staying for the Comptroller of the Inner Temple, where
was to be kept a riotous and reveling Christmas, according to custom.Bentley, about the Library at
St.A great Christmas kept at Wotton, open house, much company.I
presented my book of Medals, etc., to divers noblemen, before I exposed
it to sale.Fulham, who lately married my niece, preached
against atheism, a very eloquent discourse, somewhat improper for most
of the audience at [Wotton], but fitted for some other place, and very
apposite to the profane temper of the age.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th January, 1698.Whitehall burned, nothing but walls and ruins left.The imprisonment of the great banker, Duncombe:
censured by Parliament; acquitted by the Lords; sent again to the Tower
by the Commons.The Czar of Muscovy being come to England, and having a mind to see the
building of ships, hired my house at Sayes Court, and made it his court
and palace, newly furnished for him by the King.[84]

    [Footnote 84: While the Czar was in his house.Evelyn's servant
    writes to him: "There is a house full of people, and right nasty.The Czar lies next your library, and dines in the parlor next your
    study.He dines at ten o'clock and at six at night; is very seldom
    at home a whole day; very often in the King's yard, or by water,
    dressed in several dresses.The King is expected here this day; the
    best parlor is pretty clean for him to be entertained in.The King
    pays for all he has."]The Czar went from my house to return home.An
exceedingly sharp and cold season.An extraordinary great snow and frost, nipping the corn
and other fruits.Corn at nine shillings a bushel [L18 a load].Pepys's, where I heard the rare voice of
Mr.Pule, who was lately come from Italy, reputed the most excellent
singer we had ever had.White, late Bishop of Norwich, who had been ejected
for not complying with Government, was buried in St.Gregory's

non-juror bishops, Dr.Lloyd, with forty other
non-juror clergymen, who would not stay the Office of the burial,
because the Dean of St.Paul's had appointed a conforming minister to
read the Office; at which all much wondered, there being nothing in that
Office which mentioned the present King.Godolphin
with the Earl of Marlborough's daughter.To Deptford, to see how miserably the Czar had left my
house, after three months making it his Court.I got Sir Christopher
Wren, the King's surveyor, and Mr.London, his gardener, to go and
estimate the repairs, for which they allowed L150 in their report to the
Lords of the Treasury.I then went to see the foundation of the Hall and
Chapel at Greenwich Hospital.I dined with Pepys, where was Captain Dampier,[85] who
had been a famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted Prince Job,
and printed a relation of his very strange adventure, and his
observations.He was now going abroad again by the King's encouragement,
who furnished a ship of 290 tons.He seemed a more modest man than one
would imagine by the relation of the crew he had assorted with.He
brought a map of his observations of the course of the winds in the
South Sea, and assured us that the maps hitherto extant were all false
as to the Pacific Sea, which he makes on the south of the line, that on
the north end running by the coast of Peru being extremely tempestuous.[Footnote 85: The celebrated navigator, born in 1652, the time of

Sunderland for his being made Professor of Physic at Oxford, in the
King's gift.I went also to the Archbishop in his behalf.Being one of the Council of the Royal Society, I was
named to be of the committee to wait on our new President, the Lord
Chancellor, our Secretary, Dr.Sloane, and Sir R. Southwell, last
Vice-President, carrying our book of statutes; the office of the
President being read, his Lordship subscribed his name, and took the
oaths according to our statutes as a Corporation for the improvement of
natural knowledge.Then his Lordship made a short compliment concerning
the honor the Society had done him, and how ready he would be to promote
so noble a design, and come himself among us, as often as the attendance
on the public would permit; and so we took our leave.She was daughter to Sir
John Evelyn, of Wilts, my father's nephew; she was widow to William
Pierrepoint, brother to the Marquis of Dorchester, and mother to Evelyn
Pierrepoint, Earl of Kingston; a most excellent and prudent lady.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The House of Commons persist in refusing more than 7,000 men to be a
standing army, and no strangers to be in the number.Our county member, Sir R. Onslow, opposed it also; which
might reconcile him to the people, who began to suspect him.Mander, the
Master of Baliol College, where he was entered a fellow-commoner.A most furious wind, such as has not happened for
many years, doing great damage to houses and trees, by the fall of which
several persons were killed.The old East India Company lost their business against
the new Company, by ten votes in Parliament, so many of their friends
being absent, going to see a tiger baited by dogs.The persecuted Vaudois, who were banished out of Savoy, were received by
the German Protestant Princes.My only remaining son died after a tedious languishing
sickness, contracted in Ireland, and increased here, to my exceeding
grief and affliction; leaving me one grandson, now at Oxford, whom I
pray God to prosper and be the support of the Wotton family.He was aged
forty-four years and about three months.He had been six years one of
the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland, with great ability and
reputation.After an extraordinary storm, there came up the Thames
a whale which was fifty-six feet long.Such, and a larger of the spout
kind, was killed there forty years ago (June 1658).My deceased son was buried in the vault at Wotton,
according to his desire.The Duke of Devon lost L1,900 at a horse race at Newmarket.The King preferring his young favorite Earl of Albemarle to be first
Commander of his Guard, the Duke of Ormond laid down his commission.This of the Dutch Lord passing over his head, was exceedingly resented
by everybody.Lord Spencer purchased an incomparable library[86] of...
wherein, among other rare books, were several that were printed at the
first invention of that wonderful art, as particularly "Tully's Offices,
etc."There was a Homer and a Suidas in a very good Greek character and
good paper, almost as ancient.This gentleman is a very fine scholar,
whom from a child I have known.[Footnote 86: The foundation of the noble library now at Blenheim.]I dined with the Archbishop; but my business was to
get him to persuade the King to purchase the late Bishop of Worcester's
library, and build a place for his own library at St.James's, in the
Park, the present one being too small.At a meeting of the Royal Society I was nominated to be of
the committee to wait on the Lord Chancellor to move the King to
purchase the Bishop of Worcester's library (Dr.The Court party have little influence in this Session.The Duke of Ormond restored to his commission.All
Lotteries, till now cheating the people, to be no longer permitted than
to Christmas, except that for the benefit of Greenwich Hospital.Bridgman, chairman of the committee for that charitable work, died; a
great loss to it.He was Clerk of the Council, a very industrious,
useful man.John Moore,[87] Bishop of Norwich,
one of the best and most ample collection of all sorts of good books in
England, and he, one of the most learned men.[Footnote 87: Afterward Bishop of Ely.He died 31st of July, 1714.King George I. purchased this library after the Bishop's death, for
    L6,000, and presented it to the University of Cambridge, where it
    now is.]After a long drought, we had a refreshing shower.The
day before, there was a dreadful fire at Rotherhithe, near the Thames
side, which burned divers ships, and consumed nearly three hundred
houses.Now died the famous Duchess of Mazarin; she had been the richest
lady in Europe.She was niece of Cardinal Mazarin, and was married to
the richest subject in Europe, as is said.She was born at Rome,
educated in France, and was an extraordinary beauty and wit but
dissolute and impatient of matrimonial restraint, so as to be abandoned
by her husband, and banished, when she came into England for shelter,
lived on a pension given her here, and is reported to have hastened her
death by intemperate drinking strong spirits.She has written her own
story and adventures, and so has her other extravagant sister, wife to
the noble family of Colonna.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th June, 1699.This week died Conyers Seymour, son of Sir Edward
Seymour, killed in a duel caused by a slight affront in St.James's
Park, given him by one who was envious of his gallantries; for he was a
vain, foppish young man, who made a great _eclat_ about town by his
splendid equipage and boundless expense.He was about twenty-three years
old; his brother, now at Oxford, inherited an estate of L7,000 a year,
which had fallen to him not two years before.My cousin, George Evelyn, of Nutfield, died suddenly.The heat has been so great, almost all this month, that
I do not remember to have felt much greater in Italy, and this after a
winter the wettest, though not the coldest, that I remember for fifty
years last past.Finding my occasions called me so often to London, I
took the remainder of the lease my son had in a house in Dover Street,
to which I now removed, not taking my goods from Wotton.Seasonable showers, after a continuance of excessive
drought and heat.At Deptford, they had
been building a pretty new church.David's [Watson]
deprived for simony.[88] The city of Moscow burnt by the throwing of
squibs.[Footnote 88: _Ante_, p.There was in this week an eclipse of the sun, at
which many were frightened by the predictions of the astrologers.I
remember fifty years ago that many were so terrified by Lilly, that they
dared not go out of their houses.A strange earthquake at New Batavia,
in the East Indies.My worthy brother died at Wotton, in the 83d year of
his age, of perfect memory and understanding.He was religious, sober,
and temperate, and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the
county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as it were, open house
the whole year in the same manner, or gave more noble or free
entertainment to the county on all occasions, so that his house was
never free.There were sometimes twenty persons more than his family,
and some that stayed there all the summer, to his no small expense; by
this he gained the universal love of the county.He was born at Wotton,
went from the free school at Guildford to Trinity College, Oxford,
thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of the best quality did, but
without intention to study the law as a profession.He married the
daughter of Colwall, of a worthy and ancient family in Leicestershire,
by whom he had one son; she dying in 1643, left George her son an
infant, who being educated liberally, after traveling abroad, returned
and married one Mrs.Gore, by whom he had several children, but only
three daughters survived.He was a young man of good understanding, but,
over-indulging his ease and pleasure, grew so very corpulent, contrary
to the constitution of the rest of his father's relations, that he died.My brother afterward married a noble and honorable lady, relict of Sir
John Cotton, she being an Offley, a worthy and ancient Staffordshire
family, by whom he had several children of both sexes.This lady died,
leaving only two daughters and a son.The younger daughter died before
marriage; the other afterward married Sir Cyril Wych, a noble and
learned gentleman (son of Sir ---- Wych), who had been Ambassador at
Constantinople, and was afterward made one of the Lords Justices of
Ireland.Before this marriage, her only brother married the daughter of
---- Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honorable family, but left a widow
without any child living; he died about 1691, and his wife not many
years after, and my brother resettled the whole estate on me.His
sister, Wych, had a portion of L6,000, to which was added L300 more; the
three other daughters, with what I added, had about L5,000 each.My
brother died on the 5th of October, in a good old age and great
reputation, making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix,
leaving me only his library and some pictures of my father, mother, etc.She buried him with extraordinary solemnity, rather as a nobleman than
as a private gentleman.There were, as I computed, above 2,000 persons
at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county doing him the last
honors.I returned to London, till my lady should dispose of herself and
family.After an unusual warm and pleasant season, we were
surprised with a very sharp frost.I presented my "_Acetaria_,"
dedicated to my Lord Chancellor, who returned me thanks in an
extraordinarily civil letter.There happened this week so thick a mist and fog,
that people lost their way in the streets, it being so intense that no
light of candles, or torches, yielded any (or but very little)
direction.Robberies were committed between
the very lights which were fixed between London and Kensington on both
sides, and while coaches and travelers were passing.It began about four
in the afternoon, and was quite gone by eight, without any wind to
disperse it.At the Thames, they beat drums to direct the watermen to
make the shore.At our chapel in the evening there was a sermon
preached by young Mr.Horneck, chaplain to Lord Guilford, whose lady's
funeral had been celebrated magnificently the Thursday before.A
panegyric was now pronounced, describing the extraordinary piety and
excellently employed life of this amiable young lady.She died in
childbed a few days before, to the excessive sorrow of her husband, who
ordered the preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life,
exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the course of his
life, which was before in great danger of being perverted; following the
mode of this dissolute age.Her devotion, early piety, charity,
fastings, economy, disposition of her time in reading, praying,
recollections in her own handwriting of what she heard and read, and her
conversation were most exemplary.Blackwell's election to be the next
year's Boyles Lecturer.Such horrible robberies and murders were committed, as had not been
known in this nation; atheism, profaneness, blasphemy, among all sorts,
portended some judgment if not amended; on which a society was set on
foot, who obliged themselves to endeavor the reforming of it, in London
and other places, and began to punish offenders and put the laws in more
strict execution; which God Almighty prosper!A gentle, calm, dry,
temperate weather all this season of the year, but now came sharp, hard
frost, and mist, but calm.Calm, bright, and warm as in the middle of April.So
continued on 21st of January.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The Parliament reverses the prodigious donations of the Irish
forfeitures, which were intended to be set apart for discharging the
vast national debt.They called some great persons in the highest
offices in question for setting the Great Seal to the pardon of an
arch-pirate,[89] who had turned pirate again, and brought prizes into
the West Indies, suspected to be connived at on sharing the prey; but
the prevailing part in the House called Courtiers, out-voted the
complaints, not by being more in number, but by the country party being
negligent in attendance.[Footnote 89: Captain Kidd; he was hanged about two years afterward
    with some of his accomplices.This was one of the charges brought by
    the Commons against Lord Somers.]14th January, 1699-1700.Stringfellow, who had been made the first preacher at our chapel by
the Bishop of Lincoln [Dr.Tenison, now Archbishop], while he held St.Martin's by dispensation, and put in one Mr.Sandys, much against the
inclination of those who frequented the chapel.The Scotch book about
Darien was burned by the hangman by vote of Parliament.[90]

    [Footnote 90: The volume alluded to was "An Enquiry into the Causes
    of the Miscarriage of the Scots Colony at Darien: Or an Answer to a
    Libel," entitled "A Defense of the Scots abdicating Darien."See
    Votes of the House of Commons, 15th January, 1699-1700.]Died the Duke of Beaufort, a person of great honor,
prudence, and estate.I went to Wotton, the first time after my brother's
funeral, to furnish the house with necessaries, Lady Wych and my nephew
Glanville, the executors having sold and disposed of what goods were
there of my brother's.The weather was now altering into sharp and hard
frost.[Sidenote: LONDON]

One Stephens, who preached before the House of Commons on King Charles's
Martyrdom, told them that the observation of that day was not intended
out of any detestation of his murder, but to be a lesson to other Kings
and Rulers, how they ought to behave themselves toward their subjects,
lest they should come to the same end.This was so resented that, though
it was usual to desire these anniversary sermons to be printed, they
refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no one should preach
before them, who was not either a Dean or a Doctor of Divinity.The Parliament voted against the Scots settling in
Darien as being prejudicial to our trade with Spain.They also voted
that the exorbitant number of attorneys be lessened (now indeed
swarming, and evidently causing lawsuits and disturbance, eating out the
estates of the people, provoking them to go to law).Mild and calm season, with gentle frost, and little
mizzling rain.Martin's frequently preached at Trinity
chapel in the afternoon.The season was like April for warmth and
mildness.--11th.On Wednesday, was a sermon at our chapel, to be
continued during Lent.I was at the funeral of my Lady Temple, who was buried
at Islington, brought from Addiscombe, near Croydon.She left my
son-in-law Draper (her nephew) the mansion house of Addiscombe, very
nobly and completely furnished, with the estate about it, with plate and
jewels, to the value in all of about L20,000.She was a very prudent
lady, gave many great legacies, with L500 to the poor of Islington,
where her husband, Sir Purbeck Temple, was buried, both dying without
issue.The season warm, gentle, and exceedingly pleasant.Divers persons of quality entered into the Society for Reformation[91]
of Manners; and some lectures were set up, particularly in the city of
London.The most eminent of the clergy preached at Bow Church, after
reading a declaration set forth by the King to suppress the growing
wickedness; this began already to take some effect as to common
swearing, and oaths in the mouths of people of all ranks.[Footnote 91: _Ante_, p.Burnet preached to-day before the Lord Mayor and a
very great congregation, on Proverbs xxvii.5, 6, "Open rebuke is better
than secret love; the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of
an enemy."He made a very pathetic discourse concerning the necessity
and advantage of friendly correction.The Duke of Norfolk now succeeded in obtaining a divorce
from his wife by the Parliament for adultery with Sir John Germaine, a
Dutch gamester, of mean extraction, who had got much by gaming; the Duke
had leave to marry again, so that if he should have children, the
Dukedom will go from the late Lord Thomas's children, <DW7>s indeed,
but very hopeful and virtuous gentlemen, as was their father.The now
Duke their uncle is a Protestant.The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into Ireland as
commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, toward payment
of the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great
measure given to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others
of little merit, and very unseasonably.That this might be done without
suspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member
of either House should be in the commission.The great contest between
the Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and
rejecting bills tacked to the money bill, carried for the Commons.However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King
Charles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass
rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance.This was
carried but by one voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the
Court, save one; so that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph
of the Commons and Country party, but high regret of the Court, and
those to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland.Pity it is,
that things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this
nation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are
satisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection on this side
heaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too
far.Among the rest, there passed a law as to <DW7>s' estates, that if
one turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass
to his next Protestant heir.This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only
the usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the
indiscreet insolence of the <DW7>s here, going in triumphant and public
processions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers
places (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their
party.This week there was a great change of State officers.The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of
Jersey, the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat.Vernon,
Secretary of State, was put out.The Seal was taken from the Lord
Chancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted by a great majority of
votes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons.This
being in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers
refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in
this fluctuating conjuncture.It is certain that this Chancellor was a
most excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior
pen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is
said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in
place in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known.But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and
liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their
jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which
protected the people from tyranny.A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of fruit of all kinds,
and a propitious year.The great trial between Sir Walter Clarges and Mr.Sherwin concerning the legitimacy of the late Duke of Albemarle, on
which depended an estate of L1,500 a year; the verdict was given for Sir
Walter, 19th.Serjeant Wright at last accepted the Great Seal.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

24th May, 1700.I went from Dover street to Wotton, for the rest of the
summer, and removed thither the rest of my goods from Sayes Court.A sweet season, with a mixture of refreshing showers.In the afternoon, our clergyman had a catechism,
which was continued for some time.I was visited with illness, but it pleased God that I
recovered, for which praise be ascribed to him by me, and that he has
again so graciously advertised me of my duty to prepare for my latter
end, which at my great age, cannot be far off.The Duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of Denmark, died of the
smallpox.I went to Harden, which was originally a barren warren
bought by Sir Robert Clayton, who built there a pretty house, and made
such alteration by planting not only an infinite store of the best
fruit; but so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys, and
solitary mountains about it, that it rather represented some foreign
country, which would produce spontaneously pines, firs, cypress, yew,
holly, and juniper; they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,
mazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the utmost care, so
that I who had seen it some years before in its naked and barren
condition, was in admiration of it.The land was bought of Sir John
Evelyn, of Godstone, and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement
by the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen.He and his lady
received us with great civility.The tombs in the church at Croydon of
Archbishops Grindal, Whitgift, and other Archbishops, are fine and
venerable; but none comparable to that of the late Archbishop Sheldon,
which, being all of white marble, and of a stately ordinance and
carvings, far surpassed the rest, and I judge could not cost less than
L700 or L800.I went to Beddington, the ancient seat of the
Carews, in my remembrance a noble old structure, capacious, and in form
of the buildings of the age of Henry VIII.and Queen Elizabeth, and
proper for the old English hospitality, but now decaying with the house
itself, heretofore adorned with ample gardens, and the first orange
trees[92] that had been seen in England, planted in the open ground, and
secured in winter only by a tabernacle of boards and stoves removable in
summer, that, standing 120 years, large and goodly trees, and laden with
fruit, were now in decay, as well as the grotto, fountains, cabinets,
and other curiosities in the house and abroad, it being now fallen to a
child under age, and only kept by a servant or two from utter
dilapidation.The estate and park about it also in decay.[Footnote 92: Oranges were eaten in this kingdom much earlier than
    the time of King James I.]Pepys at Clapham, where he has
a very noble and wonderfully well-furnished house, especially with
Indian and Chinese curiosities.The offices and gardens well
accommodated for pleasure and retirement.My birthday now completed the 80th year of my age.I
with my soul render thanks to God, who, of his infinite mercy, not only
brought me out of many troubles, but this year restored me to health,
after an ague and other infirmities of so great an age; my sight,
hearing, and other senses and faculties tolerable, which I implore him
to continue, with the pardon of my sins past, and grace to acknowledge
by my improvement of his goodness the ensuing year, if it be his
pleasure to protract my life, that I may be the better prepared for my
last day, through the infinite merits of my blessed Savior, the Lord
Jesus, Amen!Came the news of my dear grandson (the only male of
my family now remaining) being fallen ill of the smallpox at Oxford,
which after the dire effects of it in my family exceedingly afflicted
me; but so it pleased my most merciful God that being let blood at his
first complaint, and by the extraordinary care of Dr.Mander (Head of
the college and now Vice Chancellor), who caused him to be brought and
lodged in his own bed and bedchamber, with the advice of his physician
and care of his tutor, there were all fair hopes of his recovery, to our
infinite comfort.We had a letter every day either from the Vice
Chancellor himself, or his tutor.Assurance of his recovery by a letter from himself.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was a change of great officers at Court.Lord Godolphin returned
to his former station of first Commissioner of the Treasury; Sir Charles
Hedges, Secretary of State.At the Royal Society, Lord Somers, the late
Chancellor, was continued President.Great alterations of officers at Court, and
elsewhere,--Lord Chief Justice Treby died; he was a learned man in his
profession, of which we have now few, never fewer; the Chancery
requiring so little skill in deep law-learning, if the practicer can
talk eloquently in that Court; so that probably few care to study the
law to any purpose.Lord Marlborough Master of the Ordnance, in place of
Lord Romney made Groom of the Stole.The Earl of Rochester goes Lord
Lieutenant to Ireland.I finished the sale of North Stoake in Sussex to
Robert Michell, Esq., appointed by my brother to be sold for payment of
portions to my nieces, and other incumbrances on the estate.An exceeding deep snow, and melted away as suddenly.Severe frost, and such a tempest as threw down many
chimneys, and did great spoil at sea, and blew down above twenty trees
of mine at Wotton.Harley, an able
gentleman, chosen.Our countryman, Sir Richard Onslow, had a party for
him.By an order of the House of Commons, I laid before
the Speaker the state of what had been received and paid toward the
building of Greenwich Hospital.Wye, Rector of Wotton, died, a very worthy good man.Bohun, a learned person and excellent preacher, who had been my
son's tutor, and lived long in my family.I let Sayes Court to Lord Carmarthen, son to the Duke
of Leeds.I went to the funeral of my sister Draper, who was
buried at Edmonton in great state.Davenant displeased the clergy
now met in Convocation by a passage in his book, p.A Dutch boy of about eight or nine years old was carried
about by his parents to show, who had about the iris of one eye the
letters of _Deus meus_, and of the other _Elohim_, in the Hebrew
character.How this was done by artifice none could imagine; his parents
affirming that he was so born.It did not prejudice his sight, and he
seemed to be a lively playing boy.Everybody went to see him; physicians
and philosophers examined it with great accuracy; some considered it as
artificial, others as almost supernatural.The Duke of Norfolk died of an apoplexy, and Mr.Thomas
Howard of complicated disease since his being cut for the stone; he was
one of the Tellers of the Exchequer.Some Kentish men, delivering a petition to the House of
Commons, were imprisoned.[93]

    [Footnote 93: Justinian Champneys, Thomas Culpepper, William
    Culpepper, William Hamilton, and David Polhill, gentlemen of
    considerable property and family in the county.There is a very good
    print of them in five ovals on one plate, engraved by R. White, in
    1701.They desired the Parliament to mind the public more, and their
    private heats less.They were confined till the prorogation, and
    were much visited.A great dearth, no considerable rain having fallen for some months.Very plentiful showers, the wind coming west and south.The Bishops and Convocation at difference concerning the right of

20th June, 1701.The Commons demanded a conference with the Lords on the
trial of Lord Somers, which the Lords refused, and proceeding on the
trial, the Commons would not attend, and he was acquitted.I went to congratulate the arrival of that worthy and
excellent person my Lord Galway, newly come out of Ireland, where he had
behaved himself so honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the
people: but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman, though they had
not a more worthy, valiant, discreet, and trusty person in the two
kingdoms, on whom they could have relied for his conduct and fitness.He
was one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his father, for
being Protestants.My Lord Treasurer made my grandson one of the Commissioners
of the prizes, salary L500 per annum.My grandson went to Sir Simon Harcourt, the
Solicitor-General, to Windsor, to wait on my Lord Treasurer.There had
been for some time a proposal of marrying my grandson to a daughter of
Mrs.Boscawen, sister of my Lord Treasurer, which was now far advanced.I subscribed toward rebuilding Oakwood Chapel, now,
after 200 years, almost fallen down.The weather changed from heat not much less than in Italy
or Spain for some few days, to wet, dripping, and cold, with
intermissions of fair.I went to Kensington, and saw the house,
plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr.Wise, who was there to receive
me.The death of King James, happening on the 15th of this month, N. S.,
after two or three days' indisposition, put an end to that unhappy
Prince's troubles, after a short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly
attempting to bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the Jesuits; which the
nation would not endure.Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague about the Duke
of Albemarle's estate, claiming under a will supposed to have been
forged, is said to have been worth L10,000 to the lawyers.His eldest
son shot himself a few days after his father's death; for what cause is
not clear.He was a most hopeful young man, and had behaved so bravely
against the Turks at the siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a
Count of the Empire.It was falsely reported that Sir Edward Seymour was
dead, a great man; he had often been Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and
in many other lucrative offices.He was of a hasty spirit, not at all
sincere, but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.I kept my first courts in Surrey, which took up
the whole week.Hervey, a Counsellor, Justice of
Peace, and Member of Parliament, and my neighbor.I gave him six
guineas, which was a guinea a day, and to Mr.Martin, his clerk, three
guineas.I was this day 81 complete, in tolerable health,
considering my great age.I gave my vote and
interest to Sir R. Onslow and Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1701-02.At the Royal Society there was read and approved
the delineation and description of my Tables of Veins and Arteries, by
Mr.Cooper, the chirurgeon, in order to their being engraved.The King had a fall from his horse, and broke his
collar bone, and having been much indisposed before, and aguish, with a
long cough and other weakness, died this Sunday morning, about four
o'clock.I carried my accounts of Greenwich Hospital to the Committee.My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed this life this
morning after a long languishing illness, leaving a son by my sister,
and two granddaughters.Our relation and friendship had been long and
great.He died in the 84th year of his
age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and carried down to
Greenwich, put on board a ship, and buried in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, about the Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or
Wednesday after.This occasioned much discourse, he having no relation
at all to the sea.He was a gentleman of an ancient family in
Devonshire, and married my sister Jane.By his prudent parsimony he much
improved his fortune.He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might
have been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of what he had laid out
on repairs, amounting to L1,900.The report of the committee sent to examine the state of
Greenwich hospital was delivered to the House of Commons, much to their
satisfaction.Being elected a member of the Society lately incorporated for the
propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts, I subscribed L10 per annum
toward the carrying it on.We agreed that every missioner, besides the
L20 to set him forth, should have L50 per annum out of the stock of the
Corporation, till his settlement was worth to him L100 per annum.We
sent a young divine to New York.I dined at the Archbishop's with the newly made Bishop
of Carlisle, Dr.Nicolson, my worthy and learned correspondent.I went to Wotton with my family for the rest of the
summer, and my son-in-law, Draper, with his family, came to stay with
us, his house at Addiscombe being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty.Most of the new Parliament were chosen of Church of
England principles, against the peevish party.The Queen was
magnificently entertained at Oxford and all the towns she passed through
on her way to Bath.Arrived now to the 82d year of my age, having read
over all that passed since this day twelvemonth in these notes, I render
solemn thanks to the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring that he
will continue his assistance, and prepare me for my blessed Savior's
coming, that I may obtain a comfortable departure, after so long a term
as has been hitherto indulged me.I find by many infirmities this year
(especially nephritic pains) that I much decline; and yet of his
infinite mercy retain my intellect and senses in great measure above
most of my age.I have this year repaired much of the mansion house and
several tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements.My
wife, children, and family in health: for all which I most sincerely
beseech Almighty God to accept of these my acknowledgments, and that if
it be his holy will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul.My kinsman, John Evelyn, of Nutfield, a young and
very hopeful gentleman, and Member of Parliament, after having come to
Wotton to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and there died
of the smallpox.He left a brother, a commander in the army in Holland,
to inherit a fair estate.Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea and land, that
there has not been so great an union in Parliament, Court, and people,
in memory of man, which God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue!The Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both Houses of
Parliament at St.Paul's; they were wonderfully huzzaed in their
passage, and splendidly entertained in the city.The expectation now is, what treasure will be found on
breaking bulk of the galleon brought from Vigo by Sir George Rooke,
which being made up in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not
begun to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of the Privy
Council, two of the chief magistrates of the city, and the Lord
Treasurer.After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on the Earl of
Marlborough, by making him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke, for the
success of but one campaign, that he should desire L5,000 a year to be
settled on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought a bold
and unadvised request, as he had, besides his own considerable estate,
above L30,000 a year in places and employments, with L50,000 at
interest.He had married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third to the Earl of
Bridgewater.He is a very handsome person, well-spoken and affable, and
supports his want of acquired knowledge by keeping good company.News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict with the French
fleet in the West Indies, in which he gallantly behaved himself, and was
wounded, and would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance; for this,
two of their commanders were tried by a Council of War, and
executed;[94] a third was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, loss of
pay, and incapacity to serve in future.[Footnote 94: The Captains Kirby and Wade, having been tried and
    condemned to die by a court-martial held on them in the West Indies,
    were sent home in the "Bristol;" and, on its arrival at Portsmouth
    were both shot on board, not being suffered to land on English
    ground.]Oglethorpe (son of the late Sir Theo.fought on occasion of some words which passed at a committee of the
House.Oglethorpe was disarmed.The Bill against occasional
conformity was lost by one vote.Corn and provisions so cheap that the
farmers are unable to pay their rents.[Sidenote: LONDON]

February, 1703.A famous cause at the King's Bench between Mr.Fenwick
and his wife, which went for him with a great estate.The Duke of
Marlborough lost his only son at Cambridge by the smallpox.A great
earthquake at Rome, etc.A famous young woman, an Italian, was hired by
our comedians to sing on the stage, during so many plays, for which they
gave her L500; which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above all with such
skill, that there was never any who did anything comparable with their
voices.She was to go home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I
believe carried with her out of this vain nation above L1,000, everybody
coveting to hear her at their private houses.Samuel Pepys, a very worthy,
industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through all the most
considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity.went
out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but
withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with
his partner, Mr.Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and
sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of his labors in great
prosperity.He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in
many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men of
whom he had the conversation.His library and collection of other
curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships
especially.Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he
found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of
the Navy, or _Navalia_, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what
will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr.Pepys had educated in all sorts of
useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned
with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir.Pepys had
been for near forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr.Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at
his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing
him this last office.Rains have been great and continual, and now, near
midsummer, cold and wet.I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles from Wotton, to
see my son-in-law's new house, the outside, to the coving, being such
excellent brickwork, based with Portland stone, with the pilasters,
windows, and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good and
solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's houses in
Surrey, when finished.I returned to Wotton in the evening, though
weary.The last week in this month an uncommon long-continued
rain, and the Sunday following, thunder and lightning.The new Commission for Greenwich hospital was sealed
and opened, at which my son-in-law, Draper, was present, to whom I
resigned my office of Treasurer.From August 1696, there had been
expended in building L89,364 14s.This day, being eighty-three years of age, upon
examining what concerned me, more particularly the past year, with the
great mercies of God preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble thanks,
beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of my sins past, and to
prepare me for a better life by the virtue of his grace and mercy, for
the sake of my blessed Savior.The wet and uncomfortable weather staying us from
church this morning, our Doctor officiated in my family; at which were
present above twenty domestics.55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty of life, and
the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction of a holy life, with
pertinent inferences to prepare us for death and a future state.I gave
him thanks, and told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26-7th November, 1703.The effects of the hurricane and tempest of
wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London,
were very dismal.As to my
own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and
valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning
the garden mount, the growing along the park meadow, the damage to my
own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be
paralleled, with anything happening in our age.I am not able to
describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.I removed to Dover Street, where I found all well;
but houses, trees, garden, etc., at Sayes Court, suffered very much.I made up my accounts, paid wages, gave rewards and
New Year's gifts, according to custom.The King of Spain[95] landing at Portsmouth, came to
Windsor, where he was magnificently entertained by the Queen, and
behaved himself so nobly, that everybody was taken with his graceful
deportment.After two days, having presented the great ladies, and
others, with valuable jewels, he went back to Portsmouth, and
immediately embarked for Spain.[Footnote 95: Charles III., afterward Emperor of Germany, by the
    title of Charles VI.]The Lord Treasurer gave my grandson the office of
Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of L300 a year.The fast on the Martyrdom of King Charles I. was
observed with more than usual solemnity.Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford, now
died,[96] I think the oldest acquaintance now left me in the world.He
was eighty-six years of age, stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after
having been a person of admirable parts and learning.This is a serious
alarm to me.He built a very handsome
chapel to the college, and his own tomb.He gave a legacy of money, and
a third part of his library, to his nephew, Dr.Bohun, who went hence to
his funeral.[Footnote 96: There is a very good Life of him, with his portrait
    prefixed, by Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity College, and Poetry
    Professor at Oxford.][Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1704.This day was celebrated the thanksgiving for the
late great victory,[97] with the utmost pomp and splendor by the Queen,
Court, great Officers, Lords Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc.The
streets were scaffolded from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned.Every company was ranged
under its banners, the city militia without the rails, which were all
hung with cloth suitable to the color of the banner.The Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards; the Queen in a
rich coach with eight horses, none with her but the Duchess of
Marlborough in a very plain garment, the Queen full of jewels.Music and
trumpets at every city company.The great officers of the Crown,
Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six horses, besides
innumerable servants, went to St.After
this, the Queen went back in the same order to St.The city
companies feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night.Music for the church and anthems composed by the best masters.The day before was wet and stormy, but this was one of the most serene
and calm days that had been all the year.[Footnote 97: Over the French and Bavarians, at Blenheim, 13th
    August, 1704.]Being my birthday and the 84th year of my life,
after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I
set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine
my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing, and imploring his
protection for the year following.Lord Clarendon presented me with the three volumes of
his father's "History of the Rebellion."My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr.Clarke's
continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for
his excellent performance of this year.I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the
victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand
with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to
do, without any alteration of his good-nature.He had a most rich George
in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very
plain.I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.Agues and smallpox much in
every place.Great loss by fire,
burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at
Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the
carelessness of a servant.A little before, the same happened at Lord
Pembroke's, at Wilton.The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of
Algernon Percy, Admiral of the fleet to King Charles I., died in the 83d
year of her age.She was sister to the Earl of Suffolk, and left a great
estate, her jointure to descend to the Duke of Somerset.On the death of the Emperor, there was no mourning worn at Court,
because there was none at the Imperial Court on the death of King
William.I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Turnham Green, the
gardens being very fine, and exceedingly well planted with fruit.Most extravagant expense to debauch and corrupt votes
for Parliament members.I sent my grandson with his party of my
freeholders to vote for Mr.I dined at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr.King, a sharp and ready man in politics, as well as very learned.We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir,
which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by one who
went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came along among the
adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the doctor
had written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations.He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St.John's College,
Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but has now altogether given
it over, and lives retired, being very old and infirm, yet continuing
chemistry.I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began to take in wounded
and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for.The
buildings now going on are very magnificent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

October, 1705.Observing how uncertain
great officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not
accept it, unless L2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice.His predecessors, how
little time soever they had the Seal, usually got L100,000 and made
themselves Barons.Lord Abington, Lieutenant
of the Tower, displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in.An indication of great unsteadiness somewhere, but
thus the crafty Whig party (as called) begin to change the face of the
Court, in opposition to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen.There had never been so great an assembly of members
on the first day of sitting, being more than 450.The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen, contrary to
all expectation.I am this day arrived to the 85th year of my age.Lord teach me so to number my days to come, that I may apply them to
wisdom!Making up my accounts for the past year, paid
bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according to custom.Though much
indisposed and in so advanced a stage, I went to our chapel [in London]
to give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to assist me and my
family the ensuing year, if he should yet continue my pilgrimage here,
and bring me at last to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.My indisposition increasing, I was exceedingly ill
this whole week.Notes of the sermons at the chapel in the morning and
afternoon, written with his own hand, conclude this Diary.[98]

concluded that young Brice was not the type to acquire the money which
his father had lost.And he reflected that Stephen must feel as strange
in St.Louis as a cod might amongst the cat-fish in the Mississippi.So the assistant manager of Carvel & Company resolved to indulge in the
pleasure of patronizing the Bostonian.he asked him, as the boarders walked into the
best room.And it may be said here that, if
Mr.Hopper underestimated him, certainly he underestimated Mr."It ain't easy to get a job this Fall," said Eliphalet, "St."What business was you callatin' to grapple with?"In reality he was a
bit chagrined, having pictured with some pleasure the Boston aristocrat
going from store to store for a situation."You didn't come here
figurin' on makin' a pile, I guess."He took in the
blocky shoulders and the square head, and he pictured the little eyes at
a vanishing-point in lines of a bargain.Then humor blessed humor--came
to his rescue.He had entered the race in the West, where all start
equal.He had come here, like this man who was succeeding, to make his
living.Hopper drew something out of his pocket, eyed Miss Crane, and bit
off a corner."Judge Whipple's--unless he has changed his mind."Eliphalet gave him a
look more eloquent than words."If all the Fourth of Julys we've had was piled into one," said Mr.Hopper, slowly and with conviction, "they wouldn't be a circumstance to
Silas Whipple when he gets mad.My boss, Colonel Carvel, is the only
man in town who'll stand up to him.I've seen 'em begin a quarrel in the
store and carry it all the way up the street.I callate you won't stay
with him a great while."BLACK CATTLE

Later that evening Stephen Brice was sitting by the open windows in his
mother's room, looking on the street-lights below."Well, my dear," asked the lady, at length, "what do you think of it
all?""Yes, they are kind," she assented, with a sigh."But they are not--they
are not from among our friends, Stephen.""I thought that one of our reasons for coming West, mother," answered
Stephen.We came West in order that you might have more
chance for the career to which you are entitled.Our friends in Boston
were more than good."He left the window and came and stood behind her chair, his hands
clasped playfully beneath her chin."Have you the exact date about you, mother?"And you
must not forget that there is a youth limit in our Constitution for
senators."Then the widow smiled,--a little sadly, perhaps.And it made her strong face akin to all that was human and
helpful."I believe that you have the subject of my first speech in that august
assembly.And, by the way, what was it?""It was on 'The Status of the Emigrant,'" she responded instantly,
thereby proving that she was his mother."And it touched the Rights of Privacy," he added, laughing, "which do
not seem to exist in St."In the eyes of your misguided profession, statesmen and authors and
emigrants and other public charges have no Rights of Privacy," said she.Longfellow told me once that they were to name a brand of flour for
him, and that he had no redress.""Have you, too, been up before Miss Crane's Commission?""They have some expert members," he continued.Abner
Reed could be a shining light in any bar.I overheard a part of her
cross-examination.She--she had evidently studied our case--"

"My dear," answered Mrs.Brice, "I suppose they know all about us."She
was silent a moment, "I had so hoped that they wouldn't.They lead the
same narrow life in this house that they did in their little New England
towns."I did not expect to find so many New Englanders here--I wish that Mr.Whipple had directed us elsewhere-"

"He probably thought that we should feel at home among New Englanders.I
hope the Southerners will be more considerate."They are very proud," said his mother."A wonderful people,--born
aristocrats.You don't remember those Randolphs with whom we travelled
through England.They were with us at Hollingdean, Lord Northwell's
place.There was a young girl, Eleanor
Randolph, a beauty.I shall never forget the way she entered those
English drawing-rooms.They visited us once in Beacon Street,
afterwards.And I have heard that there are a great many good Southern
families here in St."You did not glean that from Judge Whipple's letter, mother," said
Stephen, mischievously."He was very frank in his letter," sighed Mrs."I imagine he is always frank, to put it delicately.""Your father always spoke in praise of Silas Whipple, my dear.I have
heard him call him one of the ablest lawyers in the country.He won a
remarkable case for Appleton here, and he once said that the Judge
would have sat on the Supreme Bench if he had not been pursued with such
relentlessness by rascally politicians.""The Judge indulges in a little relentlessness now and then, himself.He is not precisely what might be termed a mild man, if what we hear is
correct.""Well, there was a gentleman on the steamboat who said that it took
more courage to enter the Judge's private office than to fight a Border
Ruffian.And another, a young lawyer, who declared that he would rather
face a wild cat than ask Whipple a question on the new code.And yet he
said that the Judge knew more law than any man in the West.And lastly,
there is a polished gentleman named Hopper here from Massachusetts who
enlightened me a little more."He saw that she was distressed by
these things.Heaven knows that she had borne enough trouble in the last
few months."Come, mother," he said gently, "you should know how to take my jokes by
this time.I am sure the Judge is a good man,--one of
those aggressive good men who make enemies.I have but a single piece of
guilt to accuse him of.""The cunning forethought which he is showing in wishing to have it said
that a certain Senator and Judge Brice was trained in his office."Her eye wandered around the room,--Widow Crane's best bedroom.It was
dimly lighted by an extremely ugly lamp.The hideous stuffy bed curtains
and the more hideous imitation marble mantel were the two objects that
held her glance.But Stephen,
who knew his mother, felt that her little elation over her arrival had
ebbed, Neither would confess dejection to the other."I--even I--" said Stephen, tapping his chest, "have at least made
the acquaintance of one prominent citizen, Mr.Dickens, he is a true American gentleman, for he chews
tobacco.Louis five years, is now assistant manager
of the largest dry goods house, and still lives in one of Miss
Crane's four-dollar rooms.I think we may safely say that he will be a
millionaire before I am a senator."He put his hands in his pockets and walked over to the window."I think that it would be better if I did the same thing.""What do you mean, my son--"

"If I went to work,--started sweeping out a store, I mean.See here,
mother, you've sacrificed enough for me already.After paying father's
debts, we've come out here with only a few thousand dollars, and the
nine hundred I saved out of this year's Law School allowance.What shall
we do when that is gone?The honorable legal profession, as my friend
reminded me to-night, is not the swiftest road to millions."With a mother's discernment she guessed the agitation, he was striving
to hide; she knew that he had been gathering courage for this moment for
months.And she knew that he was renouncing thus lightly, for her sake
an ambition he had had from his school days.Widow passed her hand over her brow.It was a space before she answered
him."My son," she said, let us never speak of this again:

"It was your father's dearest wish that you should become a lawyer
and--and his wishes are sacred God will take care of us.""Remember, my dear, when you go to Judge Whipple in the morning,
remember his kindness, and--."A while later he stole gently back into her room again.She was on her
knees by the walnut bedstead.At nine the next manning Stephen left Miss Crane's, girded for the
struggle with the redoubtable Silas Whipple.He was not afraid, but a
poor young man as an applicant to a notorious dragon is not likely to
be bandied with velvet, even though the animal had been a friend of
his father.Dragons as a rule have had a hard rime in their youths, and
believe in others having a hard time.To a young man, who as his father's heir in Boston had been the
subject of marked consideration by his elders, the situation was keenly
distasteful.So presently, after inquiry,
he came to the open square where the new Court House stood, the dome
of which was indicated by a mass of staging, and one wing still to be
completed.Across from the building, on Market Street, and in the middle
of the block, what had once been a golden hand pointed up a narrow dusty
stairway.Here was a sign, "Law office of Silas Whipple."Stephen climbed the stairs, and arrived at a ground glass door, on which
the sign was repeated.Behind that door was the future: so he opened it
fearfully, with an impulse to throw his arm above his head.But he was
struck dumb on beholding, instead of a dragon, a good-natured young
man who smiled a broad welcome.The reaction was as great as though one
entered a dragon's den, armed to the teeth, to find a St.Stephen's heart went out to this young man,--after that organ had jumped
back into its place.Even the
long black coat which custom then decreed could not hide the bone and
sinew under it.The young man had a broad forehead, placid Dresden-blue
eyes, flaxen hair, and the German coloring.Across one of his high
cheek-bones was a great jagged scar which seemed to add distinction
to his appearance.That caught Stephen's eye, and held it.He wondered
whether it were the result of an encounter with the Judge.he asked, in the accents of an educated
German."Yes," said Stephen, "if he isn't busy.""He is out," said the other, with just a suspicion of a 'd' in the word."You know he is much occupied now, fighting election frauds."I am a stranger here," said Stephen.exclaimed the German, "now I know you, Mr.The young
one from Boston the Judge spoke of.But you did not tell him of your
arrival.""I did not wish to bother him," Stephen replied, smiling."My name is Richter--Carl Richter, sir."Richter's big hands warmed Stephen as nothing else
had since he had come West.He was moved to return it with a little more
fervor than he usually showed.And he felt, whatever the Judge might be,
that he had a powerful friend near at hand--Mr.Richter's welcome came
near being an embrace.Brice," he said; "mild weather for November, eh?The
Judge will be here in an hour."Stephen looked around him: at the dusty books on the shelves, and the
still dustier books heaped on Mr.Richter's big table; at the cuspidors;
at the engravings of Washington and Webster; at the window in the jog
which looked out on the court-house square; and finally at another
ground-glass door on which was printed:

               SILAS WHIPPLE

                PRIVATE

This, then, was the den,--the arena in which was to take place a
memorable interview.But the thought of waiting an hour for the dragon
to appear was disquieting.Stephen remembered that he had something over
nine hundred dollars in his pocket (which he had saved out of his last
year's allowance at the Law School).Richter, who was
dusting off a chair, to direct him to the nearest bank."Why, certainly," said he; "Mr.Brinsmade's bank on Chestnut Street."He
took Stephen to the window and pointed across the square."I am sorry I
cannot go with you," he added, "but the Judge's <DW64>, Shadrach, is out,
and I must stay in the office.Stephen thanked his new friend for the note to the bank president, and
went slowly down the stairs.To be keyed up to a battle-pitch, and then
to have the battle deferred, is a trial of flesh and spirit.As he reached the pavement, he saw people gathering in front of the wide
entrance of the Court House opposite, and perched on the copings.Then he walked slowly toward the place, and
buttoning his coat, pushed through the loafers and passers-by dallying
on the outskirts of the crowd.There, in the bright November sunlight, a
sight met his eyes which turned him sick and dizzy.Against the walls and pillars of the building, already grimy with
soot, crouched a score of miserable human beings waiting to be sold at
auction.Lynch's slave pen had been disgorged that morning.Old and
young, husband and wife,--the moment was come for all and each.How
hard the stones and what more pitiless than the gaze of their
fellow-creatures in the crowd below!O friends, we who live in peace and
plenty amongst our families, how little do we realize the terror and
the misery and the dumb heart-aches of those days!Stephen thought with
agony of seeing his own mother sold before his eyes, and the building in
front of him was lifted from its foundation and rocked even as shall the
temples on the judgment day.The oily auctioneer was inviting the people to pinch the wares.Men came
forward to feel the creatures and look into their mouths, and one brute,
unshaven and with filthy linen, snatched a child from its mother's
lap Stephen shuddered with the sharpest pain he had ever known.An
ocean-wide tempest arose in his breast, Samson's strength to break
the pillars of the temple to slay these men with his bare hands.Seven
generations of stern life and thought had their focus here in him,--from
Oliver Cromwell to John Brown.Stephen was far from prepared for the storm that raged within him.He had not been brought up an Abolitionist--far from it.Nor had his
father's friends--who were deemed at that time the best people in
Boston--been Abolitionists.Only three years before, when Boston had
been aflame over the delivery of the fugitive Anthony Burns, Stephen
had gone out of curiosity to the meeting at Faneuil Hall.How well he
remembered his father's indignation when he confessed it, and in his
anger Mr.Brice had called Phillips and Parker "agitators."But his
father, nor his father's friends in Boston had never been brought face
to face with this hideous traffic.Was that the sing-song voice of the auctioneer He was selling the
cattle.High and low, caressing an menacing, he teased and exhorted them
to buy.The were bidding, yes, for the possession of souls, bidding in
the currency of the Great Republic.And between the eager shouts came a
moan of sheer despair.He was tearing
two of then: from a last embrace.Three--four were sold while Stephen was in a dream

Then came a lull, a hitch, and the crowd began to chatter gayly.But the
misery in front of him held Stephen in a spell.A white-haired patriarch, with eyes raised to the sky;
a flat-breasted woman whose child was gone, whose weakness made her
valueless.Then two girls were pushed forth, one a quadroon of great
beauty, to be fingered.Stephen turned his face away,--to behold Mr.Eliphalet Hopper looking calmly on.Brice, this is an interesting show now, ain't it?I generally stop here to take a look when I'm passing."And
he spat tobacco juice on the coping.said he, "you get used to it.When I came here, I was a
sort of an Abolitionist.But after you've lived here awhile you get to
know that <DW65>s ain't fit for freedom.""Likely gal, that beauty," Eliphalet continued unrepressed."There's a
well-known New Orleans dealer named Jenkins after her.I callate she'll
go down river.""I reckon you're right, Mistah," a man with a matted beard chimed in,
and added with a wink: "She'll find it pleasant enough--fer a while.Some of those other <DW65>s will go too, and they'd rather go to hell.They do treat 'em nefarious down thah on the wholesale plantations.But seven
years in a cotton swamp,--seven years it takes, that's all, Mistah."He felt that to stay near the man was to be
tempted to murder.He moved away, and just then the auctioneer yelled,
"Attention!""Gentlemen," he cried, "I have heah two sisters, the prope'ty of the
late Mistah Robe't Benbow, of St.Louis, as fine a pair of wenches as
was ever offe'd to the public from these heah steps--"

"Speak for the handsome gal," cried a wag."Sell off the cart hoss fust," said another.The auctioneer turned to the darker sister:

"Sal ain't much on looks, gentlemen," he said, "but she's the best
<DW65> for work Mistah Benbow had."He seized her arm and squeezed it,
while the girl flinched and drew back."She's solid, gentlemen, and
sound as a dollar, and she kin sew and cook.Much to the auctioneer's disgust, Sal was bought in for four hundred
dollars, the interest in the beautiful sister having made the crowd
impatient.Stephen, sick at heart, turned to leave.Halfway to the
corner he met a little elderly man who was the color of a dried gourd.And just as Stephen passed him, this man was overtaken by an old
negress, with tears streaming down her face, who seized the threadbare
hem of his coat."Well, Nancy," said the little man, "we had marvellous luck.I was able
to buy your daughter for you with less than the amount of your savings.""T'ank you, Mistah Cantah," wailed the poor woman, "t'ank you, suh.Praised be de name ob de Lawd.Oh, Mistah Cantah"
(the agony in that cry), "is you gwineter stan' heah an' see her sister
Hester sol' to--to--oh, ma little Chile!De little Chile dat I nussed,
dat I raised up in God's 'ligion.Mistah Cantah, save her, suh, f'om dat
wicked life o' sin.De Lawd Jesus'll rewa'd you, suh.Dis ole woman'll
wuk fo' you twell de flesh drops off'n her fingers, suh."And had he not held her, she would have gone down on her knees on the
stone flagging before him.Her suffering was stamped on the little man's
face--and it seemed to Stephen that this was but one trial more which
adversity had brought to Mr."Nancy," he answered (how often, and to how many, must he have had to
say the same thing), "I haven't the money, Nancy.Would to God that I
had, Nancy!"It was not so
merciful as that.It was Stephen who lifted her, and helped her to the
coping, where she sat with her bandanna awry.Stephen was not of a descent to do things upon impulse.But the tale
was told in after days that one of his first actions in St.The waters stored for ages in the four great lakes, given
the opportunity, rush over Niagara Falls into Ontario."Take the woman away," said Stephen, in a low voice, "and I will buy the
girl,--if I can.""Give me your card,--your address.I will buy the girl, if I can, and
set her free."He fumbled in his pocket and drew out a dirty piece of pasteboard.It
read: "R. Canter, Second Hand Furniture, 20 Second Street."And still
he stared at Stephen, as one who gazes upon a mystery.A few curious
pedestrians had stopped in front of them."Get her away, if you can, for God's sake," said Stephen again.And he
strode off toward the people at the auction.In his
eagerness to reach a place of vantage before the girl was sold, he
pushed roughly into the crowd.But suddenly he was brought up short by the blocky body of Mr.Hopper,
who grunted with the force of the impact."Gosh," said that gentleman, "but you are inters'ted.They ain't begun
to sell her yet--he's waitin' for somebody.Hopper down, he certainly
could not buy her.And it was a relief to know that the sale had not
begun.As for Eliphalet, he was beginning to like young Brice.He approved
of any man from Boston who was not too squeamish to take pleasure in a
little affair of this kind.He ceased
trembling, and began to think."There's my boss, Colonel Carvel across the
street.But what d'ye think of him for a real
Southern gentleman?""The young dandy is his nephew, Clarence Colfax.Eliphalet was speaking leisurely, as usual, while preparing to
move."That's Virginia Carvel, in red.Any gals down Boston-way to beat
her?Guess you won't find many as proud."They were
picking their way over the muddy crossing toward him.Was it possible
that these people were coming to a slave auction?And yet
here they were on the pavement at his very side.She wore a long Talma of crimson cashmere, and her face was in that most
seductive of frames, a scoop bonnet of dark green velvet, For a fleeting
second her eyes met his, and then her lashes fell.But he was aware,
when he had turned away, that she was looking at him again.He wondered whether his appearance betrayed his purpose, or made
a question of his sanity.Yes, probably he was insane from her point of view.A sudden
anger shook him that she should be there calmly watching such a scene.Just then there was a hush among the crowd.The beautiful slave-girl was
seized roughly by the man in charge and thrust forward, half fainting,
into view.But unconsciously he turned, to see the
effect upon Virginia Carvel.Here was the rasp of the auctioneer's voice:-- "Gentlemen, I reckon
there ain't never been offered to bidders such an opportunity as this
heah.I ask you, ain't she a splendid
creature?"Colonel Carvel, in annoyance, started to move on."Come Jinny," he said,
"I had no business to bring you aver.""Pa," she cried, "it's Mr.Buy her for me You know that I always wanted her.The Colonel halted, irresolute, and pulled his goatee Young Colfax
stepped in between them."I'll buy her for you, Jinny.Mother promised you a present, you know,
and you shall have her.""Do buy her, one of you," was all she said

"You may do the bidding, Clarence," said the Colonel, "and we'll settle
the ownership afterward."Taking Virginia's arm, he escorted her across
the street.Here was a home for the girl, and a good
one.Why should me spend the money which meant so much to him.He saw
the man Jenkin elbowing to the front.He had promised to buy her if he could, and to set her
free:

Stephen had made up his mind: He shouldered his way after Jenkins.CHAPTER V. THE FIRST SPARK PASSES

"Now, gentlemen," shouted the auctioneer when he had finished his
oration upon the girl's attractions, "what 'tin I bid?There was a long pause no one cared to start
the bidding.He knows what
she's worth to a cent.Jenkins winked at the auction joined in the laugh.Then some one cried:--"Three
hundred and fifty!"He was recognized at once, by name, evidently as a
person of importance."Thank you, Mistah Colfax, suh," said the auctioneer, with a servile
wave of the hand in his direction, while the crowd twisted their
necks to see him.He stood very straight, very haughty, as if entirely
oblivious to his conspicuous position."That's better, Mistah Jenkins," said the auctioneer, sarcastically.He
turned to the girl, who might have stood to a sculptor for a figure of
despair.Her hands were folded in front of her, her head bowed down.The
auctioneer put his hand under her chin and raised it roughly."Cheer up,
my gal," he said, "you ain't got nothing to blubber about now."Hester's breast heaved and from her black eyes there shot a magnificent
look of defiance.Clarence Colfax had his bid taken from his lips.Above the heads of
the people he had a quick vision of a young man with a determined face,
whose voice rang clear and strong,-- "Four hundred!"Even the auctioneer, braced two ways, was thrown off his balance by the
sudden appearance of this new force.Stephen grew red over the sensation
he made.Apparently the others present had deemed competition with such
as Jenkins and young Colfax the grossest folly.He was treated to much
liberal staring before the oily salesman arranged his wits to grapple
with the third factor.Four hundred from--from--from that gentleman.And the chubby index
seemed the finger of scorn.Jenkins, the New Orleans dealer, lighted a very long cigar
and sat down on the coping.The auctioneer paid no attention to this
manoeuvre.Colfax, being very young, fondly
imagined that they had the field to themselves, to fight to a finish.Here wisdom suggested in a mild whisper to Stephen that there was a last
chance to pull out.That was pride,
and most reprehensible.Canter and of
Nancy, and that was not pride.said the wag, and the crowd howled with
merriment.But Stephen was from New England, and poor, and he
thought of the size of his purse.A glance at his adversary showed that
his blood was up.Money was plainly no consideration to him, and young
Colfax did not seem to be the kind who would relish returning to a young
lady and acknowledge a defeat.He was in full possession of himself now,
and proof against the thinly veiled irony of the oily man's remarks
in favor of Mr.In an incredibly short time the latter's
impetuosity had brought them to eight hundred and ten dollars.Jenkins got up from the curb and said, "Eight hundred and
twenty-five," with his cigar in his mouth.Scarcely had the hum of
excitement died when Stephen, glancing at Colfax for the next move,
saw that young gentleman seized from the rear by his uncle, the tall
Colonel.And across the street was bliss Virginia Carvel, tapping her
foot on the pavement."The wench isn't worth
it.""I've got to buy her now, sir," he cried.And so,
protesting, he passed Stephen, at whom he did not deign to glance.The
humiliation of it must have been great for Mr."Jinny wants her;
sir," he said, "and I have a right to buy her.""Jinny wants everything," was the Colonel's reply.And in a single look
of curiosity and amusement his own gray eyes met Stephen's.They seemed
to regret that this young man, too, had not a guardian.Then uncle and
nephew recrossed the street, and as they walked off the Colonel was seen
to laugh.Virginia had her chin in the air, and Clarence's was in his
collar.The crowd, of course, indulged in roars of laughter, and even Stephen
could not repress a smile, a smile not without bitterness.Out of respect for the personages involved,
the auctioneer had been considerately silent daring the event.Brice who was now the centre of observation.Come, gentlemen, come, this here's a joke--eight twenty-five.I've been in the business twenty yea's, and I neve'
seen her equal.Give me a bid, Mr.--Mr.--you have the advantage of me,
suh."Jenkins took his cigar out of his teeth, and stared.Jerkins whipped his hat from off his head, and made Stephen
a derisive bow."She's youahs, suh," he said.I can do bettah in Louisville fo' less.Congratulate you,
suh--reckon you want her wuss'n I do."At which sally Stephen grew scarlet, and the crowd howled with joy."Why, gentlemen, this heah's a joke.Nine
hundred and ten dollars, gents, nine hundred and ten.The trader shook his head, and puffed at his cigar."Well," cried the oily man, "this is a slaughter.Going at nine hundred
an' ten--nine ten--going--going--" down came the hammer--"gone at nine
hundred and ten to Mr.--Mr.--you have the advantage of me, suh."An attendant had seized the girl, who was on the verge of fainting, and
was dragging her back.Stephen did not heed the auctioneer, but thrust
forward regardless of stares."Handle her gently, you blackguard," he cried."Suttinly, sah," he said.Hester lifted her eyes, and they were filled with such gratitude and
trust that suddenly he was overcome with embarrassment."Then get up," he said, "and follow me."Then a fat man came out of the Court House, with a
quill in his hand, and a merry twinkle in his eye that Stephen resented."This way, please, sah," and he led him to a desk, from the drawer of
which he drew forth a blank deed.But instead of writing it clown, the man merely
stared at him, while the fat creases in his face deepened and deepened.Finally he put down his quill, and indulged in a gale of laughter,
hugely to Mr.said the fat man, as soon as he could."What are you givin' us?That the's a Yankee boa'din' house.""And I suppose that that is part of your business, too," said Stephen,
acidly.The fat man looked at him, pressed his lips, wrote down the number,
shaken all the while with a disturbance which promised to lead to
another explosion.Finally, after a deal of pantomime, and whispering
and laughter with the notary behind the wire screen, the deed was made
out, signed, attested, and delivered.Stephen counted out the money
grimly, in gold and Boston drafts.Out in the sunlight on Chestnut Street, with the girl by his side, it
all seemed a nightmare.The son of Appleton Brice of Boston the owner of
a beautiful quadroon girl!And he had bought hex with his last cent.Miss Crane herself opened the door in answer to his ring.Her keen eyes
instantly darted over his shoulder and dilated, But Stephen, summoning
all his courage, pushed past her to the stairs, and beckoned Hester to
follow."I have brought this--this person to see my mother," he said

The spinster bowed from the back of her neck.She stood transfixed on a
great rose in the hall carpet until she heard Mrs.Brice's door open and
slam, and then she strode up the stairs and into the apartment of Mrs.As she passed the first landing, the quadroon girl was
waiting in the hall.SILAS WHIPPLE

The trouble with many narratives is that they tell too much.Stephen's
interview with his mother was a quiet affair, and not historic.Miss
Crane's boarding-house is not an interesting place, and the tempest in
that teapot is better imagined than described.Stephen Brice, we shall skip likewise a most affecting scene at Mr.That afternoon Stephen came again to the dirty flight of steps which
led to Judge Whipple's office.He paused a moment to gather courage, and
then, gripping the rail, he ascended.The ascent required courage now,
certainly.He halted again before the door at the top.But even as he
stood there came to him, in low, rich tones, the notes of a German song.Richter rose in shirt-sleeves from his desk to greet
him, all smiling.inquired Stephen, with ill-concealed anxiety.The big young German patted him on the shoulder.Suddenly a voice roared from out the open transom of the private office,
like a cyclone through a gap."Then why in thunder doesn't he come in?"Richter opened the private door, and in Stephen walked.The door
closed again, and there he was in the dragon's dens face to face with
the dragon, who was staring him through and through.The first objects
that caught Stephen's attention were the grizzly gray eye brows, which
seemed as so much brush to mark the fire of the deep-set battery of the
eyes.And that battery, when in action, must have been truly terrible.The Judge was shaven, save for a shaggy fringe of gray beard around his
chin, and the size of his nose was apparent even in the full face.Stephen felt that no part of him escaped the search of Mr.But it was no code or course of conduct that kept him silent."So you are Appleton Brice's son," said the Judge, at last.His tone was
not quite so gruff as it might have been.said the Judge, with a look that scarcely expressed approval."I guess you've been patted on the back too much by your father's
friends.""How I used to detest
people who patted boys on the back and said with a smirk, 'I know your
father.'I never had a father whom people could say that about.But,
sir," cried the Judge, bringing down his fist on the litter of papers
that covered his desk, "I made up my mind that one day people should
know me.They
won't know your father here--"

If Stephen thought the Judge brutal, he did not say so.He glanced
around the little room,--at the bed in the corner, in which the Judge
slept, and which during the day did not escape the flood of books and
papers; at the washstand, with a roll of legal cap beside the pitcher."I guess you think this town pretty crude after Boston, Mr."From time immemorial it has been the pleasant habit
of old communities to be shocked at newer settlements, built by their
own countrymen.Fortunately the Judge did not give him time to answer."Why didn't your mother let me know that she was coming?""She didn't wish to put you to any trouble, sir.""Wasn't I a good friend of your father's?Didn't I ask you to come here
and go into my office?"Whipple--"

"A chance of what?"And there is still a chance of it," added
Stephen, smiling.For a second it looked as if the Judge might smile, too.He rubbed his
nose with a fearful violence.Richter tells me you were looking for a bank," said he, presently."Yes, sir, I was, but--"

But Mr.Whipple merely picked up the 'Counterfeit Bank Note Detector'."Beware of Western State Currency as you would the devil," said he."That's one thing we don't equal the East in--yet.And so you want to
become a lawyer?""I intend to become a lawyer, sir.""And so you shall, sir," cried the Judge, bringing down his yellow fist
upon the 'Bank Note Detector'."I'll make you a lawyer, sir.But my
methods ain't Harvard methods, sir.""I am ready to do anything, Mr.He scratched among his papers, and produced
some legal cap and a bunch of notes."Go out there," he said, "and take off your coat and copy this brief.And tell your mother I shall do myself
the honor to call upon her this evening."Stephen did as he was told, without a word.Richter was not in
the outer office when he returned to it.He tried to compose himself to
write, although the recollection of each act of the morning hung like a
cloud over the back of his head.Therefore the first sheet of legal cap
was spoiled utterly.He had
gone through the ground glass door with the firm intention of making
a clean breast of the ownership of Hester.Now, as he sat still, the
trouble grew upon him.He started a new sheet, and ruined that: Once he
got as far as his feet, and sat down again.But at length he had quieted
to the extent of deciphering ten lines of Mr.Whipple's handwriting when
the creak of a door shattered his nerves completely.He glanced up from his work to behold--none other than Colonel Comyn
Carvel.Richter's chair, and seeing it empty, the Colonel's eye
roved about the room until it found Stephen.There it remained, and the
Colonel remained in the middle of the floor, his soft hat on the back of
his head, one hand planted firmly on the gold head of his stick, and
the other tugging at his goatee, pulling down his chin to the quizzical
angle.The effect of this was to make one perspire freely.And as there seemed no logical answer, he made none.Carvel turned, shaking with a laughter he could not
control, and strode into the private office the door slammed behind him.First of all there was an eloquent silence.Then the scratch-scratch of a quill pen, and finally the Judge's voice."Carvel, what the devil's the matter with you, sir?"A squall of guffaws blew through the transom, and the Colonel was heard
slapping his knee."Judge Whipple," said he, his voice vibrating from suppressed
explosions, "I am happy to see that you have overcome some of your
ridiculous prejudices, sir.""Toward slavery, Judge," said Mr.Carvel, seeming to recover his
gravity."You are a broader man than I thought, sir."An unintelligible gurgle came from the Judge."Carvel, haven't you and I quarrelled enough on that subject?""You didn't happen to attend the <DW65> auction this morning when you
were at the court?""Colonel," said the Judge, "I've warned you a hundred times against the
stuff you lay out on your counter for customers.""You weren't at the auction, then," continued the Colonel, undisturbed.You missed seeing this young man you've just
employed buy the prettiest quadroon wench I ever set eyes on."But whether to fly in at the
one entrance or out at the other, he was undecided.It did not seem to Stephen as if he was walking when he went toward the
ground glass door.There was Colonel Carvel seated on the
bed, his goatee in his hand.And there was the Judge leaning forward
from his hips, straight as a ramrod.Fire was darting from beneath his
bushy eyebrows.Brice," said he, "there is one question I always
ask of those whom I employ.I omitted it in your case because I have
known your father and your grandfather before you.What is your opinion,
sir, on the subject of holding human beings in bondage?"The answer was immediate,--likewise simple."I do not believe in it, Mr.The Judge shot out of his chair like a long jack-in-the box, and towered
to his full height.Brice, did you, or did you not, buy a woman at auction to-day?"But Stephen caught a glimpse of the
Colonel's hand slipping from his chin cover his mouth.cried the Judge, and he sat down heavily."You say that
you are an Abolitionist?""No, sir, I do not say that.But it does not need an Abolitionist to
condemn what I saw this morning.""Are you a slave-owner, sir?""Then get your coat and hat and leave my office, Mr.He slipped it on, and turned to go.He
was, if the truth were told, more amused than angry.It was Colonel
Carvel's voice that stopped him."Hold on, Judge," he drawled, "I reckon you haven't got all the packing
out of that case."Whipple locked at him in a sort of stupefaction."Come back here, sir," he cried.No man shall
say that I am not just.""I did not expect one, sir," he said..

"And you don't deserve one, sir," cried the Judge."I think I do," replied Stephen, quietly.he demanded

"I took her to Miss Crane's boarding-house," said Stephen.The guffaw which came from hire
drowned every other sound.Again he looked at the Colonel,
and this time something very like mirth shivered his lean frame."And
what do you intend to do with her?""To give her freedom, sir, as soon as I can find somebody to go on her
bond."Whipple rubbed his nose with more than customary
violence, and looked very hard at Mr.Carvel, whose face was
inscrutable.Brice," said the Judge, at length, "take off your coat, sir I will
go her bond."It was Stephen's turn to be taken aback.He stood regarding the Judge
curiously, wondering what manner of man he was.He did not know that
this question had puzzled many before him.His hand was on the knob of the door, when Mr.Whipple called him back
abruptly.His voice had lost some of its gruffness."What were your father's ideas about slavery, Mr.The young man thought a moment, as if seeking to be exact."I suppose he would have put slavery among the necessary evils, sir,"
he said, at length."But he never could bear to have the liberator
mentioned in his presence.He was not at all in sympathy with Phillips,
or Parker, or Summer.And such was the general feeling among his
friends.""Then," said the Judge, "contrary to popular opinion in the West and
South, Boston is not all Abolition.""The conservative classes are not at all Abolitionists, sir."growled the Judge, "the conservative
classes!I am tired of hearing about the conservative classes.Why not
come out with it, sir, and say the moneyed classes, who would rather
see souls held in bondage than risk their worldly goods in an attempt to
liberate them?"It was not at all clear to him then how he was to get
along with Judge Whipple."I am sure that you do them an injustice, sir," he said, with more
feeling them he had yet shown."I am not speaking of the rich alone, and
I think that if you knew Boston you would not say that the conservative
class there is wholly composed of wealthy people.Many of may father's
friends were by no means wealthy.And I know that if he had been poor he
would have held the same views."Stephen did not mark the quick look of approval which Colonel Carvel
gave him."Well, sir," he said, "what were his views, then?""My father regarded slaves as property, sir.And conservative people"
(Stephen stuck to the word) "respect property the world over.My
father's argument was this: If men are deprived by violence of one kind
of property which they hold under the law, all other kinds of property
will be endangered.Furthermore, he
recognized that the economic conditions in the South make slavery
necessary to prosperity.And he regarded the covenant made between the
states of the two sections as sacred."There was a brief silence, during which the uncompromising expression of
the Judge did not change."I am not sure, sir, after what I saw yesterday.I--I must have time to
see more of it.""Good Lord," said Colonel Carvel, "if the conservative people of
the North act this way when they see a slave sale, what will the
Abolitionists do?Whipple," he added slowly, but with conviction, "this
means war."Then the Colonel got to his feet, and bowed to Stephen with ceremony."Whatever you believe, sir," he said, "permit me to shake your hand.And although my own belief is that the black race
is held in subjection by a divine decree, I can admire what you have
done, Mr.It was a noble act, sir,--a right noble act.And I have
more respect for the people of Boston, now, sir, than I ever had before,
sir."Having delivered himself of this somewhat dubious compliment (which he
meant well), the Colonel departed.CALLERS

If the Brices had created an excitement upon their arrival, it was as
nothing to the mad delirium which raged at Miss Crane's boarding-house.Twenty times was Miss Crane
on the point of requesting Mrs.Brice to leave, and twenty times, by the
advice of Mrs.The culmination came when the
news leaked out that Mr.Stephen Brice had bought the young woman in
order to give her freedom.Like those who have done noble acts since the
world began, Stephen that night was both a hero and a fool.The cream
from which heroes is made is very apt to turn.cried Stephen, when they had reached their room after tea,
"wasn't that meal a fearful experience?Let's find a hovel, mother, and
go and live in it."Not if you persist in your career of reforming an Institution, my son,"
answered the widow, smiling."It was beastly hard luck," said he, "that I should have been shouldered
with that experience the first day.But I have tried to think it over
calmly since, and I can see nothing else to have done."He paused in his
pacing up and down, a smile struggling with his serious look."It was
quite a hot-headed business for one of the staid Brices, wasn't it?""The family has never been called impetuous," replied his mother.His mother had not said one word about the
money."We are at least a year nearer the poor-house," he said; "you haven't
scolded me for that.I should feel so much better if you would.""Oh, Stephen, don't say that!""God has given me no
greater happiness in this life than the sight of the gratitude of that
poor creature, Nancy.I shall never forget the old woman's joy at the
sight of her daughter.It made a palace out of that dingy furniture
shop.Stephen noticed with a pang that the lace of it was frayed and torn at
the corner.Brice, hastily putting the handkerchief down.Hester stood on the threshold, and old Nancy beside her.De good Lawd bless you, lady, an' Miste' Brice,"
said the old negress."Ain' you gwineter' low Hester an' me to wuk fo' you?""Indeed I should be glad to, Nancy."Yassm, yassm," said Nancy, and relapsed into awkward silence.Then
again, "Mis' Brice!""Ef you 'lows us t' come heah an' straighten out you' close, an' mend
'em--you dunno how happy you mek me an' Hester--des to do dat much, Mis'
Brice."Brice rose and unlocked the
trunks."You may unpack them, Nancy," she said.With what alacrity did the old woman take off her black bonnet and
shawl!"Whaffor you stannin' dere, Hester?"Brice, compassionately, and tears came to
her eyes again at the thought of what they had both been through that
day.She
des kinder stupefied by you' goodness, Mis' Brice."A scene was saved by the appearance of Miss Crane's hired girl.Cluyme, in the parlor, mum," she said.Jacob Cluyme sniffed a little as he was ushered into Miss Crane's
best parlor, it was perhaps because of she stuffy dampness of that room.Cluyme was one of those persons the effusiveness of whose greeting
does not tally with the limpness of their grasp.He was attempting, when
Stephen appeared, to get a little heat into his hands by rubbing them,
as a man who kindles a stick of wood for a visitor.The gentleman had
red chop-whiskers,--to continue to put his worst side foremost, which
demanded a ruddy face.Louis with neighborly
effusion; while his wife, a round little woman, bubbled over to Mrs.Cluyme, "I used often to go to Boston in the
forties.In fact--ahem--I may claim to be a New Englander.Alas, no, I
never met your father.But when I heard of the sad circumstances of his
death, I felt as if I had lost a personal friend.His probity, sir, and
his religious principles were an honor to the Athens of America.I have
listened to my friend, Mr.Samuel Atterbury,--eulogize
him by the hour.""Why, yes," said he, "Mr.Cluyme, "I knew it.Four years ago, the last
business trip I made to Boston, I met Atterbury on the street.Absence
makes no difference to some men, sir, nor the West, for that matter.Atterbury nearly took me in his arms.'My dear
fellow,' he cried, 'how long are you to be in town?''Sorry I can't ask you to dinner,' says he, but step into the
Tremont House and have a bite.'--Wasn't that like Atterbury?"Cluyme was evidently expecting no
answer."Well," said he, "what I was going to say was that we heard you were in
town; 'Friends of Samuel Atterbury, my dear,' I said to my wife.We live very plainly, sir, very simply.I am afraid that you will miss
the luxury of the East, and some of the refinement, Stephen.I hope I
may call you so, my boy.We have a few cultured citizens, Stephen, but
all are not so.I seemed to live again when I
got to Boston.But business, sir,--the making of money is a sordid
occupation."I scarcely think that my mother will go out," said Stephen.Not a dinner-party, my boy, only
a plain, comfortable meal, with plenty to eat.Boston,
Stephen, I have always looked upon as the centre of the universe.Oh, no," he
added quickly, "I don't mean a Know Nothing.Religious freedom, my boy,
is part of our great Constitution.By the way, Stephen--Atterbury always
had such a respect for your father's opinions--"

"My father was not an Abolitionist, sir," said Stephen, smiling."Quite right, quite right," said Mr."But I am not sure, since I have come here, that I have not some
sympathy and respect for the Abolitionists."Cluyme gave a perceptible start.He glanced at the heavy hangings on
the windows and then out of the open door into the hall.For a space his
wife's chatter to Mrs.Brace, on Boston fashions, filled the room."My dear Stephen," said the gentleman, dropping his voice, "that is all
very well in Boston.But take a little advice from one who is old enough
to counsel you.You are young, and you must learn to temper yourself to
the tone of the place which you have made your home.Louis is full
of excellent people, but they are not precisely Abolitionists.We are
gathering, it is true, a small party who are for gradual emancipation.But our New England population here is small yet compared to the
Southerners.Stephen could not resist saying, "Judge Whipple does not seem to have
tempered himself, sir.""Silas Whipple is a fanatic, sir," cried Mr.He denounces Douglas on the slightest
excuse, and would go to Washington when Congress opens to fight with
Stephens and Toombs and Davis.He might
have been in the Senate, or on the Supreme Bench, had he not stirred up
so much hatred.And yet I can't help liking Whipple.A resounding ring of the door-bell cut off Stephen's reply, and Mrs.Cluyme's small talk to Mrs.In the hall rumbled a familiar voice,
and in stalked none other than Judge Whipple himself.Without noticing
the other occupants of the parlor he strode up to Mrs.Brice, looked at
her for an instant from under the grizzled brows, and held out his large
hand."Pray, ma'am," he said, "what have you done with your slave?"Cluyme emitted a muffled shriek, like that of a person frightened
in a dream.Her husband grasped the curved back of his chair."I am, madam," was the reply."My slave is upstairs, I believe, unpacking my trunks," said Mrs.Cluyme exchanged a glance of consternation.Cluyme sat down again, rather heavily, as though her legs had refused to
hold her.Brice, and a gleam
of mirth lighted the severity of his face.He was plainly pleased with
her--this serene lady in black, whose voice had the sweet ring of women
who are well born and whose manner was so self-contained.To speak
truth, the Judge was prepared to dislike her.He had never laid eyes
upon her, and as he walked hither from his house he seemed to foresee
a helpless little woman who, once he had called, would fling her Boston
pride to the winds and dump her woes upon him.He looked again, and
decidedly approved of Mrs.Brice, and was unaware that his glance
embarrassed her.Whipple," she said,--"do you know Mr.The Judge looked behind him abruptly, nodded ferociously at Mr.Cluyme,
and took the hand that fluttered out to him from Mrs.exclaimed that lady, "I reckon we do.And my Belle is
so fond of him.She thinks there is no one equal to Mr.Judge,
you must come round to a family supper.said the Judge, "I think I like Edith best of your girls,
ma'am.""Edith is a good daughter, if I do say it myself," said Mrs."I
have tried to do right by my children."She was still greatly flustered,
and curiosity about the matter of the slave burned upon her face.Brice were people one could catechise.Stephen, scanning the Judge, was wondering how far he regarded the
matter as a joke.Whipple, as he seated himself on the other end
of the horsehair sofa, "I'll warrant when you left Boston that you did
not expect to own a slave the day after you arrived in St."But I do not own her," said Mrs.You, a mere boy, have
bought a negress?""And what is more, sir, I approve of it," the Judge put in, severely."I
am going to take the young man into my office."Cluyme gradually retired into the back of his chair, looking at
Mr.Whipple as though he expected him to touch a match to the window
curtains."Pardon me, Judge," said he, "but I trust that I may be allowed to
congratulate you upon the abandonment of principles which I have
considered a clog to your career.They did you honor, sir, but they were
Quixotic.I, sir, am for saving our glorious Union at any cost.And we
have no right to deprive our brethren of their property of their very
means of livelihood."Cluyme was as yet too stunned to
speak.Only Stephen's mother sniffed gunpowder in the air.Cluyme," said the Judge, mildly, "is an age of shifting
winds.It was not long ago," he added reflectively, "when you and I met
in the Planters' House, and you declared that every drop of Northern
blood spilled in Kansas was in a holy cause.Cluyme's wife alone knew whether he trembled."And I repeat that, sir," he cried, with far too much zeal.And yet I was for the Omnibus Bill, and I am with Mr.I am willing to bury my abhorrence of
a relic of barbarism, for the sake of union and peace.""Well, sir, I am not," retorted the Judge, like lightning.He rubbed the
red spat on his nose, and pointed a bony finger at Mr.Many a
criminal had grovelled before that finger."I, too, am for the Union.And the Union will never be safe until the greatest crime of modern
times is wiped out in blood.Cluyme, in blood,
sir," he thundered.Did I not understand you to approve of Mr.Brice he crossed over and took her hand.It has been further
claimed that he bowed."Good night, madam," he said."I shall call again to pay my respects
when you are not occupied."BELLEGARDE

Miss Virginia Carvel came down the steps in her riding-habit.And Ned,
who had been waiting in the street with the horses, obsequiously held
his hand while his young mistress leaped into Vixen's saddle.Leaving
the darkey to follow upon black Calhoun, she cantered off up the street,
greatly to the admiration of the neighbor.They threw open their windows
to wave at her, but Virginia pressed her lips and stared straight ahead.She was going out to see the Russell girls at their father's country
place on Bellefontaine Road, especially to proclaim her detestation
for a certain young Yankee upstart.She had unbosomed herself to Anne
Brinsmade and timid Eugenie Renault the day before.It was Indian summer, the gold and purple season of the year.Wasps were buzzing confusedly about the eaves again,
marvelling at the balmy air, and the two Misses Russell, Puss and
Emily, were seated within the wide doorway at needlework when Virginia
dismounted at the horseblock."Oh, Jinny, I'm so glad to see you," said Miss Russell."Here's Elise
Saint Simon from New Orleans.You must stay all day and to-night.""I can't, Puss," said Virginia, submitting impatiently to Miss Russell's
warm embrace."I only
came--to say that I am going to have a birthday party in a few weeks.You must be sure to come, and bring your guest."Virginia took her bridle from Ned, and Miss Russell's hospitable face
fell."To Bellegarde for dinner," answered Virginia."But it's only ten o'clock," said Puss."There's a new young man in town, and they do say his appearance is very
striking--not exactly handsome, you know, but strong-looking.""And he's no gentleman," said Virginia."But how do you know, Jinny?"But he belongs to a very good Boston family, they say.""There are no good Boston families," replied Virginia, with conviction,
as she separated her reins.Who ever heard of a
good Yankee family?""What has he done to you, Virginia?"But her grievance was too hot within her
for suppression.The one I always said I
wanted.Pa and I were passing the
Court House, with Clarence, when she was put up for sale.We crossed
the street to see what was going on, and there was your strong-looking
Yankee standing at the edge of the crowd.I am quite sure that he saw me
as plainly as I see you, Puss Russell.""He heard me ask Pa to buy her.He heard Clarence say that he would bid
her in for me.And yet he goes in and outbids Clarence,
and buys her himself.Do you think any gentleman would do that, Puss
Russell?""Why I
thought that all Bostonians were Abolitionists.""Then he set her free," said Miss Carvel, contemptuously, "Judge Whipple
went on her bond to-day.""Oh, I'm just crazy to see him now," said Miss Russell."Ask him to your party, Virginia," she added mischievously."Do you think I would have him in my house?"Miss Russell was likewise courageous--"I don't see why not.You have
Judge Whipple every Sunday dinner, and he's an Abolitionist.""Judge Whipple has never insulted me," she said, with dignity.Whereupon, despite her protests and prayers
for forgiveness, Virginia took to her mare again and galloped off.They
saw her turn northward on the Bellefontaine Road.Presently the woodland hid from her sight the noble river shining far
below, and Virginia pulled Vixen between the gateposts which marked the
entrance to her aunt's place, Bellegarde.Half a mile through the cool
forest, the black dirt of the driveway flying from Vixen's hoofs, and
there was the Colfax house on the edge of the gentle <DW72>; and beyond
it the orchard, and the blue grapes withering on the vines,--and
beyond that fields and fields of yellow stubble.The silver smoke of
a steamboat hung in wisps above the water.A young <DW64> was busily
washing the broad veranda, but he stopped and straightened at sight of
the young horsewoman."<DW71>, where's your mistress?""Clar t' goodness, Miss Jinny, she was heah leetle while ago.""Yo' git atter Miss Lilly, yo' good-fo'-nuthin' niggah," said Ned,
warmly."Ain't yo' be'n raised better'n to stan' theh wif yo'mouf open?"<DW71> was taking the hint, when Miss Virginia called him back.I'll fotch him, Miss Jinny.He jes come home f'um seein'
that thar trottin' hose he's gwine to race nex' week."Ned, who had tied Calhoun and was holding his mistress's bridle,
sniffed.He had been Colonel Carvel's jockey in his younger days."I hoped to die befo' the day a
gemman'd own er trottah, Jinny.On'y runnin' hosses is fit fo' gemmen.""Ned," said Virginia, "I shall be eighteen in two weeks and a young
lady.On that day you must call me Miss Jinny."Ned's face showed both astonishment and inquiry."Jinny, ain't I nussed you always?Ain't I come upstairs to quiet you
when yo' mammy ain't had no power ovah yo'?Ain't I cooked fo' yo', and
ain't I followed you everywheres since I quit ridin' yo' pa's bosses to
vict'ry?Ain't I one of de fambly?An' yit yo' ax me to call yo' Miss
Jinny?""Then you've had privileges enough," Virginia answered."One week from
to-morrow you are to say 'Miss Jinny.'""I'se tell you what, Jinny," he answered mischievously, with an emphasis
on the word, "I'se call you Miss Jinny ef you'll call me Mistah Johnson."Ned," she demanded suddenly, "would you like
to be free?""Why you ax me dat, Jinny?"Benbow's Hester is free," she said."A detestable young Yankee, who has come out here
to meddle with what doesn't concern him.And you
should have married her, if you behaved yourself.""I reckon I'se too ol' fo' Heste'."And added with privileged impudence,
"There ain't no cause why I can't marry her now."Virginia suddenly leaped to the ground without his assistance."That's enough, Ned," she said, and started toward the house."Miss Jinny, I seed that than young gemman.Lan' sakes, he ain' look
like er Yankee.""Ned," said Virginia, sternly, "do you want to go back to cooking?""Oh, no'm--Lan' sakes, no'm.She turned, frowned, and bit her lip.Around the corner of the veranda
she ran into her cousin.He reached
out, boyishly, to catch her in his arms.But she drew back from his
grasp."Why, Jinny," he cried, "what's the matter?"She often called him so, his middle name being Maxwell."But you have no right to do that.""You know," answered Virginia, curtly."Because you have not, unless I choose.Uncle Comyn made me
come away.You should have had the girl, Jinny, if it took my fortune.""You have been drinking this morning, Max," said Virginia."Only a julep or so," he replied apologetically."I rode over to the
race track to see the new trotter.I've called him Halcyon, Jinny," he
continued, with enthusiasm."And he'll win the handicap sure."She sat down on the veranda steps, with her knees crossed and her chin
resting on her hands.The air was heavy with the perfume of the grapes
and the smell of late flowers from the sunken garden near by.A blue
haze hung over the Illinois shore."Max, you promised me you wouldn't drink so much.""And I haven't been, Jinny, 'pon my word," he replied."But I met old
Sparks at the Tavern, and he started to talk about the horses, and--and
he insisted.""And you hadn't the strength of character," she said, scornfully, "to
refuse.""Pshaw, Jinny, a gentleman must be a gentleman.Then she said, without changing
her position:

"If you were, you might be worth something."She did not reply, but sat gazing toward the water.He began to pace the
veranda, fiercely."Look here, Jinny," he cried, pausing in front of her."There are some
things you can't say to me, even in jest."Virginia rose, flicked her riding-whip, and started down the steps."Don't be a fool, Max," she said.She skirted the garden, passed the orchard,
and finally reached a summer house perched on a knoll at the edge of the
wood.Then she seated herself on a bench, silently.He took a place on
the opposite side, with his feet stretched out, dejectedly."I'm tired trying to please you," he said.It was all right when I was younger, when there
was no one else to take you riding, and jump off the barn for your
amusement, Miss.Now you have Tom Catherwood and Jack Brinsmade and
the Russell boys running after you, it's different.He did not see her smile as he sat staring at his feet."Max," said she, all at once, "why don't you settle down to something?Colfax's arm swept around in a circle."There are twelve hundred acres to look after here, and a few <DW65>s.exclaimed his cousin, "this isn't a cotton plantation.Aunt
Lillian doesn't farm for money.If she did, you would have to check your
extravagances mighty quick, sir.""I look after Pompey's reports, I do as much work as my ancestors,"
answered Clarence, hotly."Ah, that is the trouble," said Virginia."We have been gentlemen too long," said Virginia.The pride and wilfulness of
generations was indeed in his handsome face.Around the mouth a grave tinge of indulgence."A mixture of
gamecocks and ponies and race horses and billiards, and idleness at the
Virginia Springs, and fighting with other boys.You don't know anything about the history of your country."I can ride and fight," he said."I can go to New Orleans to-morrow
to join Walker's Nicaragua expedition.We've got to beat the
Yankees,--they'll have Kansas away from us before we know it.""Do you remember, Jinny," he cried, "one day long ago when those Dutch
ruffians were teasing you and Anne on the road, and Bert Russell and
Jack and I came along?And you were bathing it here, and one of my buttons was gone."Rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief, doctor, lawyer, merchant, chief,"
she recited, laughing.She crossed over and sat beside him, and her tone
changed.Max, if you would
only work at something.If you would
learn to weld iron, or to build bridges, or railroads.Or if you would
learn business, and go to work in Pa's store.""You do not care for me as I am?""I knew that you did not understand," she answered passionately."It is
because I care for you that I wish to make you great.You care too much
for a good time, for horses, Max.You love the South, but you think too
little how she is to be saved.If war is to come, we shall want men like
that Captain Robert Lee who was here.A man who can turn the forces of
the earth to his own purposes.""I have always intended to go into politics, after Pa's example," he
said at length."Then--" began Virginia, and paused.And she met it, with her lips tightly
pressed together."Virginia, you will never forgive that Yankee, Brice.""I shall never forgive any Yankee," she retorted quickly."But we are
not talking about him.I am thinking of the South, and of you."He stooped toward her face, but she avoided him and went back to the
bench."You must prove first that you are a man," she said.The vineyard, the yellow stubble; and
the river rushing on and on with tranquil power, and the slow panting of
the steamboat.A doe ran out of the forest, and paused, her head raised,
not twenty feet away."And then you will marry me, Jinny?""Before you may hope to control another, we shall see whether you can
control yourself, sir.""But it has all been arranged," he exclaimed, "since we played here
together years ago!""No one shall arrange that for me," replied Virginia promptly."And
I should think that you would wish to have some of the credit for
yourself."Again she avoided him by leaping the low railing.The doe fled into the
forest, whistling fearfully.Virginia waved her hand to him and started
toward the house.At the corner of the porch she ran into her aunt Mrs.Beautiful when Addison Colfax married her
in Kentucky at nineteen, beautiful still at three and forty.This, I am
aware, is a bald statement.It was told you by some old beau who lives upon the memory of the past."Ladies, a score of different daguerrotypes of Lillian Colfax are in
existence.And whatever may be said of portraits, daguerrotypes do not
flatter.All the town knew
that she was the daughter of old Judge Colfax's overseer at Halcyondale.If she had not been beautiful, Addison Colfax would not have run away
with her.He left her a rich widow at five and twenty,
mistress of the country place he had bought on the Bellefontaine Road,
near St.Colfax was not dancing off to the Virginia
watering-places, Bellegarde was a gay house."Jinny," exclaimed her aunt, "how you scared me!"Nothing," said Virginia

"She refused to kiss me," put in Clarence, half in play, half in
resentment.She put one of her white hands on each
of her niece's cheeks, kissed her, and then gazed into her face until
Virginia reddened."Law, Jinny, you're quite pretty," said her aunt

"I hadn't realized it--but you must take care of your complexion.You're
horribly sunburned, and you let your hair blow all over your face.It's
barbarous not to wear a mask when you ride.Your Pa doesn't look after
you properly.I would ask you to stay to the dance to-night if your
skin were only white, instead of red.You're old enough to know better,
Virginia.Vance was to have driven out for dinner.Colfax continued, "and he generally brings
candy.She sat down with a
grand air at the head of the table, while Alfred took the lid from the
silver soup-tureen in front of her."Jinny, can't you say something
bright?Do I have to listen to Clarence's horse talk for another hour?"Why do you listen to Clarence's horse talk?""Why don't
you make him go to work!"Colfax, laughing, "what could he do?""He hasn't a serious interest in life."And his mother, as usual, took his side."What put that into your head, Jinny," she said."He has the place here
to look after, a very gentlemanly occupation."Yes," said Virginia, scornfully, "we're all gentlemen in the South.What do we know about business and developing the resources of the
country?"You make my head ache, my dear," was her aunt's reply."You ask me because I am a girl," said Virginia."You believe that women
were made to look at, and to play with,--not to think.But if we are
going to get ahead of the Yankees, we shall have to think.It was all
very well to be a gentleman in the days of my great-grandfather.But now
we have railroads and steamboats.We
of the South think of our ancestors, and drift deeper and deeper into
debt.We know how to fight, and we know how to command.But we have
been ruined by--" here she glanced at the retreating form of Alfred, and
lowered her voice, "by <DW65>s."Colfax's gaze rested languidly on her niece's faces which glowed
with indignation."You get this terrible habit of argument from Comyn," she said."He
ought to send you to boarding-school.You've been talking with that old reprobate Whipple.Why does Comyn put
up with him?""He isn't an old reprobate," said Virginia, warmly."You really ought to go to school," said her aunt.I suppose you wish Clarence to go into a factory.""If I were a man," said Virginia, "and going into a factory would teach
me how to make a locomotive or a cotton press, or to build a bridge, I
should go into a factory.We shall never beat the Yankees until we meet
them on their own ground."Colfax, and added fervently, "Thank
the Lord!"A QUIET SUNDAY IN LOCUST STREET

IF the truth were known where Virginia got the opinions which she
expressed so freely to her aunt and cousin, it was from Colonel Carvel
himself.The Colonel would rather have denounced the Dred Scott decision
than admit to Judge Whipple that one of the greatest weaknesses of the
South lay in her lack of mechanical and manufacturing ability.But he
had confessed as much in private to Captain Elijah Brent.The Colonel
would often sit for an hour or more, after supper, with his feet tucked
up on the mantel and his hat on the back of his head, buried in thought.Then he would saunter slowly down to the Planters' House bar, which
served the purposes of a club in those days, in search of an argument
with other prominent citizens.The Colonel had his own particular chair
in his own particular corner, which was always vacated when he came in
at the door.And then he always had three fingers of the best Bourbon
whiskey, no more and no less, every evening.He never met his bosom friend and pet antagonist at the Planters'
House bar.Judge Whipple, indeed, took his meals upstairs, but he never
descended,--it was generally supposed because of the strong slavery
atmosphere there.However, the Judge went periodically to his friend's
for a quiet Sunday dinner (so called in derision by St.Louisans), on
which occasions Virginia sat at the end of the table and endeavored to
pour water on the flames when they flared up too fiercely.The Sunday following her ride to Bellegarde was the Judge's Sunday,
Certain tastes which she had inherited had hitherto provided her with
pleasurable sensations while these battles were in progress.More than
once had she scored a fair hit on the Judge for her father,--to the
mutual delight of both gentlemen.But to-day she dreaded being present
at the argument.Just why she dreaded it is a matter of feminine
psychology best left to the reader for solution.The argument began, as usual, with the tearing apart limb by limb of the
unfortunate Franklin Pierce, by Judge Whipple."What a miserable exhibition in the eyes of the world," said the
Judge."Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire" (he pronounced this name with
infinite scorn) "managed by Jefferson Davis of Mississippi!""And he was well managed, sir," said the Colonel."What a pliant tool of your Southern slaveholders!I hear that you are
to give him a plantation as a reward.""He deserves it," continued the Judge, with conviction."See the
magnificent forts he permitted Davis to build up in the South, the
arsenals he let him stock.But the
day will, come when they will execrate Pierce before Benedict Arnold,
sir.And look at the infamous Kansas-Nebraska act!That is the greatest
crime, and Douglas and Pierce the greatest criminals, of the century.""Do have some more of that fried chicken, Judge," said Virginia.Whipple helped himself fiercely, and the Colonel smiled."You should be satisfied now," said he."Another Northern man is in the
White House."roared the Judge, with his mouth full.He swallows
the Dred Scott decision, and smirks.What a blot on the history of this
Republic!Whipple, "what are we coming to?A Northern
man, he could gag and bind Kansas and force her into slavery against the
will of her citizens.He packs his Cabinet to support the ruffians
you send over the borders.The very governors he ships out there, his
henchmen, have their stomachs turned.Look at Walker, whom they are
plotting against in Washington.He can't stand the smell of this
Lecompton Constitution Buchanan is trying to jam down their throats.Jefferson Davis would have troops there, to be sure that it goes
through, if he had his way.Can't you see how one sin leads to another,
Carvel?How slavery is rapidly demoralizing a free people?""It is because you won't let it alone where it belongs, sir," retorted
the Colonel.It was seldom that he showed any heat in his replies.He
talked slowly, and he had a way of stretching forth his hand to prevent
the more eager Judge from interrupting him."The welfare of the whole South, as matters now stand, sir, depends upon
slavery.Our plantations could not exist a day without slave labor.If
you abolished that institution, Judge Whipple, you would ruin millions
of your fellow-countrymen,--you would reduce sovereign states to a
situation of disgraceful dependence.And all, sir," now he raised his
voice lest the Judge break in, "all, sir, for the sake of a low breed
that ain't fit for freedom.You and I, who have the Magna Charta and
the Declaration of Independence behind us, who are descended from a
race that has done nothing but rule for ten centuries and more, may well
establish a Republic where the basis of stability is the self-control of
the individual--as long as men such as you and I form its citizens.And the minute you
and I let in <DW65>s, who haven't any more self-control than dogs, on
an equal basis, with as much of a vote as you have,--<DW65>s, sir, that
have lived like wild beasts in the depths of the jungle since the days
of Ham,--what's going to become of our Republic?"But the word was snatched out of his mouth."Education isn't a matter of one generation.No, sir, nor two, nor
three, nor four."Sir," said the Judge, "I can point out <DW64>s of intelligence and
learning.""And I reckon you could teach some monkeys to talk English, and recite
the catechism, and sing emotional hymns, if you brought over a couple of
million from Africa," answered the Colonel, dryly, as he rose to put on
his hat and light a cigar.It was his custom to offer a cigar to the Judge, who invariably refused,
and rubbed his nose with scornful violence.Virginia, on the verge of leaving, stayed on, fascinated by the turn the
argument had taken."Your prejudice is hide-bound, sir," said Mr."No, Whipple," said the Colonel, "when God washed off this wicked
earth, and started new, He saw fit to put the sons of Ham in subjection.They're slaves of each other in Africa, and I reckon they're treated no
better than they are here.Abuses can't be helped in any system, sir,
though we are bettering them.Were the poor in London in the days of the
Edwards as well off as our <DW65>s are to-day?"Because the world
has been a wicked place of oppression since Noah's day, is that any
reason why it should so continue until the day of Judgment?"The Colonel smiled, which was a sign that he was pleased with his
argument."Now, see here, Whipple," said he."If we had any guarantee that you
would let us alone where we are, to manage our slaves and to cultivate
our plantations, there wouldn't be any trouble.But the country keeps
on growing and growing, and you're not content with half.You want
everything,--all the new states must abolish slavery.And after a while
you will overwhelm us, and ruin us, and make us paupers.Do you wonder
that we contend for our rights, tooth and nail?"If it had not been for Virginia and Maryland and the South, this nation
would not be in existence.""First rate, Jinny," he cried."The nation is going to the dogs," he said, mumbling rather to himself
than to the others."We shall never prosper until the curse is shaken
off, or wiped out in blood.Our merchant marine,
of which we were so proud, has been annihilated by these continued
disturbances.But, sir," he cried, hammering his fist upon the table
until the glasses rang, "the party that is to save us was born at
Pittsburgh last year on Washington's birthday.Carvel, with amusement, "The Black Republican
Party, made up of old fools and young Anarchists, of Dutchmen and
<DW65>-worshippers.Why, Whipple, that party's a joke."Abraham Lincoln, sir," thundered Mr."And to my way of
thinking he has uttered a more significant phrase on the situation than
any of your Washington statesmen.'This government,' said he to a friend
of mine, 'cannot exist half slave and half free.'"Carvel
stirred uneasily, and in spite of himself, as though he were listening
to an oracle."He's a demagogue, seeking for striking phrases, sir.You're too
intelligent a man to be taken in by such as he.""I tell you he is not, sir.""I know him, sir," cried the Colonel, taking down his feet.Richardson of Springfield tells me he is low down.He was born in a log
cabin, and spends most of his time in a drug-store telling stories that
you would not listen to, Judge Whipple.""I would listen to anything he said," replied the Judge.But
mark my words, the day will come when it will.He was ballotted for
Vice-President in the Philadelphia convention last year.If the convention had heard him speak at Bloomington,
he would have been nominated instead of Fremont.If the nation could
have heard him, he would be President to-day instead of that miserable
Buchanan.And while the idiots on the
platform were drivelling, the people kept calling for Lincoln.He came ambling
out of the back of the hall, a lanky, gawky looking man, ridiculously
ugly, sir.But the moment he opened his mouth he had us spellbound.The
language which your low-down lawyer used was that of a God-sent prophet,
sir.He had those Illinois bumpkins all worked up,--the women crying,
and some of the men, too.Good Lord, they were mad--'We will
say to the Southern disunionists,' he cried,--'we will say to the
Southern disunionists, we won't go out of the Union, and you shan't.'"And he stood over the Judge in his favorite
attitude,--with his feet apart,--as he lighted another cigar."I reckon we're going to have war, Silas," said he, slowly; "but don't
you think that your Mr.I don't
count his bluster worth a cent.It's this youngster who comes
out here from Boston and buys a <DW65> with all the money he's got in
the world.And if he's an impetuous young fool; I'm no judge of men.""Appleton Brice wasn't precisely impetuous," remarked Mr.And
he smiled a little bitterly, as though the word had stirred a memory."It seems to be a kind
of fatality with me to get along with Yankees.I reckon there's a screw
loose somewhere, but Brice acted the man all the way through.He goa
a fall out of you, Silas, in your room, after the show.Virginia had risen, and she was standing very erects with a flush on her
face, waiting for her father to finish."To see Anne Brinsmade," she said.Hers was the one voice that seemed
to soften him--it never failed.He turned to her now with a movement
that was almost gentle."Virginia, I should like you to know my young
Yankee," said he."Thank you, Uncle Silas," said the girl, with dignity, "but I scarcely
think that he would care to know me."He feels no stronger than I do," replied the Judge."You have gotten used to me in eighteen years, and besides," she
flashed, "you never spent all the money you had in the world for a
principle."Whipple smiled as she went out of the door."I have spent pretty near all," he said.But more to himself than to the
Colonel.That evening, some young people came in to tea, two of the four big
Catherwood boys, Anne Brinsmade and her brother Jack, Puss Russell and
Bert, and Eugenie Renault.In an evil
moment Puss Russell started the subject of the young Yankee who had
deprived her of Hester.Puss was ably seconded by Jack Brinsmade, whose
reputation as a tormentor extended far back into his boyhood.In vain;
did Anne, the peacemaker, try to quench him, while the big Catherwoods
and Bert Russell laughed incessantly.She would not speak to Puss as that young lady bade her good night.And
the Colonel, coming home from an evening with Mr.Brinsmade, found his
daughter in an armchair, staring into the sitting-room fire.There was
no other light in the room Her chin was in her hand, and her lips were
pursed.said the Colonel, "what's the trouble now?""Come," he insisted, "what have they been doing to my girl?""I don't want to go to balls all my life.I want to go to
boarding-school, and learn something.Emily is going to Monticello after
Christmas.He, thought of his lonely
widowerhood, of her whose place Virginia had taken."It will only be for a little while.And Monticello isn't very far, Pa.""Well, well, there is plenty of time to think it over between now and
January," he said."And now I have a little favor to ask of you, honey."The Colonel took the other armchair, stretched his feet toward the
blaze, and stroked his goatee.He glanced covertly at his daughter's
profile."Yes, Pa" (without turning her head)."Jinny, I was going to speak of this young.He's a stranger here,
and he comes of a good family, and--and I like him.""And you wish me to invite him to my party," finished Virginia."I reckon you guessed it," he said.Then she said:

"Do you think, in bidding against me, that he behaved, like a
gentleman?""Lord, Virginia," he said, "I thought you told the judge this afternoon
teat it was done out of principle."But she bit her lip

"He is like all Yankees, without one bit of consideration for a woman."What makes you imagine that he thought of you at all, my dear?"asked
her father, mildly, "He does not know you.""I reckon that he wasn't worrying much about us.And besides, he was
trying to save Hester from Jennings.""I thought that you said that it was to be my party, Pa," said Virginia,
irrelevantly.The Colonel looked thoughtful, then he began to laugh."Haven't we enough Black Republican friends?""I didn't say that I wouldn't have him," she answered.The Colonel rose, and brushed the ashes from his goat.CHAPTER X. THE LITTLE HOUSE

When Stephen attempted to thank Judge Whipple for going on Hester's
bond, he merely said, "Tut, tut."The Judge rose at six, so his man Shadrach told Stephen.He had his
breakfast at the Planters' House at seven, read the Missouri Democrat,
and returned by eight.Sometimes he would say good morning to Stephen
and Richter, and sometimes he would not.Whipple was out a great
part of the day, and he had many visitors.Like
a great specialist (which he was), he would see only one person at a
time.And Stephen soon discovered that his employer did not discriminate
between age or sex, or importance, or condition of servitude.In short,
Stephen's opinion of Judge Whipple altered very materially before the
end of that first week.He saw poor women and disconsolate men go into
the private room ahead of rich citizens, who seemed content to wait
their turn on the hard wooden chairs against the wall of the main
office.There was one incident in particular, when a well-dressed
gentleman of middle age paced impatiently for two mortal hours after
Shadrach had taken his card into the sanctum.When at last he had been
admitted, Mr.It was that of a
big railroad man from the East.The transom let out the true state of
affairs."See here, Callender," the Judge was heard to say, "you fellows don't
like me, and you wouldn't come here unless you had to.But when your
road gets in a tight place, you turn up and expect to walk in ahead of
my friends.No, sir, if you want to see me, you've got to wait."Callender made some inaudible reply, "Money!"roared the Judge,
"take your money to Stetson, and see if you win your case."Richter smiled at Stephen, as if in sheer happiness at this
vindication of an employer who had never seemed to him to need a
defence.Stephen was greatly drawn toward this young German with the great scar
on his pleasant face.And he was itching to know about that scar.Every day, after coming in from dinner, Richter lighted a great brown
meerschaum, and read the St.Louis 'Anzeiger' and the 'Westliche Post'.Often he sang quietly to himself:

          "Deutschlands Sohne
          Laut ertone
          Euer Vaterlandgesang.Du Land des Ruhmes,
          Weih' zu deines Heiligthumes
          Hutern, uns and unser Schwert."And some wonderful quality in the German's
voice gave you a thrill when you heard them, albeit you could not
understand the words.Richter never guessed how Stephen, with his eyes
on his book, used to drink in those airs.And presently he found out
that they were inspired.The day that the railroad man called, and after he and the Judge had
gone out together, the ice was broken."You Americans from the North are a queer people, Mr.Richter, as he put on his coat.The Judge, at first I could not comprehend him--he would
scold and scold.But one day I see that his heart is warm, and since
then I love him.Have you ever eaten a German dinner, Mr.It was raining, the streets ankle-deep in mud, and the beer-garden by
the side of the restaurant to which they went was dreary and bedraggled.Inside, to all intents and
purposes, it was Germany.A most genial host crossed the room to give
Mr.Richter a welcome that any man might have envied."We were all 'Streber' together, in Germany," said Richter."Strivers, you might call it in English.In the Vaterland those who
seek for higher and better things--for liberty, and to be rid of
oppression--are so called.That is why we fought in '48 and lost.And
that is why we came here, to the Republic.I fear I will never be
the great lawyer--but the striver, yes, always.We must fight once more
to be rid of the black monster that sucks the blood of freedom--vampire."I fear,--yes, I fear," said the German, shaking his head.cried Richter, with a flash of anger in his blue eyes
that died as suddenly as it came,--died into reproach."Call me not a
foreigner--we Germans will show whether or not we are foreigners when
the time is ripe.Your
ancestors founded it, and fought for it, that the descendants of mine
might find a haven from tyranny.My friend, one-half of this city is
German, and it is they who will save it if danger arises.You must come
with me one night to South St.You will not think of us as foreign
swill, but as patriots who love our new Vaterland even as you love it.You must come to our Turner Halls, where we are drilling against the
time when the Union shall have need of us."exclaimed Stephen, in still greater
astonishment.The German's eloquence had made him tingle, even as had
the songs.answered Richter, smiling and holding up his glass
of beer."You will come to a 'commerce', and see."This is not our blessed Lichtenhainer, that we drink at Jena.One may
have a pint of Lichtenhainer for less than a groschen at Jena.Aber,"
he added as he rose, with a laugh that showed his strong teeth, "we
Americans are rich."As Stephen's admiration for his employer grew, his fear of him waxed
greater likewise.The Judge's methods of teaching law were certainly not
Harvard's methods.For a fortnight he paid as little attention to the
young man as he did to the messengers who came with notes and cooled
their heels in the outer office until it became the Judge's pleasure to
answer them.But he stuck to
his Chitty and his Greenleaf and his Kent.It was Richter who advised
him to buy Whittlesey's "Missouri Form Book," and warned him of Mr.There came a
fearful hour of judgment.Whipple
descended out of a clear sky, and instantly the law terms began to
rattle in Stephen's head like dried peas in a can.It was the Old Style
of Pleading this time, without a knowledge of which the Judge declared
with vehemence that a lawyer was not fit to put pen to legal cap."First," said Stephen, "was the Declaration.The answer to that was the
Plea.Then came the Rejoinder,
then the Surrejoinder, then the Rebutter, then the Surrebutter.But they
rarely got that far," he added unwisely."A good principle in Law, sir," said the Judge, "is not to volunteer
information."Stephen was somewhat cast down when he reached home that Saturday
evening.He had come out of his examination with feathers drooping.He
had been given no more briefs to copy, nor had Mr.Whipple vouchsafed
even to send him on an errand.He had not learned how common a thing
it is with young lawyers to feel that they are of no use in the world.His mother, knitting before the fire in her own room, greeted him
with her usual quiet smile of welcome.He tried to give her a humorous
account of his catechism of the morning, but failed."I am quite sure that he doesn't like me," said Stephen."If he did, he would not show it," she answered."I can feel it," said Stephen, dejectedly."The Judge was here this afternoon," said his mother.They say that he never calls in
the daytime, and rarely in the evening."He said that some of this Boston nonsense must be gotten out of you,"
answered Mrs.That
you needed to rub against the plain men who were building up the West.Who were making a vast world-power of the original little confederation
of thirteen states.And Stephen," she added more earnestly, "I am not
sure but what he is right."And for a long time he sat staring into the fire."He told me about a little house which we might rent very cheaply.The house is on this street, next door to Mr.Whipple brought the key, that we
might inspect it to-morrow.""But a servant," objected Stephen, "I suppose that we must have a
servant.""That poor girl whom you freed is here to see me every day.But Hester has no work and she is a burden to Judge
Whipple.Oh, no," she continued, in response to Stephen's glance, "the
Judge did not mention that, but I think he had it in mind that Nester
might come.Brice and Stephen walked down
Olive Street, and stood looking at a tiny house wedged in between, two
large ones with scrolled fronts.Sad memories of Beacon Street filled
them both as they gazed, but they said nothing of this to each other.As
Stephen put his hand on the latch of the little iron gate, a gentleman
came out of the larger house next door.He was past the middle age,
somewhat scrupulously dressed in the old fashion, in swallowtail coat
and black stock.Benevolence was in the generous mouth, in the large
nose that looked like Washington's, and benevolence fairly sparkled in
the blue eyes.He smiled at them as though he had known them always,
and the world seemed brighter that very instant.They smiled in return,
whereupon the gentleman lifted his hat.And the kindliness and the
courtliness of that bow made them very happy."Did you wish to look at
the house, madam?"he asked "Yes, sir," said Mrs."Allow me to open it for you," he said, graciously taking the key from
her."I fear that you will find it inconvenient and incommodious, ma'am.I should be fortunate, indeed, to get a good tenant."He fitted the key in the door, while Stephen and his mother smiled at
each other at the thought of the rent.The gentleman opened the door,
and stood aside to let them enter, very much as if he were showing them
a palace for which he was the humble agent.They went into the little parlor, which was nicely furnished in mahogany
and horsehair.And it had back of it a bit of a dining room, with a
little porch overlooking the back yard.Brice thought of the dark
and stately high-ceiled dining-room she had known throughout her married
days: of the board from which a royal governor of Massachusetts Colony
had eaten, and some governors of the Commonwealth since.Thank God, she
had not to sell that, nor the Brice silver which had stood on the high
sideboard with the wolves and the shield upon it.She had not hoped again to have a home for these
things, nor the father's armchair, nor the few family treasures that
were to come over the mountains.The gentleman, with infinite tact, said little, but led the way through
the rooms.At the door of the kitchen he
stopped, and laid his hand kindly on Stephen's shoulder:-- "Here we may
not enter.This is your department, ma'am," said he.Finally, as they stood without waiting for the gentleman, who insisted
upon locking the door, they observed a girl in a ragged shawl hurrying
up the street.As she approached them, her eyes were fixed upon the
large house next door.But suddenly, as the gentleman turned, she caught
sight of him, and from her lips escaped a cry of relief.She flung open
the gate, and stood before him.Brinsmade," she cried, "mother is dying.You have done so much
for us, sir,--couldn't you come to her for a little while?She thought
if she might see you once more, she would die happy."The voice was
choked by a sob.Brinsmade took the girl's hand in his own, and turned to the lady
with as little haste, with as much politeness, as he had shown before."You will excuse me, ma'am," he said, with his hat in his hand.But she and her son watched him
as he walked rapidly down the street, his arm in the girl's, until they
were out of sight.Might not the price of this little house be likewise a piece of the
Brinsmade charity?Eliphalet Hopper, in his Sunday-best broadcloth was a marvel of
propriety.It seemed to Stephen that his face wore a graver expression
on Sunday when he met him standing on Miss Crane's doorstep, picking
the lint from his coat.But he
remembered what the Judge had said to his mother, and nodded.Why,
indeed, should he put on airs with this man who had come to St.Louis
unknown and unrecommended and poor, who by sheer industry had made
himself of importance in the large business of Carvel &, Company?As
for Stephen Brice, he was not yet earning his salt, but existing by the
charity of Judge Silas Whipple.Hopper, his glance caught by the
indefinable in Stephen's costume."Be you asked to Virginia Carvel's party?""I do not know Miss Carvel," said Stephen, wondering how well the other
did.And if the truth be told, he was a little annoyed at Mr.Hopper's
free use of her name."That shouldn't make no difference," said Eliphalet with just a shade
of bitterness in his tone."They keep open house, like all Southerners,"
Mr.Hopper hesitated,--"for such as come well recommended.I'most
forgot," said he."I callate you're not any too well recommended.I
'most forgot that little transaction down to the Court House.They do
say that she wanted that gal almighty bad,--she was most awful cut up
not to get her.Show her she
can't have everything her own way.And say," he added, with laughter,
"how you did fix that there stuckup Colfax boy!He'll never forgive
you no more than she.Hopper, meditatively, "it was a
durned-fool trick."I think Stephen's critics will admit that he had a good right to be
angry, and that they will admire him just a little bit because he kept
his temper.Hopper evidently thought he had gone too far."She ain't got no use for me, neither," he said."She's not long sighted, that's sure," replied Eliphalet, with emphasis.And it was then he made the
determination to write for the newspapers in order to pay the rent on
Mr.Miss Carvel's coming-out party was the chief
topic."They do say the Colonel is to spend a sight of money on that ball,"
said Mrs."I callate he ain't pushed for money," that gentleman vouchsafed."He's a good man, and done well by you, Mr."So--so," answered Eliphalet."But I will say that I done something for
the Colonel.I've saved him a hundred times my pay since I showed old
Hood the leaks.And I got a thousand dollar order from Wright & Company
this week for him.""I dare say you'd keep a tight hand enough on expenses," said Miss
Crane, half in sarcasm, half in approval."If Colonel Carvel was doin' business in New England," said Eliphalet,
"he'd been bankrupt long ago."Abner Reed broke in, "he'll get a
right smart mint o' money when he marries Virginia.They do say her
mother left her independent."And young Colfax ain't precisely a pauper," said Miss Crane."I'll risk a good deal that she don't marry Colfax," said Mr."No," he answered, "it ain't broke off.But I callate she won't have him
when the time comes.Heavy at heart, Stephen climbed the stairs, thanking heaven that he
had not been drawn into the controversy.He suspected that gentleman of an
aggressive determination to achieve wealth, and the power which comes
with it, for the purpose of using that power upon those beneath
him.Nay, when he thought over his conversation, he suspected him of
more,--of the intention to marry Virginia Carvel.It will be seen whether Stephen was right or wrong.He took a walk that afternoon, as far out as a place called Lindell's
Grove, which afterward became historic.And when he returned to the
house, his mother handed him a little white envelope."It came while you were out," she said.He turned it over, and stared at his name written across the front in a
feminine hand In those days young ladies did not write in the bold and
masculine manner now deemed proper.Stephen stared at the note, manlike,
and pondered."Why don't you open it, and see?"What a funny formal little note we should think
it now!He read it, and he read it
again, and finally he walked over to the window, still holding it in his
hand.Brice did not,
wherein she proved herself their superiors in the knowledge of mankind.Stephen stood for a long while looking out into the gathering dusk.Then
he went over to the fireplace and began tearing the note into little
bits.Only once did he pause, to look again at his name on the envelope."It is an invitation to Miss Carvel's party," he said.By Thursday of that week the Brices, with thanksgiving in their hearts,
had taken possession of Mr."MISS JINNY"

The years have sped indeed since that gray December when Miss Virginia
Carvel became eighteen.Louis has changed from a pleasant
Southern town to a bustling city, and a high building stands on the site
of that wide and hospitable home of Colonel Carvel.And the Colonel's
thoughts that morning, as Ned shaved him, flew back through the years to
a gently rolling Kentucky countryside, and a pillared white house among
the oaks.He was riding again with Beatrice Colfax in the springtime.Again he stretched out his arm as if to seize her bridle-hand, and he
felt the thoroughbred rear.Then the vision faded, and the memory of his
dead wife became an angel's face, far--so far away.Louis, and with his inheritance had founded
his business, and built the great double house on the corner.The child
came, and was named after the noble state which had given so many of her
sons to the service of the Republic.A black war of conquest which,
like many such, was to add to the nation's fame and greatness: Glory
beckoned, honor called--or Comyn Carvel felt them.With nothing of the
profession of arms save that born in the Carvels, he kissed Beatrice
farewell and steamed down the Mississippi, a captain in Missouri
regiment.Ned, as he shaved his master's face, read his thoughts by the strange
sympathy of love.He had heard the last pitiful words of his mistress.Posthlewaite as he read the sublime
service of the burial of the dead.It was Ned who had met his master,
the Colonel, at the levee, and had fallen sobbing at his feet.Long after he was shaved that morning, the Colonel sat rapt in his
chair, while the faithful servant busied himself about the room, one eye
on his master the while.Carvel's revery is broken by
the swift rustle of a dress, and a girlish figure flutters in and plants
itself on the wide arm of his mahogany barber chair, Mammy Easter in the
door behind her.And the Colonel, stretching forth his hands, strains
her to him, and then holds her away that he may look and look again into
her face."Honey," he said, "I was thinking of your mother."Virginia raised her eyes to the painting on the wall over the marble
mantel.The face under the heavy coils of brown hair was sweet and
gentle, delicately feminine.It had an expression of sorrow that seemed
a prophecy.The Colonel's hand strayed upward to Virginia's head."You are not like her, honey," he said: "You may see for yourself.You
are more like your Aunt Bess, who lived in Baltimore, and she--"

"I know," said Virginia, "she was the image of the beauty, Dorothy
Manners, who married my great-grandfather.""Yes, Jinny," replied the Colonel, smiling.You are
somewhat like your great-grandmother."cried Virginia, putting her hand over his mouth, "I like
that.You and Captain Lige are always afraid of turning my head.I need
not be a beauty to resemble her.When you
took me on to Calvert House to see Uncle Daniel that time, I remember
the picture by, by--"

"Sir Joshua Reynolds.""You were only eleven," says the Colonel."She is not a difficult person to remember."Carvel, laughing, "especially if you have lived with
her.""Not that I wish to be that kind," said Virginia, meditatively,--"to
take London by storm, and keep a man dangling for years.""But he got her in the end," said the Colonel."And a very honorable record it is," exclaimed the Colonel."Jinny,
we shall read it together when we go a-visiting to Culvert House.I
remember the old gentleman as well as if I had seen him yesterday.""Pa," she began, "Pa, did you ever see the pearls Dorothy Carvel wore on
her wedding day?"Well, I reckon I did," replied the Colonel, gazing at her steadfastly."Pa, Uncle Daniel told me that I was to have that necklace when I was
old enough."said the Colonel, fidgeting, "your Uncle Daniel was just fooling
you.""He's a bachelor," said Virginia; "what use has he got for it?""Why," says the Colonel, "he's a young man yet, your uncle, only
fifty-three.I've known older fools than he to go and do it.I've seed 'em at seventy, an' shufflin' about
peart as Marse Clarence's gamecocks.Why, dar was old Marse Ludlow--"

"Now, Mister Johnson," Virginia put in severely, "no more about old
Ludlow."Ned grinned from ear to ear, and in the ecstasy of his delight dropped
the Colonel's clothes-brush.he cried, "ef she ain't
recommembered."Recovering his gravity and the brush simultaneously, he
made Virginia a low bow.I sholy is gwinter s'lute
you dis day.May de good Lawd make you happy, Miss Jinny, an' give you a
good husban'--"

"Thank you, Mister Johnson, thank you," said Virginia, blushing."How come she recommembered, Marse Comyn?Doan't you talk to Ned 'bout de quality, Marsa.""And when did I ever talk to you about the quality, you scalawag?""Th' ain't none 'cept de bes' quality keep they word dat-a-way," said
Ned, as he went off to tell Uncle Ben in the kitchen.Was there ever, in all this wide country, a good cook who was not a
tyrant?Uncle Ben Carvel was a veritable emperor in his own domain; and
the Colonel himself, had he desired to enter the kitchen, would have
been obliged to come with humble and submissive spirit.As for Virginia,
she had had since childhood more than one passage at arms with Uncle
Ben.And the question of who had come off victorious had been the
subject of many a debate below stairs.There were a few days in the year, however, when Uncle Ben permitted
the sanctity of his territory to be violated.On such a day it was his habit to retire to the broken chair
beside the sink (the chair to which he had clung for five-and-twenty
years).There he would sit, blinking, and carrying on the while an
undercurrent of protests and rumblings, while Miss Virginia and other
young ladies mixed and chopped and boiled and baked and gossiped.But
woe to the unfortunate Rosetta if she overstepped the bounds of respect!Woe to Ned or Jackson or Tato, if they came an inch over the threshold
from the hall beyond!Even Aunt Easter stepped gingerly, though she was
wont to affirm, when assisting Miss Jinny in her toilet, an absolute
contempt for Ben's commands."So Ben ordered you out, Mammy?"think I'se skeered o' him, honey?Reckon I'd frail
'em good ef he cotched hole of me with his black hands.Jes' let him try
to come upstairs once, honey, an' see what I say to'm."Nevertheless Ben had, on one never-to-be-forgotten occasion, ordered
Mammy Easter out, and she had gone.And now, as she was working the beat
biscuits to be baked that evening, Uncle Ben's eye rested on her with
suspicion.What mere man may write with any confidence of the delicacies which
were prepared in Uncle's kitchen that morning?No need in those days of
cooking schools.What Southern lady, to the manner born, is not a cook
from the cradle?Even Ben noted with approval Miss Virginia's scorn for
pecks and pints, and grunted with satisfaction over the accurate pinches
of spices and flavors which she used.And he did Miss Eugenie the honor
to eat one of her praleens.That night came Captain Lige Brent, the figure of an eager and
determined man swinging up the street, and pulling out his watch under
every lamp-post.And in his haste, in the darkness of a midblock, he
ran into another solid body clad in high boots and an old army overcoat,
beside a wood wagon."Howdy, Captain," said he of the high boots."Well, I just thought as much," was the energetic reply; "minute I seen
the rig I knew Captain Grant was behind it."He held out a big hand, which Captain Grant clasped, just looking at
his own with a smile.The stranger was Captain Elijah Brent of the
'Louisiana'."Now," said Brent, "I'll just bet a full cargo that you're off to the
Planters' House, and smoke an El Sol with the boys.""You're keen, Captain," said he."I've got something here that'll outlast an El Sol a whole day,"
continued Captain Breast, tugging at his pocket and pulling out a
six-inch cigar as black as the night.The Captain instantly struck a match on his boot and was puffing in a
silent enjoyment which delighted his friend."Reckon he don't bring out cigars when you make him a call," said the
steamboat captain, jerking his thumb up at the house.Captain Grant did not reply to that, nor did Captain Lige expect him to,
as it was the custom of this strange and silent man to speak ill of no
one.He turned rather to put the stakes back into his wagon."Where are you off to, Lige?""Lord bless my soul," said Captain Lige, "to think that I could forget!""Grant, did you ever see my
little sweetheart, Jinny Carvel?""She ain't little
any more, and she eighteen to-day."Captain Grant clapped his hand to his forehead."Say, Lige," said he, "that reminds me.A month or so ago I pulled a
fellow out of Renault's area across from there.After he got away I saw the Colonel and his daughter in the
window."Instantly Captain Lige became excited, and seized Captain Grant by the
cape of his overcoat."Say, Grant, what kind of appearing fellow was he?""Short, thick-set, blocky face.""I reckon I know," said Breast, bringing down his fist on the wagon
board; "I've had my eye on him for some little time."He walked around the block twice after Captain Grant had driven down the
muddy street, before he composed himself to enter the Carvel mansion.He
paid no attention to the salutations of Jackson, the butler, who saw him
coming and opened the door, but climbed the stairs to the sitting-room."Why, Captain Lige, you must have put wings on the Louisiana," said
Virginia, rising joyfully from the arm of her father's chair to meet
him.What, give me up when I never missed a birthday,--and this the best of
all of 'em."If your pa had got sight of me shovin' in wood and cussin' the pilot
for slowin' at the crossin's, he'd never let you ride in my boat again.Bill Jenks said: 'Are you plum crazy, Brent?'Five dollars'' says I; 'wouldn't go in for five hundred.To-morrow's
Jinny Carvel's birthday, and I've just got to be there.'I reckon the
time's come when I've got to say Miss Jinny," he added ruefully.The Colonel rose, laughing, and hit the Captain on the back."Drat you, Lige, why don't you kiss the girl?Can't you see she's
waiting?"The honest Captain stole one glance at Virginia, and turned red copper
color."Shucks, Colonel, I can't be kissing her always."We'll not talk of husbands yet awhile, Lige."Virginia went up to Captain Lige, deftly twisted into shape his black
tie, and kissed him on the check.How his face burned when she touched
him.said she, "and don't you ever dare to treat me as a young lady.Why, Pa, he's blushing like a girl.He's going to be married at last to that Creole girl in New Orleans."The Colonel slapped his knee, winked slyly at Lige, while Virginia began
to sing:

       "I built me a house on the mountain so high,
        To gaze at my true love as she do go by.""There's only one I'd ever marry, Jinny," protested the Captain,
soberly, "and I'm a heap too old for her.But I've seen a youngster
that might mate with her, Colonel," he added mischievously."If he just
wasn't a Yankee.Jinny, what's the story I hear about Judge Whipple's
young man buying Hester?"It was Virginia's turn to blush, and she grew
red as a peony."He's a tall, hateful, Black Republican Yankee!""There you do him wrong, honey," the Colonel put in."I hear he took Hester to Miss Crane's," the Captain continued, filling
the room with his hearty laughter."That boy has sand enough, Jinny; I'd
like to know him.""You'll have that priceless opportunity to-night," retorted Miss
Virginia, as she flung herself out of the room."Pa has made me invite
him to my party."Whereupon the Captain hastily
ripped open the bundle under his arm and produced a very handsome India
shawl.With a cry of delight Virginia threw it over her shoulders and
ran to the long glass between the high windows."Her father, I reckon," was the prompt reply."Captain Lige," said she, turning to him."If you had only kept the
presents you have brought me from New Orleans, you might sell out your
steamboat and be a rich man.""He is a rich man," said the Colonel, promptly."Did you ever miss
bringing her a present, Lige?""When the Cora Anderson burnt," answered the Captain."Why," cried Virginia, "you brought me a piece of her wheel, with the
char on it.It was when the
French dress, with the furbelows, which Madame Pitou had gotten me from
Paris for you, was lost.""And I think I liked the piece of wheel better," says Virginia."It was
brought me by a brave man, the last to leave his boat.""And who should be the last to leave, but the captain?I saw the thing
in the water; and I just thought we ought to have a relic.""Lige," said the Colonel, putting up his feet, "do you remember the
French toys you used to bring up here from New Orleans?""Colonel," replied Brent, "do you recall the rough and uncouth young
citizen who came over here from Cincinnati, as clerk on the Vicksburg?""I remember, sir, that he was so promising that they made him
provisional captain the next trip, and he was not yet twenty-four years
of age.""And do you remember buying the Vicksburg at the sheriff's sale for
twenty thousand dollars, and handing her over to young Brent, and
saying, 'There, my son, she's your boat, and you can pay for her when
you like'?"Carvel, sternly, "your memory's too good.But
I proved myself a good business man, Jinny; he paid for her in a year.""You don't mean that you made him pay you for the boat?""Why, Pa, I didn't think you were that mean!""I was a heap meaner," said her father.Virginia drew in her breath, and looked at the Colonel in amazement."He's the meanest man I know," said Captain Lige."He made me pay
interest, and a mint julep.""Upon my word, Pa," said Miss Virginia, soberly, "I shouldn't have
believed it of you."Just then Jackson, in his white jacket; came to announce that supper was
ready, and they met Ned at the dining-room door, fairly staggering under
a load of roses."Marse Clarence done send 'em in, des picked out'n de hothouse dis
afternoon, Miss Jinny.She took the flowers from Ned, one by one, and to
the wonderment of Captain Lige and her--father strewed them hither and
thither upon the table until the white cloth was hid by the red flowers.The Colonel stroked his goatee and nudged Captain Lige."Look-a-there, now," said he."Any other woman would have spent two
mortal hours stickin' 'em in china."Virginia, having critically surveyed her work, amid exclamations from
Ned and Jackson, had gone around to her place.And there upon her plate
lay a pearl necklace.For an instant she clapped her palms together,
staring at it in bewilderment.And once more the little childish cry of
delight, long sweet to the Colonel's ears, escaped her."Pa," she said, "is it--?"And there she stopped, for fear that it might
not be."Your Uncle Daniel sent it, as he
promised.And when you go upstairs, if Easter has done as I told her,
you will see a primrose dress with blue coin-flowers on your bed.Daniel
thought you might like that, too, for a keepsake.Dorothy Manners wore
it in London, when she was a girl."And so Virginia ran and threw her arms about her father's neck, and
kissed him again and again.And lest the Captain feel badly, she laid
his India shawl beside her; and the necklace upon it.What a joyful supper they had,--just the three of them!And as the fresh
roses filled the room with fragrance, Virginia filled it with youth and
spirits, and Mr.Carvel and the Captain with honest, manly merriment.And Jackson plied Captain Brent (who was a prime favorite in that house)
with broiled chicken and hot beat biscuits and with waffles, until at
length he lay back in his chair and heaved a sigh of content, lighting a
cigar.And then Virginia, with a little curtsey to both of them, ran off
to dress for the party."Well," said Captain Brent, "I reckon there'll be gay goings-on here
to-night.I wouldn't miss the sight of 'em, Colonel, for all the cargoes
on the Mississippi."No, thank you, Lige," Mr."Do you remember, one
morning some five years ago, when I took in at the store a Yankee named
Hopper?Captain Brent jumped, and the ashes of his cigar fell on his coat.He
had forgotten his conversation with Captain Grant."I reckon I do," he said dryly.For a moment he was on the point of telling the affair.He could not be sure of Eliphalet from Grant's description.So
he decided to await a better time.Captain Brent was one to make sure of
his channel before going ahead."Well," continued the Colonel, "I have been rather pushed the last week,
and Hopper managed things for this dance.He got the music, and saw the
confectioner.But he made such a close bargain with both of 'em that
they came around to me afterward," he added, laughing."Lige," replied the Colonel, "you never do get over a prejudice.Yes,
he's coming, just to oversee things.He seems to have mighty little
pleasure, and he's got the best business head I ever did see.Carvel, meditatively, as he put on his hat, "a Yankee, when he
will work, works like all possessed.Hood don't like him any more than
you do, but he allows Hopper is a natural-born business man.Last month
Samuels got tight, and Wright & Company were going to place the largest
order in years.I I'm
too old to solicit business, Hood,' said I.'Then there's only one man
to send,' says he, 'young Hopper.He'll get the order, or I'll give up
this place I've had for twenty years.'Hopper 'callated' to get it, and
another small one pitched in.And you'd die laughing, Lige, to hear how
he did it.""Some slickness, I'll gamble," grunted Captain Lige."Well, I reckon 'twas slick," said the Colonel, thoughtfully."You know
old man Wright hates a solicitor like poison.And
maybe you've noticed signs stuck up all over his store, 'No Solicitors
nor Travelling Men Allowed Here'.""But Hopper--Hopper walks in, sir, bold as you please, right past the
signs till he comes to the old man's cage.Wright,'
says he to the clerk.shouts old Wright,
flying 'round in his chair, 'what the devil does this mean?'And you dare to come in
here?bellowed the
old man; 'I reckon you're a damned Yankee.I reckon I'll upset your
"callations" for once.And if I catch you in here again, I'll wring your
neck like a roostah's."Wright himself,--afterward," replied Mr.The old man lives at the Planters' House, you know.Hopper do but go 'round there that very night and give a <DW65> two bits
to put him at the old man's table.When Wright comes and sees him, he
nearly has one of his apoplectic fits.But in marches Hopper the next
morning with twice the order."He's dangerous," said the Captain, emphatically."The Yankees are changing business in this town," was the Colonel's
answer."We've got to keep the pace, Lige."THE PARTY

To gentle Miss Anne Brinsmade, to Puss Russell of the mischievous eyes,
and even to timid Eugenie Renault, the question that burned was: Would
he come, or would he not?And, secondarily, how would Virginia treat him
if he came?Put our friend Stephen for the subjective, and Miss Carvers
party for the objective in the above, and we have the clew.For very
young girls are given to making much out of a very little in such
matters.If Virginia had not gotten angry when she had been teased a
fortnight before, all would have been well.Even Puss, who walked where angels feared to tread, did not dare to go
too far with Virginia.She had taken care before the day of the party to
beg forgiveness with considerable humility.It had been granted with a
queenly generosity.And after that none of the bevy had dared to broach
the subject to Virginia.He told Puss afterward that
when Virginia got through with him, he felt as if he had taken a rapid
trip through the wheel-house of a large steamer.Puss tried, by
various ingenious devices, to learn whether Mr.These things added a zest to a party long looked forward to amongst
Virginia's intimates.In those days young ladies did not "come out" so
frankly as they do now.Mothers did not announce to the world that they
possessed marriageable daughters.And then the matrimonial market was feverishly active.Young
men proposed as naturally as they now ask a young girl to go for a
walk,--and were refused quite as naturally.An offer of marriage was not
the fearful and wonderful thing--to be dealt with gingerly--which it has
since become.Seventeen was often the age at which they began.And one
of the big Catherwood boys had a habit of laying his heart and hand at
Virginia's feet once a month.Nor did his vanity suffer greatly when she
laughed at him.It was with a flutter of excitement, therefore, that Miss Carvel's
guests flitted past Jackson, who held the door open obsequiously.The
boldest of them took a rapid survey of the big parlor, before they put
foot on the stairs to see whether Mr.And if
their curiosity held them too long, they were usually kissed by the
Colonel.Carvel shook hands heartily with the young mean and called them by
their first names, for he knew most of their fathers and grandfathers.And if an older gentleman arrived, perhaps the two might be seen going
down the hall together, arm in arm.So came his beloved enemy, Judge
Whipple, who did not make an excursion to the rear regions of the house
with the Colonel; but they stood and discussed Mr.President Buchanan's
responsibility for the recent panic, until the band, which Mr.Hopper
had stationed under the stairs, drowned their voices.As we enter the room, there stands Virginia under the rainbowed prisms
of the great chandelier, receiving.But here was suddenly a woman of
twenty-eight, where only this evening we knew a slip of a girl.It was
a trick she had, to become majestic in a ball-gown.She held her head
high, as a woman should, and at her slender throat glowed the pearls of
Dorothy Manners.The result of all this was to strike a little awe into the souls of many
of her playmates.Little Eugenie nearly dropped a curtsey.Belle Cluyme
was so impressed that she forgot for a whole hour to be spiteful.But
Puss Russell kissed her on both cheeks, and asked her if she really
wasn't nervous.But she said
nothing to her hostess, for fear of marring an otherwise happy occasion.She retired with Jack Brim made to a corner, where she recited:--

     "Oh young Lochinvar is come out of the East;
     Of millions of Yankees I love him the least."Clarence Colfax, resplendent in new evening clothes just
arrived from New York, was pressing his claim for the first dance with
his cousin in opposition to numerous other claims, the chatter of the
guests died away.Virginia turned her head, and for an instant the
pearls trembled on her neck.There was a young man cordially and
unconcernedly shaking hands with her father and Captain Lige.Her memory
of that moment is, strangely, not of his face (she did not deign to
look at that), but of the muscle of his shoulder half revealed as he
stretched forth his arm."Virginia," he whispered earnestly, almost fiercely, "Virginia, who
invited him here?""I did," said Virginia, calmly, "of course.cried Clarence, "do you know who he is?""Yes," she answered, "I know.And is that any reason why he should not
come here as a guest?Would you bar any gentleman from your house on
account of his convictions?"Ah, Virginia, who had thought to hear that argument from your lips?What
would frank Captain Lige say of the consistency of women, if he heard
you now?And how give an account of yourself to Anne Brinsmade?What
contrariness has set you so intense against your own argument?Clarence can recover from his
astonishment and remind her of her vehement words on the subject at
Bellegarde, Mr.Stephen is making thither with the air of one who
conquers.Has he no shame that he should hold his head so high?She feels her color mounting, even as her resentment rises at his
self-possession, and yet she would have despised him had he shown
self-consciousness in gait or manner in the sight of her assembled
guests.Nearly as tall as the Colonel himself, he is plainly seen, and
Miss Puss in her corner does not have to stand on tiptoe.Carvel
does the honors of the introduction.But a daughter of the Carvels was not to fail before such a paltry
situation as this.Shall it be confessed that curiosity stepped into the
breach?As she gave him her hand she was wondering how he would act.As a matter of fact he acted detestably.He said nothing whatever, but
stood regarding her with a clear eye and a face by far too severe.The thought that he was meditating on the incident of the auction sale
crossed through her mind, and made her blood simmer.An evil spirit took
possession of Virginia.Brice, do you know my cousin, Mr.To this new phase his sense of humor
did not rise.Brice was a Yankee and no gentleman, inasmuch as he
had overbid a lady for Hester."Have you come here to live, Mr."Yes," he said, "if I can presently make enough to keep me alive."Then
turning to Virginia, he said, "Will you dance, Miss Carvel?"The effrontery of this demand quite drew the breath from the impatient
young gentlemen who had been waiting their turn.Several of them spoke
up in remonstrance.And for the moment (let one confess it who knows),
Virginia was almost tempted to lay her arm in his.Then she made a bow
that would have been quite as effective the length of the room.Brice," she said, "but I am engaged to Mr.Abstractedly he watched her glide away in her cousin's arms.Stephen had
a way of being preoccupied at such times.When he grew older he
would walk the length of Olive Street, look into face after face
of acquaintances, not a quiver of recognition in his eyes.But most
probably the next week he would win a brilliant case in the Supreme
Court.And so now, indifferent to the amusement of some about him, he
stood staring after Virginia and Clarence.Where had he seen Colfax's
face before he came West?Many, many years before he
had stood with his father in the mellow light of the long gallery at
Hollingdean, Kent, before a portrait of the Stuarts' time.The face was
that of one of Lord Northwell's ancestors, a sporting nobleman of the
time of the second Charles.It was a head which compelled one to pause
before it.Strangely enough,--it was the head likewise of Clarence
Colfax.The image of it Stephen had carried undimmed in the eye of his memory.White-haired Northwell's story, also.Brice
had expected his small son to grasp.As a matter of fact Stephen had not
grasped it then--but years afterward.It was not a pleasant story,--and
yet there was much of credit in it to the young rake its subject,--of
dash and courage and princely generosity beside the profligacy and
incontinence.The face had impressed him, with its story.He had often dreamed of it,
and of the lace collar over the dull-gold velvet that became it so well.And here it was at last, in a city west of the Mississippi River.Here
were the same delicately chiselled features, with their pallor, and
satiety engraved there at one and twenty.Here was the same lazy scorn
in the eyes, and the look which sleeplessness gives to the lids: the
hair, straight and fine and black; the wilful indulgence--not of one
life, but of generations--about the mouth; the pointed chin.And yet it
was a fact to dare anything, and to do anything.One thing more ere we have done with that which no man may explain.Had
he dreamed, too, of the girl?Stephen might not tell, but
thrice had the Colonel spoken to him before he answered."You must meet some of these young ladies, sir."It was little wonder that Puss Russell thought him dull on that first
occasion.Out of whom condescension is to flow is a matter of which
Heaven takes no cognizance.To use her own words, Puss thought him
"stuck up," when he should have been grateful.We know that Stephen
was not stuck up, and later Miss Russell learned that likewise.Very
naturally she took preoccupation for indifference.It is a matter worth
recording, however, that she did not tease him, because she did not
dare.He did not ask her to dance, which was rude.Carvel, who introduced him to Miss Renault and Miss Saint
Cyr, and other young ladies of the best French families.And finally,
drifting hither and thither with his eyes on Virginia, in an evil moment
he was presented to Mrs.Colfax was a very great lady indeed, albeit the daughter of an overseer.She bore Addison Colfax's name, spent his fortune, and retained her good
looks.On this particular occasion she was enjoying herself quite as
much as any young girl in the room, and, while resting from a waltz, was
regaling a number of gentlemen with a humorous account of a scandal at
the Virginia Spring's.None but a great lady could have meted out the punishment administered
to poor Stephen.None but a great lady could have concerned it.And he,
who had never been snubbed before, fell headlong into her trap.How
was the boy to know that there was no heart in the smile with which she
greeted him?She continued to talk about
Virginia Springs, "Oh, Mr.Brice, of course you have been there.Charles, you look
as if you were just dying to waltz.Let's have a turn before the music
stops."And so she whirled away, leaving Stephen forlorn, a little too angry to
be amused just then.In that state he spied a gentleman coming towards
him--a gentleman the sight of whom he soon came to associate with all
that is good and kindly in this world, Mr.And now he put his
hand on Stephen's shoulder.Whether he had seen the incident just past,
who can tell?"My son," said he, "I am delighted to see you here.Now that we are such
near neighbors, we must be nearer friends.You must know my wife, and my
son Jack, and my daughter Anne."Brinsmade was a pleasant little body, but plainly not a fit mate
for her husband.Jack gave Stephen a warm grasp of the hand, and
an amused look.As for Anne, she was more like her father; she was
Stephen's friend from that hour."I have seen you quite often, going in at your gate, Mr.And
I have seen your mother, too."She has such a
wonderful face."And the girl raised her truthful blue eyes to his."My mother would be delighted to know you," he ventured, not knowing
what else to say.It was an effort for him to reflect upon their new
situation as poor tenants to a wealthy family."I shall call on her to-morrow, with
mother.Brice," she continued, "do you know that your
mother is just the person I should go to if I were in trouble, whether I
knew her or not?""I have found her a good person in trouble," said Stephen, simply.He
might have said the same of Anne.She had thought him cold, but these words belied
that.She had wrapped him in that diaphanous substance with which young
ladies (and sometimes older ones) are wont to deck their heroes.She had
approached a mystery--to find it human, as are many mysteries.But thank
heaven that she found a dignity, a seriousness,--and these more than
satisfied her.Likewise, she discovered something she had not looked
for, an occasional way of saying things that made her laugh.She danced
with him, and passed him back to Miss Puss Russell, who was better
pleased this time; she passed him on to her sister, who also danced with
him, and sent him upstairs for her handkerchief.As the evening wore on, he was more
and more aware of an uncompromising attitude in his young hostess, whom
he had seen whispering to various young ladies from behind her fan as
they passed her.He had not felt equal to asking her to dance a second
time.Honest Captain Lige Breast, who seemed to have taken a fancy to
him, bandied him on his lack of courage with humor that was a little
rough.And, to Stephen's amazement, even Judge Whipple had pricked him
on.It was on his way upstairs after Emily Russell's handkerchief that
he ran across another acquaintance.Eliphalet Hopper, in Sunday
broadcloth, was seated on the landing, his head lowered to the level of
the top of the high door of the parlor.Stephen caught a glimpse of the
picture whereon his eyes were fixed.Perhaps it is needless to add that
Miss Virginia Carvel formed the central figure of it.Hopper, and added darkly: "I ain't in no hurry.Just
now they callate I'm about good enough to manage the business end of
an affair like this here.But some day," said he,
suddenly barring Stephen's way, "some day I'll give a party.And hark to
me when I tell you that these here aristocrats 'll be glad enough to get
invitations."The
incident was all that was needed to dishearten and disgust him.Kindly
as he had been treated by others, far back in his soul was a thing that
rankled.Shall it be told crudely why he went that night?Stephen
Brice, who would not lie to others, lied to himself.And when he came
downstairs again and presented Miss Emily with her handkerchief,
his next move was in his mind.And that was to say good-night to the
Colonel, and more frigidly to Miss Carvel herself.But music has upset
many a man's calculations.The strains of the Jenny Lind waltz were beginning to float through the
rooms.There was Miss Virginia in a corner of the big parlor, for the
moment alone with her cousin.Not a
sign did she give of being aware of his presence until he stood before
her.But she said: "So you have
come at last to try again, Mr.Brice said: "If you will do me the honor, Miss Carvel."Clarence Colfax got to his feet.Then she
looked up at the two men as they stood side by side, and perhaps swept
them both in an instant's comparison.The New Englander's face must have reminded her more of her own father,
Colonel Carvel.It possessed, from generations known, the power to
control itself.She afterwards admitted that she accepted him to tease
Clarence.Miss Russell, whose intuitions are usually correct, does not
believe this."I will dance with you," said Virginia.But, once in his arms, she seemed like a wild thing, resisting.Although
her gown brushed his coat, the space between them was infinite, and her
hand lay limp in his, unresponsive of his own pressure.Not so her feet;
they caught the step and moved with the rhythm of the music, and round
the room they swung.More than one pair paused in the dance to watch
them.Then, as they glided past the door, Stephen was disagreeably
conscious of some one gazing down from above, and he recalled Eliphalet
Hopper and his position.The sneer from Eliphalet's seemed to penetrate
like a chilly draught.All at once, Virginia felt her partner gathering up his strength, and
by some compelling force, more of wild than of muscle, draw her nearer.Unwillingly her hand tightened under his, and her blood beat faster
and her color came and went as they two moved as one.Anger--helpless
anger--took possession of her as she saw the smiles on the faces of her
friends, and Puss Russell mockingly throwing a kiss as she passed her.And then, strange in the telling, a thrill as of power rose within her
which she strove against in vain.A knowledge of him who guided her so
swiftly, so unerringly, which she had felt with no other man.Faster and
faster they stepped, each forgetful of self and place, until the waltz
came suddenly to a stop.said Captain Lige to Judge Whipple, "you can whollop me on my
own forecastle if they ain't the handsomest couple I ever did see."CHAPTER I. RAW MATERIAL

Summer, intolerable summer, was upon the city at last.The families of
its richest citizens had fled.Even at that early day some braved the
long railroad journey to the Atlantic coast.Amongst these were our
friends the Cluymes, who come not strongly into this history.But many, like the Brinsmades and the Russells,
the Tiptons and the Hollingsworths, retired to the local paradise of
their country places on the Bellefontaine road, on the cool heights
above the river.Thither, as a respite from the hot office, Stephen was
often invited by kind Mr.Brinsmade, who sometimes drove him out in his
own buggy.But Miss Virginia
Carvel he had never seen since the night he had danced with her.This was because, after her return from the young ladies' school at
Monticello, she had gone to Glencoe, Glencoe, magic spot, perched high
on wooded highlands.And under these the Meramec, crystal pure, ran
lightly on sand and pebble to her bridal with that turbid tyrant, the
Father of Waters.To reach Glencoe you spent two dirty hours on that railroad which
(it was fondly hoped) would one day stretch to the Pacific Ocean.You
generally spied one of the big Catherwood boys in the train, or their
tall sister Maude.The Catherwoods likewise lived at Glencoe in the
summer.And on some Saturday afternoons a grim figure in a linen duster
and a silk skull-cap took a seat in the forward car.That was Judge
Whipple, on his way to spend a quiet Sunday with Colonel Carvel.To the surprise of many good people, the Judge had recently formed
another habit.At least once a week he would drop in at the little house
on Olive Street next to Mr.Brinsmade's big one, which was shut up, and
take tea with Mrs.Afterward he would sit on the little porch
over the garden in the rear, or on the front steps, and watch the
bob-tailed horse-cars go by.His conversation was chiefly addressed to
the widow.Rarely to Stephen; whose wholesome respect for his employer
had in no wise abated.Through the stifling heat of these summer days Stephen sat in the outer
office, straining at the law.Had it not been for the fact that Mr.Whipple went to his mother's house, despair would have seized him long
since.Apparently his goings-out and his comings-in were noted only by
Mr.Truly the Judge's methods were not Harvard methods.And if
there were pride in the young Bostonian, Mr.Whipple thought he knew the
cure for it.It was to Richter Stephen owed a debt of gratitude in these days.He
would often take his midday meal in the down-town beer garden with the
quiet German.Then there came a Sunday afternoon (to be marked with a
red letter) when Richter transported him into Germany itself.The Rhine was
Market Street, and south of that street was a country of which polite
American society took no cognizance.Here was an epic movement indeed, for South St.Louis was a great sod
uprooted from the Fatherland and set down in all its vigorous crudity in
the warm black mud of the Mississippi Valley.Here lager beer took the
place of Bourbon, and black bread and sausages of hot rolls and fried
chicken.Here were quaint market houses squatting in the middle of wide
streets; Lutheran churches, square and uncompromising, and bulky Turner
Halls, where German children were taught the German tongue.Here, in a
shady grove of mulberry and locust, two hundred families were spread out
at their ease.For a while Richter sat in silence, puffing at a meerschaum with a huge
brown bowl.A trick of the mind opened for Stephen one of the histories
in his father's library in Beacon Street, across the pages of which had
flitted the ancestors of this blue-eyed and great-chested Saxon.He saw
them in cathedral forests, with the red hair long upon their bodies.He saw terrifying battles with the Roman Empire surging back and forth
through the low countries.He saw a lad of twenty at the head of rugged
legions clad in wild skins, sweeping Rome out of Gaul.Back in the dim
ages Richter's fathers must have defended grim Eresburg.And it seemed
to him that in the end the new Republic must profit by this rugged
stock, which had good women for wives and mothers, and for fathers men
in whose blood dwelt a fierce patriotism and contempt for cowardice.He thought of the forefathers of
those whom he knew, who dwelt north of Market Street.Many, though this
generation of the French might know it not, had bled at Calais and at
Agincourt, had followed the court of France in clumsy coaches to Blois
and Amboise, or lived in hovels under the castle walls.Others had
charged after the Black Prince at Poitiers, and fought as serf or noble.in the war of the Roses; had been hatters or tailors in Cromwell's
armies, or else had sacrificed lands and fortunes for Charles Stuart.These English had toiled, slow but resistless, over the misty Blue
Ridge after Boone and Harrod to this old St.Louis of the French, their
enemies, whose fur traders and missionaries had long followed the veins
of the vast western wilderness.And now, on to the structure builded by
these two, comes Germany to be welded, to strengthen or to weaken.Richter put down his pipe on the table."Stephen," he said suddenly, "you do not share the prejudice against us
here?"He thought of some vigorous words that Miss Puss
Russell had used on the subject of the Dutch."I am glad," answered Richter, with a note of sadness, in his voice."Do not despise us before you know more of us.We are still feudal in
Germany--of the Middle Ages.He is compelled to
serve the lord of the land every year with so much labor of his hands.The small farmers, the 'Gross' and 'Mittel Bauern', we call them, are
also mortgaged to the nobles who tyrannize our Vaterland.Our merchants
are little merchants--shopkeepers, you would say.My poor father, an
educated man, was such."And now," said Stephen, "why do they not keep their hold?""We were unused to ruling," he answered."We knew not how to act--what
to do.You must remember that we were not trained to govern ourselves,
as are you of the English race, from children.Those who have been for
centuries ground under heel do not make practical parliamentarians.No;
your heritage is liberty--you Americans and English; and we Germans must
desert our native land to partake of it."The eyes of the German filled at the recollection, nor did he seem
ashamed of his tears."I had a poor old father whose life was broken to save the Vaterland,
but not his spirit," he cried, "no, not that.God directed my grandfather to send him to the Kolnisches
gymnasium, where the great Jahn taught.Jahn was our Washington, the
father of Germany that is to be.Our women wore Parisian clothes, and
spoke the language; French immorality and atheism had spread like a
plague among us Napoleon the vile had taken the sword of our Frederick
from Berlin.It was Father Jahn (so we love to call him), it was Father
Jahn who founded the 'Turnschulen', that the generations to come might
return to simple German ways,--plain fare, high principles, our native
tongue; and the development of the body.The downfall of the fiend
Napoleon and the Vaterland united--these two his scholars must have
written in their hearts.All summer long, in their black caps and linen
pantaloons, they would trudge after him, begging a crust here and a
cheese there, to spread his teachings far and wide under the thatched
roofs.I have heard my father tell how in the heat of that
year a great red comet burned in the sky, even as that we now see, my
friend.But in the coming spring
the French conscripts filled our sacred land like a swarm of locusts,
devouring as they went.And at their head, with the pomp of Darius, rode
that destroyer of nations and homes, Napoleon.But the red embers were beneath, fanned by Father Jahn.Napoleon
at Dresden made our princes weep.Never, even in the days of the
Frankish kings, had we been so humbled.He dragged our young men with
him to Russia, and left them to die moaning on the frozen wastes, while
he drove off in his sledge."It was the next year that Germany rose.High and low, rich and poor,
Jaeger and Landwehr, came flocking into the army, and even the old men,
the Landsturm.Russia was an ally, and later, Austria.My father, a last
of sixteen, was in the Landwehr, under the noble Blucher in Silesia,
when they drove the French into the Katzbach and the Neisse, swollen by
the rains into torrents.It had rained until the forests were marshes.But Blucher, ah, there was a man!He whipped his
great sabre from under his cloak, crying 'Vorwarts!And the
Landwehr with one great shout slew their enemies with the butts of their
muskets until their arms were weary and the bodies were tossed like logs
in the foaming waters.They called Blucher Marachall Vorwarts!But the victors quarrelled amongst
themselves, while Talleyrand and Metternich tore our Vaterland into
strips, and set brother against brother.And our blood, and the grief
for the widows and the fatherless, went for nothing.""After a while," he continued presently, "came the German Confederation,
with Austria at the head.Rid of Napoleon, we had another despot in
Metternich.But the tree which Jahn had planted grew, and its branches
spread.My father had gone to
Jena University, when he joined the Burschenschaft, or Students' League,
of which I will tell you later.It was pledged to the rescue of the
Vaterland.He was sent to prison for dipping his handkerchief in the
blood of Sand, beheaded for liberty at Mannheim.Afterwards he was
liberated, and went to Berlin and married my mother, who died when I
was young.Twice again he was in prison because the societies met at his
house.You in America know not the meaning
of that word.His health broke, and when '48 came, he was an old man.His hair was white, and he walked the streets with a crutch.But he had
saved a little money to send me to Jena.I was big-boned and fair, like my mother.And when
I came home at the end of a Semester I can see him now, as he
would hobble to the door, wearing the red and black and gold of the
Burschenschaft.And he would keep me up half the night-telling him of
our 'Schlager' fights with the aristocrats.My father had been a noted
swordsman in his day."For Stephen was staring at the jagged
scar, He had never summoned the courage to ask Richter how he came by
it."Broadswords," answered the German, hastily."Some day I will tell you
of them, and of the struggle with the troops in the 'Breite Strasse' in
March.We lost, as I told you because we knew not how to hold what we
had gained."I left Germany, hoping to make a home here for my poor father.How sad
his face as he kissed me farewell!And he said to me: 'Carl, if ever
your new Vaterland, the good Republic, be in danger, sacrifice all.I have spent my years in bondage, and I say to you that life without
liberty is not worth the living.'Three months I was gone, and he was
dead, without that for which he had striven so bravely.He never knew
what it is to have an abundance of meat.He never knew from one day to
the other when he would have to embrace me, all he owned, and march away
to prison, because he was a patriot."Richter's voice had fallen low,
but now he raised it."Do you think, my friend," he cried, "do you think
that I would not die willingly for this new country if the time should
come.Yes, and there are a million like me, once German, now American,
who will give their lives to preserve this Union.For without it the
world is not fit to live in."Stephen had food for thought as he walked northward through the strange
streets on that summer evening.Here indeed was a force not to be
reckoned, and which few had taken into account.ABRAHAM LINCOLN

It is sometimes instructive to look back and see hour Destiny gave us a
kick here, and Fate a shove there, that sent us in the right direction
at the proper time.And when Stephen Brice looks backward now, he laughs
to think that he did not suspect the Judge of being an ally of the
two who are mentioned above.Whipple's words and
advices to him that summer had been these.Stephen was dressed more
carefully than usual, in view of a visit to Bellefontaine Road.Whereupon the Judge demanded whether he were contemplating marriage.Without waiting for a reply he pointed to a rope and a slab of limestone
on the pavement below, and waved his hand unmistakably toward the
Mississippi.Whipple had once been crossed
in love.But we are to speak more particularly of a put-up job, although Stephen
did not know this at the time.Towards five o'clock of a certain afternoon in August of that year,
1858, Mr.Instead of turning to the right,
he strode straight to Stephen's table.His communications were always a
trifle startling.Brice," said he, "you are to take the six forty-five train on the
St.Louis, Alton, and Chicago road tomorrow morning for Springfield,
Illinois.""Arriving at Springfield, you are to deliver this envelope into the
hands of Mr.Abraham Lincoln, of the law firm of Lincoln & Herndon."cried Stephen, rising and straddling his chair."But,
sir--"

"Abraham Lincoln," interrupted the Judge, forcibly "I try to speak
plainly, sir.If he
is not in Springfield, find out where he is and follow him up.And he knew better than to argue the matter with Mr.He had read in the Missouri Democrat of this man Lincoln,
a country lawyer who had once been to Congress, and who was even now
disputing the senatorship of his state with the renowned Douglas.In
spite of their complacent amusement, he had won a little admiration
from conservative citizens who did not believe in the efficacy of Judge
Douglas's Squatter Sovereignty.Lincoln, who had once
been a rail-sputter, was uproariously derided by Northern Democrats
because he had challenged Mr.Douglas to seven debates, to be held at
different towns in the state of Illinois.David with his sling and
his smooth round pebble must have had much of the same sympathy and
ridicule.Douglas, Senator and Judge, was a national character, mighty in
politics, invulnerable in the armor of his oratory.And he was known
far and wide as the Little Giant.Those whom he did not conquer with his
logic were impressed by his person.Stephen remembered with a thrill that these debates were going on now.One, indeed, had been held, and had appeared in fine print in a corner
of the Democrat.Perhaps this Lincoln might not be in; Springfield;
perhaps he, Stephen Brice, might, by chance, hit upon a debate, and see
and hear the tower of the Democracy, the Honorable Stephen A. Douglas.But it is greatly to be feared that our friend Stephen was bored
with his errand before he arrived at the little wooden station of the
Illinois capital.Standing on the platform after the train pulled out,
he summoned up courage to ask a citizen with no mustache and a beard,
which he swept away when he spat, where was the office of Lincoln &
Herndon.Brice pityingly,
and finally led him in silence past the picket fence and the New
England-looking meeting-house opposite until they came to the great
square on which the State House squatted.The State House was a building
with much pretension to beauty, built in the classical style, of a
yellow stone, with sold white blinds in the high windows and mighty
columns capped at the gently slanting roof.But on top of it was reared
a crude wooden dome, like a clay head on a marble statue."That there," said the stranger, "is whar we watches for the County
Delegations when they come in to a meetin'."And with this remark,
pointing with a stubby thumb up a well-worn stair, he departed before
Stephen could thank him.Stephen paused under the awning, of which there
were many shading the brick pavement, to regard the straggling line of
stores and houses which surrounded and did homage to the yellow pile.Lincoln's office was had decorations above
the windows.Mounting the stair, Stephen found a room bare enough, save
for a few chairs and law books, and not a soul in attendance.After
sitting awhile by the window, mopping his brow with a handkerchief, he
went out on the landing to make inquiries.There he met another citizen
in shirt sleeves, like unto the first, in the very act of sweeping his
beard out of the way of a dexterous expectoration."Wal, young man," said he, "who be you lookin' for here?"At this the gentleman sat down on the dirty top step; and gave vent to
quiet but annoying laughter."I reckon you come to the wrong place.""I was told this was his office," said Stephen, with some heat."I don't see what that has to do with it," answered our friend."Wal," said the citizen, critically, "if you was from Philadelphy or
Boston, you might stand acquitted."Stephen was on the point of claiming Boston, but wisely hesitated."Ye talk like y e was from down East," said the citizens who seemed in
the humor for conversation."I reckon old Abe's' too busy to see you.Say, young man, did you ever hear of Stephen Arnold Douglas, alias the
Little Giant, alias the Idol of our State, sir?"This was too much for Stephen, who left the citizen without the
compliment of a farewell.Continuing around the square, inquiring for
Mr.Lincoln's house, he presently got beyond the stores and burning
pavements on to a plank walk, under great shade trees, and past old
brick mansions set well back from the street.At length he paused in
front of a wooden house of a dirty grayish brown, too high for its
length and breadth, with tall shutters of the same color, and a picket
fence on top of the retaining wall which lifted the yard above the plank
walk.But an ugly house may look beautiful
when surrounded by such heavy trees as this was.Their shade was
the most inviting thing Stephen had seen.A boy of sixteen or so was
swinging on the gate, plainly a very mischievous boy, with a round,
laughing, sunburned face and bright eyes.In front of the gate was a
shabby carriage with top and side curtains, hitched to a big bay horse."Well, I guess," said the boy."I'm his son, and he lives right here
when he's at home.asked Stephen, beginning to realize the purport of his
conversations with citizens.Lincoln mentioned the name of a small town in the northern
part of the state, where he said his father would stop that night.He
told Stephen that he looked wilted, invited him into the house to have
a glass of lemonade, and to join him and another boy in a fishing
excursion with the big bay horse.Lincoln that he
should have to take the first train after his father.exclaimed the other, enviously, "then you'll hear the Freeport
debate."Now it has been said that the day was scorching hot.And when Stephen
had got back to the wooden station, and had waited an hour for the
Bloomington express, his anxiety to hear the Freeport debate was not
as keen as it might have been.Late in the afternoon he changed at
Bloomington to the Illinois Central Railroad: The sun fell down behind
the cardboard edge of the prairie, the train rattled on into the north,
wrapped in its dust and Smoke, and presently became a long comet,
roaring red, to match that other comet which flashed in the sky.By this time it may be said that our friend was heartily sick of his
mission, He tried to doze; but two men, a farmer and a clerk, got in
at a way station, and sat behind him.They began to talk about this man
Lincoln."Shucks," said the clerk, "think of him opposing the Little Giant.""He's right smart, Sam," said the farmer."He's got a way of sayin'
things that's clear.But Steve Douglas, he only
mixes you up.""Because you ain't had no education: What
does a rail-sputter like Abe know about this government?Let the territories take care of
themselves.The fust of this week I
seen him side-tracked down the road here in a caboose, while Doug went
by in a special.""Abe is a plain man, Sam," the farmer answered solemnly.It was ten o'clock when Stephen descended at his destination.Merciful
night hid from his view the forlorn station and the ragged town.The
baggage man told him that Mr.Will words describe the impression it made on a certain
young man from Boston!It was long and low and ramshackly and hot that
night as the inside of a brick-kiln.As he drew near it on the single
plant walk over the black prairie-mud, he saw countrymen and politicians
swarming its narrow porch and narrower hall.Discussions in all keys
were in progress, and it, was with vast difficulty that our distracted
young man pushed through and found the landlord, This personage was the
coolest of the lot.Confusion was but food for his smiles, importunity
but increased his suavity.And of the seeming hundreds that pressed him,
he knew and utilized the Christian name of all.From behind a corner of
the bar he held them all at bay, and sent them to quarters like the old
campaigner he was."Now, Ben, tain't no use gettin' mad.You, and Josh way, an' Will, an'
Sam, an' the Cap'n, an' the four Beaver brothers, will all sleep in
number ten.No, sirree, the Honerable Abe, and
Mister Hill, and Jedge Oglesby is sleepin' in seven."The smell of
perspiration was stifling as Stephen pushed up to the master of the
situation.Gosh, I reckon if you can fight your way to the dinin' room, the gals'll
give you some pork and a cup of coffee."After a preliminary scuffle with a drunken countryman in mud-caked
boots, Mr.Brice presently reached the long table in the dining-room.A sense of humor not quite extinct made him smile as he devoured pork
chops and greasy potatoes and heavy apple pie.As he was finishing the
pie, he became aware of the tavern keeper standing over him."Are you one of them flip Chicagy reporters?"asked that worthy, with a
suspicious eye on Stephen's clothes."You didn't talk jest like 'em.Guess you'll be here, tonight--"

"Yes," said Stephen, wearily.And he added, outs of force of habit, "Can
you give me a room?""Number ten, There ain't nobody in
there but Ben Billings, and the four Beaver brothers, an' three more.I'll have a shake-down for ye next the north window."Stephen's thanks for the hospitality perhaps lacked heartiness.But
perceiving his host still contemplating him, he was emboldened to say:

"Has Mr.Stephen's reflections here on the dignity of the Senatorial candidate of
the Republican Party in Illinois were novel, at any rate.He thought of
certain senators he had seen in Massachusetts."The only reason he ain't down here swappin' yarns with the boys, is
because he's havin' some sort of confab with the Jedge and Joe Medill of
the 'Chicagy Press' and 'Tribune'."He was
emboldened by the apparent lack of ceremony of the candidate.The
landlord looked at him in some surprise.Jest go up an' knock at the door number seven, and say
Tom Wright sent ye.""Pick out the ugliest man in the room.There ain't nobody I kin think of
uglier than Abe."Bearing in mind this succinct description of the candidate, Stephen
climbed the rickety stairs to the low second story.All the bedroom
doors were flung open except one, on which the number 7 was inscribed.From within came bursts of uproarious laughter, and a summons to enter.He pushed open the door, and as soon as his eyes became, accustomed to
the tobacco smoke, he surveyed the room.There was a bowl on the
floor, the chair where it belonged being occupied.There was a very
inhospitable looking bed, two shake-downs, and four Windsor chairs in
more or less state of dilapidation--all occupied likewise.A country
glass lamp was balanced on a rough shelf, and under it a young man sat
absorbed in making notes, and apparently oblivious to the noise around
him.Every gentleman in the room was collarless, coatless, tieless,
and vestless.Some were engaged in fighting gnats and June bugs, while
others battled with mosquitoes--all save the young man who wrote, he
being wholly indifferent.Stephen picked out the homeliest man in the room.And, instead of a discussion of the campaign with the other
gentlemen, Mr.Lincoln was
defending an occasional and judicious use of swear words."Judge," said he, "you do an almighty lot of cussing in your speeches,
and perhaps it ain't a bad way to keep things stirred up.""Well," said the Judge, "a fellow will rip out something once in a while
before he has time to shut it off."Lincoln passed his fingers through his tousled hair.His thick
lower lip crept over in front of the upper one, A gleam stirred in the
deep-set gray eyes."Boys," he asked, "did I ever tell you about Sam'l, the old Quaker's
apprentice?"There was a chorus of "No's" and "Go ahead, Abe?"The young man who was
writing dropped his pencil.As for Stephen, this long, uncouth man
of the plains was beginning to puzzle him.The face, with its crude
features and deep furrows, relaxed into intense soberness.Lincoln began his story with a slow earnestness that was truly
startling, considering the subject."This apprentice, Judge, was just such an incurable as you.""And Sam'l, when he wanted to, could get out as many cusses in a second
as his anvil shot sparks.And the old man used to wrastle with him
nights and speak about punishment, and pray for him in meeting.When anything went wrong, Sam'l had an appropriate
word for the occasion.One day the old man got an inspiration when he
was scratching around in the dirt for an odd-sized iron."'Sam'l,' says he, 'I want thee.'"Sam'l went, and found the old man standing over a big rat hole, where
the rats came out to feed on the scraps."'Sam'l,' says he, 'fetch the tongs.'"Sam'l fetched the tongs."'Now, Sam'l,' says the old man, 'thou wilt sit here until thou hast
a rat.And when thou hast him, if I hear thee
swear, thou wilt sit here until thou hast another.Lincoln seized two cotton umbrellas, rasped his chair over the
bare boor into a corner of the room, and sat hunched over an imaginary
rat hole, for all the world like a gawky Quaker apprentice.And this was
a candidate for the Senate of the United States, who on the morrow was
to meet in debate the renowned and polished Douglas!Lincoln continued, "that was on a Monday, I reckon, and the
boys a-shouting to have their horses shod.Maybe you think they didn't
have some fun with Sam'l.But Sam'l sat there, and sat there, and sat
there, and after a while the old man pulled out his dinner-pail.First thing you know, snip went the tongs.""What do you reckon Sam'l said, Judge?"The Judge, at random, summoned up a good one, to the delight of the
audience.Lincoln, with solemnity, "I reckon that's what you'd
have said.Sam'l never said a word, and the old man kept on eating his
dinner.One o'clock came, and the folks began to drop in again, but
Sam'l, he sat there.'Long towards night the boys collected 'round the
door.Lincoln bent forward a little, and his voice fell to a loud,
drawling whisper."First thing you know, here come the whiskers peeping
up, then the pink eyes a--blinking at the forge, then--!""Suddenly he brought the umbrellas together with whack."'By God,' yells Sam'l, 'I have thee at last!'"Lincoln stood up, his long body swaying to and fro
as he lifted high the improvised tongs.They heard a terrified squeal,
and there was the rat squirming and wriggling,--it seemed before
their very eyes.And Stephen forgot the country tavern, the country
politician, and was transported straightway into the Quaker's smithy.IN WHICH STEPHEN LEARNS SOMETHING

It was Mr.The astonishing candidate for
the Senate had sunk into his chair, his face relaxed into sadness save
for the sparkle lurking in the eyes.So he sat, immobile, until the
laughter had died down to silence."Sonny," he said, "did you want to see me?"Stephen was determined to be affable and kind, and (shall we say it?)Lincoln uncomfortable either by a superiority of
English or the certain frigidity of manner which people in the West said
he had.But he tried to imagine a Massachusetts senator, Mr.Sumner,
for instance, going through the rat story, and couldn't.Somehow,
Massachusetts senators hadn't this gift.And yet he was not quite sure
that it wasn't a fetching gift.Stephen did not quite like to be
called "Sonny."But he looked into two gray eyes, and at the face, and
something curious happened to him.How was he to know that thousands of
his countrymen were to experience the same sensation?Lincoln again, "did you want to see me?"He
drew from his inner pocket the envelope which the Judge had given him.He put
the document in his tall hat, which was upside down on the floor.As he
got deeper into the letter, he pursed his mouth, and the lines of his
face deepened in a smile."Judge Whipple told you to run till you found me, did he, Mr."Is the Judge the same old criss-cross, contrary, violent fool that he
always was?"Providence put an answer in Stephen's mouth."He's been very good to me, Mr."Why, he's the biggest-hearted man I know.You know him, Oglesby,--Silas
Whipple.But a man has to be a Daniel or a General Putnam to venture
into that den of his.There's only one man in the world who can beard
Silas, and he's the finest states-right Southern gentleman you ever saw.You've heard of him, Oglesby.Don't they quarrel
once in a while, Mr."They do have occasional arguments," said Stephen, amused.Lincoln; "well, I couldn't come as near to
fighting every day and stand it.If my dog and Bill's dog across the
street walked around each other and growled for half a day, and then
lay down together, as Carvel and Whipple do, by Jing, I'd put pepper on
their noses--"

"I reckon Colonel Carvel isn't a fighting man," said some one, at
random.Strangely enough, Stephen was seized with a desire to vindicate the
Colonel's courage.Lincoln and Judge Oglesby forestalled him."Why, the other day--"

"Now, Oglesby," put in Mr.Lincoln, "I wanted to tell that story."Stephen had heard it, and so have we.Lincoln's imitation of the
Colonel's drawl brought him a pang like homesickness."'No, suh, I didn't intend to shoot.But he wriggled and twisted like a rattlesnake, and I just couldn't
resist, suh.Then I sent m'<DW65> Ephum to tell him not to let me catch
sight of him 'round the Planters' House.Yes, suh, that's what he was.One of these damned Yankees who come South and go into <DW65>-deals and
politics."'Lincoln glanced at Stephen, and then again at the Judge's letter.He
took up his silk hat and thrust that, too, into the worn lining, which
was already filled with papers.He clapped the hat on his head, and
buttoned on his collar."I reckon I'll go for a walk, boys," he said, "and clear my head, so as
to be ready for the Little Giant to-morrow at Freeport.Brice, do
you feel like walking?"Stephen, taken aback, said that he did."Now, Abe, this is just durned foolishness," one of the gentlemen
expostulated."We want to know if you're going to ask Douglas that
question.""If you do, you kill yourself, Lincoln," said another, who Stephen
afterwards learned was Mr.Medill, proprietor of the great 'Press and
Tribune'."I guess I'll risk it, Joe," said Mr.Suddenly comes
the quiver about the corners of his mouth and the gray eyes respond."Boys," said he, "did you ever hear the story of farmer Bell, down in
Egypt?I'll tell it to you, boys, and then perhaps you'll know why I'll
ask Judge Douglas that question.Farmer Bell had the prize Bartlett pear
tree, and the prettiest gal in that section.And he thought about the
same of each of 'em.But there
was only one who had any chance of getting her, and his name was Jim
Rickets.Jim was the handsomest man in that section.But Jim had a good deal out of life,--all the appetites, and some
of the gratifications.He liked Sue, and he liked a luscious Bartlett.And it just so happened that that prize
pear tree had a whopper on that year, and old man Bell couldn't talk of
anything else."Now there was an ugly galoot whose name isn't worth mentioning.He knew
he wasn't in any way fit for Sue, and he liked pears about as well as
Jim Rickets.Well, one night here comes Jim along the road, whistling;
to court Susan, and there was the ugly galoot a-yearning on the bank
under the pear tree.Jim was all fixed up, and he says to the galoot,
'Let's have a throw.'Now the galoot knew old Bell was looking over
the fence So he says, 'All right,' and he gives Jim the first shot--Jim
fetched down the big pear, got his teeth in it, and strolled off to the
house, kind of pitiful of the galoot for a, half-witted ass.When he got
to the door, there was the old man.'Why,' says Rickets, in his off-hand way, for he always had great
confidence, 'to fetch Sue.'""The old man used to wear brass toes to keep his boots from wearing
out," said Mr.Lincoln, "you see the galoot knew that Jim
Rickets wasn't to be trusted with Susan Bell."Some of the gentlemen appeared to see the point of this political
parable, for they laughed uproariously.Then
they slapped their knees, looked at Mr.Lincoln's face, which was
perfectly sober, and laughed again, a little fainter.Then the Judge
looked as solemn as his title."It won't do, Abe," said he."You'd better stick to the pear, Abe," said Mr.Medill, "and fight
Stephen A. Douglas here and now."Why, yes, Joe," said Mr."He's a man with tens of
thousands of blind followers.It's my business to make some of those
blind followers see."By this time Stephen was burning to know the question that Mr.Lincoln
wished to ask the Little Giant, and why the other gentlemen were against
it.Lincoln surprised him still further in taking him by the
arm.Hill, who had finished his
writing, he said:

"Bob, a little air will do you good.I've had enough of the old boys for
a while, and I'm going to talk to somebody any own age."Stephen was halfway down the corridor when he discovered that he had
forgotten his hat.As he returned he heard somebody say:

"If that ain't just like Abe.He stopped to pull a flea out of his
stocking when he was going to fight that duel with Shields, and now he's
walking with boys before a debate with the smartest man in this country.And there's heaps of things he ought to discuss with us.""Reckon we haven't got much to do with it," said another, half laughing,
half rueful."There's some things Abe won't stand."Lincoln threading his way through the
crowd below, laughing at one, pausing to lay his hand on the shoulder
of another, and replying to a rough sally of a third to make the place a
tumult of guffaws.But none had the temerity to follow him.When
Stephen caught up with him in the little country street, he was talking
earnestly to Mr.Hill, the young reporter of the Press and Tribune.And
what do you think was the subject?Lincoln's strides, another
shock in store for him.This rail-splitter, this postmaster, this
flat-boatman, whom he had not credited with a knowledge of the New Code,
was talking Astronomy.Lincoln, "can you elucidate the problem of the three
bodies?"The talk then fell upon novels and stories, a few of which Mr.He spoke, among others, of the "Gold Bug.""The
story is grand," said he, "but it might as well have been written of
Robinson Crusoe's island.What a fellow wants in a book is to know where
he is.There are not many novels, or ancient works for that matter, that
put you down anywhere.""There is that genuine fragment which Cicero has preserved from a last
work of Aristotle," said Mr."'If there were beings who
lived in the depths of the earth, and could emerge through the open
fissures, and could suddenly behold the earth, the sea, and the--vault
of heaven--'"

"But you--you impostor," cried Mr.Lincoln, interrupting, "you're giving
us Humboldt's Cosmos."It is remarkable how soon we accustom ourselves to a strange situation.And to Stephen it was no less strange to be walking over a muddy road of
the prairie with this most singular man and a newspaper correspondent,
than it might have been to the sub-terrestrial inhabitant to emerge on
the earth's surface.Stephen's mind was in the process of a chemical
change: Suddenly it seemed to him as if he had known this tall
Illinoisan always.The whim of the senatorial candidate in choosing him
for a companion he did not then try to account for.Lincoln, presently, "where do you hail
from?""And how does it happen that you
come to me with a message from a rank Abolitionist lawyer in St."Is the Judge a friend of yours, sir?"Lincoln, "didn't he tell you he was?""He said nothing at all, sir, except to tell me to travel until I found
you.""I call the Judge a friend of mine," said Mr."He may not claim
me because I do not believe in putting all slave-owners to the sword.""I do not think that Judge Whipple is precisely an Abolitionist, sir."It was rare with him, and he must have
caught it from Mr."I am not for ripping out the dam suddenly, sir, that would drown the
nation.I believe that the water can be drained off in some other way."Lincoln's direct answer to this was to give Stephen stinging slap
between the shoulder-blades.Bob, take that
down for the Press and Tribune as coming from a rising young politician
of St."Why," Stephen blurted out, "I--I thought you were an Abolitionist, Mr.Lincoln, "I have as much use for the Boston
Liberator as I have for the Charleston Courier.The question is not whether we shall or shall not have slavery,
but whether slavery shall stay where it is, or be extended according to
Judge Douglas's ingenious plan.I am
for cauterizing the sore so that it shall not spread.Brice, that this nation cannot exist half slave and half free."Was it the slap on the back that opened Stephen's eyes?It was certain
that as they returned to the tavern the man at his side was changed.He
need not have felt chagrined.Men in high places underestimated Lincoln,
or did not estimate him at all.The great warm
heart had claimed Stephen as it claimed all who came near it.The tavern was deserted save for a few stragglers.Under the dim light
at the bar Mr.Lincoln took off his hat and drew the Judge's letter from
the lining.Stephen," said he, "would you like to come to Freeport with me
to-morrow and hear the debate?"An hour earlier he would have declined with thanks.Now his
face lighted at the prospect, and suddenly fell again.He laid his hand on the young man's shoulder, and
laughed."I reckon you're thinking of what the Judge will say.""I'll take care of the Judge," said Mr.He drew forth from the inexhaustible hat a slip of paper, and
began to write."There," said he, when he had finished, "a friend of mine is going to
Springfield in the morning, and he'll send that to the Judge."And this is what he had written:--

     "I have borrowed Steve for a day or two, and guarantee
     to return him a good Republican.It is worth remarking that this was the first time Mr.Brice had been
called "Steve" and had not resented it.Lincoln, but that
gentleman's quizzical look cut him short.And the next remark made him
gasp."Look here, Steve," said he, "you know a parlor from a drawing-room.What did you think of me when you saw me to-night?"Stephen blushed furiously, and his tongue clave to the roof of his
mouth.Lincoln, with his characteristic smile, "you
thought that you wouldn't pick me out of a bunch of horses to race with
the Senator."THE QUESTION

Many times since Abraham Lincoln has been called to that mansion which
God has reserved for the patriots who have served Him also, Stephen
Brice has thought of that steaming night in the low-ceiled room of the
country tavern, reeking with the smell of coarse food and hot humanity.He remembers vividly how at first his gorge rose, and recalls how
gradually there crept over him a forgetfulness of the squalidity and
discomfort.Then the
dawning of a worship for a very ugly man in a rumpled and ill-made coat.You will perceive that there was hope for Stephen.On his shake-down
that night, oblivious to the snores of his companions and the droning of
the insects, he lay awake.And before his eyes was that strange, marked
face, with its deep lines that blended both humor and sadness there.It
was homely, and yet Stephen found himself reflecting that honesty was
just as homely, and plain truth.And yet both were beautiful to those
who had learned to love them.He fell asleep wondering why Judge Whipple had sent him.It was in accord with nature that reaction came with the morning.Such a
morning, and such a place!He was awakened, shivering, by the beat of rain on the roof, and
stumbling over the prostrate forms of the four Beaver brothers, reached
the window.Clouds filled the sky, and Joshway, whose pallet was under
the sill, was in a blessed state of moisture.No wonder some of his enthusiasm had trickled away!He made his toilet in the wet under the pump outside; where he had to
wait his turn.And he rather wished he were going back to St.He had an early breakfast of fried eggs and underdone bacon, and coffee
which made him pine for Hester's.The dishes were neither too clean nor
too plentiful, being doused in water as soon as ever they were out of
use.But after breakfast the sun came out, and a crowd collected around the
tavern, although the air was chill and the muck deep in the street.Lincoln towering above the knots of
country politicians who surrounded him, and every once in a while a knot
would double up with laughter.There was no sign that the senatorial
aspirant took the situation seriously; that the coming struggle with
his skilful antagonist was weighing him down in the least.Stephen held
aloof from the groups, thinking that Mr.Louis on the morning train, and was even
pushing toward the tavern entrance with his bag in his hand, when he was
met by Mr."I had about given you up, Mr.Lincoln asked me to
get hold of you, and bring you to him alive or dead."Accordingly Stephen was led to the station, where a long train of twelve
cars was pulled up, covered with flags and bunting.On entering one of
these, he perceived Mr.Lincoln sprawled (he could think of no other
word to fit the attitude) on a seat next the window, and next him was
Mr.The seat just in front was reserved
for Mr.Hill, who was to make any notes necessary.His appearance was even less attractive than the night before, as he
had on a dirty gray linen duster."I thought you'd got loose, Steve," he said, holding out his hand.Just you sit down there next to Bob, where I can talk to
you."Stephen sat down, diffident, for he knew that there were others in that
train who would give ten years of their lives for that seat."I've taken a shine to this Bostonian, Joe," said Mr Lincoln to Mr."We've got to catch 'em young to do anything with 'em, you know.Now, Steve, just give me a notion how politics are over in St.What do they think of our new Republican party?Lincoln seemed to feel Medill's objections, as by mental telepathy.But
he said:-- "We'll come to that little matter later, Joe, when the cars
start."But under the influence of that
kindly eye he thawed, and forgot himself.He felt that this man was
not one to feign an interest.The shouts of the people on the little
platform interrupted the account, and the engine staggered off with its
load.Louis is a nest of Southern Democrats," Mr.Lincoln
remarked, "and not much opposition.""There are quite a few Old Line Whigs, sir," ventured Stephen, smiling.Lincoln, "did you ever hear Warfield's definition of an
Old Line Whig?""A man who takes his toddy regularly, and votes the Democratic ticket
occasionally, and who wears ruffled shirts."Both of these gentlemen laughed, and two more in the seat behind, who
had an ear to the conversation."But, sir," said Stephen, seeing that he was expected to go on, "I think
that the Republican party will gather a considerable strength there in
another year or two.We have the material for powerful leaders in Mr."We are getting an
ever increasing population from New England, mostly of young men who
will take kindly to the new party."And then he added, thinking of
his pilgrimage the Sunday before: "South St.Louis is a solid mass of
Germans, who are all antislavery.But they are very foreign still, and
have all their German institutions.""Then they will the more easily be turned into soldiers if the time
should come," said Mr.And he added quickly, "I pray that it
may not."Stephen had cause to remember that observation, and the acumen it
showed, long afterward.The train made several stops, and at each of them shoals of country
people filled the aisles, and paused for a most familiar chat with the
senatorial candidate.His appearance was the equal
in roughness to theirs, his manner if anything was more democratic,--yet
in spite of all this Stephen in them detected a deference which might
almost be termed a homage.Had our
friend been older, he might have known that the presence of good women
in a political crowd portends something.He
was destined to be still more surprised that day.When they had left behind them the shouts of the little down of Dixon,
Mr.Lincoln took off his hat, and produced a crumpled and not too
immaculate scrap of paper from the multitude therein."Now, Joe," said he, "here are the four questions I intend to ask Judge
Douglas."We don't care anything about the others," answered Mr.If you ask that second one, you'll never see the United
States Senate.""And the Republican party in this state will have had a blow from which
it can scarcely recover," added Mr.His eyes were far away over the
wet prairie.But neither he, nor Medill, nor Judd, nor Hill
guessed at the pregnancy of that moment.How were they to know that
the fate of the United States of America was concealed in that
Question,--was to be decided on a rough wooden platform that day in the
town of Freeport, Illinois?But Abraham Lincoln, the uncouth man in the linen duster with the
tousled hair, knew it.And the stone that was rejected of the builders
was to become the corner-stone of the temple.Lincoln recalled himself, glanced at the paper, and cleared
his throat.In measured tones, plainly heard above the rush and roar of
the train, he read the Question:

   "Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way,
   against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude
   slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State
   Constitution?""Abe," said he, solemnly, "Douglas will answer yes, or equivocate, and
that is all the assurance these Northern Democrats want to put Steve
Douglas in the Senate.Medill, reflecting the sheer astonishment of the
others; "then why the devil are you wearing yourself out?And why are we
spending our time and money on you?"Lincoln laid his hand on Medill's sleeve."Joe," said he, "a rat in the larder is easier to catch than a rat
that has the run of the cellar.You know, where to set your trap in the
larder.I'll tell you why I'm in this campaign: to catch Douglas now,
and keep him out of the White House in 1860.To save this country of
ours, Joe.There was a silence, broken by two exclamations."But see here, Abe," said Mr.Medill, as soon as ever he got his breath,
"what have we got to show for it?"Nowhere, I reckon," he answered simply."You mean to say, as the candidate of the Republican party, you don't
care whether you get to the Senate?""Not if I can send Steve Douglas there with his wings broken," was the
calm reply."Suppose he does answer yes, that slavery can be excluded?"Lincoln, "then Douglas loses the vote of the great
slave-holders, the vote of the solid South, that he has been fostering
ever since he has had the itch to be President.Without the solid South
the Little Giant will never live in the White House.And unless I'm
mightily mistaken, Steve Douglas has had his aye as far ahead as 1860
for some time."There was a stout man standing in
the aisle, and he spat deftly out of the open window."You may wing Steve Douglas, Abe," said he, gloomily, "but the gun will
kick you over the bluff.""Don't worry about me, Ed," said Mr.In a wave of comprehension the significance of all this was revealed to
Stephen Brice, The grim humor, the sagacious statesmanship, and (best of
all)--the superb self sacrifice of it, struck him suddenly.I think it
was in that hour that he realized the full extent of the wisdom he was
near, which was like unto Solomon's.Shame surged in Stephen's face that he should have misjudged him.And in after years, when
he thought of this new vital force which became part of him that day,
it was in the terms of Emerson: "Pythagoras was misunderstood, and
Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and
Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh.How many have conversed with Lincoln before and since, and knew him not!Lincoln's greatness were
needed,--he had chosen to speak to them in homely parables.The story of
Farmer Bell was plain as day.Jim Rickets, who had life all his own way,
was none other than Stephen A. Douglas, the easily successful.The ugly
galoot, who dared to raise his eyes only to the pear, was Mr.And the pear was the Senatorship, which the galoot had denied
himself to save Susan from being Mr.Stephen could understand likewise the vehemence of the Republican
leaders who crowded around their candidate and tried to get him to
retract that Question.He listened quietly, he answered with a patient
smile.Now and then he threw a story into the midst of this discussion
which made them laugh in spite of themselves.The hopelessness of the
case was quite plain to Mr.Hill, who smiled, and whispered in Stephen's
ear: "He has made up his mind.They will not budge him an inch, and they
know it."Lincoln took the scrap of paper, which was even more dirty
and finger-marked by this time, and handed it to Mr.The train
was slowing down for Freeport.In the distance, bands could be heard
playing, and along the track, line upon line of men and women were
cheering and waving.It was ten o'clock, raw and cold for that time of
the year, and the sun was trying to come out.Lincoln, "be sure you get that right in your notes.And,
Steve, you stick close to me, and you'll see the show.Why, boys," he
added, smiling, "there's the great man's private car, cannon and all."All that Stephen saw was a regular day-car on a sidetrack.A brass
cannon was on the tender hitched behind it.CHAPTER V. THE CRISIS

Stephen A. Douglas, called the Little Giant on account of his intellect,
was a type of man of which our race has had some notable examples,
although they are not characteristic.Capable of sacrifice to their
country, personal ambition is, nevertheless, the mainspring of their
actions.They must either be before the public, or else unhappy.This
trait gives them a large theatrical strain, and sometimes brands them as
adventurers.Their ability saves them from being demagogues.In the case of Douglas, he had deliberately renewed some years before
the agitation on the spread of slavery, by setting forth a doctrine of
extreme cleverness.This doctrine, like many others of its kind, seemed
at first sight to be the balm it pretended, instead of an irritant, as
it really was.It was calculated to deceive all except thinking men, and
to silence all save a merciless logician.And this merciless logician,
who was heaven-sent in time of need, was Abraham Lincoln.Douglas was a juggler, a political prestidigitateur.He did things
before the eyes of the Senate and the nation.His balm for the healing
of the nation's wounds was a patent medicine so cleverly concocted that
experts alone could show what was in it.So abstruse and twisted were
some of Mr.Douglas's doctrines that a genius alone might put them into
simple words, for the common people.The great panacea for the slavery trouble put forth by Mr.Douglas
at that time was briefly this: that the people of the new territories
should decide for themselves, subject to the Constitution, whether they
should have slavery or not, and also decide for themselves all other
questions under the Constitution.Douglas, there was
the famous Dred Scott decision, which had set the South wild with joy
the year before, and had cast a gloom over the North.The Chief Justice
of the United States had declared that under the Constitution slaves
were property,--and as such every American citizen owning slaves could
carry them about with him wherever he went.Therefore the territorial
legislatures might pass laws until they were dumb, and yet their
settlers might bring with them all the slaves they pleased.He was a gentleman, a strong man, and a
patriot.He was magnanimous, and to his immortal honor be it said that
he, in the end, won the greatest of all struggles.He put down that mightiest thing that was in him,--his ambition for
himself.And he set up, instead, his ambition for his country.He bore
no ill-will toward the man whose fate was so strangely linked to his,
and who finally came to that high seat of honor and of martyrdom which
he coveted.We shall love the Judge, and speak of him with reverence,
for that sublime act of kindness before the Capitol in 1861.Abraham Lincoln might have prayed on that day of the Freeport debate:

"Forgive him, Lord.Lincoln descried the
danger afar, and threw his body into the breach.That which passed before Stephen's eyes, and to which his ears listened
at Freeport, was the Great Republic pressing westward to the Pacific.He
wondered whether some of his Eastern friends who pursed their lips when
the Wrest was mentioned would have sneered or prayed.A young English
nobleman who was there that day did not sneer.He was filled instead
with something like awe at the vigor of this nation which was sprung
from the loins of his own.Crudeness he saw, vulgarity he heard, but
Force he felt, and marvelled.America was in Freeport that day, the rush of her people and the
surprise of her climate.The rain had ceased, and quickly was come out
of the northwest a boisterous wind, chilled by the lakes and scented by
the hemlocks of the Minnesota forests.The sun smiled and frowned Clouds
hurried in the sky, mocking the human hubbub below.Cheering thousands
pressed about the station as Mr.They hemmed
him in his triumphal passage under the great arching trees to the new
Brewster House.The Chief Marshal and his aides, great men before,
were suddenly immortal.The county delegations fell into their proper
precedence like ministers at a state dinner."We have faith in Abraham,
Yet another County for the Rail-sputter, Abe the Giant-killer,"--so the
banners read.Here, much bedecked, was the Galena Lincoln Club, part of
Joe Davies's shipment.Fifes skirled, and drums throbbed, and the stars
and stripes snapped in the breeze.And here was a delegation headed
by fifty sturdy ladies on horseback, at whom Stephen gaped like a
countryman.Then came carryalls of all ages and degrees, wagons from
this county and that county, giddily draped, drawn by horses from one
to six, or by mules, their inscriptions addressing their senatorial
candidate in all degrees of familiarity, but not contempt.What they
seemed proudest of was that he had been a rail-splitter, for nearly all
bore a fence-rail.But stay, what is this wagon with the high sapling flagstaff in the
middle, and the leaves still on it?"Westward the Star of Empire takes its way.The girls link on to Lincoln; their mothers were for Clay."Here was glory to blind you,--two and thirty maids in red sashes and
blue liberty caps with white stars.Each was a state of the Union,
and every one of them was for Abraham, who called them his "Basket of
Flowers."Behind them, most touching of all, sat a thirty-third shackled
in chains.Alas, the men of Kansas was far from being
as sorrowful as the part demanded,--in spite of her instructions she
would smile at the boys.But the appealing inscription she bore, "Set me
free" was greeted with storms of laughter, the boldest of the young men
shouting that she was too beautiful to be free, and some of the old
men, to their shame be it said likewise shouted.But the young men who had
brought their sweethearts to town, and were standing hand in hand with
them, for obvious reasons saw nothing: They scarcely dared to look at
Kansas, and those who did were so loudly rebuked that they turned down
the side streets.During this part of the day these loving couples, whose devotion was so
patent to the whole world, were by far the most absorbing to Stephen.He watched them having their fortunes told, the young women blushing and
crying, "Say!"and the young men getting their
ears boxed for certain remarks.He watched them standing open-mouthed
at the booths and side shows with hands still locked, or again they were
chewing cream candy in unison.Or he glanced sidewise at them, seated in
the open places with the world so far below them that even the insistent
sound of the fifes and drums rose but faintly to their ears.And perhaps,--we shall not say positively,--perhaps Mr.Brice's thoughts
went something like this, "O that love were so simple a matter to all!"But graven on his face was what is called the "Boston scorn."And no
scorn has been known like unto it since the days of Athens.So Stephen made the best of his way to the Brewster House, the elegance
and newness of which the citizens of Freeport openly boasted.Lincoln had preceded him, and was even then listening to a few remarks
of burning praise by an honorable gentleman.Lincoln himself made a
few remarks, which seemed so simple and rang so true, and were so free
from political rococo and decoration generally, that even the young
men forgot their sweethearts to listen.Lincoln went into the
hotel, and the sun slipped under a black cloud.The lobby was full, and rather dirty, since the supply of spittoons was
so far behind the demand.Like the firmament, it was divided into little
bodies which revolved about larger bodies.But there lacked not here
supporters of the Little Giant, and discreet farmers of influence in
their own counties who waited to hear the afternoon's debate before
deciding.These and others did not hesitate to tell of the magnificence
of the Little Giant's torchlight procession the previous evening.Every
Dred-Scottite had carried a torch, and many transparencies, so that
the very glory of it had turned night into day.The Chief Lictor had
distributed these torches with an unheard-of liberality.But there
lacked not detractors who swore that John Dibble and other Lincolnites
had applied for torches for the mere pleasure of carrying them.Since
dawn the delegations had been heralded from the house-tops, and wagered
on while they were yet as worms far out or the prairie.All the morning
these continued to came in, and form in line to march past their
particular candidate.The second great event of the day was the event
of the special over the Galena roar, of sixteen cars and more than a
thousand pairs of sovereign lungs.With military precision they repaired
to the Brewster House, and ahead of then a banner was flung: "Winnebago
County for the Tall Sucker."And the Tall Sucker was on the steps to
receive them.Douglas, who had arrived the evening before to the booming
of two and thirty guns, had his banners end his bunting, too.The
neighborhood of Freeport was stronghold of Northern Democrats, ardent
supporters of the Little Giant if once they could believe that he did
not intend to betray them.Stephen felt in his bones the coming of a struggle, and was
thrilled.Once he smiled at the thought that he had become an active
partisan--nay, a worshipper--of the uncouth Lincoln.Terrible suspicion
for a Bostonian,--had he been carried away?Was his hero, after all, a
homespun demagogue?Had he been wise in deciding before he had taught
a glimpse of the accomplished Douglas, whose name end fame filled the
land?But in his heart there
lurked a fear of the sophisticated Judge and Senator and man of the
world whom he had not yet seen.In his notebook he had made a copy of
the Question, and young Mr.Hill discovered him pondering in a corner
of the lobby at dinnertime.After dinner they went together to their
candidate's room.They found the doors open and the place packed, and
there was Mr.Lincoln's very tall hat towering above those of the
other politicians pressed around him.Lincoln took three strides in
Stephen's direction and seized him by the shoulder."Why, Steve," said he, "I thought you had got away again."Turning to a
big burly man with a good-natures face, who was standing by, he added."Jim, I want you to look out for this young man.Get him a seat on the
stands where he can hear."He never knew what the gentleman's last name
was, or whether he had any.It was but a few minutes' walk to the grove
where the speaking was to be.And as they made their way thither Mr.Lincoln passed them in a Conestoga wagon drawn by six milk-white horses.Jim informed Stephen that the Little Giant had had a six-horse coach.Hovering about the hem of the crowd
were the sunburned young men in their Sunday best, still clinging fast
to the hands of the young women.Bands blared "Columbia, Gem of the
Ocean."Fakirs planted their stands in the way, selling pain-killers
and ague cures, watermelons and lemonade, Jugglers juggled, and beggars
begged.Jim said that there were sixteen thousand people in that grove.He tried to think of himself as
fifty years old, with the courage to address sixteen thousand people on
such a day, and quailed.What a man of affairs it must take to do
that!Sixteen thousand people, into each of whose breasts God had put
different emotions and convictions.He had never even imagined such a
crowd as this assembles merely to listen to a political debate.But then
he remembered, as they dodged from in front of the horses, what it was
not merely a political debate: The pulse of nation was here, a great
nation stricken with approaching fever.It was not now a case of excise,
but of existence.This son of toil who had driven his family thirty miles across the
prairie, blanketed his tired horses and slept on the ground the night
before, who was willing to stand all through the afternoon and listen
with pathetic eagerness to this debate, must be moved by a patriotism
divine.In the breast of that farmer, in the breast of his tired wife
who held her child by the hand, had been instilled from birth that
sublime fervor which is part of their life who inherit the Declaration
of Independence.Instinctively these men who had fought and won the West
had scented the danger.With the spirit of their ancestors who had left
their farms to die on the bridge at Concord, or follow Ethan Allen into
Ticonderoga, these had come to Freeport.What were three days of bodily
discomfort!What even the loss of part of a cherished crop, if the
nation's existence were at stake and their votes might save it!In the midst of that heaving human sea rose the bulwarks of a wooden
stand.The rough
farmers commonly squeezed a way for him.And when they did not, he made
it with his big body.As they drew near their haven, a great surging as
of a tidal wave swept them off their feet.There was a deafening shout,
and the stand rocked on its foundations.Before Stephen could collect
his wits, a fierce battle was raging about him.Abolitionist and
Democrat, Free Soiler and Squatter Sov, defaced one another in a rush
for the platform.The committeemen and reporters on top of it rose to
its defence.Jim was
recognized and hauled bodily into the fort, and Stephen after him.The
populace were driven off, and when the excitement died down again, he
found himself in the row behind the reporters.Hill paused
while sharpening his pencil to wave him a friendly greeting.Stephen, craning in his seat, caught sight of Mr.Lincoln slouched into
one of his favorite attitudes, his chin resting in his hand.But who is this, erect, compact, aggressive, searching with a confident
eye the wilderness of upturned faces?A personage, truly, to be
questioned timidly, to be approached advisedly.Here indeed was a lion,
by the very look of him, master of himself and of others.By reason of
its regularity and masculine strength, a handsome face.A man of the
world to the cut of the coat across the broad shoulders.Here was one
to lift a youngster into the realm of emulation, like a character in a
play, to arouse dreams of Washington and its senators and great men.For
this was one to be consulted by the great alone.A figure of dignity and
power, with magnetism to compel moods.Since, when he smiled, you warmed
in spite of yourself, and when he frowned the world looked grave.The inevitable comparison was come, and Stephen's hero was shrunk once
more.He drew a deep breath, searched for the word, and gulped.How country Abraham Lincoln looked beside Stephen
Arnold Douglas!Had the Lord ever before made and set over against each other two such
different men?Yes, for such are the ways of the Lord.........................

The preliminary speaking was in progress, but Stephen neither heard nor
saw until he felt the heavy hand of his companion on his knee."There's something mighty strange, like fate, between them two," he was
saying."I recklect twenty-five years ago when they was first in the
Legislatur' together.A man told me that they was both admitted to
practice in the S'preme Court in '39, on the same day, sir.Then you
know they was nip an' tuck after the same young lady.They've been in Congress together, the Little Giant in the Senate, and
now, here they be in the greatest set of debates the people of this
state ever heard; Young man, the hand of fate is in this here, mark my
words--"

There was a hush, and the waves of that vast human sea were stilled.A
man, lean, angular, with coat-tail: flapping-unfolded like a grotesque
figure at a side-show.Stooping forward, Abraham Lincoln began to
speak, and Stephen Brice hung his head and shuddered.Could this shrill
falsetto be the same voice to which he had listened only that morning?Could this awkward, yellow man with his hands behind his back be he whom
he had worshipped?Ripples of derisive laughter rose here and there, on
the stand and from the crowd.Thrice distilled was the agony of those
moments!But what was this feeling that gradually crept over him?The hands were coming around to the
front.Suddenly one of them was thrown sharply back, with a determined
gesture, the head was raised,--and--and his shame was for gotten.But soon he lost even that, for his mind was
gone on a journey.And when again he came to himself and looked upon
Abraham Lincoln, this was a man transformed.Nay, it was now a powerful instrument which played strangely on
those who heard.Now it rose, and again it fell into tones so low as to
start a stir which spread and spread, like a ripple in a pond, until it
broke on the very edge of that vast audience."Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way,
   against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude
   slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State
   Constitution?"It was out, at last, irrevocably writ in the recording book of History,
for better, for worse.Beyond the reach of politician, committee, or
caucus.But what man amongst those who heard and stirred might say that
these minutes even now basting into eternity held the Crisis of a nation
that is the hope of the world?Not you, Judge Douglas who sit there
smiling.Consternation is a stranger in your heart,--but answer the
question if you can.Yes, your nimble wit has helped you out of many a
tight corner.You do not feel the noose--as yet.You do not guess that
your reply will make or mar the fortunes of your country.It is not
you who can look ahead two short years and see the ship of Democracy
splitting on the rocks at Charleston and at Baltimore, when the power of
your name might have steered her safely.One by one he is
taking the screws out of the engine which you have invented to run your
ship.Look, he holds them in his hands without mixing them, and shows
the false construction of its secret parts.For Abraham Lincoln dealt with abstruse questions in language so limpid
that many a farmer, dulled by toil, heard and understood and marvelled.The simplicity of the Bible dwells in those speeches, and they are now
classics in our literature.And the wonder in Stephen's mind was that
this man who could be a buffoon, whose speech was coarse and whose
person unkempt, could prove himself a tower of morality and truth.That
has troubled many another, before and since the debate at Freeport.That short hour came all too quickly to an end.And as the Moderator
gave the signal for Mr.Lincoln, it was Stephen's big companion who
snapped the strain, and voiced the sentiment of those about him.I didn't think Abe had it in
him."The Honorable Stephen A. Douglas, however, seemed anything but baffled
as he rose to reply.As he waited for the cheers which greeted him to
die out, his attitude was easy and indifferent, as a public man's should
be.The question seemed not to trouble him in the least.But for Stephen
Brice the Judge stood there stripped of the glamour that made him, even
as Abraham Lincoln had stripped his doctrine of its paint and colors,
and left it punily naked.Standing up, the very person of the Little Giant was contradictory, as
was the man himself.But he had the head
and shoulders of a lion, and even the lion's roar.What at contrast the
ring of his deep bass to the tentative falsetto of Mr.If Stephen expected the Judge to tremble, he was greatly
disappointed.John journeyed to the kitchen.As if to show the people
how lightly he held his opponent's warnings, he made them gape by
putting things down Mr.Lincoln's shirt-front and taking them out of his
mouth: But it appeared to Stephen, listening with all his might, that
the Judge was a trifle more on the defensive than his attitude might
lead one to expect.Was he not among his own Northern Democrats at
Freeport?And yet it seemed to give him a keen pleasure to call his
hearers "Black Republicans.""Not black," came from the crowd again
and again, and once a man: shouted, "Couldn't you modify it and call
it brown?"cried the Judge, and dubbed them "Yankees,"
although himself a Vermonter by birth.He implied that most of these
Black Republicans desired <DW64> wives.But quick,--to the Question, How was the Little Giant, artful in debate
as he was, to get over that without offence to the great South?Very
skillfully the judge disposed of the first of the interrogations.And
then, save for the gusts of wind rustling the trees, the grove might
have been empty of its thousands, such was the silence that fell.But
tighter and tighter they pressed against the stand, until it trembled.Oh, Judge, the time of all artful men will come at length.How were you
to foresee a certain day under the White Dome of the Capitol?Had your
sight been long, you would have paused before your answer.Had your
sight been long, you would have seen this ugly Lincoln bareheaded before
the Nation, and you are holding his hat.Judge Douglas, this act alone
has redeemed your faults.It has given you a nobility of which we did
not suspect you.At the end God gave you strength to be humble, and so
you left the name of a patriot.Judge, you thought there was a passage between Scylla and Charybdis
which your craftiness might overcome."It matters not," you cried when you answered the Question, "it matters
not which way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract
question whether slavery may or may not go into a territory under
the Constitution.The people have the lawful means to introduce or to
exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist
a day or an hour anywhere unless it is supported by local police
regulations."Judge Douglas, uneasy will you lie to-night, for you have uttered the
Freeport Heresy.It only remains to be told how Stephen Brice, coming to the Brewster
House after the debate, found Mr.On his knee, in transports
of delight, was a small boy, and Mr.Lincoln was serenely playing on
the child's Jew's-harp.Standing beside him was a proud father who had
dragged his son across two counties in a farm wagon, and who was to
return on the morrow to enter this event in the family Bible.In a
corner of the room were several impatient gentlemen of influence who
wished to talk about the Question.Lincoln looked up with a smile of welcome
that is still, and ever will be, remembered and cherished."Tell Judge Whipple that I have attended to that little matter, Steve,"
he said.Lincoln," he exclaimed, "you have had no time."Lincoln replied, "and I think that I am
well repaid.Steve," said he, "unless I'm mightily mistaken, you know a
little more than you did yesterday."Didn't you feel sorry for
me last night?""I never shall again, sir," he said.The wonderful smile, so ready to come and go, flickered and went out.In
its stead on the strange face was ineffable sadness,--the sadness of the
world's tragedies, of Stephen stoned, of Christ crucified."Pray God that you may feel sorry for me again," he said.Awed, the child on his lap was still.Lincoln had kept Stephen's hand in his own."I have hopes of you, Stephen," he said.Why was it that he walked to the station with a
heavy heart?It was a sense of the man he had left, who had been and was
to be.This Lincoln of the black loam, who built his neighbor's cabin
and hoed his neighbor's corn, who had been storekeeper and postmaster
and flat-boatman.Who had followed a rough judge dealing a rough justice
around a rough circuit; who had rolled a local bully in the dirt;
rescued women from insult; tended the bedside of many a sick coward who
feared the Judgment; told coarse stories on barrels by candlelight (but
these are pure beside the vice of great cities); who addressed political
mobs in the raw, swooping down from the stump and flinging embroilers
east and west.This physician who was one day to tend the sickbed of the
Nation in her agony; whose large hand was to be on her feeble pulse, and
whose knowledge almost divine was to perform the miracle of her healing.So was it that, the Physician Himself performed His cures, and when work
was done, died a martyr.Abraham Lincoln died in His name




CHAPTER VI.GLENCOE

It was nearly noon when Stephen walked into the office the next day,
dusty and travel-worn and perspiring.He had come straight from the
ferry, without going home.And he had visions of a quiet dinner with
Richter under the trees at the beer-garden, where he could talk about
Abraham Lincoln.But the young German met him at the top of the stair--and his face was
more serious than usual, although he showed his magnificent teeth in a
smile of welcome."You are a little behind your time, my friend," said he, "What has
happened you?""Ah, I know not," he answered, "He has gone is Glencoe.Doctor Polk says that he has worked all his life too hard.The Doctor and Colonel Carvel tried to get him to go to Glencoe.But
he would not budge until Miss Carvel herself comes all the way from the
country yesterday, and orders him.exclaimed Richter, impulsively,
"what wonderful women you have in America!I could lose my head when I
think of Miss Carvel.""Miss Carvel was here, you say?"said Richter, disgusted, "you don't care."And becoming grave again, added: "Except on
Judge Whipple's account.Have you heard from him to-day, Carl?""This morning one of Colonel Carvel's servants came for his letters.I--I pray that he is better," said Richter, his
voice breaking.But he had been conscious all at once of an
affection for the Judge of which he had not suspected himself.That
afternoon, on his way home, he stopped at Carvel & Company's to inquire.Hopper said, and added that he "presumed
likely the Colonel would not be in for a week."Eliphalet was actually in the Colonel's sanctum behind the partition,
giving orders to several clerks at the time.He was so prosperous and
important that he could scarce spare a moment to answer Stephen, who
went away wondering whether he had been wise to choose the law.On Monday, when Stephen called at Carvel & Company's, Eliphalet was too
busy to see him.But Ephum, who went out to Glencoe every night with
orders, told him that the "Jedge was wuss, suh."On Wednesday, there
being little change, Mrs.Brice ventured to despatch a jelly by Ephum.On Friday afternoon, when Stephen was deep in Whittlesey and the New
Code, he became aware of Ephum standing beside him.In reply to his
anxious question Ephum answered:

"I reckon he better, suh.He an' de Colonel done commence wrastlin'
'bout a man name o' Linkum.De Colonel done wrote you dis note, suh."It was a very polite note, containing the Colonel's compliments, asking
Mr.Brice to Glencoe that afternoon with whatever papers or letters the
Judge might wish to see.And since there was no convenient train in the
evening, Colonel Carvel would feel honored if Mr.The Missouri side of the Mississippi is a very different country from
the hot and treeless prairies of Illinois.As Stephen alighted at the
little station at Glencoe and was driven away by Ned in the Colonel's
buggy, he drew in deep breaths of the sweet air of the Meramec Valley.There had been a shower, and the sun glistened on the drops on grass and
flowers, and the great trees hung heavy over the clay road.At last they
came to a white gate in the picket fence, in sight of a rambling wooden
house with a veranda in front covered with honeysuckle.And then he saw
the Colonel, in white marseilles, smoking a cigar.As Stephen trod the rough flags between the high grass which led toward
the house, Colonel Carvel rose to his full height and greeted him."You are very welcome, sir," he said gravely."The Judge is asleep now,"
he added."I regret to say that we had a little argument this morning,
and my daughter tells me it will be well not to excite him again to-day.Jinny is reading to him now, or she would be here to entertain you, Mr.Jackson appeared hurriedly, seized Stephen's bag, and led the way
upstairs through the cool and darkened house to a pretty little room on
the south side, with matting, and roses on the simple dressing-table.After he had sat awhile staring at these, and at the wet flower-garden
from between the slats of his shutters, he removed the signs of the
railroad upon him, and descended.The Colonel was still on the porch, in
his easy-chair.He had lighted another, cigar, and on the stand beside
him stood two tall glasses, green with the fresh mint.Colonel Carvel
rose, and with his own hand offered one to Stephen.Brice," he said, "and I hope you will feel at home
here, sir.Jackson will bring you anything you desire, and should you
wish to drive, I shall be delighted to show you the country."Stephen drank that julep with reverence, and then the Colonel gave him
a cigar.He was quite overcome by this treatment of a penniless young
Yankee.The Colonel did not talk politics--such was not his notion of
hospitality to a stranger.He talked horse, and no great discernment on
Stephen's part was needed to perceive that this was Mr."I used to have a stable, Mr.Brice, before they ruined gentleman's
sport with these trotters ten years ago.Yes sir, we used to be at
Lexington one week, and Louisville the next, and over here on the Ames
track after that.Did you ever hear of Water Witch and Netty Boone?""Why, sir," he cried, "that very <DW65>, Ned, who drove you here from
the cars-he used to ride Netty Boone.He was the best jockey ever strode a horse on the Elleardsville track
here.He wore my yellow and green, sir, until he got to weigh one
hundred and a quarter.And I kept him down to that weight a whole year,
Mr.I had him wrapped in blankets and set in a chair with
holes bored in the seat.Then we lighted a spirit lamp under him.Many
a time I took off ten pounds that way.It needs fire to get flesh off a
<DW65>, sir."He didn't notice his guest's amazement."Then, sir," he continued, "they introduced these damned trotting races;
trotting races are for white trash, Mr.I wish you
could have seen Miss Virginia Carvel as he saw her then.A tea-tray was in her hand, and her head was tilted
back, as women are apt to do when they carry a burden.It was so that
these Southern families, who were so bitter against Abolitionists and
Yankees, entertained them when they were poor, and nursed them when they
were ill.Stephen, for his life, could not utter a word.But Virginia turned to
him with perfect self-possession."He has been boring you with his horses, Mr."Has he
told you what a jockey Ned used to be before he weighed one hundred and
a quarter?""Has he given you the points of Water Witch and
Netty Boone?""Pa, I tell you once more that you will drive every guest from this
house.O that you might have a notion of the way in which Virginia pronounced
intolerable.Carvel reached for another cigar asked, "My dear," he asked, "how is
the Judge?""My dear," said Virginia, smiling, "he is asleep.Mammy Easter is with
him, trying to make out what he is saying.He talks in his sleep, just
as you do--"

"And what is he saying?""'A house divided against itself,'" said Miss Carvel, with a sweep of
her arm, "'cannot stand.I believe that this Government cannot endure
permanently, half slave and half free.I do not expect the Union to
dissolve--I do not expect the house to fall--but I do expect it will
cease to be divided.'"No," cried the Colonel, and banged his fist down on the table."Why,"
said he, thoughtfully, stroking the white goatee on his chin, "cuss me
if that ain't from the speech that country bumpkin, Lincoln, made in
June last before the Black Republican convention in Illinois."And Stephen was very near it, for
he loved the Colonel.That gentleman suddenly checked himself in his
tirade, and turned to him."I beg your pardon, sir," he said; "I reckon that you have the same
political sentiments as the Judge.Believe me, sir, I would not
willingly offend a guest.""I am not offended, sir," he said.Carvel to bestow a quick glance upon him."You will pardon my absence for a while, sir," he said.In silence they watched him as he strode off under the trees through
tall grass, a yellow setter at his heels.The shadows of the walnuts and hickories were growing long, and
a rich country was giving up its scent to the evening air.From a cabin
behind the house was wafted the melody of a plantation song.To
the young man, after the burnt city, this was paradise.And then he
remembered his mother as she must be sitting on the tiny porch in
town, and sighed.Only two years ago she had been at their own place at
Westbury.He looked up, and saw the girl watching him.He dared not think that the
expression he caught was one of sympathy, for it changed instantly."I am afraid you are the silent kind, Mr.Brice," said she; "I believe
it is a Yankee trait.""I have known a great many who were not," said he, "When they are
garrulous, they are very much so.""I should prefer a garrulous one," said Virginia."I should think a Yankee were bad enough, but a noisy Yankee not to be
put up with," he ventured.Virginia did not deign a direct reply to this, save by the corners of
her mouth."I wonder," said she, thoughtfully, "whether it is strength of mind or a
lack of ideas that makes them silent.""It is mostly prudence," said Mr."Prudence is our dominant
trait.""You have not always shown it," she said, with an innocence which in
women is often charged with meaning.He would have liked
greatly to know whether she referred to his hasty purchase of Hester, or
to his rashness in dancing with her at her party the winter before."We have something left to be thankful for," he answered."We are still
capable of action.""On occasions it is violence," said Virginia, desperately.This man must
not get ahead of her."It is just as violent," said he, "as the repressed feeling which
prompts it."This was a new kind of conversation to Virginia.Of all the young men
she knew, not one had ever ventured into anything of the sort.They were
either flippant, or sentimental, or both.She was at once flattered
and annoyed, flattered, because, as a woman, Stephen had conceded her
a mind.Many of the young men she knew had minds, but deemed that these
were wasted on women, whose language was generally supposed to be a kind
of childish twaddle.Even Jack Brinsmade rarely risked his dignity
and reputation at an intellectual tilt.This was one of Virginia's
grievances.She often argued with her father, and, if the truth were
told, had had more than one victory over Judge Whipple.Virginia's annoyance came from the fact that she perceived in Stephen
a natural and merciless logic,--a faculty for getting at the bottom
of things.His brain did not seem to be thrown out of gear by local
magnetic influences,--by beauty, for instance.He did not lose his head,
as did some others she knew, at the approach of feminine charms.Here
was a grand subject, then, to try the mettle of any woman.One with
less mettle would have given it up.But Virginia thought it would be
delightful to bring this particular Yankee to his knees; and--and leave
him there.Brice," she said, "I have not spoken to you since the night of my
party."Yes, we did," said he, "and I called, but was unfortunate."Now Miss Carvel was complacency itself."Jackson is so careless with cards," said she, "and very often I do not
take the trouble to read them.""I am sorry," said he, "as I wished for the opportunity to tell you how
much I enjoyed myself.She remembered how, she had opposed his
coning.But honesty as well as something else prompted her to say: "It
was my father who invited you."Stephen did not reveal the shock his vanity had received."At least you were good enough to dance with me.""I could scarcely refuse a guest," she replied."Had I thought it would have given you annoyance," he said quietly, "I
should not have asked you.""Which would have been a lack of good manners," said Virginia, biting
her lips.Stephen answered nothing, but wished himself in St.He could not
comprehend her cruelty.But, just then, the bell rang for supper, and
the Colonel appeared around the end of the house.It was one of those suppers for which the South is renowned.And when
at length he could induce Stephen to eat no more, Colonel Carvel reached
for his broad-brimmed felt hat, and sat smoking, with his feet against
the mantle.Virginia, who had talked but little, disappeared with a tray
on which she had placed with her own hands some dainties to tempt the
Judge.The Colonel regaled Stephen, when she was gone, with the pedigree and
performance of every horse he had had in his stable.And this was a
relief, as it gave him an opportunity to think without interruption upon
Virginia's pronounced attitude of dislike.To him it was inconceivable
that a young woman of such qualities as she appeared to have, should
assail him so persistently for freeing a negress, and so depriving her
of a maid she had set her heart upon.There were other New England young
men in society.They were not
her particular friends, to be sure.But they called on her and danced
with her, and she had shown them not the least antipathy.But it was to
Stephen's credit that he did not analyze her further.He was reflecting on these things when he got to his room, when there
came a knock at the door.It was Mammy Easter, in bright turban and
apron,--was hospitality and comfort in the flesh."Is you got all you need, suh?"But Mammy showed no inclination to go, and
he was too polite to shut the door:

"How you like Glencoe, Mistah Bride?""We has some of de fust fam'lies out heah in de summer," said she."But
de Colonel, he a'n't much on a gran' place laik in Kaintuck.Shucks, no,
suh, dis ain't much of a'stablishment!Young Massa won't have no lawns,
no greenhouses, no nothin'.He say he laik it wil' and simple.He on'y
come out fo' two months, mebbe.But Miss Jinny, she make it lively.Las'
week, until the Jedge come we hab dis house chuck full, two-three young
ladies in a room, an' five young gemmen on trunnle beds."Den Miss Jinny low dey all hatter go.She say she a'n't
gwineter have 'em noun''sturbin' a sick man.He
done give the Judge his big room, and he say he and de young men gwine
ober to Mista, Catherwood's.You a'n't never seen Miss Jinny rise up,
suh!She des swep' 'em all out" (Mammy emphasized this by rolling her
hands) "an' declah she gwine ten' to the Jedge herself.She a'n't never
let me bring up one of his meals, suh."And so she left Stephen with
some food for reflection.Virginia was very gay at breakfast, and said that the Judge would see
Stephen; so he and the Colonel, that gentleman with his hat on, went
up to his room.The shutters were thrown open, and the morning sunlight
filtered through the leaves and fell on the four-poster where the Judge
sat up, gaunt and grizzled as ever.He smiled at his host, and then
tried to destroy immediately the effect of the smile."Well, Judge," cried the Colonel, taking his hand, "I reckon we talked
too much.""No such thing, Carvel," said the Judge, forcibly, "if you hadn't
left the room, your popular sovereignty would have been in rags in two
minutes."Stephen sat down in a corner, unobserved, in expectation of a renewal.But at this moment Miss Virginia swept into the room, very cool in a
pink muslin."Colonel Carvel," said she, sternly, "I am the doctor's deputy here.I
was told to keep the peace at any cost.And if you answer back, out you
go, like that!"But the Judge, whose mind was on the argument,
continued to mutter defiantly until his eye fell upon Stephen."Well, sir, well, sir," he said, "you've turned up at last, have you?I send you off with papers for a man, and I get back a piece of yellow
paper saying that he's borrowed you."He took me to Freeport, sir, where I listened to the most remarkable
speech I ever expect to hear."cried the Judge, "so far from Boston?"Stephen hesitated, uncertain whether to laugh, until he chanced to look
at Virginia."I was very much surprised, sir," he said.Whipple, "and what did you chink of that ruffian,
Lincoln?""He is the most remarkable man that I have ever met, sir," answered
Stephen, with emphasis.It seemed as if the grunt this time had in it something of approval.Stephen had doubt as to the propriety of discussing Mr.Lincoln there,
and he reddened.Virginia's expression bore a trace of defiance, and Mr.Carvel stood with his feet apart, thoughtfully stroking his goatee.Whipple seemed to have no scruples."You must agree with
that laudatory estimation of him which I read in the Missouri Democrat.""I do, sir, most decidedly," he answered."I should hardly expect a conservative Bostonian, of the class which
respects property, to have said that.It might possibly be a good thing
if more from your town could hear those debates.""They will read them, sir; I feel confident of it."At this point the Colonel could contain himself no longer."I reckon I might tell the man who wrote that Democrat article a few
things, if I could find out who he is," said he.But Stephen had turned a fiery red, "I wrote it, Colonel Carvel," he
said.For a dubious instant of silence Colonel Carvel stared.Then--then he
slapped his knees, broke into a storm of laughter, and went out of the
room.He left Stephen in a moist state of discomfiture.The Judge had bolted upright from the pillows."You have been neglecting your law, sir," he cried."I wrote the article at night," said Stephen, indignantly."Then it must have been Sunday night, Mr.At this point Virginia hid her face in her handkerchief which trembled
visibly.Being a woman, whose ways are unaccountable, the older man took
no notice of her.But being a young woman, and a pretty one, Stephen was
angry."I don't see what right you have to ask me that sir," he said.Brice," said the Judge, "Virginia, you
may strike it from the records.And now, sir, tell me something about
your trip."An hour later Stephen descended to the veranda, and it was with
apprehension that he discerned Mr.Carvel seated under the vines at the
far end.To Stephen's surprise the Colonel rose, and, coming toward him, laid a
kindly hand on his shoulder."Stephen," said he, "there will be no law until Monday you must stay
with us until then.I shall have to go by the two o'clock train, I
fear."The Colonel turned to Virginia, who, meanwhile, had sat silently by."Jinny," he said, "we must contrive to keep him.""I'm afraid he is determined, Pa," she answered.Brice
would like to see a little of the place before he goes.It is very
primitive," she explained, "not much like yours in the East."Stephen thanked her, and bowed to the Colonel.And so she led him past
the low, crooked outbuildings at the back, where he saw old Uncle
Ben busy over the preparation of his dinner, and frisky Rosetta, his
daughter, playing with one of the Colonel's setters.Then Virginia took
a well-worn path, on each side of which the high grass bent with its
load of seed, which entered the wood.Oaks and hickories and walnuts
and persimmons spread out in a glade, and the wild grape twisted
fantastically around the trunks.All this beauty seemed but a fit
setting to the strong girlish figure in the pink frock before him.So absorbed was he in contemplation of this, and in wondering whether
indeed she were to marry her cousin, Clarence Colfax, that he did not
see the wonders of view unrolling in front of him.She stopped at length
beside a great patch of wild race bushes.They were on the edge of the
bluff, and in front of them a little rustic summer-house, with seats on
its five sides.But Stephen, going to the edge,
stood and marvelled.Far, far below him, down the wooded steep, shot
the crystal Meramec, chafing over the shallow gravel beds and tearing
headlong at the deep passes.Beyond, the dimpled green hills rose and fell, and the stream ran indigo
and silver.A hawk soared over the water, the only living creature in
all that wilderness.And when at length he turned,
he saw that the girl was watching him.Virginia had taken other young men here, and they had looked only upon
her.This sincerity now was as new to her
as that with which he had surprised her in the Judge's room.A reply to those simple words of his
was impossible.At honest Tom Catherwood in the same situation she would
have laughed, Clarence never so much as glanced at scenery.Her replies
to him were either flippant, or else maternal, as to a child.A breeze laden with the sweet abundance of that valley stirred her hair.And with that womanly gesture which has been the same through the ages
she put up her hand; deftly tucking in the stray wisp behind.She glanced at the New Englander, against whom she had been in strange
rebellion since she had first seen him.His face, thinned by the summer
in town, was of the sternness of the Puritan.Stephen's features were
sharply marked for his age.Yet justice
was in the mouth, and greatness of heart.Conscience was graven on the
broad forehead.The eyes were the blue gray of the flint, kindly yet
imperishable.Struggling, then yielding to the impulse, Virginia let herself be led on
into the years.Sanity was the word that best described him.She saw him
trusted of men, honored of women, feared by the false.She saw him in
high places, simple, reserved, poised evenly as he was now."I wish that I might stay," he said regretfully."But I cannot, Miss
Carvel."Never before had she
stooped to urge young men to stay.The difficulty had always been to get
them to go.It was natural, perhaps, that her vanity was wounded.But it
hurt her to think that she had made the overture, had tried to conquer
whatever it was that set her against him, and had failed through him.Perhaps," she added, with a little
laugh, "perhaps it is Bellefontaine Road.""Then" (with a touch of derision), "then it is because you cannot miss
an afternoon's work."I was not always that kind," he answered.But now I have to or--or starve," he said.For the second time his complete simplicity had disarmed her.He had not
appealed to her sympathy, nor had he hinted at the luxury in which he
was brought up.She would have liked to question Stephen on this former
life."I thought him the ugliest man I ever saw, and the handsomest as well.""You believe with him that this government cannot exist half slave and
half free.Brice, when you and I shall be
foreigners one to the other.""You have forgotten," he said eagerly, "you have forgotten the rest
of the quotation.'I do not expect the Union to be dissolved--I do not
expect the house to fall--but cease to be divided.'It will become all
one thing or all the other.""That seemed to me very equivocal," said she."Your
rail-sputter is well named.""Will you read the rest of that speech?"he asked

"Judge Whipple is very clever.He has made a convert of you," she
answered."The Judge has had nothing to do with it," cried Stephen."He is not
given to discussion with me, and until I went to Springfield had never
mentioned Lincoln's name to me."Glancing at her, he surprised a sparkle of amusement in her eyes."Why do you suppose that you were sent to Springfield?""And that most important communication was--your self.There, now, I
have told you," said Virginia."Then you haven't the sense I thought you had," she replied impatiently."Do you know what was in that note?Well, a year ago last June this
Black Republican lawyer whom you are all talking of made a speech before
a convention in Illinois.Judge Whipple has been crazy on the subject
ever since--he talks of Lincoln in his sleep; he went to Springfield and
spent two days with him, and now he can't rest until you have seen and
known and heard him.So he writes a note to Lincoln and asks him to take
you to the debate--"

She paused again to laugh at his amazement."But he told me to go to Springfield!"He knew that you would obey his orders, I
suppose.""But I didn't know--" Stephen began, trying to come pass within an
instant the memory of his year's experience with Mr."You didn't know that he thought anything about you," said Virginia.He has more private charities on his list
than any man in the city except Mr.He
thinks a great deal of you.But there," she added, suddenly blushing
crimson, "I am sorry I told you."She did not answer, but sat tapping the seat with her fingers.And when
she ventured to look at him, he had fallen into thought."I think it must be time for dinner," said Virginia, "if you really wish
to catch the train."The coldness in her voice, rather than her words, aroused him.He rose,
took one lingering look at the river, and followed her to the house.At dinner, when not talking about his mare, the Colonel was trying
to persuade Stephen to remain.Virginia did not join in this, and
her father thought the young man's refusal sprang from her lack of
cordiality.Colonel Carvel himself drove to the station.When he returned, he found his daughter sitting idly on the porch."I like that young man, if he is a Yankee," he declared."I don't," said Virginia, promptly."My dear," said her father, voicing the hospitality of the Carvels,
"I am surprised at you.One should never show one's feelings toward a
guest.As mistress of this house it was your duty to press him to stay.""Do you know why he went, my dear," asked the Colonel."He said that his mother was alone in town, and needed him."Virginia got up without a word, and went into Judge Whipple's room.And there the Colonel found her some hours later, reading aloud from a
scrap-book certain speeches of Mr.Lincoln's which Judge Whipple had cut
from newspapers.And the Judge, lying back with his eyes half closed,
was listening in pure delight.Little did he guess at Virginia's
penance!AN EXCURSION

I am going ahead two years.Two years during which a nation struggled
in agony with sickness, and even the great strength with which she was
endowed at birth was not equal to the task of throwing it off.In 1620
a Dutch ship had brought from Guinea to his Majesty's Colony of Virginia
the germs of that disease for which the Nation's blood was to be let
so freely.During these years signs of dissolution, of death, were not
wanting.In the city by the Father of Waters where the races met, men and women
were born into the world, who were to die in ancient Cuba, who were to
be left fatherless in the struggle soon to come, who were to live to
see new monsters rise to gnaw at the vitals of the Republic, and to
hear again the cynical laugh of Europe.But they were also to see their
country a power in the world, perchance the greatest power.While Europe
had wrangled, the child of the West had grown into manhood and taken
a seat among the highest, to share with them the responsibilities of
manhood.Meanwhile, Stephen Brice had been given permission to practise law
in the sovereign state of Missouri.It cannot be said that he was intimate with that rather
formidable personage, although the Judge, being a man of habits, had
formed that of taking tea at least once a week with Mrs.Stephen
had learned to love the Judge, and he had never ceased to be grateful to
him for a knowledge of that man who had had the most influence upon his
life,--Abraham Lincoln.For the seed, sowed in wisdom and self-denial, was bearing fruit.The
sound of gathering conventions was in the land, and the Freeport Heresy
was not for gotten.We shall not mention the number of clients thronging to Mr.Some of
Stephen's income came from articles in the newspapers of that day.What funny newspapers they were, the size of a blanket!No startling
headlines such as we see now, but a continued novel among the
advertisements on the front page and verses from some gifted lady of
the town, signed Electra.And often a story of pure love, but more
frequently of ghosts or other eerie phenomena taken from a magazine, or
an anecdote of a cat or a chicken.There were letters from citizens who
had the mania of print, bulletins of different ages from all parts of
the Union, clippings out of day-before-yesterday's newspaper of Chicago
or Cincinnati to three-weeks letters from San Francisco, come by the
pony post to Lexington and then down the swift Missouri.Of course,
there was news by telegraph, but that was precious as fine gold,--not to
be lightly read and cast aside.In the autumn of '59, through the kindness of Mr.Brinsmade, Stephen had
gone on a steamboat up the river to a great convention in Iowa.On this
excursion was much of St.He widened his circle
of acquaintances, and spent much of his time walking the guards between
Miss Anne Brinsmade and Miss Puss Russell.Perhaps it is unfair to these
young ladies to repeat what they said about Stephen in the privacy of
their staterooms, gentle Anne remonstrating that they should not gossip,
and listening eagerly the while, and laughing at Miss Puss, whose
mimicry of Stephen's severe ways brought tears to her eyes.Clarence Colfax was likewise on the boat, and passing Stephen on the
guards, bowed distantly.But once, on the return trip, when Stephen had
a writing pad on his knee, the young Southerner came up to him in his
frankest manner and with an expression of the gray eyes which was not to
be withstood."I hear you are the kind that cannot be
idle even on a holiday.""Not as bad as all that," replied Stephen, smiling at him."Reckon you keep a diary, then," said Clarence, leaning against the
rail.He made a remarkably graceful figure, Stephen thought.He was
tall, and his movements had what might be called a commanding indolence.Stephen, while he smiled, could not but admire the tone and gesture with
which Colfax bade a passing <DW64> to get him a handkerchief from his
cabin.The alacrity of the black to do the errand was amusing enough.Stephen well knew it had not been such if he wanted a handkerchief.Colfax was too well bred to inquire
further; so he never found out that Mr.Brice was writing an account of
the Convention and the speechmaking for the Missouri Democrat."Brice," said the Southerner, "I want to apologize for things I've done
to you and said about you.I hated you for a long time after you beat me
out of Hester, and--" he hesitated.For the first time he actually liked Colfax.He had
been long enough among Colfax's people to understand how difficult it
was for him to say the thing he wished."You may remember a night at my uncle's, Colonel Carvel's, on the
occasion of my cousin's birthday?""Well," blurted Clarence, boyishly, "I was rude to you in my uncle's
house, and I have since been sorry.""He held out his hand, and Stephen took it warmly.Colfax," he said, "and I didn't understand your
point of view as well as I do now.Not that I have changed my ideas," he
added quickly, "but the notion of the girl's going South angered me.I
was bidding against the dealer rather than against you.Had I then known
Miss Carvel--" he stopped abruptly.The winning expression died from the face of the other.He turned away, and leaning across the rail, stared at the high bluffs,
red-bronzed by the autumn sun.A score of miles beyond that precipice
was a long low building of stone, surrounded by spreading trees,--the
school for young ladies, celebrated throughout the West, where our
mothers and grandmothers were taught,--Monticello.Hither Miss Virginia
Carvel had gone, some thirty days since, for her second winter.Perhaps Stephen guessed the thought in the mind of his companion, for
he stared also.The music in the cabin came to an abrupt pause, and only
the tumbling of waters through the planks of the great wheels broke the
silence.They were both startled by laughter at their shoulders.There
stood Miss Russell, the picture of merriment, her arm locked in Anne
Brinsmade's."It is the hour when all devout worshippers turn towards the East," she
said."The goddess is enshrined at Monticello."Both young men, as they got to their feet, were crimson.But this was not
the first time Miss Russell had gone too far.Colfax, with the
excess of manner which was his at such times, excused himself and left
abruptly.This to the further embarrassment of Stephen and Anne, and the
keener enjoyment of Miss Russell."Why, you are even writing
verses to her!""I scarcely know Miss Carvel," he said, recovering."And as for writing
verse--"

"You never did such a thing in your life!Miss Russell made a face in the direction Colfax had taken."He always acts like that when you mention her," she said."But you are so cruel, Puss," said Anne."That has been the way of the world ever since Adam and Eve," remarked
Puss."I suppose you meant to ask: Mr.Brice, whether Clarence is to
marry Virginia Carvel."Brice," Puss continued, undaunted."I shall tell you some
gossip.Virginia was sent to Monticello, and went with her father to
Kentucky and Pennsylvania this summer, that she might be away from
Clarence."Colonel Carvel is right," she went on.They are first cousins, and the Colonel doesn't like that.But he isn't good for anything in the world except horse
racing and--and fighting.He wanted to help drive the Black Republican
emigrants out of Kansas, and his mother had to put a collar and chain on
him.He wanted to go filibustering with Walker, and she had to get down
on her knees.And yet," she cried, "if you Yankees push us as far as
war, Mr."Oh, I know what you are going to say,--that Clarence has money.""Come, Anne," she said, "we mustn't interrupt the Senator any longer.That was the way in which Stephen got his nickname.It is scarcely
necessary to add that he wrote no more until he reached his little room
in the house on Olive Street.They had passed Alton, and the black cloud that hung in the still autumn
air over the city was in sight.It was dusk when the 'Jackson' pushed
her nose into the levee, and the song of the <DW64> stevedores rose from
below as they pulled the gang-plank on to the landing-stage.Stephen
stood apart on the hurricane deck, gazing at the dark line of sooty
warehouses.How many young men with their way to make have felt the same
as he did after some pleasant excursion.The presence of a tall form
beside him shook him from his revery, and he looked up to recognize the
benevolent face of Mr.Brice may be anxious, Stephen, at the late hour," said he."My
carriage is here, and it will give me great pleasure to convey you to
your door."He is in heaven now, and knows at last the good
he wrought upon earth.Of the many thoughtful charities which Stephen
received from him, this one sticks firmest in his remembrance: A
stranger, tired and lonely, and apart from the gay young men and women
who stepped from the boat, he had been sought out by this gentleman, to
whom had been given the divine gift of forgetting none."Oh, Puss," cried Anne, that evening, for Miss Russell had come to spend
the night, "how could you have talked to him so?He scarcely spoke on
the way up in the carriage."Why should I set him upon a pedestal?"said Puss, with a thread in
her mouth; "why should you all set him upon a pedestal?He is only a
Yankee," said Puss, tossing her head, "and not so very wonderful.""I did not say he was wonderful," replied Anne, with dignity.He had better
marry Belle Cluyme.A great man, he may give some decision to that
family."Then--Virginia Carvel is in love with him.""She thinks she hates him," said Miss Russell, calmly.Anne looked up at her companion admiringly.Her two heroines were Puss
and Virginia.Both had the same kind of daring, but in Puss the trait
had developed into a somewhat disagreeable outspokenness which made many
people dislike her.Her judgments were usually well founded, and her
prophecies had so often come to pass that Anne often believed in them
for no other reason."Do you remember that September, a year ago, when we were all out at
Glencoe, and Judge Whipple was ill, and Virginia sent us all away and
nursed him herself?"Brice had gone out, with letters, when the
Judge was better?""It was a Saturday afternoon that he left, although they had begged him
to stay over Sunday.Virginia had written for me to come back, and I
arrived in the evening.I asked Easter where Jinny was, and I found
her--"

"You found her--?"Sitting alone in the summer-house over the river.Easter said she
had been there for two hours.And I have never known Jinny to be such
miserable company as she was that night."But you did," said Anne, with conviction.Miss Russell's reply was not as direct as usual."You know Virginia never confides unless she wants to," she said."Virginia has scarcely seen him since then," she said."You know that
I was her room-mate at Monticello last year, and I think I should have
discovered it."I heard her repeat once what Judge
Whipple told her father of him; that he had a fine legal mind.He was
often in my letters from home, because they have taken Pa's house next
door, and because Pa likes them.I used to read those letters to Jinny,"
said Anne, "but she never expressed any desire to hear them.""I, too, used to write Jinny about him," confessed Puss."No," replied Miss Puss,--"but that was just before the holidays, you
remember.And then the Colonel hurried her off to see her Pennsylvania
relatives, and I believe they went to Annapolis, too, where the Carvels
come from."Stephen, sitting in the next house, writing out his account, little
dreamed that he was the subject of a conference in the third story front
of the Brinsmades'.Later, when the young ladies were asleep, he carried
his manuscript to the Democrat office, and delivered it into the hands
of his friend, the night editor, who was awaiting it.Toward the end of that week, Miss Virginia Carvel was sitting with her
back to one of the great trees at Monticello reading a letter.Every
once in a while she tucked it under her cloak and glanced hastily
around."I have told you all about the excursion, my dear, and how we missed
you.You may remember" (ah, Anne, the guile there is in the best of us),
"you may remember Mr.Stephen Brice, whom we used to speak of.Pa and Ma
take a great interest in him, and Pa had him invited on the excursion.He is more serious than ever, since he has become a full-fledged lawyer.But he has a dry humor which comes out when you know him well, of which
I did not suspect him.His mother is the dearest lady I have ever known,
so quiet, so dignified, and so well bred.Brice told Pa so many things about the
people south of Market Street, the Germans, which he did not know; that
Pa was astonished.He told all about German history, and how they were
persecuted at home, and why they came here.Pa was surprised to hear
that many of them were University men, and that they were already
organizing to defend the Union.I heard Pa say, 'That is what Mr.Blair
meant when he assured me that we need not fear for the city.'"Jinny dear, I ought not to have written you this, because you are for
Secession, and in your heart you think Pa a traitor, because he comes
from a slave state and has slaves of his own."It is sad to think how rich Mrs.Brice lived in Boston, and what she
has had to come to.One servant and a little house, and no place to go
to in the summer, when they used to have such a large one.I often go in
to sew with her, but she has never once mentioned her past to me."Your father has no doubt sent you the Democrat with the account of the
Convention.It is the fullest published, by far, and was so much admired
that Pa asked the editor who wrote it.Who do you think, but Stephen
Brice!Brice hesitated when Pa asked him to go
up the river, and then consented.Yesterday, when I
went in to see Mrs.Brice, a new black silk was on her bed, and as long
as I live I shall never forget how sweet was her voice when she said,
'It is a surprise from my son, my dear.I did not expect ever to have
another.'Jinny, I just know he bought it with the money he got for the
article.That was what he was writing on the boat when Clarence Colfax
interrupted him.Puss accused him of writing verses to you."At this point Miss Virginia Carvel stopped reading.Whether she had read
that part before, who shall say?But she took Anne's letter between her
fingers and tore it into bits and flung the bits into the wind, so that
they were tossed about and lost among the dead leaves under the great
trees.And when she reached her room, there was the hated Missouri
Democrat lying, still open, on her table.A little later a great black
piece of it came tossing out of the chimney above, to the affright
of little Miss Brown, teacher of Literature, who was walking in the
grounds, and who ran to the principal's room with the story that the
chimney was afire.THE COLONEL IS WARNED

It is difficult to refrain from mention of the leave-taking of Miss
Virginia Carvel from the Monticello "Female Seminary," so called in the
'Democrat'.Most young ladies did not graduate in those days.Stephen chanced to read in the 'Republican' about these
ceremonies, which mentioned that Miss Virginia Carvel, "Daughter of
Colonel Comyn Carvel, was without doubt the beauty of the day.She
wore--" but why destroy the picture?The words are meaningless to all males, and young women might laugh at
a critical time.Miss Emily Russell performed upon "that most superb of
all musical instruments the human voice."Was it 'Auld Robin Gray' that
she sang?I am sure it was Miss Maude Catherwood who recited 'To My
Mother', with such effect.Miss Carvel, so Stephen learned with alarm,
was to read a poem by Mrs.Browning, but was "unavoidably prevented."The truth was, as he heard afterward from Miss Puss Russell, that
Miss Jinny had refused point blank.So the Lady Principal, to save her
reputation for discipline, had been forced to deceive the press.There was another who read the account of the exercises with intense
interest, a gentleman of whom we have lately forborne to speak.It is to be doubted if
that somewhat easy-going gentleman, Colonel Carvel, realized the
full importance of Eliphalet to Carvel & Company.Ephum still opened the store in the mornings, but Mr.Hopper was within the ground-glass office before the place was warm, and
through warerooms and shipping rooms, rubbing his hands, to see if any
were late.Many of the old force were missed, and a new and greater
force were come in.These feared Eliphalet as they did the devil, and
worked the harder to please him, because Eliphalet had hired that kind.To them the Colonel was lifted high above the sordid affairs of the
world.He was at the store every day in the winter, and Mr.Hopper
always followed him obsequiously into the ground-glass office, called in
the book-keeper, and showed him the books and the increased earnings.Hood and his slovenly management, and sighed,
in spite of his doubled income.Hopper had added to the Company's
list of customers whole districts in the growing Southwest, and yet the
honest Colonel did not like him.Hopper, by a gradual process,
had taken upon his own shoulders, and consequently off the Colonel's,
responsibility after responsibility.There were some painful scenes,
of course, such as the departure of Mr.Hood, which never would have
occurred had not Eliphalet proved without question the incapacity of
the ancient manager.Hopper only narrowed his lids when the Colonel
pensioned Mr.But the Colonel had a will before which, when
roused, even Mr.So that Eliphalet was always polite
to Ephum, and careful never to say anything in the darkey's presence
against incompetent clerks or favorite customers, who, by the charity of
the Colonel, remained on his books.One spring day, after the sober home-coming of Colonel Carvel from the
Democratic Convention at Charleston, Ephum accosted his master as
he came into the store of a morning.Ephum's face was working with
excitement."What's the matter with you, Ephum?""No, Marsa, I ain't 'zactly."Ephum put down the duster, peered out of the door of the private office,
and closed it softly."Marse Comyn, I ain't got no use fo' dat Misteh Hoppa', Ise kinder
sup'stitious 'bout him, Marsa.""Has he treated you badly, Ephum?"The faithful <DW64> saw another question in his master's face.He well
knew that Colonel Carvel would not descend to ask an inferior concerning
the conduct of a superior.And I ain't sayin' nuthin' gin his honesty.He straight,
but he powerful sharp, Marse Comyn.An' he jus' mussiless down to a
cent."He realized that which was beyond the grasp of the
<DW64>'s mind.New and thriftier methods of trade from New England were
fast replacing the old open-handedness of the large houses.Competition
had begun, and competition is cruel.Edwards, James, & Company had taken
a Yankee into the firm.They were now Edwards, James, & Doddington, and
Mr.Edwards's coolness towards the Colonel was manifest since the rise
of Eliphalet.But Colonel
Carvel did not know until after years that Mr.Hopper had been offered
the place which Mr.Hopper, increase of salary had not changed him.He still
lived in the same humble way, in a single room in Miss Crane's
boarding-house, and he paid very little more for his board than he had
that first week in which he swept out Colonel Carvel's store.He
was superintendent, now, of Mr.Davitt's Sunday School, and a church
officer.At night, when he came home from business, he would read the
widow's evening paper, and the Colonel's morning paper at the office.Of
true Puritan abstemiousness, his only indulgence was chewing tobacco.It was as early as 1859 that the teller of the Boatman's Bank began to
point out Mr.Hopper's back to casual customers, and he was more than
once seen to enter the president's room, which had carpet on the floor.Eliphalet's suavity with certain delinquent customers from the Southwest
was A wording to Scripture.When they were profane, and invited him
into the street, he reminded them that the city had a police force and a
jail.While still a young man, he had a manner of folding his hands
and smiling which is peculiar to capitalists, and he knew the laws
concerning mortgages in several different states.But Eliphalet was content still to remain in the sphere in which
Providence had placed him, and so to be an example for many of us.He did not buy, or even hire, an evening suit.He was pleased to
superintend some of the details for a dance at Christmas-time before
Virginia left Monticello, but he sat as usual on the stair-landing.Jacob Cluyme (who had been that day in conversation with
the teller of the Boatman's Bank) chanced upon him.Cluyme was so
charmed at the facility with which Eliphalet recounted the rise and fall
of sugar and cotton and wheat that he invited Mr.And
from this meal may be reckoned the first appearance of the family of
which Eliphalet Hopper was the head into polite society.If the Cluyme
household was not polite, it was nothing.Eliphalet sat next to Miss
Belle, and heard the private history of many old families, which he
cherished for future use.Cluyme apologized for the dinner, which
(if the truth were told) needed an apology.All of which is significant,
but sordid and uninteresting.Jacob Cluyme usually bought stocks before
a rise.There was only one person who really bothered Eliphalet as he rose into
prominence, and that person was Captain Elijah Brent.If, upon entering
the ground-glass office, he found Eliphalet without the Colonel,
Captain Lige would walk out again just as if the office were empty.The
inquiries he made were addressed always to Ephum.Hopper
had bidden him good morning and pushed a chair toward him, the honest
Captain had turned his back and marched straight to the house or Tenth
Street, where he found the Colonel alone at breakfast."Colonel," said he, without an introduction."I don't like this here
business of letting Hopper run your store."Lige," he said gently, "he's nearly doubled my income.It isn't the old
times, when we all went our own way and kept our old customers year in
and year out.The Captain took a deep draught of the coffee which Jackson had laid
before him."Colonel Carvel," he said emphatically, "the fellow's a damned rascal,
and will ruin you yet if you don't take advice.""The books show that he's honest, Lige.""Yes," cried Lige, with his fist on the table.But
if that fellow ever gets on top of you, or any one else, he'll grind you
into dust.""He isn't likely to get on top of me, Lige.I know the business, and
keep watch.And now that Jinny's coming home from Monticello, I feel
that I can pay more attention to her--kind of take her mother's place,"
said the Colonel, putting on his felt hat and tipping his chair."Lige,
I want that girl to have every advantage.She ought to go to Europe and
see the world.That trip East last summer did her a heap of good.When
we were at Calvert House, Dan read her something that my grandfather had
written about London, and she was regularly fired.First I must take
her to the Eastern Shore to see Carvel Hall.The Captain walked over to the window, and said nothing.He did not see
the searching gray eyes of his old friend upon him."Lige, why don't you give up steamboating and come along to Europe?You're not forty yet, and you have a heap of money laid by."The Captain shook his head with the vigor that characterized him."This ain't no time for me to leave," he said."Colonel; I tell you
there's a storm comin'."The Colonel pulled his goatee uneasily.Here, at last, was a man in whom
there was no guile."Lige," he said, "isn't it about time you got married?"Upon which the Captain shook his head again, even with more vigor.After the Christmas holidays he had
driven Virginia across the frozen river, all the way to Monticello, in a
sleigh.It was night when they had reached the school, the light of its
many windows casting long streaks on the snow under the trees.He had
helped her out, and had taken her hand as she stood on the step."Be good, Jinny," he had said."Remember what a short time it will be
until June.And your Pa will come over to see you."She had seized him by the buttons of his great coat, and said tearfully:
"O Captain Lige!I shall be so lonely when you are away.He had put his lips to her forehead, driven madly back to Alton, and
spent the night.The first thing he did the next day when he reached
St.Louis was to go straight to the Colonel and tell him bluntly of the
circumstance."Lige, I'd hate to give her up," Mr.Carvel said; "but I'd rather you'd
marry her than any man I can think of."SIGNS OF THE TIMES

In that spring of 1860 the time was come for the South to make her
final stand.And as the noise of gathering conventions shook the ground,
Stephen Brice was not the only one who thought of the Question at
Freeport.The hour was now at hand for it to bear fruit.Meanwhile, his hero, the hewer of rails and forger of homely speech,
Abraham Lincoln, had made a little tour eastward the year before, and
had startled Cooper Union with a new logic and a new eloquence.They
were the same logic and the same eloquence which had startled Stephen.Even as he predicted who had given it birth, the Question destroyed the
great Democratic Party.Colonel Carvel travelled to the convention in
historic Charleston soberly and fearing God, as many another Southern
gentleman.In old Saint Michael's they knelt to pray for harmony, for
peace; for a front bold and undismayed toward those who wronged them.All through the week chosen orators wrestled in vain.Judge Douglas,
you flattered yourself that you had evaded the Question.Do you see
the Southern delegates rising in their seats?Alabama leaves the hall,
followed by her sister stakes.The South has not forgotten your Freeport
Heresy.Once she loved you now she will have none of you.Gloomily, indeed, did Colonel Carvel return home.He loved the Union and
the flag for which his grandfather Richard had fought so bravely.So the Judge, laying his hand upon the knee
of his friend, reminded him gravely.The
very calmness of their argument had been portentous.You of the North are bent upon taking away from us the
rights we had when our fathers framed the Constitution.However the
<DW65> got to this country, sir, in your Bristol and Newport traders, as
well as in our Virginia and Maryland ships, he is here, and he was here
when the Constitution was written.He is happier in slavery than are
your factory hands in New England; and he is no more fit to exercise the
solemn rights of citizenship, I say, than the halfbreeds in the South
American states.""Suppose you deprive me of my few slaves, you do not ruin me.Yet you
do me as great a wrong as you do my friend Samuels, of Louisiana, who
depends on the labor of five hundred.Shall I stand by selfishly and see
him ruined, and thousands of others like him?"Profoundly depressed, Colonel Carvel did not attend the adjourned
Convention at Baltimore, which split once more on Mason and Dixon's
line.The Democrats of the young Northwest stood for Douglas and
Johnson, and the solid South, in another hall, nominated Breckenridge
and Lane.This, of course, became the Colonel's ticket.What a Babel of voices was raised that summer!Each with its cure
for existing ills.Between the extremes of the Black Republican
<DW64> Worshippers and the Southern Rights party of Breckenridge, your
conservative had the choice of two candidates,--of Judge Douglas
or Senator Bell.A most respectable but practically extinct body of
gentlemen in ruffled shirts, the Old Line Whigs, had likewise met
in Baltimore.A new name being necessary, they called themselves
Constitutional Unionists Senator Bell was their candidate, and they
proposed to give the Nation soothing-syrup.So said Judge Whipple,
with a grunt of contempt, to Mr.Cluyme, who was then a prominent
Constitutional Unionist.Other and most estimable gentlemen were also
Constitutional Unionists, notably Mr.Far be it from
any one to cast disrespect upon the reputable members of this party,
whose broad wings sheltered likewise so many weak brethren.One Sunday evening in May, the Judge was taking tea with Mrs.The occasion was memorable for more than one event--which was that he
addressed Stephen by his first name for the first time."You're an admirer of Abraham Lincoln," he had said.Whipple's ways, smiled quietly at his mother.He had never dared mention to the Judge his suspicions concerning his
journey to Springfield and Freeport."Stephen," said the Judge (here the surprise came in), "Stephen, what do
you think of Mr."We hear of no name but Seward's, sir," said Stephen, When he had
recovered."Do you think that Lincoln would make a good President?""I have thought so, sir, ever since you were good enough to give me the
opportunity of knowing him."It was a bold speech--the Judge drew his great eyebrows together, but he
spoke to Mrs."I'm not as strong as I was once, ma'am," said he."And yet I am going
to that Chicago convention."Brice remonstrated mildly, to the effect that he had done his share
of political work."I shall take a younger man with me, in case anything happens.In fact,
ma'am, I had thought of taking your son, if you can spare him."And so it was that Stephen went to that most dramatic of political
gatherings,--in the historic Wigwam.It was so that his eyes were
opened to the view of the monster which maims the vitality of the
Republic,--the political machine.Seward had brought his machine
from New York,--a legion prepared to fill the Wigwam with their bodies,
and to drown with their cries all names save that of their master.Through the kindness of Judge
Whipple he heard many quiet talks between that gentleman and delegates
from other states--Pennsylvania and Illinois and Indiana and elsewhere.He perceived that the Judge was no nonentity in this new party.Whipple sat in his own room, and the delegates came and ranged
themselves along the bed.Late one night, when the delegates were gone,
Stephen ventured to speak what was in his mind.Lincoln did not strike me as the kind of man, sir; who would permit
a bargain."Lincoln's at home playing barn-ball," said the Judge, curtly."Then," said Stephen, rather hotly, "I think you are unfair to him.""Stephen, I hope that politics may be a little cleaner when you become
a delegate," he answered, with just the suspicion of a smile."Supposing
you are convinced that Abraham Lincoln is the only man who can save the
Union, and supposing that the one way to get him nominated is to meet
Seward's gang with their own methods, what would you do, sir?I want
a practical proposition, sir," said Mr.Whipple, "one that we can use
to-night.As Stephen was silent, the Judge advised him to go to bed.Seward's henchmen, confident and uproarious, were
parading the streets of Chicago with their bands and their bunting, the
vast Wigwam was quietly filling up with bony Westerners whose ally was
none other than the state of Pennsylvania.These gentlemen possessed
wind which they had not wasted in processions.And the Lord delivered
Seward and all that was his into their hands.Seward's hope went out after the first ballot,
and how some of the gentlemen attached to his person wept; and how the
voices shook the Wigwam, and the thunder of the guns rolled over the
tossing water of the lake, many now living remember.That day a name was
delivered to the world through the mouths political schemers which was
destined to enter history that of the saviour of the Nation.Down in little Springfield, on a vacant lot near the station, a tall
man in his shirt sleeves was playing barn-ball with some boys.The game
finished, he had put on his black coat and was starting homeward under
the tree--when a fleet youngster darted after him with a telegram.The
tall man read it, and continued on his walk his head bent and his feet
taking long strides, Later in the day he was met by a friend."Abe," said the friend, "I'm almighty glad there somebody in this town's
got notorious at last."In the early morning of their return from Chicago Judge Whipple
and Stephen were standing in the front of a ferry-boat crossing the
Mississippi.The Judge had taken off his hat,
and his gray hair was stirred by the river breeze.Illness had set
a yellow seal on the face, but the younger man remarked it not.For
Stephen, staring at the black blur of the city outline, was filled
with a strange exaltation which might have belonged to his Puritan
forefathers.Now at length was come his chance to be of use in life,--to
dedicate the labor of his hands and of his brains to Abraham Lincoln
uncouth prophet of the West.With all his might he would work to save
the city for the man who was the hope of the Union.The great paddles scattered the brow waters with white
foam, and the Judge voiced his thoughts."Stephen," said he, "I guess we'll have to put on shoulders to the wheel
this summer.If Lincoln is not elected I have lived my sixty-five years
for nothing."As he descended the plank, he laid a hand on Stephen's arm, and
tottered.The big Louisiana, Captain Brent's boat, just in from New
Orleans, was blowing off her steam as with slow steps they climbed the
levee and the steep pitch of the street beyond it.The clatter of hooves
and the crack of whips reached their ears, and, like many others before
them and since, they stepped into Carvel & Company's.On the inside of
the glass partition of the private office, a voice of great suavity was
heard.It was Eliphalet Hopper's."If you will give me the numbers of the bales, Captain Brent, I'll send
a dray down to your boat and get them.""No, sir, I prefer to do business with my friend, Colonel Carvel."I could sell the goods to Texas buyers who are here in the store right
now.""Until I get instructions from one of the concern," vowed Captain Lige,
"I shall do as I always have done, sir.The Captain's fist was heard to come down on the desk."You don't manage me," he said, "and I reckon you don't manage the
Colonel."Hopper's face was not pleasant to see as he emerged.But at sight of
Judge Whipple on the steps his suavity returned."The Colonel will be in any minute, sir," said he.But the Judge walked past him without reply, and into the office.Captain Brent, seeing him; sprang to his feet."Well, well, Judge," said he, heartily, "you fellows have done it now,
sure.I'll say this for you, you've picked a smart man.""Better vote for him, Lige," said the Judge, setting down."A man's got a lot of choice this year;" said he."Two governments,
thirty-three governments, one government patched up for a year ox two.""Lige, you're not such a fool as
to vote against the Union?""Judge," said the Captain, instantly, "I'm not the only one in this town
who will have to decide whether my sympathies are wrong."It's not a question of sympathy, Captain," answered the Judge, dryly."Abraham Lincoln himself was born in Kentucky."If Abraham Lincoln is elected, the South
leaves this Union."The speaker was Colonel Carvel
himself.Whipple cried hotly, "then you will be chastised
and brought back.For at last we have chosen a man who is strong
enough,--who does not fear your fire-eaters,--whose electors depend on
Northern votes alone."Stephen rose apprehensively, So did Captain Lige The Colonel had taken a
step forward, and a fire was quick to kindle in his gray eyes.Judge Whipple, deathly pale, staggered and fell into
Stephen' arms.But it was the Colonel who laid him on the horsehair
sofa.Nor could the two who listened sound the depth of the pathos the Colonel
put into those two words.And the brusqueness in his weakened voice
was even more pathetic-- "Tut, tut," said he."A little heat, and no
breakfast."The Colonel already had a bottle of the famous Bourbon day his hand,
and Captain Lige brought a glass of muddy iced water.Carvel made an
injudicious mixture of the two, and held it to the lips of his friend.cried the Judge, and with this effort he slipped back again.Those
who stood there thought that the stamp of death was already on Judge
Whipple's face.But the lips were firmly closed, bidding defiance, as ever, to the
world.The Colonel, stroking his goatee, regarded him curiously."Silas," he said slowly, "if you won't drink it for me, perhaps you will
drink it--for--Abraham--Lincoln."The two who watched that scene have never forgotten it.Outside, in the
great cool store, the rattle of the trucks was heard, and Mr.The straight figure of the Colonel
towered above the sofa while he waited.Once Judge
Whipple's bony hand opened and shut, and once his features worked.Then,
without warning, he sat up."Colonel," said he, "I reckon I wouldn't be much use to Abe if I took
that.But if you'll send Ephum after, cup of coffee--"

Mr.In two strides he had reached the door
and given the order.Then he came hack and seated himself on the sofa.He had forgotten the convention
He told her what had happened at Mr.Carvel's store, and how the Colonel
had tried to persuade Judge Whipple to take the Glencoe house while he
was in Europe, and how the Judge had refused.Tears were in the widow's
eyes when Stephen finished."And he means to stay here in the heat and go through, the campaign?""It will kill him, Stephen," Mrs.And he said that he would die willingly--after
Abraham Lincoln was elected.He had nothing to live for but to fight for
that.He had never understood the world, and had quarrelled with at all
his life."He didn't dare to look at his mother, nor she at him.And when he
reached the office, half an hour later, Mr.Whipple was seated in his
chair, defiant and unapproachable.Stephen sighed as he settled down to
his work.The thought of one who might have accomplished what her father
could not was in his head.Brinsmade's buggy drew up at Mrs.The Brinsmade family had been for some time in the country.And
frequently, when that gentleman was detained in town by business, he
would stop at the little home for tea.The secret of the good man's
visit came out as he sat with them on the front steps afterward."I fear that it will be a hot summer, ma'am," he had said to Mrs."The heat agrees with me remarkably, Mr.Brinsmade," said the lady,
smiling."I have heard that Colonel Carvel wishes to rent his house at Glencoe,"
Mr.Brinsmade continued, "The figure is not high.""It struck me that a change of air would do you
good, Mrs.Knowing that you shared in our uneasiness
concerning Judge Whipple, I thought--"

He stopped, and looked at her.It was a hard task even for that best
and roost tactful of gentlemen, Mr.He too had misjudged this
calm woman.She saw, as did Stephen,
the kindness behind the offer--Colonel Carvel's kindness and his own.The gentleman's benevolent face brightened:

"And, my dear Madam, do not let the thought of this little house trouble
you.It was never my expectation to have it occupied in the summer.If
we could induce the Judge to go to Glencoe with you for the summer; I am
sure it would be a relief for us all."He did not press the matter; but begged Stephen to call on him in a day
or two, at the bank."What do you think, Stephen," asked his mother, when Mr.Brinsmade was
gone, Stephen did not reply at once.The
vision of that proud figure of Miss Virginia was before him, and he
revolted.What was kindness from Colonel Carvel and Mr.Brinsmade was
charity from her.He could not bear the thought of living in a house
haunted by her.And yet why should he let his pride and his feelings
stand in the way of the health--perhaps of the life--of Judge Whipple?It was characteristic of his mothers strength of mind not to mention the
subject again that evening.But
when he rose in the morning he had made up his mind.After breakfast he
went straight to the Colonel's store, and fortunately found.Carvel
at his desk, winding up his affairs.The next morning, when the train for the East pulled out of
Illinoistown, Miss Jinny Carvel stood on the plat form tearfully waving
good-by to a knot of friends.Presently she
went into the sleeping-car to join the Colonel, who wore a gray liners
duster.For a long time she sat gazing at the young, corn waving on
the prairie, fingering the bunch of June roses on her lap.Clarence had
picked them only a few hours ago, in the dew at Bellegarde.She saw her
cousin standing disconsolate under the train sheds, just as she had left
him.She pictured him riding out the Bellefontaine Road that afternoon,
alone.Now that the ocean was to be between them, was it love that she
felt for Clarence at last?Once or twice she
had suspected him of wishing to separate them.Her Aunt Lillian, indeed,
had said as much, and Virginia had silenced her.But when she had asked
the Colonel to take Clarence to Europe, he had refused.And yet she knew
that he had begged Captain Lige to go.She had seen the change in
Clarence and exulted.The very first day she had surprised him on the
porch at Bellegarde with "Hardee's tactics".From a boy Clarence had
suddenly become a man with a Purpose,--and that was the Purpose of the
South."They have dared to nominate that dirty Lincoln," he said.--"Do you
think that we will submit to <DW65> equality rule?"If they elect him, I will stand and fight them until my legs
are shot from under me, and then I will shoot down the Yankees from the
ground."Virginia's heart had leaped within her at the words, and into her eyes
had flashed once more the look for which the boy had waited and hoped in
vain.He had the carriage of a soldier, the animation and endurance
of the thoroughbred when roused.He was of the stuff that made the
resistance of the South the marvel of the world.And well we know,
whatever the sound of it, that his speech was not heroics.Nor was it
love for his cousin that inspired it, save in this: he had apotheosized
Virginia.To him she was the inspired goddess of the South--his country.His admiration and affection had of late been laid upon an altar.Her
ambition for him he felt was likewise the South's ambition for him.His mother, Virginia's aunt, felt this too, and strove against it with
her feeble might.She never had had power over her son; nor over any
man, save the temporal power of beauty.And to her mortification she
found herself actually in fear of this girl who might have been her
daughter.So in Virginia's presence she became more trivial and petty
than ever.It had of course been a foregone conclusion that Clarence should join
Company A. Few young men of family did not.And now he ran to his room
to don for Virginia that glorious but useless full dress,--the high
bearskin rat, the red pigeon-tailed coat, the light blue trousers, and
the gorgeous, priceless shackle.He
held his big rifle like a veteran, and his face was set with a high
resolve there was no mistaking.The high color of her pride was on the
cheek of the girl as he brought his piece to the salute of her, his
mistress.And yet, when he was gone, and she sat alone amid the roses
awaiting him, came wilfully before her another face that was relentless
determination,--the face of Stephen Brice, as he had stood before her
in the summer house at Glencoe.Strive as she might against the thought,
deny it to herself and others, to Virginia Carvel his way become the
face of the North.Her patriotism and all that was in her of race
rebelled.To conquer that face she would have given her own soul, and
Clarence's.Angrily she had arisen and paced the garden walks, and cried
out aloud that it was not inflexible.And now, by the car window, looking out over the endless roll of the
prairie, the memory of this was bitter within her."Did you rent our house at Glencoe?"Brice was too proud to accept it at your charitable rent,
even to save Mr.The Colonel turned to his daughter in mild surprise.She was leaning
back on the seat, her eyes half closed."Once you dislike a person, Jinny, you never get over it.I always had
a fancy for the young man, and now I have a better opinion of him than
ever before.It was I who insulted them by naming that rent."'Colonel Carvel,' said he,
'I hear you wish to rent your house.''You rented it once
before, sir,' said he.'May I ask you what price you got
for it?'"I told him," said the Colonel, smiling."But I explained that I could
not expect to command that price now on short notice.He replied that
they would pay it, or not consider the place."Virginia turned her head away and stared out over the fields.Brinsmade tells me that young Brice won rather a remarkable case
last winter, and since then has had some practice.I believe he declined some sort of an editorial
position, preferring to remain at the law.""And so they are going into the house?""Whipple refused point-blank to go to the
country.He said that he would be shirking the only work of his life
likely to be worth anything.CHAPTER X. RICHTER'S SCAR

This was the summer when Mr.Stephen Brice began to make his appearance
in public.The very first was rather encouraging than otherwise,
although they were not all so.It was at a little town on the outskirts
of the city where those who had come to scoff and jeer remained to
listen.In writing that speech Stephen had striven to bear in mind a piece of
advice which Mr."Speak so that the lowest may
understand, and the rest will have no trouble."At
the halting lameness of the beginning an egg was thrown,--fortunately
wide of the mark.After this incident Stephen fairly astonished his
audience,--especially an elderly gentleman who sat on a cracker-box in
the rear, out of sight of the stand.This may have been Judge Whipple,
although we have no proof of the fact.Stephen himself would not have claimed originality for that speech.He
laughs now when it is spoken of, and calls it a boyish effort, which it
was.I have no doubt that many of the master's phrases slipped in, as
young Mr.Brice could repeat most of the Debates, and the Cooper Union
speech by heart.He had caught more than the phrasing, however.So
imbued was he with the spirit of Abraham Lincoln that his hearers caught
it; and that was the end of the rotten eggs and the cabbages.The event
is to be especially noted because they crowded around him afterward to
ask questions.For one thing, he had not mentioned abolition.Wasn't it
true, then, that this Lincoln wished to tear the <DW64> from his master,
give him a vote and a subsidy, and set him up as the equal of the man
that owned him?"Slavery may stay where it is," cried the young orator."If it is content there, so are we content.What we say is that it shall
not go one step farther.No, not one inch into a northern territory."Brice was one of the orators at a much larger
meeting in a garden in South St.And this was even a happier event, inasmuch as Mr.Brice was able to
trace with some skill the history of the Fatherland from the Napoleonic
wars to its Revolution.Incidentally he told them why they had emigrated
to this great and free country.And when in an inspired moment he
coupled the names of Abraham Lincoln and Father Jahn, the very leaves of
the trees above them trembled at their cheers.And afterwards there was a long-remembered supper in the moonlit grove
with Richter and a party of his college friends from Jena.There was
Herr Tiefel with the little Dresden-blue eyes, red and round and jolly;
and Hauptmann, long and thin and sallow; and Korner, redbearded and
ponderous; and Konig, a little clean-cut man with a blond mustache
that pointed upward.They clattered their steins on the table and sang
wonderful Jena songs, while Stephen was lifted up and his soul carried
off to far-away Saxony,--to the clean little University town with
its towers and crooked streets.And when they sang the Trolksmelodie,
"Bemooster Bursche zieh' ich aus,--Ade!"a big tear rolled down the scar
on Richter's cheek."Fahrt wohl, ihr Strassen grad and krumm
        Ich zieh' nicht mehr in euch herum,
        Durchton euch nicht mehr mit Gesang,
        Mit Larm nicht mehr and Sporenklang."As the deep tones died away, the soft night was steeped in the sadness
of that farewell song.It was Richter who brought the full force of it
home to Stephen."Do you recall the day you left your Harvard, and your Boston, my
friend?"He had never spoken of the bitterness of that, even
to his mother.And here was the difference between the Saxon and the
Anglo-Saxon.Richter smoked his pipe'mid dreamy silence, the tear still wet upon his
face."Tiefel and I were at the University together," he said at length."He
remembers the day I left Jena for good and all.Ah, Stephen, that is
the most pathetic thing in life, next to leaving the Fatherland.We
dine with our student club for the last time at the Burg Keller, a dingy
little tavern under a grim old house, but very dear to us.We swear for
the last time to be clean and honorable and patriotic, and to die for
the Fatherland, if God so wills.And then we march at the head of a slow
procession out of the old West Gate, two and two, old members first,
then the fox major and the foxes.""The youngsters--the freshmen, you call them," answered Richter,
smiling."And after the foxes," said Herr Tiefel, taking up the story, "after the
foxes comes the empty carriage, with its gay postilion and four.And so we go
slowly until we; come to the Oil Mill Tavern, where we have had many
a schlager-bout with the aristocrats.And the president of our society
makes his farewell speech under the vines, and we drink to you with all
the honors.And we drank to you, Carl, renowned swordsman!"And Herr
Tiefel, carried away by the recollection, rose to his feet.The others caught fire, and stood up with their mugs high in the air,
shouting:

"Lebe wohl, Carl!Salamander, salamander, salamander!Ein ist
ein, zwei ist zwei, drei ist drei!And so they toasted every man present, even Stephen himself, whom they
complimented on his speech.And he soon learned to cry Salamander,
and to rub his mug on the table, German fashion.He was not long in
discovering that Richter was not merely a prime favorite with his
companions, but likewise a person of some political importance in South
St.In the very midst of their merriment an elderly man whom
Stephen recognized as one of the German leaders (he afterwards became a
United States general) came and stood smiling by the table and joined in
the singing.But presently he carried Richter away with him."What a patriot he would have made, had our country been spared to us!""I think he was the best man with the Schlager
that Jena ever saw.Even Korner likes not to stand against him in mask
and fencing hat, all padded.Herr Korner gave a good-natured growl of assent."I have still a welt that he gave me a month since," he said."He has
left his mark on many an aristocrat.""And why did you always fight the aristocrats?"They all tried to tell him at once, but Tiefel prevailed."Because they were for making our country Austrian, my friend," he
cried."Because they were overbearing, and ground the poor.Because the
most of them were immoral like the French, and we knew that it must be
by morality and pure living that our 'Vaterland' was to be rescued.And
so we formed our guilds in opposition to theirs.We swore to live by the
standards of the great Jahn, of whom you spoke.We swore to strive for
the freedom of Germany with manly courage.And when we were not duelling
with the nobles, we had Schlager-bouts among ourselves.""Ja wohl," answered Korner, puffing heavily.The slit in his nose was
plain even in the moonlight."To keep our hands in, as you would say.You Americans are a brave people--without the Schlager.But we fought
that we might not become effete."It was then that Stephen ventured to ask a question that, had been long
burning within him.Korner," said he, "how did Richter come by that scar?He
always gets red when I mention it."Ah, I can well believe that," answered Korner."I will recount that
matter,--if you do not tell Carl, lieber Freund.Brice," Herr Korner continued, "has never heard of the Count von
Kalbach.We at Jena had, and all Germany.Many of us of
the Burschenschaft will bear to the grave the marks of his Schlager.Von
Kalbach went to Bonn, that university of the aristocrats, where he was
worshipped.When he came to Berlin with his sister, crowds would gather
to look at them.exclaimed
Herr Korner, "there is something in blood, when all is said.He was as
straight and strong as an oak of the Black Forest, and she as fair as a
poplar.It is so with the Pomeranians."It was in the year '47, when Carl Richter was gone home to Berlin
before his last semester, to see his father: One fine morning von
Kalbach rode in at the Brandenburg gate on a great black stallion.He
boasted openly that day that none of the despised 'Burschenschaft' dare
stand before him.Before night
all Berlin had heard of the temerity of the young Liberal of the Jena
'Burschenschaft'.To our shame be it said, we who knew and loved Carl
likewise feared for him."Carl chose for his second Ebhardt, a man of our own Germanian Club at
Jena, since killed in the Breite Strasse.And if you will believe me,
my friend.I tell you that Richter came to the glade at daybreak
smoking his pipe.The place was filled, the nobles on one side and
the Burschenschaft on the other, and the sun coming up over the trees.Richter would not listen to any of us, not even the surgeon.He would
not have the silk wound on his arm, nor the padded breeches, nor the
neck covering--Nothing!So Ebhardt put on his gauntlets and peaked cap,
and his apron with the device of the Germanians."There stood the Count in his white shirt in the pose of a statue.And
when it was seen that Richter likewise had no protection, but was calmly
smoking the little short pipe, with a charred bowl, a hush fell upon
all.At the sight of the pipe von Kalbach ground his heel in the turf,
and when the word was given he rushed at Richter like a wild beast.You,
my friend, who have never heard the whistle of sharp Schlager cannot
know the song which a skilled arm draws from the blade.It was music
that morning: You should have seen the noble's mighty strokes--'Prim und
Second und Terz und Quart'.You would have marked how Richter met him
at every blow.Von Kalbach never once took his eyes from the blue smoke
from the bowl.He was terrible in his fury, and I shiver now to think
how we of the Burschenschaft trembled when we saw that our champion was
driven back a step, and then another.You must know that it is a lasting
disgrace to be forced over one's own line.It seemed as if we could not
bear the agony.And then, while we counted out the last seconds of the
half, came a snap like that of a whip's lash, and the bowl of Richter's
pipe lay smouldering on the grass.The noble had cut the stem as clean
as it were sapling twig, and there stood Richter with the piece still
clenched in his teeth, his eyes ablaze, and his cheek running blood.He
pushed the surgeon away when he came forward with his needles.The Count
was smiling as he put up his sword, his friends crowding around
him, when Ebhardt cried out that his man could fight the second
mensur,--though the wound was three needles long.Then Kalbach cried
aloud that he would kill him.Something
was in them that made us think as we washed the cut.But when we spoke
to him he said nothing.Nor could we force the pipe stems from his
teeth.exclaimed Herr Korner, but reverently, "if I live to a
hundred I never hope to see such a sight as that 'Mensur'.The Schlager flew so fast that we only saw the light and heard
the ring alone.Before we of the Burschenschaft knew what had happened
the Count von Kalbach was over his line and had flung his Schlager into
a great tree, and was striding from the place with his head hung and the
tears streamin down his face."Amid a silence, Herr Korner lifted his great mug and emptied it slowly.A wind was rising, bearing with it song and laughter from distant
groups,--Teutonic song and, laughter.The moonlight trembled through the
shifting leaves.And Stephen was filled with a sense of the marvelous.It was as if this fierce duel, so full of national significance to a
German, had been fought in another existence, It was incredible to him
that the unassuming lawyer he knew, so wholly Americanized, had been the
hero of it.Strange, indeed, that the striving life of these leaders of
European Revolution had been suddenly cut off in its vigor.There
came to Stephen a flash of that world-comprehension which marks great
statesmen.Was it not with a divine purpose that this measureless force
of patriotism and high ideal had been given to this youngest of the
nations, that its high mission might be fulfilled?She and her brothers and Jack
Brinsmade used to banter him when he came a-visiting in Bellefontaine
Road.The time was not yet come when neighbor stared coldly upon
neighbor, when friends of long standing passed each other with averted
looks.It was not even a wild dream that white-trash Lincoln would be
elected.Jack, who made speeches for Breckenridge in the face
of Mr.Brinsmade's Union leanings, laughed at Stephen when he came to
spend the night.He joined forces with Puss in making clever fun of the
booby Dutch, which Stephen was wise enough to take good-naturedly.But
once or twice when he met Clarence Colfax at these houses he was aware
of a decided change in the attitude of that young gentleman.This
troubled him more than he cared to admit.For he liked Clarence, who
reminded him of Virginia--at once a pleasure and a pain.It is no harm to admit (for the benefit of the Society for Psychical
Research) that Stephen still dreamed of her.He would go about his work
absently all the morning with the dream still in his head, and the girl
so vividly near him that he could not believe her to be travelling in
England, as Miss Russell said.Puss and Anne were careful to keep him
informed as to her whereabouts.Stephen set this down as a most natural
supposition on their part that all young men must have an interest in
Virginia Carvel.How needless to add that Virginia in her correspondence never mentioned
Stephen, although Puss in her letters took pains to record the fact
every time that he addressed a Black Republican meeting: Miss Carvel
paid no attention to this part of the communications.Her concern for
Judge Whipple Virginia did not hide.How he stood the
rigors of that campaign were a mystery to friend and foe alike.HOW A PRINCE CAME

Who has not heard of the St.And what memories
of its October days the mere mention of at brings back to us who knew
that hallowed place as children.There was the vast wooden amphitheatre
where mad trotting races were run; where stolid cattle walked past the
Chinese pagoda in the middle circle, and shook the blue ribbons on their
horns.But it was underneath the tiers of seats (the whole way around
the ring) that the chief attractions lay hid.These were the church
booths, where fried oysters and sandwiches and cake and whit candy and
ice-cream were sold by your mothers and sister for charity.These ladies
wore white aprons as they waited on the burly farmers.And toward the
close of the day for which they had volunteered they became distracted.Thayer's,
Unitarian, where Mrs.Davitt's, conducted
by Mr.Eliphalet Hopper on strictly business principles, and the Roman
Catholic Cathedral, where Miss Renault and other young ladies of French
descent presided: and Dr.Posthelwaite's, Presbyterian, which we shall
come to presently.And others, the whole way around the ring.Louisans still delight to recall,--that
of the autumn of 1860--Think for a minute.You will remember that
Virginia Carvel came back from Europe; and made quite a stir in a
town where all who were worth knowing were intimates.Stephen caught a
glimpse of her an the street, received a distant bow, and dreamed of her
that night.Eliphalet Hopper, in his Sunday suit, was at the ferry
to pay his respects to the Colonel, to offer his services, and to
tell him how the business fared.Louis face that
Virginia saw (Captain Lige being in New Orleans), and if she conversed
with Eliphalet on the ferry with more warmth than ever before, there is
nothing strange in that.Hopper rode home with them in the carriage,
and walked to Miss Crane's with his heart thumping against his breast,
and wild thoughts whirling in his head.The next morning, in Virginia's sunny front room tears and laughter
mingled.There was a present for Eugenie and Anne and Emily and Puss
and Maude, and a hear kiss from the Colonel for each.And more tears
and laughter and sighs as Mammy Easter and Rosetta unpacked the English
trunks, and with trembling hands and rolling eyes laid each Parisian
gown upon the bed.At the thought of that glorious year my pen fails me.Why mention the
dread possibility of the <DW64>-worshiper Lincoln being elected the
very next month?Why listen, to the rumblings in the South?Pompeii had
chariot-races to the mutterings of Vesuvius.Louis was in gala garb
to greet a Prince.That was the year that Miss Virginia Carvel was given charge of the
booth in Dr.Posthelwaite's church,--the booth next one of the great
arches through which prancing horses and lowing cattle came.Now who do you think stopped at the booth for a chat with Miss Jinny?Who made her blush as pink as her Paris gown?Who slipped into her hand
the contribution for the church, and refused to take the cream candy she
laughingly offered him as an equivalent?None other than Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, Duke of Saxony, Duke of
Cornwall and Rothesay, Earl of Chester and Carrick, Baron Renfrew, and
Lord of the Isles.Out of compliment to the Republic which he visited,
he bore the simple title of Lord Renfrew.Bitter tears of envy, so it was said, were shed in the other booths.Belle Cluyme made a remark which is best suppressed.Eliphalet Hopper,
in Mr.Davitt's booths, stared until his eyes watered.A great throng
peered into the covered way, kept clear for his Royal Highness and
suite, and for the prominent gentlemen who accompanied them.And when
the Prince was seen to turn to His Grace, the Duke of Newcastle, and the
subscription was forthcoming, a great cheer shook the building, while
Virginia and the young ladies with her bowed and blushed and smiled.Colonel Carvel, who was a Director, laid his hand paternally on the
blue coat of the young Prince.Reversing all precedent, he presented
his Royal Highness to his daughter and to the other young ladies.It was
done with the easy grace of a Southern gentleman.Whereupon Lord Renfrew
bowed and smiled too, and stroked his mustache, which was a habit he
had, and so fell naturally into the ways of Democracy.Miss Puss Russell, who has another name, and whose hair is now white,
will tell you how Virginia carried off the occasion with credit to her
country.It is safe to say that the Prince forgot "Silver Heels" and "Royal Oak,"
although they had been trotted past the Pagoda only that morning for his
delectation.He had forgotten his Honor the Mayor, who had held fast to
the young man's arm as the four coal-black horses had pranced through
the crowds all the way from Barnum's Hotel to the Fair Grounds.His
Royal Highness forgot himself still further, and had at length withdrawn
his hands from the pockets of his ample pantaloons and thrust his thumbs
into his yellow waistcoat.And who shall blame him if Miss Virginia's
replies to his sallies enchained him?Not the least impressive of those who stood by, smiling, was the figure
of the tall Colonel, his hat off for once, and pride written on his
face.Oh, that his dear wife might have lived to see this!What was said in that historic interview with a future Sovereign of
England, far from his royal palaces, on Democratic sawdust, with an
American Beauty across a board counter, was immediately recorded by the
Colonel, together with an exact description of his Royal Highness's blue
coat, and light, flowing pantaloons, and yellow waist-coat, and 
kids; even the Prince's habit of stroking his mustache did not escape
the watchful eye.It is said that his Grace of Newcastle smiled twice at
Miss Virginia's retorts, and Lord Lyons, the British Minister, has more
than two to his credit.Miss
Virginia in the very midst of a sentence paused, and then stopped.Her
eyes had strayed from the Royal Countenance, and were fixed upon a
point in the row of heads outside the promenade.Her sentence was
completed--with some confusion.Perhaps it is no wonder that my Lord
Renfrew, whose intuitions are quick, remarked that he had already
remained too long, thus depriving the booth of the custom it otherwise
should have had.This was a graceful speech, and a kingly.Followed by
his retinue and the prominent citizens, he moved on.And it was remarked
by keen observers that his Honor the Mayor had taken hold once more of
the Prince's elbow, who divided his talk with Colonel Carver.What a true American of the old type you were.You,
nor the Mayor, nor the rest of the grave and elderly gentlemen were not
blinded by the light of a royal Presence.You saw in him only an amiable
and lovable young man, who was to succeed the most virtuous and lovable
of sovereigns, Victoria.You, Colonel Carvel, were not one to cringe to
royalty.Out of respect for the just and lenient Sovereign, his mother,
you did honor to the Prince.But you did not remind him, as you might
have, that your ancestors fought for the King at Marston Moor, and that
your grandfather was once an intimate of Charles James Fox.Cluyme, and of a few others whose wealth alone
enabled them to be Directors of the Fair?Miss Isabel Cluyme was duly
presented, in proper form, to his Royal Highness.Her father owned a
"peerage," and had been abroad likewise.He made no such bull as the
Colonel.And while the celebrated conversation of which we have spoken
was in progress, Mr.Cluyme stood back and blushed for his countryman,
and smiled apologetically at the few gentlemen of the royal suite who
glanced his way.His Royal Highness then proceeded to luncheon, which is described by a
most amiable Canadian correspondent who sent to his newspaper an account
of it that I cannot forbear to copy.You may believe what he says, or
not, just as you choose: "So interested was his Royal Highness in the
proceedings that he stayed in the ring three and a half hours witnessing
these trotting matches.He was invited to take lunch in a little wooden
shanty prepared for the Directors, to which he accordingly repaired, but
whether he got anything to eat or not, I cannot tell.After much trouble
he forced his way to the table, which he found surrounded by a lot of
ravenous animals.And upon some half dozen huge dishes were piled slices
of beef, mutton, and buffalo tongue; beside them were great jugs of
lager beer, rolls of bread, and plates of a sort of cabbage cut into
thin shreds, raw, and mixed with vinegar.There were neither salt spoons
nor mustard spoons, the knives the gentlemen were eating with serving in
their stead; and, by the aid of nature's forks, the slices of beef and
mutton were transferred to the plates of those who desired to eat.While
your correspondent stood looking at the spectacle, the Duke of Newcastle
came in, and he sat looking too.He was evidently trying to look
democratic, but could not manage it.By his side stood a man urging him
to try the lager beer, and cabbage also, I suppose.Henceforth, let the
New York Aldermen who gave to the Turkish Ambassador ham sandwiches and
bad sherry rest in peace."Even that great man whose memory we love and revere, Charles Dickens,
was not overkind to us, and saw our faults rather than our virtues.We
were a nation of grasshoppers, and spat tobacco from early morning until
late at night.This some of us undoubtedly did, to our shame be it
said.Dickens went down the Ohio, early in the '40's, he
complained of the men and women he met; who, bent with care, bolted
through silent meals, and retired within their cabins.Dickens
saw our ancestors bowed in a task that had been too great for other
blood,--the task of bringing into civilization in the compass of a
century a wilderness three thousand miles it breadth.And when his Royal
Highness came to St.Louis and beheld one hundred thousand people at the
Fair, we are sure that he knew how recently the ground he stood upon had
been conquered from the forest.For, while the Prince lingered
in front of the booth of Dr.Posthelwaite's church and chatted with
Virginia, a crowd had gathered without.They stood peering over the
barricade into the covered way, proud of the self-possession of their
young countrywoman.And here, by a twist of fate, Mr.Stephen Brice
found himself perched on a barrel beside his friend Richter.It was
Richter who discovered her first.It is Miss Carvel herself, Stephen," he cried, impatient at the
impassive face of his companion."Yes," said Stephen, "I see."exclaimed the disgusted German, "will nothing move you?I have
seen German princesses that are peasant women beside her.Stephen saw, and horror held him in a tremor.What if she should raise her eyes, and amid those vulgar stares
discern his own?And yet that was within him which told him that she
would look up.It was only a question of moments, and then,--and then
she would in truth despise him!Wedged tightly between the people, to
move was to be betrayed.Suddenly he rallied, ashamed of his own false shame.This was because
of one whom he had known for the short, space of a day--whom he was
to remember for a lifetime.The man he worshipped, and she detested.Abraham Lincoln would not have blushed between honest clerks and farmers
Why should Stephen Brice?And what, after all, was this girl to him?Almost the first day he had come to St.Louis the wires
of their lives had crossed, and since then had crossed many times again,
always with a spark.By the might of generations she was one thing, and
he another.They were separated by a vast and ever-widening breach only
to be closed by the blood and bodies of a million of their countrymen.Gradually, charmed like the simple people about him, Stephen became lost
in the fascination of the scene.Suddenly confronted at a booth in a
public fair with the heir to the English throne, who but one of her own
kind might have carried it off so well, have been so complete a mistress
of herself?Since, save for a heightened color, Virginia gave no sign of
excitement.Undismayed, forgetful of the admiring crowd, unconscious of
their stares until--until the very strength of his gaze had compelled
her own.Nor did he wonder
because, in that multitude of faces, her eyes had flown so straightly
homeward to his.With a rough effort that made an angry stir, Stephen flung the people
aside and escaped, the astonished Richter following in his wake.Nor
could the honest German dissuade him from going back to the office for
the rest of the day, or discover what had happened.But all through the afternoon that scene was painted on the pages of
Stephen's books.The free pose
of the girl standing in front of her companions, a blue wisp of autumn
sunlight falling at her feet.The young Prince laughing at her sallies,
and the elderly gentleman smiling with benevolence upon the pair.INTO WHICH A POTENTATE COMES

Virginia danced with the Prince, "by Special Appointment," at the ball
that evening.So likewise was Miss
Belle Cluyme among those honored and approved.But Virginia wore the
most beautiful of her Paris gowns, and seemed a princess to one watching
from the gallery.Stephen was sure that his Royal Highness made that
particular dance longer than the others.It was decidedly longer than
the one he had with Miss Cluyme, although that young lady had declared
she was in heaven.Alas, that princes cannot abide with us forever!His Royal Highness bade
farewell to St.Louis, and presently that same 'City of Alton' which
bore him northward came back again in like royal state, and this time it
was in honor of a Democrat potentate.He is an old friend now, Senator
and Judge and Presidential Candidate,--Stephen Arnold Douglas,--father
of the doctrine of Local Sovereignty, which he has come to preach.We are no sooner rid of one hero than we are ready for
another.Blow, you bandsmen on the hurricane deck, let the shores echo with your
national airs!Let the gay bunting wave in the river breeze!Uniforms
flash upon the guards, for no campaign is complete without the military.Here are brave companies of the Douglas Guards, the Hickory Sprouts, and
the Little Giants to do honor to the person of their hero.Cannon are
booming as he steps into his open carriage that evening on the levee,
where the piles of river freight are covered with people.Transparencies
are dodging in the darkness.A fresh band strikes up "Hail Columbia,"
and the four horses prance away, followed closely by the "Independent
Broom Rangers.""The shouts for Douglas," remarked a keen observer who
was present, "must have penetrated Abraham's bosom at Springfield."Jacob Cluyme, who had been a Bell and Everett man until that day,
was not the only person of prominence converted.After the speech he
assured the Judge that he was now undergoing the greatest pleasure of
his life in meeting the popular orator, the true representative man of
the Great West, the matured statesman, and the able advocate of national
principles.Douglas looked as if he had heard something
of the kind before, he pressed Mr.So was the author of Popular Sovereignty, "the great Bulwark of American
Independence," escorted to the Court House steps, past houses of his
stanch supporters; which were illuminated in his honor.Stephen,
wedged among the people, remarked that the Judge had lost none of his
self-confidence since that day at Freeport.Who, seeing the Democratic
candidate smiling and bowing to the audience that blocked the wide
square, would guess that the Question troubled him at all, or that he
missed the votes of the solid South?How gravely the Judge listened to
the eulogy of the prominent citizen, who reminded him that his work was
not yet finished, and that he still was harnessed to the cause of the
people!And how happy was the choice of that word harnessed!The Judge had heard (so he said) with deep emotion the remarks of the
chairman.Then followed one of those masterful speeches which wove a
spell about those who listened,--which, like the most popular of novels,
moved to laughter and to tears, to anger and to pity.Brice and
Mr Richter were not the only Black Republicans who were depressed that
night.And they trudged homeward with the wild enthusiasm still ringing
in their ears, heavy with the thought that the long, hot campaign of
their own Wide-Awakes might be in vain.They had a grim reproof from Judge Whipple in the morning."So you too, gentlemen, took opium last night," was all he said.Lincoln's election did not interfere with
the gayeties.Clarence Colfax gave a great
dance at Bellegarde, in honor of his cousin, Virginia, to which Mr.Virginia would have liked to have had them in uniform.It was at this time that Anne Brinsmade took the notion of having a ball
in costume.Virginia, on hearing the news, rode over from Bellegarde,
and flinging her reins to Nicodemus ran up to Anne's little
dressing-room.Anne ran over the long list of their acquaintance, but there was one
name she omitted.asked Virginia, searchingly, when she
had finished."I have invited Stephen Brice, Jinny," she said.Am I to be confronted with that
Yankee everywhere I go?It is always 'Stephen Brice', and he is ushered
in with a but."She had dignity, however, and
plenty of it."You have no right to criticise my guests, Virginia."Virginia, seated on the arm of a chair, tapped her foot on the floor."Why couldn't things remain as they were?""We were so happy
before these Yankees came.And they are not content in trying to deprive
us of our rights."Stephen Brice is a gentleman," answered Anne."He spoils no one's
pleasure, and goes no place that he is not asked.""He has not behaved according to my idea of a gentleman, the few
times that I have been unfortunate enough to encounter him," Virginia
retorted."You are the only one who says so, then."Here the feminine got the
better of Anne's prudence, and she added."I saw you waltz with him
once, Jinny Carvel, and I am sure you never enjoyed a dance as much in
your life.""You may have your ball, and your Yankees,
all of them you want.How I wish I had never seen
that horrid Stephen Brice!Virginia rose and snatched her riding-whip.She threw her arms around her friend without more ado."Don't quarrel with me, Jinny," she said tearfully.Brice is not coming, I am sure."And I was going on to
tell you that he could not come."She stopped, and stared at Virginia in bewilderment.That young lady,
instead of beaming, had turned her back.She stood flicking her whip at
the window, gazing out over the trees, down the <DW72> to the river."Because he is to be one of the speakers at a big meeting that night.Have you seen him since you got home, Jinny?We are much worried about him, because he has worked so hard this
summer."exclaimed Virginia, scornfully ignoring
the rest of what was said."Then I'll come, Anne dear," she cried,
tripping the length of the room.She cantered off down the drive and out of the gate, leaving a very
puzzled young woman watching her from the window.But when Virginia
reached the forest at the bend of the road, she pulled her horse down to
a walk.She bethought herself of the gown which her Uncle Daniel had sent her
from Calvert House, and of the pearls.And she determined to go as her
great-grandmother, Dorothy Carvel.How many readers will smile before the rest of this
true incident is told?Miss Anne Brinsmade had driven to town in
her mother's Jenny Lind a day or two before, and had stopped (as she
often did) to pay a call on Mrs.This lady, as may be guessed,
was not given to discussion of her husband's ancestors, nor of her
own.But on the walls of the little dining-room hung a Copley and two
Stuarts.One of the Stuarts was a full length of an officer in the buff
and blue of the Continental Army.And it was this picture which caught
Anne's eye that day."Colonel Wilton Brice, Stephen's grandfather.There is a marked
look about all the Brices.He was only twenty years of age when the
Revolution began.That picture was painted much later in life, after
Stuart came back to America, when the Colonel was nearly forty.He had
kept his uniform, and his wife persuaded him to be painted in it.""If Stephen would only come as Colonel Wilton Brice!""Do you
think he would, Mrs."I am afraid not, Anne," she said."I have a part of the uniform
upstairs, but I could never induce him even to try it on."As she drove from shop to shop that day, Anne reflected that it
certainly would not be like Stephen to wear his grandfather's uniform to
a ball.But she meant to ask him, at any rate.And she had driven home
immediately to write her invitations.It was with keen disappointment
that she read his note of regret.However, on the very day of the ball, Anne chanced to be in town again,
and caught sight of Stephen pushing his way among the people on Fourth
Street.She waved her hand to him, and called to Nicodemus to pull up at
the sidewalk."We are all so sorry that you are not coming," said she, impulsively.For Anne was a sincere person, and
remembered Virginia."That is, I am so sorry," she added, a little
hastily."Stephen, I saw the portrait of your grandfather, and I wanted
you to come in his costume."Stephen, smiling down on her, said nothing.And poor Anne, in her fear
that he had perceived the shade in her meaning, made another unfortunate
remark."If you were not a--a Republican--" she said."A Black Republican," he answered, and laughed at her discomfiture."I only meant that if you were not a Republican, there would be no
meeting to address that night.""It does not make any difference to you what my politics are, does it?""Some people have discarded me," he said, striving to smile.She wondered whether he meant Virginia, and whether he cared.Still
further embarrassed, she said something which she regretted immediately."Couldn't you contrive to come?""I will come, after the meeting, if it is not too late," he said at
length.He lifted his hat, and hurried on, leaving Anne in a quandary.Virginia was coming on
the condition that he was not to be there.Stephen, too, was almost instantly sorry that he had promised.The
little costumer's shop (the only one in the city at that time) had been
ransacked for the occasion, and nothing was left to fit him.But when he
reached home there was a strong smell of camphor in his mother's room.Colonel Brice's cocked hat and sword and spurs lay on the bed, and
presently Hester brought in the blue coat and buff waistcoat from the
kitchen, where she had been pressing them.Stephen must needs yield to
his mother's persuasions and try them on--they were more than a passable
fit.But there were the breeches and cavalry boots to be thought of, and
the ruffled shirt and the powdered wig.So before tea he hurried down
to the costumer's again, not quite sure that he was not making a fool
of himself, and yet at last sufficiently entered into the spirit of the
thing.The coat was mended and freshened.And when after tea he dressed
in the character, his appearance was so striking that his mother could
not refrain from some little admiration.As for Hester, she was in
transports.But still the frivolity of
it all troubled him.He had inherited from Colonel Wilton Brice, the
Puritan, other things beside clothes.And he felt in his heart as he
walked soberly to the hall that this was no time for fancy dress balls.All intention of going was banished by the time his turn had come to
speak.Not caring to sit out the
meeting on the platform, he made his way down the side of the crowded
hall, and ran into (of all people) big Tom Catherwood.As the Southern
Rights politics of the Catherwood family were a matter of note in the
city, Stephen did not attempt to conceal his astonishment.He congratulated Stephen on his speech, and
volunteered the news that he had come in a spirit of fairness to hear
what the intelligent leaders of the Republican party, such as Judge
Whipple, had to say.But the sight of him
started in Stephen a train of thought that closed his ears for once
to the Judge's words.He had had before a huge liking for Tom.Now he
admired him, for it was no light courage that took one of his position
there.And Stephen remembered that Tom was not risking merely the
displeasure of his family and his friends, but likewise something of
greater value than, either.From childhood Tom had been the devoted
slave of Virginia Carvel, with as little chance of marrying her as a man
ever had.And now he was endangering even that little alliance.And so Stephen began to think of Virginia, and to wonder what she would
wear at Anne's party; and to speculate how she would have treated him if
had gone.To speak truth, this last matter had no little weight in his
decision to stay away.But we had best leave motives to those whose
business and equipment it is to weigh to a grain.Since that agonizing
moment when her eyes had met his own among the curiously vulgar at the
Fair, Stephen's fear of meeting Virginia had grown to the proportions of
a terror.And yet there she was in his mind, to take possession of it on
the slightest occasion.When Judge Whipple had finished, Tom rose."Stephen," said he, "of course you're going to the Brinsmade's.""Why, then, you've got to come with me," says Tom, heartily."It isn't
too late, and they'll want you.I've a buggy, and I'm going to the
Russells' to change my clothes.BRINSMADE'S GATE

The eastern side of the Brinsmade house is almost wholly taken up by the
big drawing-room where Anne gave her fancy-dress ball.From the windows
might be seen, through the trees in the grounds, the Father of Waters
below.But the room is gloomy now, that once was gay, and a heavy coat
of soot is spread on the porch at the back, where the apple blossoms
still fall thinly in the spring.The huge black town has coiled about
the place the garden still struggles on, but the giants of the forest
are dying and dead.Bellefontaine Road itself, once the drive of
fashion, is no more.Trucks and cars crowd the streets which follow its
once rural windings, and gone forever are those comely wooded hills and
green pastures,--save in the memory of those who have been spared to
dream.Still the old house stands, begrimed but stately, rebuking the sordid
life around it.Still come into it the Brinsmades to marriage and to
death.Calvin Brinsmade took his
bride there.They sat on the porch in the morning light, harking to
the whistle of the quail in the corn, and watching the frightened deer
scamper across the open.Do you see the bride in her high-waisted gown,
and Mr.Calvin in his stock and his blue tail-coat and brass buttons?Old people will tell you of the royal hospitality then, of the famous
men and women who promenaded under those chandeliers, and sat down to
the game-laden table.In 1835 General Atkinson and his officers thought
nothing of the twenty miles from Jefferson Barracks below, nor of
dancing all night with the Louisville belles, who were Mrs.Thither came Miss Todd of Kentucky, long before she thought
of taking for a husband that rude man of the people, Abraham Lincoln.Foreigners of distinction fell in love with the place, with its
open-hearted master and mistress, and wrote of it in their journals.Would that many of our countrymen, who think of the West as rough, might
have known the quality of the Brinsmades and their neighbors!An era of charity, of golden simplicity, was passing on that October
night of Anne Brinsmade's ball.Those who made merry there were soon
to be driven and scattered before the winds of war; to die at Wilson's
Creek, or Shiloh, or to be spared for heroes of the Wilderness.Some
were to eke out a life of widowhood in poverty.All were to live
soberly, chastened by what they had seen.A fear knocked at Colonel
Carvel's heart as he stood watching the bright figures."Brinsmade," he said, "do you remember this room in May, '46?"Brinsmade, startled, turned upon him quickly."Why, Colonel, you have read my very thoughts," he said."Some of those
who were here then are--are still in Mexico.""And some who came home, Brinsmade, blamed God because they had not
fallen," said the Colonel."Hush, Comyn, His will be done," he answered; "He has left a daughter to
comfort you."In her gown of faded primrose
and blue with its quaint stays and short sleeves, she seemed to have
caught the very air of the decorous century to which it belonged.She
was standing against one of the pilasters at the side of the
room, laughing demurely at the antics of Becky Sharp and Sir John
Falstaff,--Miss Puss Russell and Mr.Tennyson's "Idylls" having appeared but the year before, Anne was
dressed as Elaine, a part which suited her very well.It was strange
indeed to see her waltzing with Daniel Boone (Mr.Clarence Colfax)
in his Indian buckskins.Eugenie went as Marie Antoinette.Tall Maude
Catherwood was most imposing as Rebecca; and her brother George made a
towering Friar Tuck, Even little fifteen-year-old Spencer Catherwood,
the contradiction of the family, was there.He went as the lieutenant
Napoleon, walking about with his hands behind his back and his brows
thoughtfully contracted.It was at tine very height of the
festivities that Dorothy Carvel and Mr.Daniel Boone were making their
way together to the porch when the giant gate-keeper of Kenilworth
Castle came stalking up the steps out of the darkness, brandishing his
club in their faces.Dorothy screamed, and even the doughty Daniel gave
back a step."I'm sorry, Jinny, indeed I am," said the giant, repentant, and holding
her hand in his.demanded Virginia, a little mollified."I've been to a Lincoln meeting," said honest Tom; "where I heard a very
fine speech from a friend of yours.""You might have been better employed," said she, and added, with
dignity, "I have no friends who speak at Black Republican meetings.""No," said Tom, "I meant--"

He got no further.Virginia slipped her arm through Clarence's, and they
went off together to the end of the veranda.He passed on into
the gay drawing-room, but the zest had been taken out of his antics for
that night."Whom did he mean, Jinny?"said Clarence, when they were on the seat
under the vines."He meant that Yankee, Stephen Brice," answered Virginia, languidly."I
am so tired of hearing about him.""So am I," said Clarence, with a fervor by no means false."By George,
I think he will make a Black Republican out of Tom, if he keeps on.Puss and Jack have been talking about him all summer, until I am out
of patience.But suppose he has addressed fifty
Lincoln meetings, as they say, is that any reason for making much
of him?I should not have him at Bellegarde."He is on the Brinsmade charity list.""He is not on their charity list, nor on any other," said Virginia,
quickly."Stephen Brice is the last person who would submit to charity.""And you are the last person who I supposed would stand up for him,"
cried her cousin, surprised and nettled."I want to be fair, Max," she said quietly."Pa offered them our Glencoe
House last summer at a low price, and they insisted on paying what
Mr.Edwards gave five years ago,--or nothing.You know that I detest
a Yankee as much as you do," she continued, indignation growing in her
voice."I did not come out here with you to be insulted."With her hand on the rail, she made as if to rise.Clarence was perforce
mollified."Don't go, Jinny," he said beseechingly."I didn't mean to make you
angry--"

"I can't see why you should always be dragging in this Mr.Brice," she
said, almost tearfully.(It will not do to pause now and inquire into
Virginia's logic.)"I came out to hear what you had to tell me.""Jinny, I have been made second lieutenant of Company A.""Oh, Max, I am so glad!"I suppose that you have heard the result of the October elections,
Jinny.""Pa said something about them to-night," she answered; "why?""It looks now as if there were a chance of the Republicans winning," he
answered.But it was elation that caught his voice, not gloom."You mean that this white trash Lincoln may be President?""The South will not submit to that until every man
who can bear arms is shot down."The strains of a waltz
mingled with talk and laughter floated out of the open window.His voice
dropped to a low intensity."We are getting ready in Company A," he
said; "the traitors will be dropped.We are getting ready to fight for
Missouri and for the South."The girl felt his excitement, his exaltation."And if you were not, Max, I should disown you," she whispered.He leaned forward until his face was close to hers."I am ready to work, to starve, to go to prison, to help--"

He sank back heavily into the corner."Oh, if a woman could only do more!"Do you remember
when you told me that I was good for nothing, that I lacked purpose?""I have thought it over since," he went on rapidly; "you were right.I
cannot work--it is not in me.But I have always felt that I could make a
name for myself--for you--in the army.I am sure that I could command a
regiment.She did not answer him, but absently twisted the fringe of his buckskins
in her fingers."Ever since I have known what love is I have loved you, Jinny.It was so
when we climbed the cherry trees at Bellegarde.And you loved me then--I
know you did.You loved me when I went East to school at the Military
Institute.But it has not been the same of late," he faltered.I felt it first on that day you rode out to
Bellegarde when you said that my life was of no use.Jinny, I don't ask
much.War is coming, and we shall have
to free ourselves from Yankee insolence.It is what we have both wished
for.When I am a general, will you marry me?"For a wavering instant she might have thrown herself into his
outstretched arms.Why not, and have done with sickening doubts?Perhaps
her hesitation hung on the very boyishness of his proposal.Perhaps the
revelation that she did not then fathom was that he had not developed
since those childish days.But even while she held back, came the beat
of hoofs on the gravel below them, and one of the Bellegarde servants
rode into the light pouring through the open door.Clarence muttered his dismay as he followed his cousin to the steps."Nothing; I forgot to sign the deed to the Elleardsville property,
and Worington wants it to-night."Cutting short <DW71>'s explanations,
Clarence vaulted on the horse.Leaning over
in the saddle, he whispered: "I'll be back in a quarter of an hour Will
you wait?""Yes," she said, so that he barely heard.He was away at a gallop, leaving Virginia standing bareheaded to the
night, alone.A spring of pity, of affection for Clarence suddenly
welled up within her.There came again something of her old admiration
for a boy, impetuous and lovable, who had tormented and defended her
with the same hand.Patriotism, stronger in Virginia than many of us now can conceive, was
on Clarence's side.Now was she all
afire with the thought that she, a woman, might by a single word
give the South a leader.That word would steady him, for there was no
question of her influence.She trembled at the reckless lengths he might
go in his dejection, and a memory returned to her of a day at Glencoe,
before he had gone off to school, when she had refused to drive with
him.Colonel Carvel had been away from home.In spite of Ned's beseechings Clarence had ridden off on a wild
thoroughbred colt and had left her to an afternoon of agony.Vividly
she recalled his home-coming in the twilight, his coat torn and muddy, a
bleeding cut on his forehead, and the colt quivering tame.In those days she had thought of herself unreservedly as meant for
him.Dash and courage and generosity had been the beacon lights on her
horizon.Yes, and Clarence
should have these, too.She also had been
at fault, and perhaps it was because of her wavering loyalty to him that
he had not gained them.Her name spoken within the hall startled Virginia from her reverie, and
she began to walk rapidly down the winding drive.A fragment of the air
to which they were dancing brought her to a stop.It was the Jenny Lind
waltz.And with it came clear and persistent the image she had sought to
shut out and failed.As if to escape it now, she fairly ran all the way
to the light at the entrance and hid in the magnolias clustered beside
the gateway.It was her cousin's name she whispered over and over to
herself as she waited, vibrant with a strange excitement.It was as
though the very elements might thwart her wail.Clarence would be
delayed, or they would miss her at the house, and search.It seemed an
eternity before she heard the muffled thud of a horse cantering in the
clay road.Virginia stood out in the light fairly between the gate posts.Too late
she saw the horse rear as the rider flew back in his seat, for she had
seized the bridle.The beams from the lamp fell upon a Revolutionary
horseman, with cooked hat and sword and high riding-boots.For her his
profile was in silhouette, and the bold nose and chin belonged to but
one man she knew.She gave a cry of astonishment
and dropped the rein in dismay.Her
impulse was to fly, nor could she tell what force that stayed her feet.As for Stephen, he stood high in his stirrups and stared down at the
girl.She was standing full in the light,--her lashes fallen, her face
crimson.But no sound of surprise escaped him because it was she, nor
did he wonder at her gown of a gone-by century.Her words came first,
and they were low."I--I thought that you were my cousin," she said.She gave a step backward, and raised her frightened eyes to his."I can't say why," he said quickly, "but it seems to me as if this had
happened before.I know that I am talking nonsense--"

Virginia was trembling now.And her answer was not of her own choosing."It may have been in a dream," he answered her, "that I saw you as you
stand there by my bridle.And what mystery
was it that sent him here this night of all nights?She could not even
have said that it was her own voice making reply."And I--I have seen you, with the sword, and the powdered hair, and the
blue coat and the buff waistcoat.It is a buff waistcoat like that my
great-grandfather wears in his pictures.""It is a buff waistcoat," he said, all sense of strangeness gone.The roses she held dropped on the gravel, and she put out her hand
against his horse's flank.In an instant he had leaped from his saddle,
and his arm was holding her.She did not resist, marvelling rather at
his own steadiness, nor did she then resent a tenderness in his voice."I hope you will forgive me--Virginia," he said."It was I who stopped you," she said; "I was waiting for--"

"For whom?"Colfax," she answered, in another tone.And as she
spoke she drew away from him, up the driveway.But she had scarcely
taken five steps whey she turned again, her face burning defiance."They
told me you were not coming," she said almost fiercely."You know I would not have been
here had I thought you were coming.Anne promised me that you would not
come."What would she not have given for those words back again

Stephen took astride toward her, and to the girl that stride betokened a
thousand things that went to the man's character.Within its compass the
comparison in her mind was all complete.He was master of himself when
he spoke."You dislike me, Miss Carvel," he said steadily.Nor do I flatter myself that it is only because you believe one thing,
and I another.But I assure you that it is my misfortune rather than my
fault that I have not pleased you,--that I have met you only to anger
you."He paused, for she did not seem to hear him.She was gazing at the
distant lights moving on the river.Had he come one step farther?--but
he did not.Presently she knew that he was speaking again, in the same
measured tone."Had Miss Brinsmade told me that my presence here would cause you
annoyance, I should have stayed away.I hope that you will think nothing
of the--the mistake at the gate.You may be sure that I shall not
mention it.He lifted his hat, mounted his horse, and was gone.She had not even
known that he could ride--that was strangely the first thought.The
second discovered herself intent upon the rhythm of his canter as it
died southward upon the road.There was shame in this, mingled with a
thankfulness that he would not meet Clarence.She hurried a few steps
toward the house, and stopped again.Ringing there was her talk with
Stephen Brice, as though it were still rapidly going on.His questions
and her replies--over and over again.Each trivial incident of an
encounter real and yet unreal!His transformation in the uniform, which
had seemed so natural.Though she strove to make it so, nothing of all
this was unbearable now, nor the remembrance of the firm torch of his
arm about her nor yet again his calling her by her name.Absently she took her way again up the drive, now pausing, now going on,
forgetful.First it was alarm she felt when her cousin leaped down at
her side,--then dread."I thought I should never get back," he cried breathlessly, as he threw
his reins to <DW71>."I ought not to have asked you to wait outside.She answered something, There was a seat near by under the trees.To
lead her to it he seized her hand, but it was limp and cold, and a
sudden fear came into his voice.She remembered long how he
stood in the scattered light from the bright windows, a tall, black
figure of dismay.But her own
response, warm half an hour since, was lifeless."Jinny," he said, "what is the matter?"Only I was very foolish to say I would wait for you.""Then--then you won't marry me?""Oh, Max," she cried, "it is no time to talk of that now.I feel
to-night as if something dreadful were to happen.""But war is what we want," he cried, "what we have prayed for, what we
have both been longing for to-night, Jinny.War alone will give us our
rights--"

He stopped short.Virginia had bowed her head an her hands, and he saw
her shoulders shaken by a sob.Clarence bent over her in bewilderment
and anxiety."You are not well, Jinny," he said.But when they went in at the door, he saw that her eyes were dry.Those were the days when a dozen young ladies were in the habit of
staying all night after a dance in the country; of long whispered talks
(nay, not always whispered) until early morning.Miss Russell had not been the only one who remarked Virginia's long
absence with her cousin; but Puss found her friend in one of those moods
which even she dared not disturb.Accordingly Miss Russell stayed all
night with Anne.And the two spent most of the dark hours remaining in unprofitable
discussion as to whether Virginia were at last engaged to her cousin,
and in vain queried over another unsolved mystery.This mystery was
taken up at the breakfast table the next morning, when Miss Carvel
surprised Mrs.Brinsmade and the male household by appearing at
half-past seven.Brinsmade, "what does this mean?I always
thought that young ladies did not get up after a ball until noon.""I am going to ask you to take me to town when you go, Mr."Why, certainly, my dear," he said."But I under stood that your aunt
was to send for you this afternoon from Bellegarde.""There is something I wish to do in town.""I'll drive her in, Pa," said Jack.Will you go with
me, Jinny?""But you must eat some breakfast, Jinny," said Mrs Brinsmade, glancing
anxiously at the girl."Where was Stephen Brice last night, Jack?""I understood Anne
to say that he had spoke; of coming late.""Why, sir," said Jack, "that's what we can't make out.Tom Catherwood,
who is always doing queer things, you know, went to a Black Republican
meeting last night, and met Stephen there.They came out in Tom's buggy
to the Russells', and Tom got into his clothes first and rode over.Stephen was to have followed on Puss Russell's horse.At least I can find no one who saw him.But Virginia did not raise her eyes from her plate."There might have been an accident, Jack," said that lady, with concern."Send Nicodemus over to Mrs.Brice is a Northerner, and may not be able to ride.""He rides like a dragoon, mother," said he."I don't know where he
picked it up.""The reason I mentioned him," said Mr.Brinsmade, lifting the blanket
sheet and adjusting his spectacles, "was because his name caught my eye
in this paper.His speech last night at the Library Hall is one of the
few sensible Republican speeches I have read.I think it very remarkable
for a man as young as he."Brinsmade began to read: "'While waiting
for the speaker of the evening, who was half an hour late, Mr.Tiefel
rose in the audience and called loudly for Mr.Many citizens in
the hall were astonished at the cheering which followed the mention
of this name.Brice is a young lawyer with a quiet manner and a
determined face, who has sacrificed much to the Party's cause this
summer.He was introduced by Judge Whipple, in whose office he is.He had hardly begun to speak before he had the ear of everyone in the
house.Brice's personality is prepossessing, his words are spoken
sharply, and he has a singular emphasis at times which seems to drive
his arguments into the minds of his hearers.We venture to say that if
party orators here and elsewhere were as logical and temperate as Mr.Brice; if, like him, they appealed to reason rather than to passion,
those bitter and lamentable differences which threaten our country's
peace might be amicably adjusted.'But he was interrupted by the rising of Virginia.A high color was on
the girl's face as she said:

"Please excuse me, Mrs.Brinsmade, I must go and get ready.""But you've eaten nothing, my dear.""You ought not have read that, Pa," Mr.Jack remonstrated; "you know
that she detests Yankees."THE BREACH BECOMES TOO WIDE ABRAHAM LINCOLN!At the foot of Breed's Hill in Charlestown an American had been born
into the world, by the might of whose genius that fateful name was
sped to the uttermost parts of the nation.Abraham Lincoln was elected
President of the United States.And the moan of the storm gathering in
the South grew suddenly loud and louder.Stephen Brice read the news in the black headlines and laid down the
newspaper, a sense of the miraculous upon him.There again was the
angled, low-celled room of the country tavern, reeking with food and
lamps and perspiration; for a central figure the man of surpassing
homeliness,--coatless, tieless, and vestless,--telling a story in
the vernacular.He reflected that it might well seem strange yea, and
intolerable--to many that this comedian of the country store, this crude
lawyer and politician, should inherit the seat dignified by Washington
and the Adamses.For to him had been vouchsafed the glimpse
beyond.That was a dark winter that followed, the darkest in our history.Gloom
and despondency came fast upon the heels of Republican exultation.Men
rose early for tidings from Charleston, the storm centre.Would it crumble in pieces before Abraham
Lincoln got to Washington?One smoky morning early in December Stephen arrived late at the office
to find Richter sitting idle on his stool, concern graven on his face."The Judge has had no breakfast, Stephen," he whispered.Shadrach tells me he has been doing that since six this morning, when he
got his newspaper."Stephen listened, and he heard the Judge pacing and pacing in his room.Presently the door was flung open, And they saw Mr.Whipple standing in
the threshold, stern and dishevelled.He came out and sat down in Stephen's chair, striking the newspaper in
his hand, and they feared at first that his Mind had wandered.he cried, "propitiate, propitiate, and again propitiate.Suddenly he turned upon Stephen, who was frightened.But now his voice was natural, and he thrust the paper into the young
man's lap."Have you read the President's message to Congress, sir?God
help me that I am spared to call that wobbling Buchanan President.Perhaps you can tell me why,
if a man admits that it is wrong for a state to abandon this Union, he
cannot call upon Congress for men and money to bring her back.No, this
weakling lets Floyd stock the Southern arsenals.He is for bribing them not to be angry.Take Cuba from Spain,
says he, and steal the rest of Mexico that the maw of slavery may be
filled, and the demon propitiated."And so he went back into his room, shutting
the door.That day no clients saw him, even those poor ones dependent
on his charity whom had never before denied.Richter and Stephen took
counsel together, and sent Shadrach out for his dinner.There arrived a sparkling Sunday, brought down the
valley of the Missouri from the frozen northwest.The Saturday had been
soggy and warm.Thursday had seen South Carolina leave that Union into which she was
born, amid prayers and the ringing of bells.A young lady, who had listened to a solemn sermon of Dr.Posthelwaite's, slipped out of Church before the prayers were ended,
and hurried into that deserted portion of the town about the Court House
where on week days business held its sway.She stopped once at the bottom of the grimy flight of steps leading to
Judge Whipple's office.At the top she paused again, and for a short
space stood alert, her glance resting on the little table in the corner,
on top of which a few thumbed law books lay neatly piled.Once she made
a hesitating step in this direction.Then, as if by a resolution quickly
taken, she turned her back and softly opened the door of the Judge's
room.A book was open in his lap,
but it did not seem to Virginia that he was reading it."Uncle Silas," she said, "aren't you coming to dinner any more?"He looked up swiftly from under his shaggy brows."Uncle Silas," said Virginia, bravely, "I came to get you to-day."Never before had she known him to turn away from man or woman, but now
Judge Whipple drew his handkerchief from his pocket and blew his nose
violently.A woman's intuition told her that locked tight in his heart
was what he longed to say, and could not.The shiny black overcoat he
wore was on the bed.Virginia picked it up and held it out to him, an
appeal in her eyes.Many people walking home
from church that morning marvelled as they saw these two on Locust
Street together, the young girl supporting the elderly man over the
slippery places at the crossings.For neighbor had begun to look coldly
upon neighbor.Colonel Carvel beheld them from his armchair by the sitting-room window,
and leaned forward with a start.His lips moved as he closed his Bible
reverently and marked his place.At the foot of the stairs he surprised
Jackson by waving him aside, for the Colonel himself flung open the door
and held out his hand to his friend.The Judge released Virginia's arm,
and his own trembled as he gave it."Silas," said the Colonel, "Silas, we've missed you."Virginia stood by, smiling, but her breath came deeply.Judge Whipple did not go in at the
door--He stood uncompromisingly planted on the threshold, his head flung
back, and actual fierceness in his stare."Do you guess we can keep off the subject, Comyn?"Carvel, so used to the Judge's ways, was a bit taken aback by
this question.It set him tugging at his goatee, and his voice was not
quite steady as he answered:

"God knows, Silas.We are human, and we can only try."It lacked a quarter of an hour of
dinner,--a crucial period to tax the resources of any woman.Virginia
led the talk, but oh, the pathetic lameness of it.Her own mind was
wandering when it should not, and recollections she had tried to
strangle had sprung up once more.Only that morning in church she had
lived over again the scene by Mr.Brinsmade's gate, and it was then that
a wayward but resistless impulse to go to the Judge's office had seized
her.The thought of the old man lonely and bitter in his room decided
her.On her knees she prayed that she might save the bond between him
and her father.For the Colonel had been morose on Sundays, and had
taken to reading the Bible, a custom he had not had since she was a
child.In the dining-room Jackson, bowing and smiling, pulled out the Judge's
chair, and got his customary curt nod as a reward."Oh, Uncle Silas," she cried, "I am so glad that we have a wild turkey.The girl carved deftly, feverishly,
talking the while, aided by that most kind and accomplished of hosts,
her father.In the corner the dreaded skeleton of the subject grinned
sardonically.Were they going to be able to keep it off?There was to be
no help from Judge Whipple, who sat in grim silence.A man who feels
his soul burning is not given to small talk.Virginia alone had ever
possessed the power to make him forget."Uncle Silas, I am sure there are some things about our trip that we
never told you.How we saw Napoleon and his beautiful Empress driving
in the Bois, and how Eugenie smiled and bowed at the people.I never
saw such enthusiasm in my life.And oh, I learned such a lot of French
history.All about Francis the First, and Pa took me to see his chateaus
along the Loire.You really ought to have
gone with us.""I had other work to do, Jinny," said the Judge."I told you that we stayed with a real lord in England, didn't I?""He wasn't half as nice as the Prince.But he had a beautiful house
in Surrey, all windows, which was built in Elizabeth's time.They called
the architecture Tudor, didn't they, Pa?""Yes, dear," said the Colonel, smiling."The Countess was nice to me," continued the girl, "and took me to
garden parties.But Lord Jermyn was always talking politics."The Colonel was stroking his goatee."Tell Silas about the house, Jinny--Jackson, help the Judge again.""No," said Virginia, drawing a breath."I'm going to tell him about that
queer club where my great-grand-father used to bet with Charles Fox.We
saw a great many places where Richard Carvel had been in England.Uncle Daniel read me some of his memoirs when
we were at Calvert House.I know that you would be interested in them,
Uncle Silas."And fought for his country and for his flag, Virginia," said the Judge,
who had scarcely spoken until then."No, I could not bear to read them
now, when those who should love that country are leaving it in passion."Virginia did not dare to look at her father.But the Colonel said, gently:

"Not in passion, Silas, but in sorrow."But the effort was beyond him, and the
flood within him broke loose."Colonel Carvel," he cried, "South Carolina is mad--She is departing in
sin, in order that a fiendish practice may be perpetuated.If her people
stopped to think they would know that slavery cannot exist except by
means of this Union.But let this milksop of a President do his worst.We have chosen a man who has the strength to say, 'You shall not go!'"The saving grace of it was that respect and love
for her father filled Virginia's heart.In his just anger Colonel
Carvel remembered that he was the host, and strove to think only of his
affection for his old friend."To invade a sovereign state, sir, is a crime against the sacred spirit
of this government," he said."There is no such thing as a sovereign state, sir," exclaimed the Judge,
hotly."I am an American, and not a Missourian.""When the time comes, sir," said the Colonel, with dignity, "Missouri
will join with her sister sovereign states against oppression.""Missouri will not secede, sir.""Because, sir, when the worst comes, the Soothing Syrup men will rally
for the Union.And there are enough loyal people here to keep her
straight."Foreign Republican hirelings, sir," exclaimed
the Colonel, standing up."We shall drive them like sheep if they oppose
us.You are drilling them now that they may murder your own blood when
you think the time is ripe."The Colonel did not hear Virginia leave the room, so softly had she
gone, He made a grand figure of a man as he stood up, straight and tall,
those gray eyes a-kindle at last.But the fire died as quickly as it had
flared.Pity had come and quenched it,--pity that an unselfish life
of suffering and loneliness should be crowned with these.The Colonel
longed then to clasp his friend in his arms.Quarrels they had had
by the hundred, never yet a misunderstanding.God had given to Silas
Whipple a nature stern and harsh that repelled all save the charitable
few whose gift it was to see below the surface, and Colonel Carvel had
been the chief of them.But now the Judge's vision was clouded.Steadying himself by his chair, he had risen glaring, the loose skin
twitching on his sallow face.He began firmly but his voice shook ere he
had finished."Colonel Carvel," said he, "I expect that the day has come when you
go your way and I go mine.It will be better if--we do not meet again,
sir."And so he turned from the man whose friendship had stayed him for the
score of years he had battled with his enemies, from that house which
had been for so long his only home.For the last time Jackson came
forward to help him with his coat.The Judge did not see him, nor did he
see the tearful face of a young girl leaning over the banisters above.Whipple, blinded by a moisture strange to
his eyes, clung to the iron railing as he felt his way down the steps.Before he reached the bottom a stronger arm had seize his own, and was
helping him.The Judge brushed his eyes with his sleeve, and turned a defiant face
upon Captain Elijah Brent--then his voice broke.His anger was
suddenly gone, and his thought had flown back to the Colonel's thousand
charities."Lige," he said, "Lige, it has come."In answer the Captain pressed the Judge's hand, nodding vigorously to
hide his rising emotion.cried the Captain, "I wish I knew.""Lige," said the Judge, gravely, "you're too good a man to be for
Soothing Syrup.""You're too smart to be fooled, Lige," he said, with a note near to
pleading."The time has come when you Bell people and the Douglas people
have got to decide.Never in my life did I know it to do good to dodge
a question.We've got to be white or black, Lige.Nobody's got much
use for the grays.And don't let yourself be fooled with Constitutional
Union Meetings, and compromises.The time is almost here, Lige, when it
will take a rascal to steer a middle course."Captain Lige listened, and he shifted from one foot to the other, and
rubbed his hands, which were red.Some odd trick of the mind had put
into his head two people--Eliphalet Hopper and Jacob Cluyme."Lige, you've got to decide.Can you look
on while our own states defy us, and not lift a hand?Can you sit still
while the Governor and all the secessionists in this state are plotting
to take Missouri, too, out of the Union?The militia is riddled with
rebels, and the rest are forming companies of minute men.""And you Black Republicans," the Captain cried "have organized your
Dutch Wideawakes, and are arming them to resist Americans born.""They are Americans by our Constitution, sir, which the South pretends
to revere," cried the Judge."And they are showing themselves better
Americans than many who have been on the soil for generations.""My sympathies are with the South," said the Captain, doggedly, "and my
love is for the South."Both men raised their eyes to the house of him
whose loving hospitality had been a light in the lives of both.When at
last the Captain spoke, his voice was rent with feeling."Judge," he began, "when I was a poor young man on the old 'Vicksburg',
second officer under old Stetson, Colonel Carvel used to take me up to
his house on Fourth Street to dinner.And he gave me the clothes on
my back, so that I might not be ashamed before the fashion which came
there.One day the sheriff sold the
Vicksburg.That left me high and dry in the mud.And he says to me, 'Lige, you're
captain now, the youngest captain on the river.You
can pay me principal and interest when you get ready.'"Judge Whipple, I never had any other home than right in, this house.I
never had any other pleasure than bringing Jinny presents, and tryin' to
show 'em gratitude.He took me into his house and cared for me at a time
when I wanted to go to the devil along with the stevedores when I was
a wanderer he kept me out of the streets, and out of temptation.Judge,
I'd a heap rather go down and jump off the stern of my boat than step in
here and tell him I'd fight for the North."The Judge steadied himself on his hickory stick and walked off without
a word.For a while Captain Lige stood staring after him.Then he slowly
climbed the steps and disappeared.MUTTERINGS

Early in the next year, 1861,--that red year in the Calendar of our
history,--several gentlemen met secretly in the dingy counting-room of
a prominent citizen to consider how the state of Missouri might be saved
to the Union.One of these gentlemen was Judge Whipple, another, Mr.Brinsmade; and another a masterly and fearless lawyer who afterward
became a general, and who shall be mentioned in these pages as the
Leader.By his dash and boldness and statesmanlike grasp of a black
situation St.Louis was snatched from the very bosom of secession.Alas, that chronicles may not stretch so as to embrace all great men of
a time.There is Captain Nathaniel Lyon,--name with the fateful ring.Nathaniel Lyon, with the wild red hair and blue eye, born and bred a
soldier, ordered to St.Louis, and become subordinate to a wavering
officer of ordnance.Lyon was one who brooked no trifling.He had the
face of a man who knows his mind and intention; the quick speech and
action which go with this.Red tape made by the reel to bind him, he
broke.Courts-martial had no terrors for him.He proved the ablest of
lieutenants to the strong civilian who was the Leader.If God had willed that the South should win, there
would have been no occasion.Even as Judge Whipple had said, the time was come for all men to decide.Out of the way, all hopes of compromises that benumbed Washington.No
Constitutional Unionists, no Douglas Democrats, no Republicans now.The speech-making was not done with yet.Partisanship must be overcome, and patriotism instilled in its place.One day Stephen Brice saw the Leader go into Judge Whipple's room,
and presently he was sent for.After that he was heard of in various
out-of-the-way neighborhoods, exhorting all men to forget their quarrels
and uphold the flag.The Leader himself knew not night from day in his toil,--in organizing,
conciliating, compelling when necessary.And, after that solemn inauguration, between him and
Washington.It was an open secret that the Governor of Missouri held out
his arms to Jefferson Davis, just elected President of the new Southern
Confederacy.It soon became plain to the feeblest brain what the Leader
and his friends had perceived long before, that the Governor intended
to use the militia (purged of Yankee sympathizers) to save the state for
the South.The Government Arsenal, with its stores of arms and ammunition, was
the prize.This building and its grounds lay to the south of the
City, overlooking the river.It was in command of a doubting major
of ordnance; the corps of officers of Jefferson Barracks hard by was
mottled with secession.In all the South, Pickens and Sumter alone stood
stanch to the flag.A general, wearing the uniform of the army of the
United States, surrendered the whole state of Texas.Louis Arsenal was next in succession, and the little band of
regulars at the Barracks was powerless to save it.What could the Leader
and Captain Lyon do without troops?That was the question that rang
in Stephen's head, and in the heads of many others.For, if President
Lincoln sent troops to St.And the President had other uses for the handful in the army.There came a rain-sodden night when a mysterious message arrived at
the little house in Olive Street.Brice's eyes as they followed her son out of the door.At Twelfth
Street two men were lounging on the corners, each of whom glanced at
him listessly as he passed.He went up a dark and narrow stair into a
lighted hall with shrouded windows.Men with sober faces were forming
line on the sawdust of the floors.The Leader was there giving military
orders in a low voice.That marked the beginning of the aggressive Union
movement.Stephen, standing apart at the entrance, remarked that many of the men
were Germans.Indeed, he spied his friend Tiefel there, and presently
Richter came from the ranks to greet him."My friend," he said, "you are made second lieutenant of our company,
the Black Jaegers.""But I have never drilled in my life," said Stephen.The Leader, smiling a little, put a vigorous stop to his protestations,
and told him to buy a tactics.The next man Stephen saw was big Tom
Catherwood, who blushed to the line of his hair as he returned Stephen's
grip."Well," said Tom, embarrassed, "a fellow has got to do what he think's
right.""I reckon they'll disown me, Stephen, when they find it out."Richter walked home as far as Stephen's house.He was to take the Fifth
Street car for South St.And they talked of Tom's courage, and of
the broad and secret military organization the Leader had planned that
night.Could he afford to risk his life in the war that was coming, and leave
his mother dependent upon charity?It was shortly after this that Stephen paid his last visit for many a
long day upon Miss Puss Russell.It was a Sunday afternoon, and Puss was
entertaining, as usual, a whole parlor-full of young men, whose leanings
and sympathies Stephen divined while taking off his coat in the hall.Then he heard Miss Russell cry:

"I believe that they are drilling those nasty Dutch hirelings in
secret.""I am sure they are," said George Catherwood."One of the halls is on
Twelfth Street, and they have sentries posted out so that you can't get
near them.And he told him that if
he ever got evidence of it, he'd show him the door.""Do you really think that Tom is with the Yankees?""Tom's a fool," said George, with emphasis, "but he isn't a coward.He'd just as soon tell Pa to-morrow that he was drilling if the Yankee
leaders wished it known.""Virginia will never speak to him again," said Eugenie, in an awed
voice.said Puss, "Tom never had a chance with Jinny.Did you ever know any one to change so,
since this military business has begun?I hear
that they are thinking of making him captain of a company of dragoons.""And that is the company I intend to join.""Well," began Puss, with her usual recklessness, "it's a good thing for
Clarence that all this is happening.I know somebody else--"

Poor Stephen in the hall knew not whether to stay or fly.Emily Russell came down the stairs at that instant
and spoke to him.As the two entered the parlor, there was a hush
pregnant with many things unsaid.Puss's face was scarlet, but her hand
was cold as she held it out to him.For the first time in that house
he felt like an intruder.Jack Brinsmade bowed with great ceremony,
and took his departure.There was scarcely a distant cordiality in
the greeting of the other young men.And Puss, whose tongue was loosed
again, talked rapidly of entertainments to which Stephen either had not
been invited, or from which he had stayed away.The rest of the company
were almost moodily silent.Profoundly depressed, Stephen sat straight in the velvet chair, awaiting
a seasonable time to bring his visit to a close.This was to be the last, then, of his intercourse with a warmhearted
and lovable people.This was to be the end of his friendship with this
impetuous and generous girl who had done so much to brighten his life
since he had come to St: Louis.Henceforth this house would be shut to
him, and all others save Mr.Presently, in one of the intervals of Miss Russell's feverish talk,
he rose to go.Dusk was gathering, and a deep and ominous silence
penetrated like the shadows into the tall room.Impulsively, almost tearfully, Puss put her hand in his.Then she
pressed it unexpectedly, so that he had to gulp down a lump that was in
his throat.Just then a loud cry was heard from without, the men jumped
from their chairs, and something heavy dropped on the carpet.Some ran to the window, others to the door.Directly across the street
was the house of Mr.One of the third
story windows was open, and out of it was pouring a mass of gray wood
smoke.George Catherwood was the first to speak."I hope it will burn down," he cried.Stephen picked up the object on the floor, which had dropped from his
pocket, and handed it to him.THE GUNS OF SUMTER

Winter had vanished.Toward a little island
set in the blue waters of Charleston harbor anxious eyes were strained.God alone may count the wives and mothers who listened in the still
hours of the night for the guns of Sumter.One sultry night in April
Stephen's mother awoke with fear in her heart, for she had heard them.that is the roar now, faint but sullen.That is the red flash
far across the black Southern sky.For in our beds are the terrors and
cruelties of life revealed to us.There is a demon to be faced, and
nought alone.The lightning revealed her as she bent over him.On the wings of memory be flew back to his childhood in the great Boston
house with the rounded front, and he saw the nursery with its high
windows looking out across the Common.Often in the dark had she come to
him thus, her gentle hand passing over aim to feel if he were covered.She said: "Stephen, I am afraid that the war has come."Even he did not guess the agony in her heart.We have nothing left but the little I
earn.And if I were--" He did not finish the sentence, for he felt her
trembling.But she said again, with that courage which seems woman's
alone:

"Remember Wilton Brice.It was the hour he had dreaded, stolen suddenly upon him out of the
night.How many times had he rehearsed this scene to himself!He,
Stephen Brice, who had preached and slaved and drilled for the Union,
a renegade to be shunned by friend and foe alike!He had talked for his
country, but he would not risk his life for it.He saw them passing him silently on the street.Shamefully
he remembered the time, five months agone, when he had worn the very
uniform of his Revolutionary ancestor.And high above the tier of his
accusers he saw one face, and the look of it stung to the very quick of
his soul.Before the storm he had fallen asleep in sheer weariness of the
struggle, that face shining through the black veil of the darkness.If
he were to march away in the blue of his country (alas, not of hers!)she would respect him for risking life for conviction.If he stayed at
home, she would not understand.And
yet he knew that Virginia Carvel and the women like her were ready to
follow with bare feet the march of the soldiers of the South.The rain was come now, in a flood.Stephen's mother could not see in the
blackness the bitterness on his face.Above the roar of the waters she
listened for his voice."I will not go, mother," he said."If at length every man is needed,
that will be different.""It is for you to decide, my son," she answered."There are many ways in
which you can serve your country here.But remember that you may have to
face hard things.""I have had to do that before, mother," he replied calmly."I cannot
leave you dependent upon charity."She went back into her room to pray, for she knew that he had laid his
ambition at her feet.It was not until a week later that the dreaded news came.All through
the Friday shells had rained on the little fort while Charleston looked
on.Through a wide land was that numbness which
precedes action.Force of habit sent men to their places of business,
to sit idle.South
Carolina had shot to bits the flag she had once revered.On the Monday came the call of President Lincoln for volunteers.The outraged reply of her governor
went back,--never would she furnish troops to invade her sister states.Little did Governor Jackson foresee that Missouri was to stand fifth of
all the Union in the number of men she was to give.To her was credited
in the end even more men than stanch Massachusetts.The noise of preparation was in the city--in the land.On the Monday
morning, when Stephen went wearily to the office, he was met by Richter
at the top of the stairs, who seized his shoulders and looked into his
face.The light of the zealot was on Richter's own."We shall drill every night now, my friend, until further orders.Until we go to the front, Stephen, to put down
rebellion."Stephen sank into a chair, and bowed his head.What would
he think,--this man who had fought and suffered and renounced his native
land for his convictions?Who in this nobler allegiance was ready to die
for them?How was he to confess to Richter, of all men?"Carl," he said at length, "I--I cannot go."But Richter, suddenly divining, laid his hands
impulsively on Stephen's shoulders."Ach, I see," he said.It shall be
for your mother while you are away."Then, in spite of
his feelings, he stared at the German with a new appreciation of his
character.implored Richter, "I would give a fortune, if
I had it.Ah, my friend, that would please me so.And I do not need the
money now.Spring was in the air; the first faint smell of verdure wafted across
the river on the wind.Stephen turned to the open window, tears of
intense agony in his eyes.In that instant he saw the regiment marching,
and the flag flying at its head."It is my duty to stay here, Carl," he said brokenly.Richter took an appealing step toward him and stopped.He realized that
with this young New Englander a decision once made was unalterable.In
all his knowledge of Stephen he never remembered him to change.With the
demonstrative sympathy of his race, he yearned to comfort him, and knew
not how.Two hundred years of Puritanism had reared barriers not to be
broken down.At the end of the office the stern figure of the Judge appeared.Stephen followed him into the littered room behind the ground glass
door, scarce knowing what to expect,--and scarce caring, as on that
first day he had gone in there.Whipple himself closed the door, and
then the transom.Stephen felt those keen eyes searching him from their
hiding-place.Brice," he said at last, "the President has called for seventy-five
thousand volunteers to crush this rebellion.They will go, and be
swallowed up, and more will go to fill their places.Brice, people
will tell you that the war will be over in ninety days.But I tell you,
sir, that it will not be over in seven times ninety days."He brought
down his fist heavily upon the table."This, sir, will be a war to the
death.One side or the other will fight until their blood is all let,
and until their homes are all ruins."He darted at Stephen one look from
under those fierce eyebrows."No, sir," he answered, steadily, "not
now."Then he began what seemed a never-ending search
among the papers on his desk.At length he drew out a letter, put on his
spectacles and read it, and finally put it down again.Whipple, "you are doing a courageous thing.But if
we elect to follow our conscience in this world, we must not expect to
escape persecution, sir.Two weeks ago," he continued slowly, "two weeks
ago I had a letter from Mr.cried Stephen

The Judge smiled a little.Lincoln never forgets any one," said
he."He wishes me to extend to you his thanks for your services to the
Republican party, and sends you his kindest regards."This was the first and only time that Mr.Whipple spoke to him of his
labors.Stephen has often laughed at this since, and said that he
would not have heard of them at all had not the Judge's sense of duty
compelled him to convey the message.And it was with a lighter heart
than he had felt for many a day that he went out of the door.Some weeks later, five regiments were mustered into the service of the
United States.And in response to his
appeals, despite the presence of officers of higher rank, the President
had given Captain Nathaniel Lyon supreme command in Missouri.Stephen stood among the angry, jeering crowd that lined the streets as
the regiments marched past.Their step was not as steady, nor their files as straight
as Company A. There was Richter, his head high, his blue eyes defiant.And there was little Tiefel marching in that place of second lieutenant
that Stephen himself should have filled.Here was another company,
and at the end of the first four, big Tom Catherwood.His father
had disowned him the day before, His two brothers, George and little
Spencer, were in a house not far away--a house from which a strange flag
drooped.Clouds were lowering over the city, and big drops falling, as Stephen
threaded his way homeward, the damp anal gloom of the weather in his
very soul.He went past the house where the strange flag hung against
its staff In that big city it flaunted all unchallenged.The house
was thrown wide open that day, and in its window lounged young men of
honored families.And while they joked of German boorishness and Yankee
cowardice they held rifles across their knees to avenge any insult to
the strange banner that they had set up.In the hall, through the open
doorway, the mouth of a shotted field gun could be seen.The guardians
were the Minute Men, organized to maintain the honor and dignity of the
state of Missouri.Across the street from the house was gathered a knot of curious people,
and among these Stephen paused.Two young men were standing on the
steps, and one was Clarence Colfax.His hands were in his pockets, and
a careless, scornful smile was on his face when he glanced down into the
street.Anger swept over him in a hot flame,
as at the slave auction years agone.That was the unquenchable fire of
the war.The blood throbbed in his temples as his feet obeyed,--and yet
he stopped.What right had he to pull down that flag, to die on the pavement before
that house?CAMP JACKSON

What enthusiasm on that gusty Monday morning, the Sixth of May, 1861!Twelfth Street to the north of the Market House is full three hundred
feet across, and the militia of the Sovereign State of Missouri is
gathering there.Thence by order of her Governor they are to march to
Camp Jackson for a week of drill and instruction.Half a mile nearer the river, on the house of the Minute Men, the
strange flag leaps wildly in the wind this day.On Twelfth Street the sun is shining, drums are beating, and bands
are playing, and bright aides dashing hither and thither on spirited
chargers.One by one the companies are marching up, and taking place in
line; the city companies in natty gray fatigue, the country companies
often in their Sunday clothes.But they walk with heads erect and chests
out, and the ladies wave their gay parasols and cheer them.Louis Grays, Company A; there come the Washington
Guards and Washington Blues, and Laclede Guards and Missouri Guards and
Davis Guards.Yes, this is Secession Day, this Monday.And the colors
are the Stars and Stripes and the Arms of Missouri crossed.A clatter and a
cloud of dust by the market place, an ecstasy of cheers running in waves
the length of the crowd.Here they come
at last, four and four, the horses prancing and dancing and pointing
quivering ears at the tossing sea of hats and parasols and ribbons.Maude Catherwood squeezes Virginia's arm.There, riding in front, erect
and firm in the saddle, is Captain Clarence Colfax.Virginia is red and
white, and red again,--true colors of the Confederacy.Oh, that was his true
calling, a soldier's life.In that moment she saw him at the head of
armies, from the South, driving the Yankee hordes northward and still
northward until the roar of the lakes warns them of annihilation.Down to a trot they slow, Clarence's black thorough-bred arching his
long neck, proud as his master of the squadron which follows, four and
four.The square young man of bone and sinew in the first four, whose
horse is built like a Crusader's, is George Catherwood.And Eugenie
gives a cry and points to the rear where Maurice is riding.Can the Yankee regiments with their
slouchy Dutchmen hope to capture it!If there are any Yankees in Twelfth
Street that day, they are silent.And there are
some, even in the ranks of this Militia--who will fight for the Union.There is another wait, the companies standing at ease.Some of the
dragoons dismount, but not the handsome young captain, who rides
straight to the bright group which has caught his eye, Colonel Carvel
wrings his gauntleted hand."Clarence, we are proud of you, sir," he says.And Virginia, repeats his words, her eyes sparkling, her fingers
caressing the silken curve of Jefferson's neck."Clarence, you will drive Captain Lyon and his Hessians into the river.""Hush, Jinny," he answered, "we are merely going into camp to learn to
drill, that we may be ready to defend the state when the time comes.""You will have your cousin court-martialed, my dear," said the Colonel.But he must needs press Virginia's hand
first, and allow admiring Maude and Eugenie to press his.Then he goes
off at a slow canter to join his dragoons, waving his glove at them, and
turning to give the sharp order, "Attention"!Once more she has swept from her heart
every vestige of doubt.Chosen
unanimously captain of the Squadron but a few days since, Clarence had
taken command like a veteran.George Catherwood and Maurice had told the
story.And now at last the city is to shake off the dust of the North.The bands are started, the general and
staff begin to move, and the column swings into the Olive Street road,
followed by a concourse of citizens awheel and afoot, the horse cars
crowded.Virginia and Maude and the Colonel in the Carvel carriage, and
behind Ned, on the box, is their luncheon in a hamper Standing up, the
girls can just see the nodding plumes of the dragoons far to the front.Olive Street, now paved with hot granite and disfigured by trolley
wires, was a country road then.Green trees took the place of crowded
rows of houses and stores, and little "bob-tail" yellow cars were drawn
by plodding mules to an inclosure in a timbered valley, surrounded by
a board fence, known as Lindell Grove.It was then a resort, a picnic
ground, what is now covered by close residences which have long shown
the wear of time.Into Lindell Grove flocked the crowd, the rich and the poor, the
proprietor and the salesmen, to watch the soldiers pitch their tents
under the spreading trees.The gallant dragoons were off to the west,
across a little stream which trickled through the grounds.By the side
of it Virginia and Maude, enchanted, beheld Captain Colfax shouting
his orders while his troopers dragged the canvas from the wagons, and
staggered under it to the line.The
Captain lost his temper, his troopers, perspiring over Gordian knots in
the ropes, uttered strange soldier oaths, while the mad wind which blew
that day played a hundred pranks.To the discomfiture of the young ladies, Colonel Carvel pulled his
goatee and guffawed."How mean, Pa," she said indignantly."How car, you expect them to do it
right the first day, and in this wind?""He is pulled
over on his head."And the gentlemen and ladies who were standing by
laughed, too."You will see that they can fight," she said."They can beat the Yankees
and Dutch."This speech made the Colonel glance around him: Then he smiled,--in
response to other smiles."My dear," he said, "you must remember that this is a peaceable camp of
instruction of the state militia.There fly the Stars and Stripes from
the general's tent.Do you see that they are above the state flag?Jinny stamped her foot

"Oh, I hate dissimulation," she cried, "Why can't we, say outright that
we are going to run that detestable Captain Lyon and his Yankees and
Hessians out of the Arsenal."She had forgotten that one of
her brothers was with the Yankees and Hessians."Why aren't women made generals and governors?""If we were," answered Virginia, "something might be accomplished.""Isn't Clarence enough of a fire-eater to suit you?"But the tents were pitched, and at that moment the young Captain was
seen to hand over his horse to an orderly, and to come toward them.He
was followed by George Catherwood."Come, Jinny," cried her cousin, "let us go over to the main camp.""And walk on Davis Avenue," said Virginia, flushing with pride."Yes, and a Lee Avenue, and a Beauregard Avenue," said George, taking
his sister's arm."We shall walk in them all," said Virginia.The rustling trees and the young grass
of early May, and the two hundred and forty tents in lines of military
precision.Up and down the grassy streets flowed the promenade, proud
fathers and mothers, and sweethearts and sisters and wives in gala
dress.Wear your bright gowns now, you devoted women.The day is coming
when you will make them over and over again, or tear them to lint, to
stanch the blood of these young men who wear their new gray so well.Every afternoon Virginia drove with her father and her aunt to Camp
Jackson.All the fashion and beauty of the city were there.The bands
played, the black coachmen flecked the backs of their shining horses,
and walking in the avenues or seated under the trees were natty young
gentlemen in white trousers and brass-buttoned jackets.All was not
soldier fare at the regimental messes.Cakes and jellies and even ices
and more substantial dainties were laid beneath those tents.Dress
parade was one long sigh of delight: Better not to have been born than
to have been a young man in St.Louis, early in Camp Jackson week, and
not be a militiaman.One young man whom we know, however, had little of pomp and vanity
about him,--none other than the young manager (some whispered "silent
partner") of Carvel & Company.Eliphalet had had political
ambition, or political leanings, during the half-year which had just
passed, he had not shown them.Cluyme (no mean business man himself)
had pronounced Eliphalet a conservative young gentleman who attended
to his own affairs and let the mad country take care of itself.Seeing a regiment of
Missouri Volunteers slouching down Fifth street in citizens' clothes he
had been remarked to smile cynically.But he kept his opinions so close
that he was supposed not to have any.On Thursday of Camp Jackson week, an event occurred in Mr.Carvel's
store which excited a buzz of comment.Barbo, the book-keeper, that he should not be there after four o'clock.To be sure, times were more than dull.The Colonel that morning had read
over some two dozen letters from Texas and the Southwest, telling of the
impossibility of meeting certain obligations in the present state of the
country.The Colonel had gone home to dinner with his brow furrowed.Hopper's equanimity was spoken of at the widow's
table.Hopper took an Olive Street car, tucking himself
into the far corner where he would not be disturbed by any ladies who
might enter.In the course of an hour or so, he alighted at the western
gate of the camp on the Olive Street road.Refreshing himself with a
little tobacco, he let himself be carried leisurely by the crowd between
the rows of tents.A philosophy of his own (which many men before and
since have adopted) permitted him to stare with a superior good nature
at the open love-making around him.He imagined his own figure,--which
was already growing a little stout,--in a light gray jacket and duck
trousers, and laughed.Eliphalet was not burdened with illusions of that
kind.These heroes might have their hero-worship.As he was sauntering toward a deserted seat at the foot of a tree, it so
chanced that he was overtaken by Mr.Only
that morning, this gentleman, in glancing through the real estate column
of his newspaper, had fallen upon a deed of sale which made him wink.He
reminded his wife that Mr.Hopper had not been to supper of late.Cluyme held out his hand with more than common cordiality.Hopper took it, the fingers did not close any too tightly over his own.But it may be well to remark that Mr.Hopper himself did not do any
squeezing.He took off his hat grudgingly to Miss Belle."I hope you will take pot luck with us soon again, Mr."We only have plain and simple things, but they are
wholesome, sir.Dainties are poor things to work on.I told that to his
Royal Highness when he was here last fall.He was speaking to me on the
merits of roast beef--"

"It's a fine day," said Mr.Letting his gaze wander over the camp,
he added casually, "I see that they have got a few mortars and howitzers
since yesterday.I suppose that is the stuff we heard so much about,
which came on the 'Swon' marked'marble.'They say Jeff Davis sent the
stuff to 'em from the Government arsenal the Secesh captured at Baton
Rouge.They're pretty near ready to move on our arsenal now."He was not greatly interested in
this matter which had stirred the city to the quick.Cluyme spoken as one who was deeply moved.Just then, as if to spare the
pains of a reply, a "Jenny Lind" passed them.Miss Belle recognized the
carriage immediately as belonging to an elderly lady who was well known
in St.Every day she drove out, dressed in black bombazine, and
heavily veiled.As the mother-in-law of the stalwart
Union leader of the city, Miss Belle's comment about her appearance in
Camp Jackson was not out of place.she exclaimed, "I'd like to know what she's doing here!"Hopper's answer revealed a keenness which, in the course of a few
days, engendered in Mr.Cluyme as lusty a respect as he was capable of."I don't know," said Eliphalet; "but I cal'late she's got stouter.""That Union principles must be healthy," said he, and laughed.Miss Cluyme was prevented from following up this enigma.The appearance
of two people on Davis Avenue drove the veiled lady from her mind.Eliphalet, too, had seen them.One was the tall young Captain of
Dragoons, in cavalry boots, and the other a young lady with dark brown
hair, in a lawn dress."They think they are alone in the
garden of Eden.But since he's
a captain, and has got a uniform, she's come round pretty quick.I'm
thankful I never had any silly notions about uniforms."She glanced at Eliphalet, to find that his eyes were fixed on the
approaching couple."Clarence is handsome, but worthless," she continued in her sprightly
way."I believe Jinny will be fool enough to marry him.Do you think
she's so very pretty, Mr."Neither do I," Miss Belle assented.And upon that, greatly to
the astonishment of Eliphalet, she left him and ran towards them.she cried; "Jinny, I have something so interesting to tell
you!"The look she bestowed upon Miss Cluyme was
not one of welcome, but Belle was not sensitive.Putting her arm through
Virginia's, she sauntered off with the pair toward the parade grounds,
Clarence maintaining now a distance of three feet, and not caring to
hide his annoyance.Eliphalet's eyes smouldered, following the three until they were lost
in the crowd.That expression of Virginia's had reminded him of a
time, years gone, when she had come into the store on her return from
Kentucky, and had ordered him to tell her father of her arrival.And Eliphalet was not the sort to get over smarts.She has wealth, and manners,
and looks.Too bad he holds such views
on secession.I have always thought, sir, that you were singularly
fortunate in your connection with him."There was a point of light now in each of Mr.Cluyme continued:

"What a pity, I say, that he should run the risk of crippling himself by
his opinions."And southwestern notes are not worth the paper they are written on--"

But Mr.Cluyme has misjudged his man.If he had come to Eliphalet for
information of Colonel Carvel's affairs, or of any one else's affairs,
he was not likely to get it.It is not meet to repeat here the long
business conversation which followed.Cluyme,
who was in dry goods himself, was as ignorant when he left Eliphalet
as when he met him.But he had a greater respect than ever for the
shrewdness of the business manager of Carvel & Company..........................

That same Thursday, when the first families of the city were whispering
jubilantly in each other's ears of the safe arrival of the artillery and
stands of arms at Camp Jackson, something of significance was happening
within the green inclosure of the walls of the United States arsenal,
far to the southward.The days had become alike in sadness to Stephen.Richter gone, and the
Judge often away in mysterious conference, he was left for hours at
a spell the sole tenant of the office.Fortunately there was work of
Richter's and of Mr.Whipple's left undone that kept him busy.This
Thursday morning, however, he found the Judge getting into that best
black coat which he wore on occasions.His manner had recently lost much
of its gruffness."Stephen," said he, "they are serving out cartridges and uniforms to the
regiments at the arsenal.asked Stephen, when they had reached the
street."Captain Lyon is not the man to sit still and let the Governor take the
first trick, sir," said the Judge.As they got on the Fifth Street car, Stephen's attention was at once
attracted to a gentleman who sat in a corner, with his children about
him.He was lean, and he had a face of great keenness and animation.He
had no sooner spied Judge Whipple than he beckoned to him with a kind of
military abruptness."That is Major William T. Sherman," said the Judge to Stephen."He
used to be in the army, and fought in the Mexican War.He came here two
months ago to be the President of this Fifth Street car line."They crossed over to him, the Judge introducing Stephen to Major
Sherman, who looked at him very hard, and then decided to bestow on him
a vigorous nod."Well, Whipple," he said, "this nation is going to the devil; eh?"For it was a bold man who expressed
radical opinions (provided they were not Southern opinions) in a St."Who's man enough in Washington
to shake his fist in a rebel's face?Our leniency--our timidity--has
paralyzed us, sir."By this time those in the car began to manifest considerable interest in
the conversation.Major Sherman paid them no attention, and the Judge,
once launched in an argument, forgot his surroundings."Seventy-five thousand for three months!"said the Major, vehemently,
"a bucketful on a conflagration I tell you, Whipple, we'll need all the
water we've got in the North."The Judge expressed his belief in this, and also that Mr.Lincoln would
draw all the water before he got through.Now's the time to stop
'em.The longer we let 'em rear and kick, the harder to break 'em.You
don't catch me going back to the army for three months.If they want me,
they've got to guarantee me three years.Turning
to Stephen, he added: "Don't you sign any three months' contract, young
man."By this time the car was full, and silent.No one had
offered to quarrel with the Major.Nor did it seem likely that any one
would."I'm afraid I can't go, sir.""Because, sir," said the Judge, bluntly, "his mother's a widow, and they
have no money.He was a lieutenant in one of Blair's companies before
the call came."The Major looked at Stephen, and his expression changed.Stephen's expression must have satisfied him, but he nodded again, more
vigorously than before.But he hoped to fall out of the talk.Much to his
discomfiture, the Major gave him another of those queer looks.His whole
manner, and even his appearance, reminded Stephen strangely of Captain
Elijah Brent."Aren't you the young man who made the Union speech in Mercantile
Library Hall?"At that the Major put out his hand impulsively, and gripped Stephen's."Well, sir," he said, "I have yet to read a more sensible speech, except
some of Abraham Lincoln's.Brinsmade gave it to me to read.Whipple,
that speech reminded me of Lincoln.Lincoln's debate with Judge Douglas at 'Freeport," said
Stephen; beginning to be amused."I admire your frankness, sir," he said."I meant to say that its logic
rather than its substance reminded one of Lincoln.""I tried to learn what I could from him, Major Sherman."At length the car stopped, and they passed into the Arsenal grounds.Drawn up in lines on the green grass were four regiments, all at last
in the blue of their country's service.Old soldiers with baskets of
cartridges were stepping from file to file, giving handfuls to the
recruits.Many of these thrust them in their pockets, for there were not
enough belts to go around.The men were standing at ease, and as Stephen
saw them laughing and joking lightheartedly his depression returned.It was driven away again by Major Sherman's vivacious comments.For
suddenly Captain Lyon, the man of the hour, came into view.cried the Major, "he's a man after my own heart.Just
look at him running about with his hair flying in the wind, and the
papers bulging from his pockets.But
this isn't the time to be dignified.If there were some like Lyon in
Washington, our troops would be halfway to New Orleans by this time.The gallant Captain was a sight, indeed, and vividly described by Major
Sherman's picturesque words as he raced from regiment to regiment,
and from company to company, with his sandy hair awry, pointing,
gesticulating, commanding.In him Stephen recognized the force that had
swept aside stubborn army veterans of wavering faith, that snapped the
tape with which they had tied him.Would he be duped by the Governor's ruse of establishing a State Camp at
this time?Stephen, as he gazed at him, was sure that he would not.This
man could see to the bottom, through every specious argument.Little
matters of law and precedence did not trouble him.Nor did he believe
elderly men in authority when they told gravely that the state troops
were there for peace.After the ranks were broken, Major Sherman and the Judge went to talk to
Captain Lyon and the Union Leader, who was now a Colonel of one of
the Volunteer regiments.Stephen sought Richter, who told him that the
regiments were to assemble the morning of the morrow, prepared to march."We are not consulted, my friend," he said."Will you come into my
quarters and have a bottle of beer with Tiefel?"It was not their fault that his sense at their comradeship
was gone.To him it was as if the ties that had bound him to them were
asunder, and he was become an outcast.THE STONE THAT IS REJECTED

That Friday morning Stephen awoke betimes with a sense that something
was to happen.For a few moments he lay still in the half comprehension
which comes after sleep when suddenly he remembered yesterday's
incidents at the Arsenal, and leaped out of bed."I think that Lyon is going to attack Camp Jackson to-day," he said to
his mother after breakfast, when Hester had left the room."I went down to the Arsenal with the Judge yesterday and saw them
finishing the equipment of the new regiments.Any one could see that from the way Lyon was flying about.I think he
must have proof that the Camp Jackson people have received supplies from
the South."Brice looked fixedly at her son, and then smiled in spite of the
apprehension she felt."Is that why you were working over that map of the city last night?""I was trying to see how Lyon would dispose his troops.I meant to tell
you about a gentleman we met in the street car, a Major Sherman who used
to be in the army.Brinsmade knows him, and Judge Whipple, and many
other prominent men here.Louis some months ago to take
the position of president of the Fifth Street Line.He is the keenest,
the most original man I have ever met.As long as I live I shall never
forget his description of Lyon.""Is the Major going back into the army?"Brice, Stephen
did not remark the little falter in her voice.He laughed over the
recollection of the conversation in the street car."Not unless matters in Washington change to suit him," he said."He
thinks that things have been very badly managed, and does not scruple
to say so anywhere.I could not have believed it possible that two men
could have talked in public as he and Judge Whipple did yesterday and
not be shot down.I thought that it was as much as a man's life is worth
to mention allegiance to the Union here in a crowd.Sherman pitched into the Rebels in that car full of people was enough to
make your hair stand on end.""He must be a bold man," murmured Mrs."Does he think that the--the Rebellion can be put down?""Not with seventy-five thousand men, nor with ten times that number."Brice sighed, and furtively wiped her eyes with her handkerchief."I am afraid we shall see great misery, Stephen," she said.From that peaceful little room war and its horrors seemed
very far away.The morning sun poured in through the south windows and
was scattered by the silver on the sideboard.From above, on the wall,
Colonel Wilton Brice gazed soberly down.Stephen's eyes lighted on the
portrait, and his thoughts flew back to the boyhood days when he used to
ply his father with questions about it.Then the picture had suggested
only the glory and honor which illumines the page of history.Something
worthy to look back upon, to keep ones head high.The hatred and the
suffering and the tears, the heartrending, tearing apart for all time of
loving ones who have grown together,--these were not upon that canvas,
Will war ever be painted with a wart?The sound of feet was heard on the pavement.Stephen rose, glancing at
his mother."I am going to the Arsenal," he said.To her, as has been said, was given wisdom beyond most women.She did
not try to prevent him as he kissed her good-by.But when the door had
shut behind him, a little cry escaped her, and she ran to the window to
strain her eyes after him until he had turned the corner below.His steps led him irresistibly past the house of the strange flag,
ominously quiet at that early hour.At sight of it anger made him hot
again.Louis stood at the end of the line, fast
filling with curious people who had read in their papers that morning of
the equipment of the new troops.There was little talk among them, and
that little guarded.It was a May morning to rouse a sluggard; the night air tingled into
life at the touch of the sunshine, the trees in the flitting glory
of their first green.Stephen found the shaded street in front of the
Arsenal already filled with an expectant crowd.Sharp commands broke the
silence, and he saw the blue regiments forming on the lawn inside the
wall.Truly, events were in the air,--great events in which he had no
part.As he stood leaning against a tree-box by the curb, dragged down once
more by that dreaded feeling of detachment, he heard familiar voices
close beside him.Leaning forward, he saw Eliphalet Hopper and Mr.Hopper," he said, "in spite of what you say, I expect you
are dust as eager as I am to see what is going on.You've taken an early
start this morning for sightseeing."Eliphalet's equanimity was far from shaken."I don't cal'late to take a great deal of stock in the military," he
answered.And a man must keep an eye on what
is moving."Cluyme ran his hand through his chop whiskers, and lowered his
voice."You're right, Hopper," he assented."And if this city is going to be
Union, we ought to know it right away."Stephen, listening with growing indignation to this talk, was unaware of
a man who stood on the other side of the tree, and who now came forward
before Mr."My friend," said the stranger, quietly, "I think we have met before,
when your actions were not greatly to your credit.I do not forget a
face, even when I see it in the dark.Now I hear you utter words which
are a disgrace to a citizen of the United States.As soon as Stephen recovered from the shock of his surprise, he saw that
Eliphalet had changed countenance.The manner of an important man of
affairs, which he hay so assiduously cultivated, fell away from him.He
took a step backward, and his eyes made an ugly shift.Stephen rejoiced
to see the stranger turn his back on the manager of Carvel & Company
before that dignitary had time to depart, and stand unconcernedly there
as if nothing had occurred.He was not a man you would look at twice, ordinarily, he was smoking a
great El Sol cigar.He wore clothes that were anything but new, a slouch
hat, and coarse grained, square-toed boots.His trousers were creased at
the knees.His head fell forward a little from his square shoulders, and
leaned a bit to one side, as if meditatively.He had a light brown beard
that was reddish in the sun, and he was rather short than otherwise.And yet the very plainness of the man's
appearance only added to his curiosity.His
words, his action, too, had been remarkable.The art of administering
a rebuke like that was not given to many men.It was perfectly quiet,
perfectly final.And then, when it was over, he had turned his back and
dismissed it.Next Stephen began to wonder what he could know about Hopper.Stephen
had suspected Eliphalet of subordinating principles to business gain,
and hence the conversation with Mr.Cluyme had given him no shock in
the way of a revelation, But if Hopper were a rogue, ought not Colonel
Carvel to hear it?Ought not he, Stephen Brice, to ask this man with the
cigar what he knew, and tell Judge Whipple?The sudden rattle of drums
gave him a start, and cruelly reminded him of the gulf of prejudice and
hatred fast widening between the friends.All this time the stranger stood impassively chewing his cigar, his hand
against the tree-box.A regiment in column came out of the Arsenal gate,
the Union leader in his colonel's uniform, on horseback at its head.He pulled up in the street opposite to Stephen, and sat in his saddle,
chatting with other officers around him.Then the stranger stepped across the limestone gutter and walked up
to the Colonel's horse, He was still smoking.This move, too, was
surprising enough, It argued even more assurance."Colonel Blair, my name is Grant," he said briefly.The Colonel faced quickly about, and held out his gloved hand cordially,
"Captain Ulysses Grant," said he; "of the old army?""I wanted to wish you luck," he said."Thank you, Grant," answered the Colonel."I moved to Illinois after I left here," replied Mr.Grant, as quietly
as before, "and have been in Galena, in the Leather business there.I
went down to Springfield with the company they organized in Galena, to
be of any help I could.They made me a clerk in the adjutant general's
office of the state I ruled blanks, and made out forms for a while."He
paused, as if to let the humble character of this position sink into
the Colonel's comprehension."Then they found out that I'd been
quartermaster and commissary, and knew something about military orders
Now I'm a state mustering officer.I came down to Belleville to muster
in a regiment, which wasn't ready.And so I ran over here to see what
you fellows were doing."If this humble account had been delivered volubly, and in another tone,
it is probable that the citizen-colonel would not have listened, since
the events of that day were to crown his work of a winter.Grant
possessed a manner of holding attention.. It was very evident, however;
that Colonel Blair had other things to think of.Nevertheless he said
kindly:

"Aren't you going in, Grant?""I can't afford to go in as a captain of volunteers," was the calm
reply: "I served nine years in the regular army and I think I can
command a regiment."The Colonel, whose attention was called away at that moment, did not
reply.Some of the younger officers
who were there, laughed as they followed his retreating figure.cried one, a lieutenant whom Stephen recognized
as having been a bookkeeper at Edwards, James, & Doddington's, and whose
stiff blue uniform coat creased awkwardly."I guess I'm about as fit to
command a regiment as Grant is.""That man's forty years old, if he's a day," put in another."I remember
when he came here to St.He'd resigned from
the army on the Pacific Coast.He put up a log cabin down on the Gravois
Road, and there he lived in the hardest luck of any man I ever saw until
last year."I spotted him by the El Sol cigar.He used to bring a
load of wood to the city once in a while, and then he'd go over to the
Planters' House, or somewhere else, and smoke one of these long fellows,
and sit against the wall as silent as a wooden Indian.After that he
came up to the city without his family and went into real estate one
winter.Curious, it is just a year ago this
month than he went over to Illinois.He's an honest fellow, and hard
working enough, but he don't know how.laughed the first, again, as of this in particular
had struck his sense of humor."I guess he won't get a regiment in a
hurry, There's lots of those military carpet-baggers hanging around for
good jobs now.""He might fool you fellows yet," said the one caller, though his tone
was not one of conviction."I understand he had a first-rate record an
the Mexican War."Just then an aide rode up, and the Colonel gave a sharp command which
put an end to this desultory talk.As the First Regiment took up
the march, the words "Camp Jackson" ran from mouth to mouth on the
sidewalks.Catching fire, Stephen ran with the crowd, and leaping on
passing street car, was borne cityward with the drums of the coming
hosts beating in his ears.In the city, shutters were going up on the stores.The streets were
filled with, restless citizens seeking news, and drays were halted here
and there on the corners, the white eyes and frenzied calls of the <DW64>
drivers betraying their excitement.While Stephen related to his mother
the events of the morning, Hester burned the dinner.It lay; still
untouched, on the table when the throbbing of drums sent them to the
front steps.Sigel's regiment had swung into the street, drawing in its
wake a seething crowd.Three persons came out of the big house next door.One was Anna
Brinsmade; and there was her father, his white hairs uncovered.His sister was cringing to him appealingly, and he
struggling in her grasp.Out of his coat pocket hung the curved butt of
a pepperbox revolver."Do you think I can stay here while my
people are shot down by a lot of damned Dutchman?"Brinsmade, sternly, "I cannot let you join a mob.I
cannot let you shoot at men who carry the Union flag.""You cannot prevent me, sir," shouted the young man, in a frenzy."When
foreigners take our flag for them own, it is time for us to shoot them
down."Wrenching himself free, he ran down the steps and up the street ahead of
the regiment.Then the soldiers and the noisy crowd were upon them and
while these were passing the two stood there as in a dream.After that
silence fell upon the street, and Mr.Brinsmade turned and went back
into the house, his head bowed as in prayer.Stephen and his mother drew
back, but Anne saw them."He is a rebel," she faltered.She looked at Stephen appealingly, unashamed of the tears in her eyes."I cannot stay here mother," he said.As he slammed the gate, Anne ran down the steps calling his name.He
paused, and she caught his sleeve."I knew you would go," she said, "I knew you would go.Oh, Stephen, you
have a cool head.But when he reached the corner and
looked back he saw that she had gone in at his own little gate to
meet his mother.Now and again he was
stopped by feverish questions, but at length he reached the top of the
second ridge from the river, along which crowded Eighteenth Street now
runs.Spencer Catherwood had
built two years before on the outskirts of the town, with the wall at
the side, and the brick stable and stable yard.As Stephen approached
it, the thought came to him how little this world's goods avail in times
of trouble.One of the big Catherwood boys was in the blue marching
regiment that day, and had been told by his father never again to darken
his doors.Another was in Clarence Colfax's company of dragoons, and
still another had fled southward the night after Sumter.Stephen stopped at the crest of the hill, in the white dust of the
new-turned street, to gaze westward.Clouds were gathering in the sky,
but the sun still shone brightly, Half way up the rise two blue lines
had crawled, followed by black splotches, and at the southwest was the
glint of the sun on rifle barrels.Directed by a genius in the art of
war, the regiments were closing about Camp Jackson.As he stood there meditating and paying no attention to those who
hurried past, a few familiar notes were struck on a piano.They came
through the wide-shuttered window above his head.Then a girl's voice
rose above the notes, in tones that were exultant:--

       "Away down South in de fields of cotton,
        Cinnamon seed and sandy bottom,
        Look away, look away, Look away, look away.Den I wish I was in Dixie's Land,
        Oh, oh!In Dixie's Land I'll take my stand,
        And live and die in Dixie's Land.The song ceased amid peals of girlish laughter.Jinny Carvel, how dare you!""We
shall have a whole regiment of Hessians in here."Old Uncle Ben, the Catherwoods' coachman, came out of the stable yard.The whites of his eyes were rolling, half in amusement, half in terror.Seeing Stephen standing there, he exclaimed:

"Mistah Brice, if de Dutch take Camp Jackson, is we <DW65>s gwinter be
free?"Stephen did not answer, for the piano had started again,

       "If ever I consent to be married,
        And who could refuse a good mate?The man whom I give my hand to,
        Must believe in the Rights of the State."Then the blinds were flung aside, and a young lady in
a dress of white trimmed with crimson stood in the window, smiling.For an
instant she stared at him, and then turned to the girls crowding behind
her.What she said, he did not wait to hear.THE TENTH OF MAY

Would the sons of the first families surrender, "Never!"cried a young
lady who sat behind the blinds in Mrs.It seemed to
her when she stopped to listen for the first guns of the coming battle
that the tumult in her heart would drown their roar."But, Jinny," ventured that Miss Puss Russell who never feared to speak
her mind, "it would be folly for them to fight.The Dutch and Yankees
outnumber them ten to one, and they haven't any powder and bullets.""And Camp Jackson is down in a hollow," said Maude Catherwood,
dejectedly.And yet hopefully, too, for at the thought of bloodshed she
was near to fainting."Oh," exclaimed Virginia, passionately, "I believe you want them to
surrender.I should rather see Clarence dead than giving his sword to a
Yankee."At that the other two were silent again, and sat on through an endless
afternoon of uncertainty and hope and dread in the darkened room.Catherwood's heavy step was heard as he paced the hall.From time to time they glanced at Virginia, as if to fathom her
thought.She and Puss Russell had come that day to dine with Maude.Catherwood's Ben, reeking of the stable, had brought the rumor of the
marching on the camp into the dining-room, and close upon the heels of
this the rumble of the drums and the passing of Sigel's regiment.It was
Virginia who had the presence of mind to slam the blinds in the faces of
the troops, and the crowd had cheered her.It was Virginia who flew to
the piano to play Dixie ere they could get by, to the awe and admiration
of the girls and the delight of Mr.Catherwood who applauded her spirit
despite the trouble which weighed upon him.Once more the crowd had
cheered,--and hesitated.But the Dutch regiment slouched on, impassive,
and the people followed.Virginia remained at the piano, her mood exalted patriotism, uplifted
in spirit by that grand song.At first she had played it with all her
might.She laughed in very scorn of the booby soldiers
she had seen.A million of these, with all the firearms in the world,
could not prevail against the flower of the South.Then she had begun
whimsically to sing a verse of a song she had heard the week before, and
suddenly her exaltation was fled, and her fingers left the keys.Gaining
the window, trembling, half-expectant, she flung open a blind.The troops, the people, were gone, and there alone in the road
stood--Stephen Brice.The others close behind her saw him, too, and Puss
cried out in her surprise.The impression, when the room was dark once
more, was of sternness and sadness,--and of strength.Effaced was the
picture of the plodding recruits with their coarse and ill-fitting
uniforms of blue.Not a word escaped her, nor could they tell
why--they did not dare to question her then.An hour passed, perhaps
two, before the shrill voice of a boy was heard in the street below.They heard the patter of his bare feet on the pavement, and the cry
repeated.Bitter before, now was she on fire.Close her lips as tightly as she might, the tears forced themselves to
her eyes.How hard it is for us of this age to understand that feeling.The girls gathered around her, pale and frightened and anxious.Suddenly
courage returned to her, the courage which made Spartans of Southern
women.Catherwood was on the sidewalk,
talking to a breathless man.Barbo, Colonel Carvel's
book-keeper."Yes," he was saying, "they--they surrendered.There was nothing else
for them to do.Catherwood from a kind of stupor."Virginia, we shall make them smart for this yet, My God!"he cried,
"what have I done that my son should be a traitor, in arms against his
own brother fighting for his people?To think that a Catherwood should
be with the Yankees!You, Ben," he shouted, suddenly perceiving an
object for his anger."What do you mean by coming out of the yard?By
G-d, I'll have you whipped.I'll show you <DW65>s whether you're to be
free or not."Catherwood was a good man, who treated his servants well.Suddenly he dropped Virginia's hand and ran westward down the hill.Well
that she could not see beyond the second rise.Let us stand on the little mound at
the northeast of it, on the Olive Street Road, whence Captain Lyon's
artillery commands it.Davis Avenue is
no longer a fashionable promenade, flashing with bright dresses.Those
quiet men in blue, who are standing beside the arms of the state troops,
stacked and surrendered, are United States regulars.They have been in
Kansas, and are used to scenes of this sort.The five Hessian regiments have surrounded the camp.Each commander
has obeyed the master mind of his chief, who has calculated the time
of marching with precision.Here, at the western gate, Colonel Blair's
regiment is in open order.See the prisoners taking their places between
the ranks, some smiling, as if to say all is not over yet; some with
heads hung down, in sulky shame.Still others, who are true to the
Union, openly relieved.But who is this officer breaking his sword to
bits against the fence, rather than surrender it to a Yankee?Listen to
the crowd as they cheer him.Listen to the epithets and vile names which
they hurl at the stolid blue line of the victors, "Mudsills!""<DW64>
Worshippers."Yes, the crowd is there, seething with conflicting passions.Men with
brows bent and fists clenched, yelling excitedly.Others pushing, and
eager to see,--there in curiosity only.And, alas, women and children
by the score, as if what they looked upon were not war, but a parade,
a spectacle.As the gray uniforms file out of the gate, the crowd has
become a mob, now flowing back into the fields on each side of the road,
now pressing forward vindictively until stopped by the sergeants and
corporals.Listen to them calling to sons, and brothers, and husbands in
gray!See, there is a woman who spits in a soldier's face!Throughout it all, the officers sit their horses, unmoved.A man on the
bank above draws a pistol and aims at a captain.A German private steps
from the ranks, forgetful of discipline, and points at the man, who is
cursing the captain's name.The captain, imperturbable, orders his man
back to his place.Now are the prisoners of that regiment all in place between the two
files of it.A band (one of those which played lightsome music on the
birthday of the camp) is marched around to the head of the column.The
regiment with its freight moves on to make place for a battalion of
regulars, amid imprecations and cries of "Hurrah for Jeff Davis!"Stephen Brice stood among the people in Lindell's Grove, looking up at
the troops on the road, which was on an embankment.Through the rows of
faces he had searched in vain for one.His motive he did not attempt
to fathom--in truth, he was not conscious at the time of any motive.He
heard the name shouted at the gate."Here they are,--the dragoons!Dismounted, at the head of his
small following, the young Captain walked erect.He did not seem to hear
the cheers.His face was set, and he held his gloved hand over the place
where his sword had been, as if over a wound.On his features, in his
attitude, was stamped the undying determination of the South.How those
thoroughbreds of the Cavaliers showed it!The
fire of humiliation burned, but could not destroy their indomitable
spirit.They were the first of their people in the field, and the last
to leave it.Historians may say that the classes of the South caused the
war; they cannot say that they did not take upon themselves the greatest
burden of the suffering.Twice that day was the future revealed to Stephen.Once as he stood
on the hill-crest, when he had seen a girl in crimson and white in
a window,--in her face.And now again he read it in the face of her
cousin.It was as if he had seen unrolled the years of suffering that
were to come.In that moment of deep bitterness his reason wavered.Surely there was no such feeling in the North as these
people betrayed.That most dangerous of gifts, the seeing of two
sides of a quarrel, had been given him.He
sympathized with the Southern people.They had befriended him in his
poverty.Why had he not been born, like Clarence Colfax, the owner of a
large plantation, the believer in the divine right of his race to rule?Would that his path had been as
straight, his duty as easy, as that of the handsome young Captain.Presently these thoughts were distracted by the sight of a back
strangely familiar.The back belonged to a gentleman who was
energetically climbing the embankment in front of him, on the top
of which Major Sexton, a regular, army officer, sat his horse.The
gentleman was pulling a small boy after him by one hand, and held a
newspaper tightly rolled in the other.Stephen smiled to himself when it
came over him that this gentleman was none other than that Mr.William
T. Sherman he had met in the street car the day before.Somehow Stephen
was fascinated by the decision and energy of Mr.He gave Major Saxton a salute, quick and genial.Then, almost
with one motion he unrolled the newspaper, pointed to a paragraph, and
handed it to the officer.Major Saxton was still reading when a drunken
ruffian clambered up the bank behind them and attempted to pass through
the lines.Sherman slid down the
bank with his boy into the grove beside Stephen.A corporal pitched the drunkard backwards over the bank, and
he rolled at Mr.With a curse, he picked himself up,
fumbling in his pocket.There was a flash, and as the smoke rolled from
before his eyes, Stephen saw a man of a German regiment stagger and
fall.It was the signal for a rattle of shots.Stones and bricks filled the
air, and were heard striking steel and flesh in the ranks.The regiment
quivered,--then halted at the loud command of the officers, and the
ranks faced out with level guns, Stephen reached for Mr.Sherman's boy,
but a gentleman had already thrown him and was covering his body.He contrived to throw down a woman standing beside him before the
mini-balls swished over their heads, and the leaves and branches began
to fall.Between the popping of the shots sounded the shrieks of wounded
women and children, the groans and curses of men, and the stampeding of
hundreds.He was about to obey when a young; man, small and agile, ran past him
from behind, heedless of the panic.Stopping at the foot of the bank he
dropped on one knee, resting his revolver in the hollow of his left
arm.At the same time two of the soldiers above
lowered their barrels to cover him.When it
rolled away, Brinsmade lay on the ground.He staggered to his feet with
an oath, and confronted a young man who was hatless, and upon whose
forehead was burned a black powder mark.he cried, reaching out wildly, "curse you, you d--d Yankee.Maddened, he made a rush at Stephen's throat.But Stephen seized his
hands and bent them down, and held them firmly while he kicked and
struggled.he panted; "curse you, you let me go and I'll kill
you,--you Yankee upstart!"One of the
officers, seeing the struggle, started down the bank, was reviled, and
hesitated."Let him go, Brice," he said, in a tone of command.Whereupon Brinsmade made a dash for his pistol on the ground."Now see here, Jack," he said, picking it up, "I don't want to shoot
you, but I may have to.That young man saved your life at the risk of
his own.If that fool Dutchman had had a ball in his gun instead of a
wad, Mr.Brinsmade took one long look at Stephen,
turned on his heel, and walked off rapidly through the grove.And it may
be added that for some years after he was not seen in St.For a moment the other two stood staring after him.Sherman
took his boy by the hand.Brice," he said, "I've seen a few things done in my life, but
nothing better than this.Perhaps the day may come when you and I may
meet in the army.They don't seem to think much of us now," he added,
smiling, "but we may be of use to 'em later.If ever I can serve you,
Mr.Brice, I beg you to call on me."Sherman, nodding his head
vigorously, went away southward through the grove, toward Market Street.The dead were being laid in carriages, and the
wounded tended by such physicians as chanced to be on the spot.Stephen,
dazed at what had happened, took up the march to town.He strode faster
than the regiments with their load of prisoners, and presently he found
himself abreast the little file of dragoons who were guarded by some of
Blair's men.It was then that he discovered that the prisoners' band in
front was playing "Dixie."They are climbing the second hill, and are coming now to the fringe
of new residences which the rich citizens have built.In the windows and on the steps of others women are
crying or waving handkerchiefs and calling out to the prisoners, some
of whom are gay, and others sullen.A distracted father tries to break
through the ranks and rescue his son.Ah, here is the Catherwood house.Catherwood, with her hand on her husband's arm, with
red eyes, is scanning those faces for the sight of George.Will the Yankees murder him for treason,
or send him North to languish the rest of his life?James has,
across the street, and is even now being carried into the house.Few
of us can see into the hearts of those women that day, and speak of the
suffering there.His face is cast down as
he passes the house from which he is banished.Nor do father, or mother,
or sister in their agony make any sound or sign.The
welcome and the mourning and the tears are all for him.The band is playing "Dixie" once more.George is coming, and some one
else.The girls are standing in a knot bend the old people, dry-eyed,
their handkerchiefs in their hands.Some of the prisoners take off their
hats and smile at the young lady with the chiselled features and brown
hair, who wears the red and white of the South as if she were born to
them.Ah, at last she sees him, walking erect
at the head of his dragoons.He gives her one look of entreaty, and that
smile which should have won her heart long ago.As if by common consent
the heads of the troopers are uncovered before her.How bravely she
waves at them until they are gone down the street!Then only do her eyes
fill with tears, and she passes into the house.Had she waited, she might have seen a solitary figure leaving the line
of march and striding across to Pine Street.That night the sluices of the heavens were opened, and the blood was
washed from the grass in Lindell Grove.The rain descended in floods
on the distracted city, and the great river rose and flung brush from
Minnesota forests high up on the stones of the levee.Down in the long
barracks weary recruits, who had stood and marched all the day long,
went supperless to their hard pallets.Many a boy, prisoner or volunteer, sobbed
himself to sleep in the darkness.All were prisoners alike, prisoners
of war.Sobbed themselves to sleep, to dream of the dear homes that were
here within sight and sound of them, and to which they were powerless to
go.Sisters, and mothers, and wives were there, beyond the rain, holding
out arms to them.But what of
the long nights when husband and wife have lain side by side?What of
the children who ask piteously where their father is going, and who are
gathered by a sobbing mother to her breast?Where is the picture of that
last breakfast at home?So in the midst of the cheer which is saddest in
life comes the thought that, just one year ago, he who is the staff
of the house was wont to sit down just so merrily to his morning meal,
before going to work in the office.Why had they not thanked God on
their knees for peace while they had it?See the brave little wife waiting on the porch of her home for him to go
by.The sun shines, and the grass is green on the little plot, and the
geraniums red.Last spring she was sewing here with a song on her lips,
watching for him to turn the corner as he came back to dinner.Her good
neighbors, the doctor and his wife, come in at the little gate to cheer
her.Why does God mock her with sunlight and
with friends?And that is his dear face, the second from the end.Look, he is smiling bravely, as if to say a thousand
tender things."Will, are the flannels in your knapsack?You have not
forgotten that medicine for your cough?"What courage sublime is that
which lets her wave at him?Well for you, little woman, that you cannot
see the faces of the good doctor and his wife behind you.Oh, those guns
of Sumter, how they roar in your head!Ay, and will roar again, through
forty years of widowhood!Brice was in the little parlor that Friday night, listening to the
cry of the rain outside.Why
should she be happy, and other mothers miserable?The day of reckoning
for her happiness must surely come, when she must kiss Stephen a brave
farewell and give him to his country.For the sins of the fathers are
visited on the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them
that hate Him who is the Ruler of all things.The bell rang, and Stephen went to the door.That gentleman was suddenly aged, and his clothes were wet
and spattered with mud.He sank into a chair, but refused the spirits
and water which Mrs."Stephen," he said, "I have been searching the city for John.Did you
see him at Camp Jackson--was he hurt?""I think not, sir," Stephen answered, with clear eyes."I saw him walking southward after the firing was all over.""If you will excuse me,
madam, I shall hurry to tell my wife and daughter.I have been able to
find no one who saw him."As he went out he glanced at Stephen's forehead.But for once in his
life, Mr.Brinsmade was too much agitated to inquire about the pain of
another."Stephen, you did not tell me that you saw John," said his mother, when
the door was closed.IN THE ARSENAL

There was a dismal tea at Colonel Carvel's house in Locust Street that
evening Virginia did not touch a mouthful, and the Colonel merely made a
pretence of eating.Addison Colfax had driven in
from Bellegarde, nor could it rain fast enough or hard enough to wash
the foam from her panting horses.She did not wait for Jackson to come
out with an umbrella, but rushed through the wet from the carriage
to the door in her haste to urge the Colonel to go to the Arsenal and
demand Clarence's release.Carvel assured her
it would do no good, in vain that he told her of a more important matter
that claimed him.Could there be a more important matter than his
own nephew kept in durance, and in danger of being murdered by Dutch
butchers in the frenzy of their victory?Colfax shut herself up in
her room, and through the door Virginia heard her sobs as she went down
to tea.The Colonel made no secret of his uneasiness.With his hat on his head,
and his hands in his pockets, he paced up and down the room.He let his
cigar go out,--a more serious sign still.Finally he stood with his face
to the black window, against which the big drops were beating in a fury.Virginia sat expressionless at the head of the table, still in that gown
of white and crimson, which she had worn in honor of the defenders of
the state.Expressionless, save for a glance of solicitation at her
father's back.If resolve were feminine, Virginia might have sat for
that portrait.There was a light in her dark blue eyes.Underneath there
were traces of the day's fatigue.When she spoke, there was little life
in her voice."Aren't you going to the Planters' House, Pa The Colonel turned, and
tried to smile."I reckon not to-night, Jinny."To find out what they are going to do with Clarence," she said
indignantly."I reckon they don't know at the Planters' House," he said."Then--" began Virginia, and stopped."Then why not go to the Barracks?Order the carriage, and I will go with
you."He stood looking down at her fixedly, as was sometimes
his habit."Jinny," he said slowly, "Jinny, do you mean to marry Clarence?"The suddenness of the question took her breath.But she answered
steadily:

"Yes."Still he stood, and it seemed to her that her father's gaze pierced to
her secret soul."Come here, my dear," he said.He held out his arms, and she fluttered into them.It was not the first time she had cried out her troubles
against that great heart which had ever been her strong refuge.From
childhood she had been comforted there.Had she broken her doll, had
Mammy Easter been cross, had lessons gone wrong at school, was she
ill, or weary with that heaviness of spirit which is woman's inevitable
lot,--this was her sanctuary.This burden God Himself had sent,
and none save her Heavenly Father might cure it.Through his great love
for her it was given to Colonel Carvel to divine it--only vaguely.Many times he strove to speak, and could not.But presently, as if
ashamed of her tears, she drew back from him and took her old seat on
the arm of his chair.By the light of his intuition, the Colonel chose tins words well.What
he had to speak of was another sorrow, yet a healing one."You must not think of marriage now, my dear, when the bread we eat may
fail us.Jinny, we are not as rich as we used to be.Our trade was
in the South and West, and now the South and West cannot pay.Hopper yesterday, and he tells me that we must be
prepared.""And did you think I would care, dear?""I can bear
with poverty and rags, to win this war.""His own eyes were dim, but pride shone in them.Jackson came in on
tiptoe, and hesitated.At the Colonel's motion he took away the china
and the silver, and removed the white cloth, and turned low the lights
in the chandelier.He went out softly, and closed the door."Pa," said Virginia, presently, "do you trust Mr.He improved the business greatly before this trouble
came.And even now we are not in such straits as some other houses.""Eliphalet Hopper will serve you so long as
he serves himself."I think you do him an injustice, my dear," answered the Colonel.But
uneasiness was in his voice."Hopper is hard working, scrupulous to a
cent.He owns two slaves now who are running the river.He keeps out of
politics, and he has none of the Yankee faults."Getting up, he went over to the
bell-cord at the door and pulled it."To Jefferson City, dear, to see the Governor.He smiled, and stooped to kiss her."Yes," he answered, "in the rain as far as the depot, I can trust
you, Jinny.And Lige's boat will be back from New Orleans to-morrow or
Sunday."The next morning the city awoke benumbed, her heart beating but feebly.A long line of boats lay idle,
with noses to the levee.Men stood on the street corners in the rain,
reading of the capture of Camp Jackson, and of the riot, and thousands
lifted up their voices to execrate the Foreign City below Market Street.A vague terror, maliciously born, subtly spread.The Dutch had broken
up the camp, a peaceable state institution, they had shot down innocent
women and children.What might they not do to the defenceless city under
their victorious hand, whose citizens were nobly loyal to the South?Ladies who ventured out that day
crossed the street to avoid Union gentlemen of their acquaintance.It was early when Mammy Easter brought the news paper to her mistress.Virginia read the news, and ran joyfully to her aunt's room.Three times
she knocked, and then she heard a cry within.Then the key was turned
and the bolt cautiously withdrawn, and a crack of six inches disclosed
her aunt."Oh, how you frightened me, Jinny!""I thought it was the
Dutch coming to murder us all, What have they done to Clarence?""We shall see him to-day, Aunt Lillian," was the joyful answer."The
newspaper says that all the Camp Jackson prisoners are to be set free
to-day, on parole.Oh, I knew they would not dare to hold them.The
whole state would have risen to their rescue."Colfax did not receive these tidings with transports.She permitted
her niece to come into her room, and then: sank into a chair before the
mirror of her dressing-table, and scanned her face there."I could not sleep a wink, Jinny, all night long.I
am afraid I am going to have another of my attacks."I'll get it for you," said Virginia, used to her aunt's vagaries."It says that they will be paroled to-day, and that they passed a
comfortable night.""It must be a Yankee lie," said the lady.I saw them
torturing him in a thousand ways the barbarians!I know he had to sleep
on a dirty floor with low-down trash.""But we shall have him here to-night, Aunt Lillian!""Mammy, tell Uncle Ben that Mr."Has he gone down to see
Clarence?""He went to Jefferson City last night," replied Virginia.Colfax exclaimed in horror at this news."Do you mean that he has deserted us?""That he has left us
here defenceless,--at the mercy of the Dutch, that they may wreak their
vengeance upon us women?If I were your
age and able to drag myself to the street, I should be at the Arsenal
now.I should be on my knees before that detestable Captain Lyon, even
if he is a Yankee.""I do not go on my knees to any man," she said."Rosetta, tell Ned I
wish the carriage at once."Her aunt seized her convulsively by the arm."Your Pa would never forgive
me if anything happened to you."A smile, half pity, crossed the girl's anxious face."I am afraid that I must risk adding to your misfortune, Aunt Lillian,"
she said, and left the room.His was one of the Union houses which
she might visit and not lose her self respect.Like many Southerners,
when it became a question of go or stay, Mr.Brinsmade's unfaltering
love for the Union had kept him in.Bell, and later
had presided at Crittenden Compromise meetings.In short, as a man of
peace, he would have been willing to sacrifice much for peace.And now
that it was to be war, and he had taken his stand uncompromisingly with
the Union, the neighbors whom he had befriended for so many years could
not bring themselves to regard him as an enemy.He never hurt their
feelings; and almost as soon as the war began he set about that work
which has been done by self-denying Christians of all ages,--the relief
of suffering.He visited with comfort the widow and the fatherless, and
many a night in the hospital he sat through beside the dying, Yankee and
Rebel alike, and wrote their last letters home.And Yankee and Rebel alike sought his help and counsel in time of
perplexity or trouble, rather than hotheaded advice from their own
leaders.Brinsmade's own carriage was drawn up at his door; and that
gentleman himself standing on the threshold.He came down his steps
bareheaded in the wet to hand Virginia from her carriage.Courteous and kind as ever, he asked for her father and her aunt as
he led her into the house.However such men may try to hide their own
trials under a cheerful mien, they do not succeed with spirits of a
kindred nature.With the others, who are less generous, it matters
not.Virginia was not so thoughtless nor so selfish that she could not
perceive that a trouble had come to this good man.Absorbed as she was
in her own affairs, she forgot some of them in his presence.The fire
left her tongue, and to him she could not have spoken harshly even of
an enemy.Such was her state of mind, when she was led into the
drawing-room.From the corner of it Anne arose and came forward to throw
her arms around her friend."Jinny, it was so good of you to come."Because we are Union," said honest Anne, wishing to have no shadow of
doubt."Anne," she cried, "if you were German, I believe
I should love you."I should not have dared go to your house,
because I know that you feel so deeply."That Jack has run away--has gone South, we think.Perhaps," she cried,
"perhaps he may be dead."She drew Anne to the sofa and
kissed her."No, he is not dead," she said gently, but with a confidence in her
voice of rare quality."He is not dead, Anne dear, or you would have
heard."Had she glanced up, she would have seen Mr.He
looked kindly at all people, but this expression he reserved for those
whom he honored.A life of service to others had made him guess that,
in the absence of her father, this girl had come to him for help of some
kind."Virginia is right, Anne," he said."John has gone to fight for his
principles, as every gentleman who is free should; we must remember
that this is his home, and that we must not quarrel with him, because
we think differently.""There is
something I can do for you, my dear?"And yet her honesty was as
great as Anne's.She would not have it thought that she came for other
reasons."My aunt is in such a state of worry over Clarence that I came
to ask you if you thought the news true, that the prisoners are to be
paroled.She thinks it is a--" Virginia flushed, and bit a rebellious
tongue.Brinsmade smiled at the slip she had nearly made.He
understood the girl, and admired her."I'll drive to the Arsenal with you, Jinny," he answered."I know
Captain Lyon, and we shall find out certainly.""You will do nothing of the kind, sir," said Virginia, with emphasis."Had I known this--about John, I should not have come."What a gentleman of the old school
he was, with his white ruffled shirt and his black stock and his eye
kindling with charity."My dear," he answered, "Nicodemus is waiting.I was just going myself
to ask Captain Lyon about John."Virginia's further objections were cut
short by the violent clanging of the door-bell, and the entrance of a
tall, energetic gentleman, whom Virginia had introduced to her as
Major Sherman, late of the army, and now president of the Fifth Street
Railroad.He then proceeded, as was
evidently his habit, directly to the business on which he was come.Brinsmade," he said, "I heard, accidentally, half an hour ago that
you were seeking news of your son.I regret to say, sir, that the news I
have will not lead to a knowledge of his whereabouts.But in justice to
a young gentleman of this city I think I ought to tell you what happened
at Camp Jackson."With
some gesticulation which added greatly to the force of the story,
he gave a most terse and vivid account of Mr.John's arrival at the
embankment by the grove--of his charging a whole regiment of Union
volunteers.Sherman did not believe in
mincing matters even to a father and sister."And, sir," said he, "you may thank the young man who lives next door to
you--Mr.Brice, I believe--for saving your son's life."Virginia felt Anne's hand tighten But her own was limp.A hot wave swept
over her, Was she never to hear the end of this man."Yes, sir, Stephen Brice," answered Mr."And I never in my life
saw a finer thing done, in the Mexican War or out of it.""As sure as I know you," said the Major, with excessive conviction.Brinsmade, "I was in there last night, I knew the young
man had been at the camp.He told me
that he had, by the embankment.But he never mentioned a word about
saving his life.""By glory, but he's even better than I
thought him, Did you see a black powder mark on his face?""Why, yes, sir, I saw a bad burn of some kind on his forehead.""Well, sir, if one of the Dutchmen who shot at Jack had known enough to
put a ball in his musket, he would have killed Mr.Brice, who was only
ten feet away, standing before your son."Anne gave a little cry--Virginia was silent--Her lips were parted.Though she realized it not, she was thirsting %a hear the whole of the
story.The Major told it, soldier fashion, but well.Sherman) had seen Brice throw the woman down and
had cried to him to lie down himself how the fire was darting down the
regiment, and how men and women were falling all about them; and how
Stephen had flung Jack and covered him with his body.Had she any right to treat
such a man with contempt?She remembered hour he had looked, at her when
he stood on the corner by the Catherwoods' house.And, worst of all, she
remembered many spiteful remarks she had made, even to Anne, the gist of
which had been that Mr.Brice was better at preaching than at fighting.She knew now--and she had known in her heart before--that this was the
greatest injustice she could have done him.It was Anne who tremblingly asked the Major.Sherman,
apparently, was not the man to say that Jack would have shot Stephen had
he not interfered.John would have
shot the man who saved his life.Brinsmade and Anne had
gone upstairs to the sickbed, these were the tidings the Major told
Virginia, who kept it in her heart.The reason he told her was because
she had guessed a part of it.Brinsmade drove to the Arsenal with her that Saturday,
in his own carriage.Forgetful of his own grief, long habit came to
him to talk cheerily with her.He told her many little anecdotes of his
travel, but not one of them did she hear.Again, at the moment when she
thought her belief in Clarence and her love for him at last secure, she
found herself drawing searching comparisons between him and the quieter
young Bostonian.In spite of herself she had to admit that Stephen's
deed was splendid.Clarence had been capable of the deed,--even to the rescue of an enemy.But--alas, that she should carry it out to a remorseless end--would
Clarence have been equal to keeping silence when Mr.Stephen Brice had not even told his mother, so Mr.As if to aggravate her torture, Mr.Brinsmade's talk drifted to the
subject of young Mr.He told her of the
brave struggle Stephen had made, and how he had earned luxuries, and
often necessities, for his mother by writing for the newspapers.Brinsmade, "often I have been unable to sleep, and
have seen the light in Stephen's room until the small hours of the
morning.""Can't you tell me something bad
about him?The good gentleman started, and looked searchingly at the girl by his
side, flushed and confused.Perhaps he thought--but how can we tell what
he thought?How can we guess that our teachers laugh at our pranks after
they have caned us for them?We do not remember that our parents have
once been young themselves, and that some word or look of our own brings
a part of their past vividly before them.Brinsmade was silent, but
he looked out of the carriage window, away from Virginia.And presently,
as they splashed through the mud near the Arsenal, they met a knot of
gentlemen in state uniforms on their way to the city.Nicodemus stopped
at his master's signal.Here was George Catherwood, and his father was
with him."They have released us on parole," said George."Yes, we had a fearful
night of it.They could not have kept us--they had no quarters."How changed he was from the gay trooper of yesterday!His bright uniform
was creased and soiled and muddy, his face unshaven, and dark rings of
weariness under his eyes."Do you know if Clarence Colfax has gone home?""Clarence is an idiot," cried George, ill-naturedly.Brinsmade, of
all the prisoners here, he refused to take the parole, or the oath of
allegiance.He swears he will remain a prisoner until he is exchanged.""The young man is Quixotic," declared the elder Catherwood, who was not
himself in the best of humors.Brinsmade, with as much severity as he was ever known
to use, "sir, I honor that young man for this more than I can tell you.Nicodemus, you may drive on."Perhaps George had caught sight of a face in the depths of the carriage,
for he turned purple, and stood staring on the pavement after his
choleric parent had gone on.Of all the thousand and more young men who had upheld
the honor of their state that week, there was but the one who chose to
remain in durance vile within the Arsenal wall--Captain Clarence Colfax,
late of the Dragoons.Brinsmade was rapidly admitted to the Arsenal, and treated with the
respect which his long service to the city deserved.He and Virginia
were shown into the bare military room of the commanding officer, and
thither presently came Captain Lyon himself.Virginia tingled with
antagonism when she saw this man who had made the city tremble, who had
set an iron heel on the flaming brand of her Cause.He, too, showed the
marks of his Herculean labors, but only on his clothes and person.His
long red hair was unbrushed, his boots covered with black mud, and his
coat unbuttoned.His face was ruddy, and his eye as clear as though
he had arisen from twelve hours' sleep.He bowed to Virginia (not too
politely, to be sure).Her own nod of are recognition did not seem to
trouble him."Yes, sir," he said incisively, in response to Mr.Brinsmade's question,
"we are forced to retain Captain Colfax.He prefers to remain a prisoner
until he is exchanged.He refuses to take the oath of allegiance to the
United States."And why should he be made to, Captain Lyon?In what way has he opposed
the United States troops?""You will pardon me, Miss Carvel," said Captain Lyon, gravely, "if I
refuse to discuss that question with you."Colfax is a near relative of yours, Miss Carvel,"
the Captain continued."His friends may come here to see him during
the day.And I believe it is not out of place for me to express my
admiration of the captain's conduct.You may care to see him now--"

"Thank you," said Virginia, curtly."Orderly, my respects to Captain Colfax, and ask him if a he will be
kind enough to come in here.Brinsmade," said the Captain, "I
should like a few words with you, sir."And so, thanks to the Captain's
delicacy, when Clarence arrived he found Virginia alone.She was much
agitated She ran toward him as he entered the door, calling his name."Max, you are going to stay here?"Aglow with admiration, she threw herself into his arms.Now, indeed, was
she proud of him.Of all the thousand defenders of the state, he alone
was true to his principles--to the South.Within sight of home, he alone
had chosen privation.She looked up into his face, which showed marks of excitement and
fatigue.She knew that he could live on
excitement.The thought came to her--was it that which sustained him
now?Surely the touch of this experience
would transform the boy into the man.This was the weak point in the
armor which she wore so bravely for her cousin.He had known neither care nor
responsibility.His one longing from a child had been that love of
fighting and adventure which is born in the race.Until this gloomy
day in the Arsenal, Virginia had never characterized it as a love of
excitement---as any thing which contained a selfish element.She looked
up into his face, I say, and saw that which it is given to a woman only
to see.His eyes burned with a light that was far away.Even with his
arms around her he seemed to have forgotten her presence, and that she
had come all the way to the Arsenal to see him.Her hands dropped limply
from his shoulders She drew away, as he did not seem to notice.Above and beyond the sacrifice of a woman's life, the
joy of possessing her soul and affection, is something more desirable
still--fame and glory--personal fame and glory, The woman may share
them, of course, and be content with the radiance.When the Governor
in making his inauguration speech, does he always think of the help the
little wife has given him.And so, in moments of excitement, when we see
far ahead into a glorious future, we do not feel the arms about us,
or value the sweets which, in more humdrum days, we labored so hard to
attain.Virginia drew away, and the one searching glance she gave him he did
not see.He was staring far beyond; tears started in her eyes, and she
turned from him to look out over the Arsenal grounds, still wet and
heavy with the night's storm.She
thought of the supper cooking at home.And yet, in that moment of bitterness Virginia loved him.Such are the
ways of women, even of the proudest, who love their country too.It was
but right that he should not think of her when the honor of the South
was at stake; and the anger that rose within her was against those nine
hundred and ninety-nine who had weakly accepted the parole."He has gone to Jefferson City, to see the Governor.."

"And you came alone?"What a relief that should have come
among the first.She was
afraid," (Virginia had to smile), "she was afraid the Yankees would kill
you.""They have behaved very well for Yankees," replied he, "No luxury, and
they will not hear of my having a servant.They are used to doing their
own work.But they have treated me much better since I refused to take
their abominable oath.""And you will be honored for it when the news reaches town."Clarence asked eagerly, "I reckon they will
think me a fool!""I should like to hear any one say so," she flashed out."No," said Virginia, "our friends will force them to release you.But you have done nothing to be imprisoned
for.""I do not want to be
released.""You do not want to be released," she repeated.If I remain a prisoner, it will
have a greater effect--for the South."She smiled again, this time at the boyish touch of heroics.Experience,
responsibility, and he would get over that.She remembered once, long
ago, when his mother had shut him up in his room for a punishment, and
he had tortured her by remaining there for two whole days.It was well on in the afternoon when she drove back to the city with Mr.Neither of them had eaten since morning, nor had they even
thought of hunger.Brinsmade was silent, leaning back in the corner
of the carriage, and Virginia absorbed in her own thoughts.Drawing near
the city, that dreaded sound, the rumble of drums, roused them.A shot
rang out, and they were jerked violently by the starting of the horses.As they dashed across Walnut at Seventh came the fusillade.Down the vista of the street was a mass of
blue uniforms, and a film of white smoke hanging about the columns of
the old Presbyterian Church Mr.Brinsmade quietly drew her back into the
carriage.The shots ceased, giving place to an angry roar that struck terror to
her heart that wet and lowering afternoon.Nicodemus tugging at the reins, and great splotches of
mud flying in at the windows.The roar of the crowd died to an ominous
moaning behind them.Brinsmade was speaking:--
"From battle and murder, and from sudden death--from all sedition, privy
conspiracy, and rebellion,--Good Lord, deliver us."He was repeating the Litany--that Litany which had come down through the
ages.They had chanted it in Cromwell's time, when homes were ruined and
laid waste, and innocents slaughtered.They had chanted it on the dark,
barricaded stairways of mediaeval Paris, through St.Bartholomew's
night, when the narrow and twisted streets, ran with blood.They had
chanted it in ancient India, and now it was heard again in the New World
and the New Republic of Peace and Good Will.The girl flinched at the word which the good gentleman had
uttered in his prayers.Was she a traitor to that flag for which her
people had fought in three wars?She burned to blot it
forever from the book Oh, the bitterness of that day, which was prophecy
of the bitterness to come.Brinsmade escorted her up her own steps.He held her hand a little at parting, and bade her be of good cheer.Perhaps he guessed something of the trial she was to go through that
night alone with her aunt, Clarence's mother.Brinsmade did not go
directly home.He went first to the little house next door to his.Brice and Judge Whipple were in the parlor: What passed between them
there has not been told, but presently the Judge and Mr.Brinsmade came
out together and stood along time in, the yard, conversing, heedless of
the rain.THE STAMPEDE

Sunday dawned, and the people flocked to the churches.But even in the
house of God were dissension and strife.Posthelwaite's Virginia saw men and women rise from their knees and
walk out--their faces pale with anger.Mark's the prayer for
the President of the United States was omitted.Catherwood nodded approvingly over the sermon in which the South was
justified, and the sanction of Holy Writ laid upon her Institution.With not indifferent elation these gentlemen watched the departure of
brethren with whom they had labored for many years, save only when Mr.Brinsmade walked down the aisle never to return.So it is that war, like
a devastating flood, creeps insistent into the most sacred places, and
will not be denied.Davitt, at least, preached that day to an united
congregation,--which is to say that none of them went out.Hopper,
who now shared a pew with Miss Crane, listened as usual with a most
reverent attention.The clouds were low and the streets wet as people
walked home to dinner, to discuss, many in passion and some in sorrow,
the doings of the morning.A certain clergyman had prayed to be
delivered from the Irish, the Dutch, and the Devil.Was it he who
started the old rumor which made such havoc that afternoon?Those
barbarians of the foreign city to the south, drunk with power, were to
sack and loot the city.How it flew across street and alley, from
yard to yard, and from house to house!Privileged Ned ran into the
dining-room where Virginia and her aunt were sitting, his eyes rolling
and his face ashen with terror, crying out that the Dutch were marching
on the city, firebrands in hand and murder in their hearts."De Gen'ral done gib out er procl'mation, Miss Jinny," he cried."De
Gen'ral done say in dat procl'mation dat he ain't got no control ober de
Dutch soldiers.""Oh Miss Jinny, ain't you gwineter Glencoe?Ain't you gwineter flee
away?Every fambly on dis here street's gwine away--is packin' up fo' de
country.Doan't you hear 'em, Miss Jinny?What'll your pa say to Ned of
he ain't make you clear out!Doan't you hear de carridges a-rattlin' off
to de country?"Virginia rose in agitation, yet trying to be calm, and to remember
that the safety of the household depended upon her alone.That was her
thought,--bred into her by generations,--the safety of the household,
of the humblest slave whose happiness and welfare depended upon her
father's bounty.How she longed in that instant for her father or
Captain Lige, for some man's strength, to depend upon.She has seen her aunt swoon before,
and her maid Susan knows well what to do."Laws Mussy, no, Miss Jinny.One <DW65> laik me doan't make no
difference.My Marsa he say: 'Whaffor you leave ma house to be ramsacked
by de Dutch?'Oh Miss Jinny, you an' Miss Lill an' Mammy
Easter an' Susan's gwine with Jackson, an' de othah niggahs can walk.Ephum an' me'll jes' put up de shutters an' load de Colonel's gun."By this time the room was filled with excited <DW64>s, some crying,
and some laughing hysterically.Uncle Ben had come in from the kitchen;
Jackson was there, and the women were a wailing bunch in the corner by
the sideboard.Old Ephum, impassive, and Ned stood together.Virginia's
eye rested upon them, and the light of love and affection was in it.Yes, carriages were indeed rattling outside, though
a sharp shower was falling.Across the street Alphonse, M. Renault's
butler, was depositing bags and bundles on the steps.M. Renault himself
bustled out into the rain, gesticulating excitedly.Spying her at the
window, he put his hands to his mouth, cried out something, and ran in
again.Virginia flung open the sash and listened for the dreaded sound
of drums.Then she crossed quickly over to where her aunt was lying on
the lounge."O Jinny," murmured that lady, who had revived, "can't you do something?They will be here any moment to burn us, to
murder us--to--oh, my poor boy!Why isn't he here to protect his mother!Why was Comyn so senseless, so thoughtless, as to leave us at such a
time!""I don't think there is any need to be frightened," said Virginia, with
a calmness that made her aunt tremble with anger."It is probably only a
rumor.Brinsmade's and ask him about it."However loath to go, Ned departed at once.All honor to those old-time
<DW64>s who are now memories, whose devotion to their masters was next
to their love of God.A great fear was in Ned's heart, but he went.And he believed devoutly that he would never see his young mistress any
more.Colfax is summoning
that courage which comes to persons of her character at such times.She
gathers her jewels into a bag, and her fine dresses into her trunk,
with trembling hands, although she is well enough now.The picture of
Clarence in the diamond frame she puts inside the waist of her gown.No,
she will not go to Bellegarde.With frantic
haste she closes the trunk, which Ephum and Jackson carry downstairs and
place between the seats of the carriage.Ned had had the horses in it
since church time.It is three in the afternoon, and Jackson explains that,
with the load, they would not reach there until midnight, if at all.Yes; many of the first families live there,
and would take them in for the night.Equipages of all sorts are
passing,--private carriages and public, and corner-stand hacks.The
black drivers are cracking whips over galloping horses.Pedestrians are hurrying by with bundles under their arms, some running
east, and some west, and some stopping to discuss excitedly the chances
of each direction.From the river comes the hoarse whistle of the boats
breaking the Sabbath stillness there.Virginia leaned against the iron railing of the steps, watching the
scene, and waiting for Ned to return from Mr.Her face was
troubled, as well it might be.The most alarming reports were cried up
to her from the street, and she looked every moment for the black smoke
of destruction to appear to the southward.Around her were gathered the
Carvel servants, most of them crying, and imploring her not to leave
them.Colfax's trunk was brought down and placed in the
carriage where three of them might have ridden to safety, a groan of
despair and entreaty rose from the faithful group that went to her
heart."Miss Jinny, you ain't gwineter leave yo' ol mammy?""Hush, Mammy," she said."No, you shall all go, if I have to stay
myself.Ephum, go to the livery stable and get another carriage."She went up into her own deserted room to gather the few things she
would take with her--the little jewellery case with the necklace of
pearls which her great-grandmother had worn at her wedding.Rosetta and
Mammy Easter were of no use, and she had sent them downstairs again.With a flutter she opened her wardrobe door, to take one last look at
the gowns there.They were part of happier days
gone by.She fell down on her knees and opened the great drawer at the
bottom, and there on the top lay the dainty gown which had belonged
to Dorothy Manners.A tear fell upon one of the flowers of the stays.Irresistibly pressed into her mind the memory of Anne's fancy dress
ball,--of the episode by the gate, upon which she had thought so often
with burning face.The voices below grow louder, but she does not hear.She is folding the
gown hurriedly into a little package.It was her great-grandmother's;
her chief heirloom after the pearls.Silk and satin from Paris are
left behind.With one glance at the bed in which she had slept since
childhood, and at the picture over it which had been her mother's, she
hurries downstairs.And Dorothy Manners's gown is under her arm.On the
landing she stops to brush her eyes with her handkerchief.Ned simply pointed out a young man standing on the
steps behind the <DW64>s.Crimson stains were on Virginia's cheeks,
and the package she carried under her arm was like lead.The young
man, although he showed no signs of excitement, reddened too as he came
forward and took off his hat.But the sight of him had acurious effect
upon Virginia, of which she was at first unconscious.A sense of
security came upon her as she looked at his face and listened to his
voice.Brinsmade has gone to the hospital, Miss Carvel," he said.Brinsmade asked me to come here with your man in the hope that I might
persuade you to stay where you are.""Then the Germans are not moving on the city?"It was that smile that angered her,
that made her rebel against the advice he had to offer; that made her
forget the insult he had risked at her hands by coming there.For she
believed him utterly, without reservation.The moment he had spoken she
was convinced that the panic was a silly scare which would be food for
merriment in future years.And yet--was not that smile in derision of
herself--of her friends who were running away?Was it not an assumption
of Northern superiority, to be resented?"It is only a malicious rumor, Miss Carvel," he answered."You have
been told so upon good authority, I suppose," she said dryly.And at the
change in her tone she saw his face fall."I have not," he replied honestly, "but I will submit it to your own
judgment.Yesterday General Harney superseded Captain Lyon in command
in St.Some citizens of prominence begged the General to send the
troops away, to avoid further ill-feeling and perhaps--bloodshed."(They
both winced at the word.)"Colonel Blair represented to the General that
the troops could not be sent away, as they had been enlisted to serve
only in St.Louis; whereupon the General in his proclamation states that
he has no control over these Home Guards.That sentence has been twisted
by some rascal into a confession that the Home Guards are not to be
controlled.I can assure you, Miss Carvel," added Stephen, speaking
with a force which made her start and thrill, "I can assure you from a
personal knowledge of the German troops that they are not a riotous lot,
and that they are under perfect control.If they were not, there are
enough regulars in the city to repress them."And she was silent, forgetful of the hub-bub around her.It
was then that her aunt called out to her, with distressing shrillness,
from the carriage:-- "Jinny, Jinny, how can you stand there talking to
young men when our lives are in danger?"She glanced hurriedly at Stephen, who said gently; "I do not wish to
delay you, Miss Carvel, if you are bent upon going."His tone was not resentful, simply quiet.Ephum turned the
corner of the street, the perspiration running on his black face."Miss Jinny, dey ain't no carridges to be had in this town.This was the occasion for another groan from the <DW64>s, and they began
once more to beseech her not to leave them.In the midst of their cries
she heard her aunt calling from the carriage, where, beside the trunk,
there was just room for her to squeeze in."Jinny," cried that lady, frantically, "are you to go or stay?The
Hessians will be here at any moment.Oh, I cannot stay here to be
murdered!"Unconsciously the girl glanced again at Stephen.He had not gone, but
was still standing in the rain on the steps, the one figure of strength
and coolness she had seen this afternoon.Distracted, she blamed the
fate which had made this man an enemy.How willingly would she have
leaned upon such as he, and submitted to his guidance.Unluckily at
that moment came down the street a group which had been ludicrous on any
other day, and was, in truth, ludicrous to Stephen then.At the head
of it was a little gentleman with red mutton-chop whiskers, hatless, in
spite of the rain beginning to fall.His face was the very caricature of
terror.His clothes, usually neat, were awry, and his arms were full
of various things, not the least conspicuous of which was a magnificent
bronze clock.It was this object that caught Virginia's eye.But years
passed before she laughed over it.Cluyme (for it was he)
trotted his family.Cluyme, in a pink wrapper, carried an armful
of the family silver; then came Belle with certain articles of feminine
apparel which need not be enumerated, and the three small Cluymes of
various ages brought up the rear.Cluyme, at the top of his speed, was come opposite to the carriage
when the lady occupant got out of it.Clutching at his sleeve, she
demanded where he was going.His wife coming after
him had a narrower escape still.Colfax retained a handful of lace
from the wrapper, the owner of which emitted a shriek of fright."Virginia, I am going to the river," said Mrs."No, indeedy, Miss Lilly, I ain't a-gwine 'thout
young Miss.The Dutch kin cotch me an' hang me, but I ain't a-gwine
'thout Miss Jinny."Colfax drew her shawl about her shoulders with dignity."Ill as I am, I shall walk.Bear
witness that I have spent a precious hour trying to save you.If I live
to see your father again, I shall tell him that you preferred to stay
here and carry on disgracefully with a Yankee, that you let your own
aunt risk her life alone in the rain.She did not run down the steps, but she caught
her aunt by the arm ere that lady had taken six paces.The girl's face
frightened Mrs.Colfax into submission, and she let herself be led back
into the carriage beside the trunk.Colfax's stung
Stephen to righteous anger and resentment--for Virginia.As to himself, he had looked for insult.He turned to go that he might
not look upon her confusion; and hanging on the resolution, swung on his
heel again, his eyes blazeing.He saw in hers the deep blue light of
the skies after an evening's storm.She was calm, and save for a little
quiver of the voice, mistress of herself as she spoke to the group of
cowering servants."Mammy," she said, "get up on the box with Ned.And, Ned, walk the
horses to the levee, so that the rest may follow.Ephum, you stay here
with the house, and I will send Ned back to keep you company."With these words, clasping tightly the precious little bundle under her
arm, she stepped into the carriage.Heedless of the risk he ran, sheer
admiration sent Stephen to the carriage door."If I can be of any service, Miss Carvel," he said, "I shall be happy."And as the horses slipped and started she slammed the door in his face.Down on the levee wheels rattled over the white stones washed clean by
the driving rain.The drops pelted the chocolate water into froth, and a
blue veil hid the distant bluffs beyond the Illinois bottom-lands.Down
on the Levee rich and poor battled for places on the landing-stages, and
would have thrown themselves into the flood had there been no boats
to save them from the dreaded Dutch.Attila and his Huns were not
more feared.What might not its
Barbarians do when roused?The rich and poor struggled together; but
money was a power that day, and many were pitilessly turned off because
they did not have the high price to carry them--who knew where?Boats which screamed, and boats which had a dragon's roar were backing
out of the close ranks where they had stood wheel-house to wheel-house,
and were dodging and bumping in the channel.See, their guards are black
with people!Colfax, when they are come out of the narrow street
into the great open space, remarks this with alarm.All the boats will
be gone before they can get near one.She
is thinking of other things than the steamboats, and wondering whether
it had not been preferable to be killed by Hessians.Vance, is
a friend of the family.What a mighty contempt did Ned and his kind have
for foot passengers!Laying about him with his whip, and shouting at the
top of his voice to make himself heard, he sent the Colonel's Kentucky
bays through the crowd down to the Barbara's landing stage, the people
scampering to the right and left, and the Carvel servants, headed by
Uncle Ben, hanging on to the carriage springs, trailing behind.He will tell you to this day how
Mr.Catherwood's carriage was pocketed by drays and bales, and how Mrs.James's horses were seized by the bridles and turned back.Ned had a
head on his shoulders, and eyes in his head.He spied Captain Vance
himself on the stage, and bade Uncle Ben hold to the horses while he
shouldered his way to that gentleman.The result was that the Captain
came bowing to the carriage door, and offered his own cabin to the
ladies.But the <DW65>s---he would take no <DW65>s except a maid for
each; and he begged Mrs.Colfax's pardon--he could not carry her trunk.So Virginia chose Mammy Easter, whose red and yellow turban was awry
from fear lest she be left behind and Ned was instructed to drive the
rest with all haste to Bellegarde.Colfax his
arm, and Virginia his eyes.He escorted the ladies to quarters in the
texas, and presently was heard swearing prodigiously as the boat was
cast off.It was said of him that he could turn an oath better than any
man on the river, which was no mean reputation.Colfax was assisted to bed by Susan.Virginia stood by the little
window of the cabin, and as the Barbara paddled and floated down the
river she looked anxiously for signals of a conflagration.Nay, in that
hour she wished that the city might burn.So it is that the best of us
may at times desire misery to thousands that our own malice may be
fed.Virginia longed to see the yellow flame creep along the wet,
gray clouds.Passionate tears came to her eyes at the thought of the
humiliation she had suffered,--and before him, of all men.Could she
ever live with her aunt after what she had said?"Carrying on with that
Yankee!"Her anger, too, was still against Stephen.Once more he had been sent by
circumstances to mock her and her people.If the city would only burn,
that his cocksure judgment might for once be mistaken, his calmness for
once broken!The rain ceased, the clouds parted, and the sun turned the muddy river
to gold.The bluffs shone May-green in the western flood of light, and a
haze hung over the bottom-lands.Not a sound disturbed the quiet of
the city receding to the northward, and the rain had washed the pall
of smoke from over it.On the boat excited voices died down to natural
tones; men smoked on the guards and promenaded on the hurricane deck,
as if this were some pleasant excursion.Women waved to the other boats
flocking after.Colfax stirred in
her berth and began to talk.Virginia did not move

"Jinny!"In that hour she remembered that great good-natured man, her
mother's brother, and for his sake Colonel Carvel had put up with much
from his wife's sister in-law.She could pass over, but never forgive
what her aunt had said to her that afternoon.Colfax had often been
cruel before, and inconsiderate.But as the girl thought of the speech,
staring out on the waters, it suddenly occurred to her that no lady
would have uttered it.In all her life she had never realized till now
that her aunt was not a lady.From that time forth Virginia's attitude
toward her aunt was changed.She controlled herself, however, and answered something, and went out
listlessly to find the Captain and inquire the destination of the boat.At the foot of the companionway
leading to the saloon deck she saw, of all people, Mr.Eliphalet Hopper
leaning on the rail, and pensively expectorating on the roof of the
wheel-house.In another mood Virginia would have laughed, for at sight
of her he straightened convulsively, thrust his quid into his cheek, and
removed his hat with more zeal than the grudging deference he usually
accorded to the sex.Clearly Eliphalet would not have chosen the
situation."I cal'late we didn't get out any too soon, Miss Carvel," he remarked,
with a sad attempt at jocoseness."There won't be a great deal in that
town when the Dutch get through with it.""I think that there are enough men left in it to save it," said
Virginia.Hopper found no suitable answer to this, for he made
none.He continued to glance at her uneasily.There was an impudent
tribute in his look which she resented strongly."He's down below--ma'am," he replied."Yes," she said, with abrupt maliciousness, "you may tell me where you
are going.""I cal'late, up the Cumberland River.That's where she's bound for,
if she don't stop before she gets there Guess there ain't many of 'em
inquired where she was goin', or cared much," he added, with a ghastly
effort to be genial."I didn't see any use in gettin' murdered, when I couldn't do anything."He stared after her up the companionway, bit off a
generous piece of tobacco, and ruminated.If to be a genius is to
possess an infinite stock of patience, Mr.But it was not a pleasant smile to look upon.She had told her aunt the news, and stood
in the breeze on the hurricane deck looking southward, with her hand
shading her eyes.The 'Barbara Lane' happened to be a boat with a
record, and her name was often in the papers.She had already caught up
with and distanced others which had had half an hour's start of her, and
was near the head of the procession.Virginia presently became aware that people were gathering around her in
knots, gazing at a boat coming toward them.Others had been met which,
on learning the dread news, turned back.But this one kept her bow
steadily up the current, although she had passed within a biscuit-toss
of the leader of the line of refugees.It was then that Captain Vance's
hairy head appeared above the deck.he said, "if here ain't pig-headed Brent, steaming the
'Jewanita' straight to destruction.""Oh, are you sure it's Captain Brent?""If that there was Shreve's old Enterprise come to life again, I'd lay
cotton to sawdust that Brent had her.Danged if he wouldn't take her
right into the jaws of the Dutch."The Captain's words spread, and caused considerable excitement.On board
the Barbara Lane were many gentlemen who had begun to be shamefaced over
their panic, and these went in a body to the Captain and asked him to
communicate with the 'Juanita'.Whereupon a certain number of whistles
were sounded, and the Barbara's bows headed for the other side of the
channel.As the Juanita drew near, Virginia saw the square figure and clean,
smooth-shaven face of Captain Lige standing in front of his wheel-house
Peace crept back into her soul, and she tingled with joy as the bells
clanged and the bucket-planks churned, and the great New Orleans packet
crept slowly to the Barbara's side."You ain't goin' in, Brent?"At the sound of his voice Virginia could
have wept."The Dutch are sacking the city," said Vance.A general titter went along the guards, and Virginia blushed."I'm on my reg'lar trip, of course," said Vance.Out there on the sunlit
river the situation seemed to call for an apology."Seems to be a little more loaded than common," remarked Captain Lige,
dryly, at which there was another general laugh."If you're really goin' up," said Captain Vance, "I reckon there's a few
here would like to be massacred, if you'll take 'em."Brent; "I'm bound for the barbecue."While the two great boats were manoeuvring, and slashing with one wheel
and the other, the gongs sounding, Virginia ran into the cabin."Oh, Aunt Lillian," she exclaimed, "here is Captain Lige and the
Juanita, and he is going to take us back with him.It its unnecessary here to repeat the moral persuasion which Virginia
used to get her aunt up and dressed.That lady, when she had heard the
whistle and the gongs, had let her imagination loose.Turning her face
to the wall, she was in the act of repeating her prayers as her niece
entered.A big stevedore carried her down two decks to where the gang-plank
was thrown across.Captain Lige himself was at the other end.His face
lighted, Pushing the people aside, he rushed across, snatched the lady
from the <DW64>'s arms, crying:

"Jinny!The stevedore's
services were required for Mammy Easter.And behind the burly shield
thus formed, a stoutish gentleman slipped over, all unnoticed, with a
carpet-bag in his hand It bore the initials E. H.

The plank was drawn in.The great wheels began to turn and hiss, the
Barbara's passengers waved good-by to the foolhardy lunatics who had
elected to go back into the jaws of destruction.Colfax was put
into a cabin; and Virginia, in a glow, climbed with Captain Lige to the
hurricane deck.There they stood for a while in silence, watching the
broad stern of the Barbara growing smaller."Just to think," Miss Carvel
remarked, with a little hysterical sigh, "just to think that some of
those people brought bronze clocks instead of tooth-brushes.""And what did you bring, my girl?"asked the Captain, glancing at the
parcel she held so tightly under her arm.He never knew why she blushed so furiously.THE STRAINING OF ANOTHER FRIENDSHIP

Captain Lige asked but two questions: where was the Colonel, and was
it true that Clarence had refused to be paroled?Though not possessing
over-fine susceptibilities, the Captain knew a mud-drum from a lady's
watch, as he himself said.In his solicitude for Virginia, he saw that
she was in no state of mind to talk of the occurrences of the last few
days.So he helped her to climb the little stair that winds to the top
of the texas,--that sanctified roof where the pilot-house squats.The
girl clung to her bonnet Will you like her any the less when you know
that it was a shovel bonnet, with long red ribbons that tied under
her chin?"Captain Lige," she said, almost
tearfully, as she took his arm, "how I thank heaven that you came up the
river this afternoon!""Jinny," said the Captain, "did you ever know why cabins are called
staterooms?""Why, no," answered she, puzzled."There was an old fellow named Shreve who ran steamboats before Jackson
fought the redcoats at New Orleans.In Shreve's time the cabins were
curtained off, just like these new-fangled sleeping-car berths.The old
man built wooden rooms, and he named them after the different states,
Kentuck, and Illinois, and Pennsylvania.So that when a fellow came
aboard he'd say: 'What state am I in, Cap?'And from this river has the
name spread all over the world--stateroom.That's mighty interesting,"
said Captain Lige."Yea," said Virginia; "why didn't you tell me long ago.""And I'll bet you can't say," the Captain continued, "why this house
we're standing on is called the texas.""Because it is annexed to the states," she replied, quick a flash."Well, you're bright," said he."Old Tufts got that notion, when Texas
came in.Bill Jenks was Captain Brent's senior pilot.His skin hung on his face
in folds, like that of a rhinoceros It was very much the same color.His
grizzled hair was all lengths, like a worn-out mop; his hand reminded
one of an eagle's claw, and his teeth were a pine yellow.He greeted
only such people as he deemed worthy of notice, but he had held Virginia
in his arms."William," said the young lady, roguishly, "how is the eye, location,
and memory?"When this happened it was put in
the Juanita's log."So the Cap'n be still harpin' on that?"he said, "Miss Jinny, he's just
plumb crazy on a pilot's qualifications.""He says that you are the best pilot on the river, but I don't believe
it," said Virginia.He made a place for her on the leather-padded
seat at the back of the pilot house, where for a long time she sat
staring at the flag trembling on the jackstaff between the great sombre
pipes.The sun fell down, but his light lingered in the air above as the
big boat forged abreast the foreign city of South St.There
was the arsenal--grim despite its dress of green, where Clarence was
confined alone.Captain Lige came in from his duties below."Well, Jinny, we'll soon be
at home," he said."We've made a quick trip against the rains.""And--and do you think the city is safe?""Jinny, would
you like to blow the whistle?""I should just love to," said Virginia.Jenks's
directions she put her toe on the tread, and shrank back when the
monster responded with a snort and a roar.River men along the levee
heard that signal and laughed.The joke was certainly not on sturdy
Elijah Brent.An hour later, Virginia and her aunt and the Captain, followed by Mammy
aster and Rosetta and Susan, were walking through the streets of the
stillest city in the Union.All that they met was a provost's guard, for
St.Once in a while they saw the light of
some contemptuous citizen of the residence district who had stayed to
laugh.Out in the suburbs, at the country houses of the first families,
people of distinction slept five and six in a room--many with only a
quilt between body and matting.Little wonder that these dreamed of
Hessians and destruction.In town they slept with their doors open,
those who remained and had faith.Martial law means passes and
explanations, and walking generally in the light of day.Martial law
means that the Commander-in-chief, if he be an artist in well doing,
may use his boot freely on politicians bland or beetle-browed.No police
force ever gave the sense of security inspired by a provost's guard.Captain Lige sat on the steps of Colonel Carvel's house that night, long
after the ladies were gone to bed.The only sounds breaking the silence
of the city were the beat of the feet of the marching squads and the
call of the corporal's relief.But the Captain smoked in agony until the
clouds of two days slipped away from under the stars, for he was trying
to decide a Question.Then he went up to a room in the house which had
been known as his since the rafters were put down on that floor.The next morning, as the Captain and Virginia sit at breakfast together
with only Mammy Easter to cook and Rosetta to wait on them, the Colonel
bursts in.He is dusty and travel-stained from his night on the train,
but his gray eyes light with affection as he sees his friend beside his
daughter."Jinny," he cries as he kisses her, "Jinny, I'm proud oil you, my girl!You didn't let the Yankees frighten you--But where is Jackson?"And so the whole miserable tale has to be told over again, between
laughter and tears on Virginia's part, and laughter and strong language
on Colonel Carvel's.What--blessing that Lige met them, else the
Colonel might now be starting for the Cumberland River in search of his
daughter.The Captain does not take much part in the conversation, and
he refuses the cigar which is offered him."Lige," he says, "this is the first time to my knowledge.""I smoked too many last night," says the Captain.The Colonel sat down,
with his feet against the mantel, too full of affairs to take much
notice of Mr."The Yanks have taken the first trick--that's sure," he said."But I
think we'll laugh last, Jinny.The
state has got more militia, or will have more militia in a day or
two.We won't miss the thousand they stole in Camp Jackson.And I've got a few commissions right here," and he
tapped his pocket."Pa," said Virginia, "did you volunteer?""The Governor wouldn't have me," he answered."He said I was more good
here in St.The Colonel listened with
many exclamations, slapping his knee from time to time as she proceeded.he cried, when she had finished, "the boy has it in him, after
all!They can't hold him a day--can they, Lige?"(No answer from the
Captain, who is eating his breakfast in silence.)"All that we have to
do is to go for Worington and get a habeas corpus from the United States
District Court.The Captain got up excitedly, his face
purple."I reckon you'll have to excuse me, Colonel," he said."There's a cargo
on my boat which has got to come off."And without more ado he left the
room.In consternation they heard the front door close behind him.And
yet, neither father nor daughter dared in that hour add to the trial
of the other by speaking out the dread that was in their hearts.The
Colonel smoked for a while, not a word escaping him, and then he patted
Virginia's cheek."I reckon I'll run over and see Russell, Jinny," he said, striving to
be cheerful.He stopped
abruptly in the hall and pressed his hand to his forehead."My God," he
whispered to himself, "if I could only go to Silas!"Colfax's lawyer, of whose politics it is not necessary to speak.There
was plenty of excitement around the Government building where his Honor
issued the writ.There lacked not gentlemen of influence who went with
Mr.Russell and Colonel Carvel and the lawyer and the Commissioner to
the Arsenal.They were admitted to the presence of the indomitable Lyon,
who informed them that Captain Colfax was a prisoner of war, and, since
the arsenal was Government property, not in the state.The Commissioner
thereupon attested the affidavit to Colonel Carvel, and thus the
application for the writ was made legal.These things the Colonel reported to Virginia; and to Mrs.Colfax, who
received them with red eyes and a thousand queries as to whether that
Yankee ruffian would pay any attention to the Sovereign law which he
pretended to uphold; whether the Marshal would not be cast over the
Arsenal wall by the slack of his raiment when he went to serve the writ.This was not the language, but the purport, of the lady's questions.Colonel Carvel had made but a light breakfast: he had had no dinner,
and little rest on the train.But he answered his sister-in-law with
unfailing courtesy.He was too honest to express a hope which he did not
feel.He had returned that evening to a dreary household.During the
day the servants had straggled in from Bellegarde, and Virginia had had
prepared those dishes which her father loved.Colfax chose to keep
her room, for which the two were silently thankful.The Colonel was humming a tune as he went down the stairs, but
Virginia was not deceived.He would not see the yearning in her eyes as
he took his chair; he would not glance at Captain Lige's empty seat.She caught her breath when she saw that the
food on his plate lay untouched.He pushed his chair away, such suffering in his look as she had never
seen."Jinny," he said, "I reckon Lige is for the Yankees.""I have known it all along," she said, but faintly."My God," cried the Colonel, in agony, "to think that he kept it from me
I to think that Lige kept it from me!""It is because he loves you, Pa," answered the girl, gently, "it is
because he loves us."Virginia got up, and went softly around the
table."Yes," he said, his voice lifeless.But her courage was not to be lightly shaken."Pa, will you forbid him
to come here--now?"A long while she waited for his answer, while the big clock ticked out
the slow seconds in the hall, and her heart beat wildly."As long as I have a roof, Lige may come under
it."She did not ask him where he was
going, but ordered Jackson to keep the supper warm, and went into the
drawing-room.The lights were out, then, but the great piano that was
her mother's lay open.That wondrous
hymn which Judge Whipple loved, which for years has been the comfort
of those in distress, floated softly with the night air out of the
open window.Colonel Carvel heard it, and
paused.He did not stop again until he reached the narrow street at the top
of the levee bank, where the quaint stone houses of the old French
residents were being loaded with wares.He took a few steps back-up the
hill.Then he wheeled about, walked swiftly down the levee, and on to
the landing-stage beside which the big 'Juanita' loomed in the night.On
her bows was set, fantastically, a yellow street-car.Its unexpected appearance there had
served to break the current of his meditations.He stood staring at it,
while the roustabouts passed and repassed, noisily carrying great logs
of wood on shoulders padded by their woollen caps."That'll be the first street-car used in the city of New Orleans, if it
ever gets there, Colonel.""Reckon I'll have to stay here and boss the cargo all night.Want to
get in as many trips as I can before--navigation closes," the Captain
concluded significantly."You were never too busy to come for
supper, Lige.Captain Lige shot at him a swift look."Come over here on the levee," said the Colonel, sternly.They walked
out together, and for some distance in silence."Lige," said the elder gentleman, striking his stick on the stones, "if
there ever was a straight goer, that's you.You've always dealt squarely
with me, and now I'm going to ask you a plain question."I'm North, I reckon," answered the Captain, bluntly.It was a long time before he spoke again.The Captain waited
like a man who expects and deserve, the severest verdict."And you wouldn't tell me, Lige?"My God, Colonel," exclaimed the other, passionately, "how could I?I
owe what I have to your charity.But for you and--and Jinny I should
have gone to the devil.If you and she are taken away, what have I left
in life?I was a coward, sir, not to tell you.And yet,--God help me,--I can't stand by and see the nation go to
pieces.Your fathers fought that
we Americans might inherit the earth--" He stopped abruptly.Then he
continued haltingly, "Colonel, I know you're a man of strong feelings
and convictions.All I ask is that you and Jinny will think of me as a
friend--"

He choked, and turned away, not heeding the direction of his feet.The
Colonel, his stick raised, stood looking after him.He was folded in the
near darkness before he called his name.He came back, wondering, across the rough stones until he stood beside
the tall figure.Below them, the lights glided along the dark water."Lige, didn't I raise you?Haven't I taught you that my house was your
home?But--but never speak to me again of this night!Not a word passed between them as they went up the quiet street.At the
sound of their feet in the entry the door was flung open, and Virginia,
with her hands out stretched, stood under the hall light."Oh, Pa, I knew you would bring him back," she said.OF CLARENCE

Captain Clarence Colfax, late of the State Dragoons, awoke on Sunday
morning the chief of the many topics of the conversation of a big city.His conduct drew forth enthusiastic praise from the gentlemen and ladies
who had thronged Beauregard and Davis avenues, and honest admiration
from the party which had broken up the camp.There were many doting parents, like Mr.Catherwood, whose boys had
accepted the parole, whose praise was a trifle lukewarm, to be sure.But popular opinion, when once aroused, will draw a grunt from the most
grudging.We are not permitted, alas, to go behind these stern walls and discover
how Captain Colfax passed that eventful Sunday of the Exodus.We know
that, in his loneliness, he hoped for a visit from his cousin, and took
to pacing his room in the afternoon, when a smarting sense of injustice
crept upon him.And how was he to guess, as he
looked out in astonishment upon the frightened flock of white boats
swimming southward, that his mother and his sweetheart were there?On Monday, while the Colonel and many prominent citizens were busying
themselves about procuring the legal writ which was at once to release
Mr.Colfax, and so cleanse the whole body of Camp Jackson's defenders
from any, veiled intentions toward the Government, many well known
carriages drew up before the Carvel House in Locust Street to
congratulate the widow and the Colonel upon the possession of such a
son and nephew.There were some who slyly congratulated Virginia, whose
martyrdom it was to sit up with people all the day long.Colfax
kept her room, and admitted only a few of her bosom friends to cry with
her.When the last of the callers was gone, Virginia was admitted to her
aunt's presence."Aunt Lillian, to-morrow morning Pa and I are going to the Arsenal with
a basket for Max.Pa seems to think there is a chance that he may come
back with us.The lady smiled wearily at the proposal, and raised her hands in
protest, the lace on the sleeves of her dressing gown falling away from
her white arms.she exclaimed, "when I can't walk to my bureau after that
terrible Sunday.No," she added, with conviction,
"I never again expect to see him alive.Comyn says they may release him,
does he?The girl went away, not in anger or impatience, but in sadness.Brought
up to reverence her elders, she had ignored the shallowness of her
aunt's character in happier days.Colfax's conduct carried
a prophecy with it.Virginia sat down on the landing to ponder on the
years to come,--on the pain they were likely to bring with them from
this source--Clarence gone to the war; her father gone (for she felt
that he would go in the end), Virginia foresaw the lonely days of trial
in company with this vain woman whom accident made her cousin's mother.Ay, and more, fate had made her the mother of the man she was to marry.The girl could scarcely bear the thought--through the hurry and swing of
the events of two days she had kept it from her mind.To-morrow he would be coming home
to her joyfully for his reward, and she did not love him.She was bound
to face that again and again.She had cheated herself again and again
with other feelings.She had set up intense love of country in the
shrine where it did not belong, and it had answered--for a while.She
saw Clarence in a hero's light--until a fatal intimate knowledge made
her shudder and draw back.Captain Lige's cheery voice roused her from below--and her father's
laugh.And as she went down to them she thanked God that this friend had
been spared to him.Never had the Captain's river yarns been better told
than at the table that evening.Virginia did not see him glance at the
Colonel when at last he had brought a smile to her face."I'm going to leave Jinny with you, Lige," said Mr."Worington has some notion that the Marshal may go to the Arsenal
to-night with the writ.she pleaded

The Colonel was taken aback.He stood looking down at her, stroking his
goatee, and marvelling at the ways of woman."The horses have been out all day, Jinny," he said, "I am going in the
cars.""I can go in the cars, too.""There is only a chance that we shall see Clarence," he went on,
uneasily."It is better than sitting still," cried Virginia, as she ran away to
get the bonnet with the red strings."Lige,--" said the Colonel, as the two stood awaiting her in the hall,
"I can't make her out.It was a long journey, in a bumping car with had springs that rattled
unceasingly, past the string of provost guards.The Colonel sat in the
corner, with his head bent down over his stick At length, cramped and
weary, they got out, and made their way along the Arsenal wall, past the
sentries to the entrance.The sergeant brought his rifle to a "port".Carver

"Captain Colfax was taken to Illinois in a skiff, quarter of an hour
since."Captain Lige gave vent to a long, low whistle.he exclaimed, "and the river this high!Before he could answer came the noise of steps from the direction of
the river, and a number of people hurried up excitedly.Worington, the lawyer, and caught him by the sleeve.Worington glanced at the sentry, and pulled the Colonel past the
entrance and into the street."They have started across with him in a light skiff----four men and a
captain.And a lot of us, who suspected
what they were up to, were standing around.When we saw 'em come down,
we made a rush and had the guard overpowered But Colfax called out to
stand back.""Cuss me if I understand him," said Mr."He told us to
disperse, and that he proposed to remain a prisoner and go where they
sent him."Then--"Move on please, gentlemen," said the sentry,
and they started to walk toward the car line, the lawyer and the Colonel
together.Virginia put her hand through the Captain's arm.In the
darkness he laid his big one over it."Don't you be frightened, Jinny, at what I said, I reckon they'll fetch
up in Illinois all right, if I know Lyon.There, there," said Captain
Lige, soothingly.She had endured more in
the past few days than often falls to the lot of one-and-twenty.He thought of the
many, many times he had taken her on his knee and kissed her tears.He
might do that no more, now.There was the young Captain, a prisoner on
the great black river, who had a better right, Elijah Brent wondered, as
they waited in the silent street for the lonely car, if Clarence loved
her as well as he.It was vary late when they reached home, and Virginia went silently up
to her room.Colonel Carvel stared grimly after her, then glanced at his
friend as he turned down the lights.The eyes of the two met, as of old,
in true understanding.The sun was still slanting over the tops of the houses the next morning
when Virginia, a ghostly figure, crept down the stairs and withdrew
the lock and bolt on the front door.The street was still, save for
the twittering of birds and the distant rumble of a cart in its early
rounds.The chill air of the morning made her shiver as she scanned the
entry for the newspaper.Dismayed, she turned to the clock in the hall.She sat long behind the curtains in her father's little library, the
thoughts whirling in her brain as she watched the growing life of
another day.Once she stole softly back to
the entry, self-indulgent and ashamed, to rehearse again the bitter and
the sweet of that scene of the Sunday before.She summoned up the image
of the young man who had stood on these steps in front of the frightened
servants.She seemed to feel again the calm power and earnestness of his
face, to hear again the clear-cut tones of his voice as he advised
her.Then she drew back, frightened, into the sombre library,
conscience-stricken that she should have yielded to this temptation
then, when Clarence--She dared not follow the thought, but she saw the
light skiff at the mercy of the angry river and the dark night.If he were spared, she prayed for strength to
consecrate herself to him A book lay on the table, and Virginia took
refuge in it.And her eyes glancing over the pages, rested on this
verse:--

       "Thy voice is heard thro' rolling drums,
        That beat to battle where he stands;
        Thy face across his fancy comes,
        And gives the battle to his hands."The paper brought no news, nor mentioned the ruse to which Captain Lyon
had resorted to elude the writ by transporting his prisoner to Illinois.Newspapers were not as alert then as now.Colonel Carvel was off early
to the Arsenal in search of tidings.He would not hear of Virginia's
going with him.Captain Lige, with a surer instinct, went to the river.Twice Virginia was summoned to her aunt, and
twice she made excuse.It was the Captain who returned first, and she
met him at the door."He is alive," said the Captain, tremulously, "alive and well, and
escaped South."She took a step toward him, and swayed.For a
brief instant he held her in his arms and then he led her to the great
armchair that was the Colonel's."Lige," she said, "--are you sure that this is not--a kindness?""No, Jinny," he answered quickly, "but things were mighty close.They struck out straight
across, but they drifted and drifted like log-wood.And then she began
to fill, and all five of 'em to bail.The
five soldiers came up on that bit of an island below the Arsenal.They
hunted all night, but they didn't find Clarence.And they got taken off
to the Arsenal this morning.""I knew that much this morning," he continued, "and so did your pa.But
the Andrew Jackson is just in from Memphis, and the Captain tells me
that he spoke the Memphis packet off Cape Girardeau, and that Clarence
was aboard.She picked him up by a miracle, after he had just missed a
round trip through her wheel-house."CHAPTER I. INTRODUCING A CAPITALIST

A cordon of blue regiments surrounded the city at first from Carondelet
to North St.The crowds liked best to go to
Compton Heights, where the tents of the German citizen-soldiers were
spread out like so many slices of white cake on the green beside the
city's reservoir.Thence the eye stretched across the town, catching the
dome of the Court House and the spire of St.Away to the west,
on the line of the Pacific railroad that led halfway across the state,
was another camp.Then another, and another, on the circle of the fan,
until the river was reached to the northward, far above the bend.Within
was a peace that passed understanding,--the peace of martial law.Without the city, in the great state beyond, an irate governor had
gathered his forces from the east and from the west.Letters came and
went between Jefferson City and Jefferson Davis, their purport being
that the Governor was to work out his own salvation, for a while
at least.Louis, struck in a night by the fever of
militarism, arose and went to Glencoe.Prying sergeants and commissioned
officers, mostly of hated German extraction, thundered at the door
of Colonel Carvel's house, and other houses, there--for Glencoe was
a border town.They searched the place more than once from garret to
cellar, muttered guttural oaths, and smelled of beer and sauerkraut, The
haughty appearance of Miss Carvel did not awe them--they were blind
to all manly sensations.The Colonel's house, alas, was one of many in
Glencoe written down in red ink in a book at headquarters as a place
toward which the feet of the young men strayed.Good evidence was
handed in time and time again that the young men had come and gone, and
red-faced commanding officers cursed indignant subalterns, and implied
that Beauty had had a hand in it.Councils of war were held over the
advisability of seizing Mr.Carvel's house at Glencoe, but proof was
lacking until one rainy night in June a captain and ten men spurred up
the drive and swung into a big circle around the house.The Captain
took off his cavalry gauntlet and knocked at the door, more gently than
usual.The Captain was given an
audience more formal than one with the queen of Prussia could have been,
Miss Carvel was infinitely more haughty than her Majesty.Was not the
Captain hired to do a degrading service?Indeed, he thought so as he
followed her about the house and he felt like the lowest of criminals
as he opened a closet door or looked under a bed.He was a beast of the
field, of the mire.How Virginia shrank from him if he had occasion to
pass her!Her gown would have been defiled by his touch.And yet the
Captain did not smell of beer, nor of sauerkraut; nor did he swear in
any language.He did his duty apologetically, but he did it.He pulled
a man (aged seventeen) out from under a great hoop skirt in a little
closet, and the man had a pistol that refused its duty when snapped in
the Captain's face.This was little Spencer Catherwood, just home from a
military academy.Spencer was taken through the rain by the chagrined Captain to the
headquarters, where he caused a little embarrassment.No damning
evidence was discovered on his person, for the pistol had long since
ceased to be a firearm.And so after a stiff lecture from the Colonel
he was finally given back into the custody of his father.Despite the
pickets, the young men filtered through daily,--or rather nightly.Presently some of them began to come back, gaunt and worn and tattered,
among the grim cargoes that were landed by the thousands and tens of
thousands on the levee.And they took them (oh, the pity of it!)Lynch's slave pen, turned into a Union prison of
detention, where their fathers and grandfathers had been wont to send
their disorderly and insubordinate <DW65>s.They were packed away, as
the miserable slaves had been, to taste something of the bitterness
of the <DW64>'s lot.So came Bert Russell to welter in a low room whose
walls gave out the stench of years.How you cooked for them, and schemed
for them, and cried for them, you devoted women of the South!You spent
the long hot summer in town, and every day you went with your baskets
to Gratiot Street, where the infected old house stands, until--until one
morning a lady walked out past the guard, and down the street.She was
civilly detained at the corner, because she wore army boots.If you were a young lady of the proper principles
in those days, you climbed a steep pair of stairs in the heat, and stood
in line until it became your turn to be catechised by an indifferent
young officer in blue who sat behind a table and smoked a horrid cigar.He had little time to be courteous.He was not to be dazzled by a bright
gown or a pretty face; he was indifferent to a smile which would have
won a savage.His duty was to look down into your heart, and extract
therefrom the nefarious scheme you had made to set free the man you
loved ere he could be sent north to Alton or Columbus.My dear, you
wish to rescue him, to disguise him, send him south by way of Colonel
Carvel's house at Glencoe.At least, he will
have died for the South.First politics, and then war, and then more politics, in this our
country.Your masterful politician obtains a regiment, and goes to war,
sword in hand.He fights well, but he is still the politician.It
was not a case merely of fighting for the Union, but first of getting
permission to fight.Camp Jackson taken, and the prisoners exchanged
south, Captain Lyon; who moved like a whirlwind, who loved the Union
beyond his own life, was thrust down again.A mutual agreement was
entered into between the Governor and the old Indian fighter in command
of the Western Department, to respect each other.How Lyon chafed, and paced the Arsenal walks while he might have
saved the state.Then two gentlemen went to Washington, and the next
thing that happened was Brigadier General Lyon, Commander of the
Department of the West.Would General Lyon confer with the Governor of Missouri?Yes, the
General would give the Governor a safe-conduct into St.Louis, but
his Excellency must come to the General.His Excellency came, and the
General deigned to go with the Union leader to the Planters House.Conference, five hours; result, a safe-conduct for the Governor back.And this is how General Lyon ended the talk.His words, generously
preserved by a Confederate colonel who accompanied his Excellency,
deserve to be writ in gold on the National Annals."Rather than concede to the state of Missouri the right to demand that
my Government shall not enlist troops within her limits, or bring troops
into the state whenever it pleases; or move its troops at its own will
into, out of, or through, the state; rather than concede to the state of
Missouri for one single instant the right to dictate to my Government in
any matter, however unimportant, I would" (rising and pointing in turn
to every one in the room) "see you, and you, and you, and you, and every
man, woman, and child in this state, dead and buried."Then, turning
to the Governor, he continued, "This means war.In an hour one of my
officers will call for you and conduct you out of my lines."And thus, without another word, without an inclination of the head, he
turned upon his heel and strode out of the room, rattling his spurs and
clanking his sabre.In less than two months that indomitable leader was
lying dead beside Wilson's Creek, among the oaks on Bloody Hill.What he
would have been to this Union, had God spared him, we shall never know.He saved Missouri, and won respect and love from the brave men who
fought against him.What prayers rose to heaven,
and curses sank to hell, when the news of them came to the city by
the river!Flags were made by loving fingers, and shirts and bandages.Trembling young ladies of Union sympathies presented colors to regiments
on the Arsenal Green, or at Jefferson Barracks, or at Camp Benton to the
northwest near the Fair Grounds.And then the regiments marched through
the streets with bands playing that march to which the words of the
Battle Hymn were set, and those bright ensigns snapping at the front;
bright now, and new, and crimson.But soon to be stained a darker red,
and rent into tatters, and finally brought back and talked over and
cried over, and tenderly laid above an inscription in a glass case, to
be revered by generations of Americans to confer What can stir the
soul more than the sight of those old flags, standing in ranks like
the veterans they are, whose duty has been nobly done?The blood of the
color-sergeant is there, black now with age.But where are the tears of
the sad women who stitched the red and the white and the blue together?The regiments marched through the streets and aboard the boats, and
pushed off before a levee of waving handkerchiefs and nags.Later--much later, black headlines, and grim
lists three columns long,--three columns of a blanket sheet!"The City
of Alton has arrived with the following Union dead and wounded, and
the following Confederate wounded (prisoners)."In a never-ceasing procession they steamed up the river; those calm
boats which had been wont to carry the white cargoes of Commerce now
bearing the red cargoes of war.And they bore away to new battlefields
thousands of fresh-faced boys from Wisconsin and Michigan and Minnesota,
gathered at Camp Benton.Some came back with their color gone and their
red cheeks sallow and bearded and sunken.Stephen Brice, with a pain over his heart and a lump in his throat,
walked on the pavement beside his old company, but his look avoided
their faces.He wrung Richter's hand on the landing-stage.The good German's eyes were filled as he said good-by."You will come, too, my friend, when the country needs you," he said."Now" (and he shrugged his shoulders), "now have we many with no cares
to go.I have not even a father--" And he turned to Judge Whipple, who
was standing by, holding out a bony hand."God bless you, Carl," said the Judge And Carl could scarce believe his
ears.He got aboard the boat, her decks already blue with troops, and as
she backed out with her whistle screaming, the last objects he saw were
the gaunt old man and the broad-shouldered young man side by side on the
edge of the landing.Stephen's chest heaved, and as he walked back to the office with the
Judge, he could not trust himself to speak.Back to the silent office
where the shelves mocked them.The Judge closed the ground-glass door
behind him, and Stephen sat until five o'clock over a book.No, it was
not Whittlesey, but Hardee's "Tactics."He shut it with a slam, and went
to Verandah Hall to drill recruits on a dusty floor,--narrow-chested
citizens in suspenders, who knew not the first motion in right about
face.For Stephen was an adjutant in the Home Guards--what was left of
them.One we know of regarded the going of the troops and the coming of the
wounded with an equanimity truly philosophical.When the regiments
passed Carvel & Company on their way riverward to embark, Mr.Hopper did
not often take the trouble to rise from his chair, nor was he ever known
to go to the door to bid them Godspeed.This was all very well, because
they were Union regiments.Hopper did not contribute a horse,
nor even a saddle-blanket, to the young men who went away secretly in
the night, without fathers or mothers or sisters to wave at them.One scorching afternoon in July Colonel Carvel came into the office,
too hurried to remark the pain in honest Ephum's face as he watched his
master.The sure signs of a harassed man were on the Colonel.Since May
he had neglected his business affairs for others which he deemed public,
and which were so mysterious that even Mr.Hopper could not get wind
of them.These matters had taken the Colonel out of town.But now the
necessity of a pass made that awkward, and he went no farther than
Glencoe, where he spent an occasional Sunday.Hopper rose from
his chair when Mr.Carvel entered,--a most unprecedented action.Sitting down at his desk, he drummed upon it
uneasily.Eliphalet crossed the room quickly, and something that was very near a
smile was on his face.Carvel's chair with
a semi-confidential air,--one wholly new, had the Colonel given it a
thought.He did not, but began to finger some printed slips of paper
which had indorsements on their backs.His fine lips were tightly
closed, as if in pain.Hopper," he said, "these Eastern notes are due this week, are they
not?""There is no use mincing matters, Hopper.You know as well as I that
there is no money to pay them," said he, with a certain pompous attempt
at severity which characterized his kind nature.You have brought this business up to a modern footing, and made
it as prosperous as any in the town.I am sorry, sir, that those
contemptible Yankees should have forced us to the use of arms, and cut
short many promising business careers such as yours, sir.And the good gentleman looked
out of the window.He was thinking of a day, before the Mexican War,
when his young wife had sat in the very chair filled by Mr."These notes cannot be met," he repeated, and his voice was near to
breaking.The flies droning in the hot office made the only sound.Outside the
partition, among the bales, was silence.Hopper, with a remarkable ease, "I cal'late these
notes can be met."The Colonel jumped as if he had heard a shot, and one of the notes fell
to the floor.Eliphalet picked it up tenderly, and held it."There isn't a bank in town
that will lend me money.I--I haven't a friend--a friend I may ask who
can spare it, sir."Suavity was come upon
it like a new glove and changed the man.Now
he had poise, such poise as we in these days are accustomed to see in
leather and mahogany offices."I will take up those notes myself, sir."cried the Colonel, incredulously, "You?"There was not a deal of hypocrisy in his
nature, and now he did not attempt the part of Samaritan.He did not
beam upon the Colonel and remind him of the day on which, homeless and
friendless, he had been frightened into his store by a drove of mules.But his day,--the day toward which he had striven unknown and
unnoticed for so many years--the day when he would laugh at the pride of
those who had ignored and insulted him, was dawning at last.When we
are thoughtless of our words, we do not reckon with that spark in little
bosoms that may burst into flame and burn us.Not that Colonel Carvel
had ever been aught but courteous and kind to all.His station in life
had been his offence to Eliphalet, who strove now to hide an exultation
that made him tremble."I cal'late that I can gather together enough to meet the notes,
Colonel.Here followed an interval
of sheer astonishment to Mr."And you will take my note for the amount?"The Colonel pulled his goatee, and sat back in his chair, trying to face
the new light in which he saw his manager.He knew well enough that the
man was not doing this out of charity, or even gratitude.He reviewed
his whole career, from that first morning when he had carried bales to
the shipping room, to his replacement of Mr.Hood, and there was nothing
with which to accuse him.He remembered the warnings of Captain Lige
and Virginia.He could not in honor ask a cent from the Captain now.He
would not ask his sister-in-law, Mrs.Colfax, to let him touch the money
he had so ably invested for her; that little which Virginia's mother had
left the girl was sacred.Carvel had lain awake with the agony of those
Eastern debts.Not to pay was to tarnish the name of a Southern
gentleman.His house would bring nothing
in these times.He rose and began to pace the floor, tugging at his
chin.Hopper, who sat calmly on, and the
third time stopped abruptly before him."Where the devil did you get this money, sir?""I haven't been extravagant, Colonel, since I've worked for you,"
he said."It don't cost me much to live.The furrows in the Colonel's brow deepened."You offer to lend me five times more than I have ever paid you, Mr.Tell me how you have made this money before I accept it."Eliphalet had never been able to meet that eye since he had known it.But he went to his desk, and drew a long sheet of
paper from a pigeonhole."These be some of my investments," he answered, with just a tinge of
surliness."I cal'late they'll stand inspection.I ain't forcing you to
take the money, sir," he flared up, all at once."I'd like to save the
business."He went unsteadily to his desk, and none save
God knew the shock that his pride received that day.To rescue a name
which had stood untarnished since he had brought it into the world, he
drew forth some blank notes, and filled them out.But before he signed
them he spoke:

"You are a business man, Mr.Hopper," said he, "And as a business man
you must know that these notes will not legally hold.The courts are abolished, and all transactions here in St."One moment, sir," cried the Colonel, standing up and towering to his
full height."Law or no law, you shall have the money and interest, or
your security, which is this business.I need not tell you, sir, that my
word is sacred, and binding forever upon me and mine.""I'm not afraid, Colonel," answered Mr.Hopper, with a feeble attempt at
geniality.He was, in truth, awed at last."If you
were--this instant you should leave this place."He sat down, and
continued more calmly: "It will not be long before a Southern Army
marches into St."Do you reckon we can hold the business together until then,
Mr.God forbid that we should smile at the Colonel's simple faith.And if
Eliphalet Hopper had done so, his history would have ended here."Leave that to me, Colonel," he said soberly.The good Colonel sighed as he signed, away that
business which had been an honor to the city where it was founded, I
thank heaven that we are not concerned with the details of their talk
that day.Why should we wish to know the rate of interest on those
notes, or the time?Hopper filled out his check, and presently departed.It was the
signal for the little force which remained to leave.Outside, in the
store; Ephum paced uneasily, wondering why his master did not come out.Presently he crept to the door of the office, pushed it open, and beheld
Mr.Carvel with his head bowed, down in his hands."Marse Comyn, you know what I done promise young MISS long time ago,
befo'--befo' she done left us?"He saw the faithful old <DW64> but dimly.Faintly he heard the pleading
voice."Marse Comyn, won' you give Ephum a pass down, river, ter fotch Cap'n
Lige?""Ephum," said the Colonel, sadly, "I had a letter from the Captain
yesterday.His boat is a Federal transport, and he is in
Yankee pay."Ephum took a step forward, appealingly, "But de Cap'n's yo' friend,
Marse Comyn.He ain't never fo'get what you done fo' him, Marse Comyn.He ain't in de army, suh.""And I am the Captain's friend, Ephum," answered the Colonel, quietly."But I will not ask aid from any man employed by the Yankee Government.No--not from my own brother, who is in a Pennsylvania regiments."Ephum shuffled out, and his heart was lead as he closed the store that
night.Hopper has boarded a Fifth Street car, which jangles on with many
halts until it comes to Bremen, a German settlement in the north of the
city.At Bremen great droves of mules fill the street, and crowd the
entrances of the sale stables there.Whips are cracking like pistol
shots, Gentlemen with the yellow cavalry stripe of the United States
Army are pushing to and fro among the drivers and the owners, and
fingering the frightened animals.A herd breaks from the confusion
and is driven like a whirlwind down the street, dividing at the Market
House.They are going to board the Government transport--to die on the
battlefields of Kentucky and Missouri.Hopper alights from the car with complacency.He stands for a
while on a corner, against the hot building, surveying the busy scene,
unnoticed.Was it not a prophecy,--that drove which sent him into
Mr.Presently a man with a gnawed yellow mustache and a shifty eye walks out
of one of the offices, and perceives our friend.Eliphalet extends a hand to be squeezed and returned."Wal, I jest reckon," is the answer: The fellow was interrupted by the
appearance of a smart young man in a smart uniform, who wore an air of
genteel importance.He could not have been more than two and twenty, and
his face and manners were those of a clerk.The tan of field service was
lacking on his cheek, and he was black under the eyes."Hullo, Ford," he said, jocularly."Howdy, Cap," retorted the other."Wal, suh, that last lot was an extry,
fo' sure.Gov'ment
ain't cheated much on them there at one-eighty a head, I reckon."Ford said this with such an air of conviction and such a sober face
that the Captain smiled.And at the same time he glanced down nervously
at the new line of buttons on his chest."I guess I know a mule from a Newfoundland dog by this time," said he."Wal, I jest reckon," asserted Mr."Cap'n
Wentworth, allow me to make you acquainted with Mr.Hopper,
Cap'n Wentworth.""You interested in
mules, Mr."I don't cal'late to be," said.Let us hope that our worthy
has not been presented as being wholly without a sense of humor.He
grinned as he looked upon this lamb in the uniform of Mars, and added,
"I'm just naturally patriotic, I guess.Cap'n, 'll you have a drink?""It's d--d tiresome lookin' at mules all
day in the sun."Davitt that his mission work does not extend to Bremen,
that the good man's charity keeps him at the improvised hospital down
town.Hopper has resigned the superintendency of his Sunday School,
it is true, but he is still a pillar of the church.The young officer leans against the bar, and listens to stories by
Mr.Ford, which it behooves no church members to hear.And Eliphalet understands that
the good Lord put some fools into the world in order to give the smart
people a chance to practise their talents.Hopper neither drinks nor
smokes, but he uses the spittoon with more freedom in this atmosphere.When at length the Captain has marched out, with a conscious but manly
air, Mr.Hopper turns to Ford--"Don't lose no time in presenting them
vouchers at headquarters," says he.And
there's grumbling about this Department in the Eastern papers, If we
have an investigation, we'll whistle.He tosses off a pony of Bourbon, but
his face is not a delight to look upon, "Hopper, you'll be a d--d rich
man some day."And because I ain't got no capital, I only get
four per cent.""Don't one-twenty a day suit you?"And you've got horse contracts, and
blanket contracts besides.What's to prevent my goin' south
when the vouchers is cashed?""Then your mother'll have
to move out of her little place."NEWS FROM CLARENCE

The epithet aristocrat may become odious and fatal on the banks of the
Mississippi as it was on the banks of the Seine.Thousands of our population, by the
sudden stoppage of business, are thrown out of employment.When gaunt
famine intrudes upon their household, it is but natural that they should
inquire the cause.Virginia did not read this editorial, because it appeared in that
abhorred organ of the Mudsills, the 'Missouri Democrat.'The wheels of
fortune were turning rapidly that first hot summer of the war time.Let
us be thankful that our flesh and blood are incapable of the fury of
the guillotine.But when we think calmly of those days, can we escape
without a little pity for the aristocrats?Do you think that many of
them did not know hunger and want long before that cruel war was over?How bravely they met the grim spectre which crept so insidiously into
their homes!Colfax, peevishly, one morning as they
sat at breakfast, "why do you persist it wearing that old gown?It has
gotten on my nerves, my dear.You really must have something new made,
even if there are no men here to dress for.""Aunt Lillian, you must not say such things.I do not think that I ever
dressed to please men.""Tut, tut; my dear, we all do.We must not go shabby in such times as these, or be out of
fashion, Did you know that Prince Napoleon was actually coming here for
a visit this autumn?I am having a fitting at
Miss Elder's to-day."She did not reply as she poured out her
aunt's coffee."Jinny," said that lady, "come with me to Elder's, and I will give you
some gowns.If Comyn had been as careful of his own money as of mine,
you could dress decently.""I think I do dress decently, Aunt Lillian," answered the girl."I do
not need the gowns.Give me the money you intend to pay for them, and I
can use it for a better purpose."Colfax arranged her lace pettishly."I am sick and tired of this superiority, Jinny.""Hodges goes through the lines to-morrow
night."But you have no idea where
Clarence is."exclaimed her aunt, "I would not trust him.How do you know
that he will get through the Dutch pickets to Price's army?Wasn't
Souther captured last week, and that rash letter of Puss Russell's
to Jack Brinsmade published in the Democrat?"She laughed at the
recollection, and Virginia was fain to laugh too."Puss hasn't been
around much since.I hope that will cure her of saying what she thinks
of people.""I'll save my money until Price drives the Yankees from the state, and
Clarence marches into the city at the head of a regiment," Mrs.Colfax
went on, "It won't be long now.""Oh, you can't have read the papers.And don't you remember the letter
Maude had from George?They need the bare necessities of life, Aunt
Lillian.And half of Price's men have no arms at all."Colfax, "bring me a newspaper."All we know is that Lyon has left
Springfield to meet our troops, and that a great battle is coming,
Perhaps--perhaps it is being fought to-day."Colfax burst into tears, "Oh, Jinny," she cried, "how can you be so
cruel!"That very evening a man, tall and lean, but with the shrewd and kindly
eye of a scout, came into the sitting-room with the Colonel and handed
a letter to Mrs.In the hall he slipped into Virginia's hand
another, in a "Jefferson Davis" envelope, and she thrust it in her
gown--the girl was on fire as he whispered in her ear that he had seen
Clarence, and that he was well.In two days an answer might be left
at Mr.But she must be careful what she wrote, as the
Yankee scouts were active.Clarence, indeed, had proven himself a man.Glory and uniform became
him well, but danger and deprivation better.The words he had written,
careless and frank and boyish, made Virginia's heart leap with pride.Colfax's letter began with the adventure below the Arsenal, when
the frail skiff had sunk near the island, He told how he had heard the
captain of his escort sing out to him in the darkness, and how he had
floated down the current instead, until, chilled and weary, he had
contrived to seize the branches of a huge tree floating by.And how by a
miracle the moon had risen.When the great Memphis packet bore down upon
him, he had, been seen from her guards, and rescued and made much of;
and set ashore at the next landing, for fear her captain would get into
trouble.In the morning he had walked into the country, first providing
himself with butternuts and rawhide boots and a bowie-knife.Virginia
would never have recognized her dashing captain of dragoons in this
guise.The letter was long for Clarence, and written under great difficulties
from date to date.For nearly a month he had tramped over mountains
and across river bottoms, waiting for news of an organized force of
resistance in Missouri.Begging his way from cabin to cabin, and living
on greasy bacon and corn pone, at length he crossed the swift Gasconade
(so named by the French settlers because of its brawling ways) where
the bridge of the Pacific railroad had been blown up by the Governor's
orders.Then he learned that the untiring Lyon had steamed up the
Missouri and had taken possession of Jefferson City without a blow, and
that the ragged rebel force had fought and lost at Booneville.Footsore,
but undaunted, he pushed on to join the army, which he heard was
retreating southward along the western tier of counties of the state.On the banks of the Osage he fell in with two other young amen in as bad
a plight as himself.They travelled together, until one day some rough
farmers with shotguns leaped out of a bunch of willows on the borders
of a creek and arrested all three for Union spies.Clarence tried to explain that he had not long since been the dapper
captain of the State Dragoons.His Excellency, the Governor of Missouri (so acknowledged by all good
Southerners), likewise laughed when Mr.Colfax and the two others were
brought before him.His Excellency sat in a cabin surrounded by a camp
which had caused the dogs of war to howl for very shame.Louis in butternuts and
rawhide boots?""Give me a razor," demanded Clarence, with indignation, "a razor and a
suit of clothes, and I will prove it."A suit of clothes You know not what you ask."George Catherwood was
brought in,--or rather what had once been George.Now he was a big
frontiersman with a huge blond beard, and a bowie, knife stuck into
his trousers in place of a sword.He recognized his young captain of
dragoons the Governor apologized, and Clarence slept that night in the
cabin.The next day he was given a horse, and a bright new rifle which
the Governor's soldiers had taken from the Dutch at Cole Camp on the way
south, And presently they made a junction with three thousand more who
were their images.This was Price's army, but Price had gone ahead into
Kansas to beg the great McCulloch and his Confederates to come to their
aid and save the state."Dear mother, I wish that you and Jinny and Uncle Comyn could have
   seen this country rabble.How you would have laughed, and cried,
   because we are just like them.In the combined army two thousand
   have only bowie-knives or clubs.Some have long rifles of Daniel
   Boone's time, not fired for thirty years.And the impedimenta are a
   sight.Open wagons and conestogas and carryalls and buggies, and
   even barouches, weighted down with frying-pans and chairs and
   feather beds.But we've got spirit, and we can whip Lyon's Dutchmen
   and Yankees just as we are.Spirit is what counts, and the Yankees
   haven't got it, I was made to-day a Captain of Cavalry under
   Colonel Rives.I ride a great, raw-boned horse like an elephant.He jolts me until I am sore,--not quite as easy as my thoroughbred,
   Jefferson.Tell Jinny to care for him, and have him ready when we
   march into St."COWSKIN PRAIRIE, 9th July."We have whipped Sigel on the prairie by <DW53> Creek and killed--we
   don't know how many.Tell Maude that George distinguished himself
   in the fight."We have at last met McCulloch and his real soldiers.We cheered
   until we cried when we saw their ranks of gray, with the gold
   buttons and the gold braid and the gold stars.General McCulloch
   has taken me on his staff, and promised me a uniform.But how to
   clothe and feed and arm our men!We have only a few poor cattle,
   and no money.We shall whip the
   Yankees before we starve."Colfax did not cease to bewail the hardship which
her dear boy was forced to endure.He, who was used to linen sheets and
eider down, was without rough blanket or shelter; who was used to the
best table in the state, was reduced to husks."But, Aunt Lillian," cried Virginia, "he is fighting for the South.If
he were fed and clothed like the Yankees, we should not be half so proud
of him."Why set down for colder gaze the burning words that Clarence wrote to
Virginia.How she pored over that letter, and folded it so that even
the candle-droppings would not be creased and fall away!He was happy,
though wretched because he could not see her.It was the life he had
longed for.he was proving his usefulness
in this world.He was no longer the mere idler whom she had chidden."Jinny, do you remember saying so many years ago that our ruin would
   come of our not being able to work?How I wish you could see us
   felling trees to make bullet-moulds, and forging slugs for canister,
   and making cartridges at night with our bayonets as candlesticks.Jinny dear, I know that you will keep up your courage.I can see
   you sewing for us, I can hear you praying for us."It was, in truth, how Virginia learned to sew.Her fingers were pricked and sore weeks after she began.Sad
to relate, her bandages, shirts, and havelocks never reached the
front,--those havelocks, to withstand the heat of the tropic sun, which
were made in thousands by devoted Union women that first summer of the
war, to be ridiculed as nightcaps by the soldiers."Why should not our soldiers have them, too?"They were never so happy as when sewing on them against
the arrival of the Army of Liberation, which never came.The long, long days of heat dragged slowly, with little to cheer those
families separated from their dear ones by a great army.Clarence might
die, and a month--perhaps a year--pass without news, unless he were
brought a prisoner to St.How Virginia envied Maude because the
Union lists of dead and wounded would give her tidings of her brother
Tom, at least!How she coveted the many Union families, whose sons and
brothers were at the front, this privilege!We were speaking of the French Revolution, when, as Balzac remarked, to
be a spy was to be a patriot.Heads are not so cheap in our Anglo-Saxon
countries; passions not so fierce and uncontrollable.Compare, with a
prominent historian, our Boston Massacre and St.Compare Camp Jackson, or Baltimore, where a
few people were shot, with some Paris street scenes after the Bastille.Our own provost marshal was
hissed in the street, and called "Robespierre," and yet he did not fear
the assassin's knife.Our own Southern aristocrats were hemmed in in
a Union city (their own city).No women were thrown into prison, it is
true.Yet one was not permitted to shout for Jeff Davis on the street
corner before the provost's guard.Once in a while a detachment of
the Home Guards, commanded by a lieutenant; would march swiftly into a
street and stop before a house, whose occupants would run to the rear,
only to encounter another detachment in the alley.One day, in great excitement, Eugenie Renault rang the bell of the
Carvel house, and ran past the astounded Jackson up the stairs to
Virginia's room, the door of which she burst open.she cried, "Puss Russell's house is surrounded by Yankees,
and Puss and Emily and all the family are prisoners!"said Virginia, dropping in her excitement her
last year's bonnet, which she was trimming with red, white, and red."Because," said Eugenie, sputtering with indignation "because they waved
at some of our poor fellows who were being taken to the slave pen.Russell's house under guard--Puss had a
small--"

"Confederate flag," put in Virginia, smiling in spite of herself."And she waved it between the shutters," Eugenie continued."And some
one told, the provost marshal.He has had the house surrounded, and the
family have to stay there.""Then," said Miss Renault, in a voice of awe, "then each one of the
family is to have just a common army ration.They are to be treated as
prisoners.""Oh, those Yankees are detestable!"As soon as our army is organized and equipped, they shall
pay for it ten times over."She tried on the bonnet, conspicuous with
its red and white ribbons, before the glass.Then she ran to the closet
and drew forth the white gown with its red trimmings."Wait for me,
Genie," she said, "and we'll go down to Puss's house together.It may
cheer her to see us.""But not in that dress," said Eugenie, aghast.And her eyes flashed so
that Eugenie was frightened.Miss Renault regarded her friend with something of adoration from
beneath her black lashes.It was about five in the afternoon when they
started out together under Virginia's white parasol, Eugenie's slimmer
courage upheld by her friend's bearing.We must remember that
Virginia was young, and that her feelings were akin to those our
great-grandmothers experienced when the British held New York.It was
as if she had been born to wear the red and white of the South.Elderly
gentlemen of Northern persuasion paused in their homeward walk to smile
in admiration,--some sadly, as Mr.Young gentlemen found an
excuse to retrace their steps a block or two.But Virginia walked on
air, and saw nothing.She was between fierce anger and exaltation.She
did not deign to drop her eyes as low as the citizen sergeant and guard
in front of Puss Russell's house (these men were only human, after all);
she did not so much as glance at the curious people standing on the
corner, who could not resist a murmur of delight.The citizen sergeant
only smiled, and made no move to arrest the young lady in red and white.Nor did Puss fling open the blinds and wave at her.Russell won't let her," said Virginia,
disconsolately, "Genie, let's go to headquarters, and show this Yankee
General Fremont that we are not afraid of him."Eugenie's breath was taken away by the very boldness of this
proposition.. She looked up timidly into Virginia's face, and
hero-worship got the better of prudence.The house which General Fremont appropriated for his use when he came
back from Europe to assume command in the West was not a modest one.It
still stands, a large mansion of brick with a stone front, very tall and
very wide, with an elaborate cornice and plate-glass windows, both tall
and broad, and a high basement.Two stately stone porches capped by
elaborate iron railings adorn it in front and on the side.In short, the house is of that type built
by many wealthy gentlemen in the middle of the century, which has best
stood the test of time,--the only type which, if repeated to-day, would
not clash with the architectural education which we are receiving.A
spacious yard well above the pavement surrounds it, sustained by a wall
of dressed stones, capped by an iron fence.The whole expressed wealth,
security, solidity, conservatism.Alas, that the coal deposits under
the black mud of our Western states should, at length, have driven
the owners of these houses out of them!They are now blackened, almost
buried in soot; empty, or half-tenanted by boarders, Descendants of the
old families pass them on their way to business or to the theatre with
a sigh.The sons of those who owned them have built westward, and
west-ward again, until now they are six miles from the river.On that summer evening forty years ago, when Virginia and Eugenie came
in sight of the house, a scene of great animation was before them.Talk
was rife over the commanding general's pomp and circumstance.He had
just returned from Europe, where pomp and circumstance and the military
were wedded.Foreign officers should come to America to teach our
army dress and manners.A dashing Hungarian commanded the general's
body-guard, which honorable corps was even then drawn up in the street
before the house, surrounded at a respectable distance by a crowd
that feared to jest.They felt like it save when they caught the stern
military eye of the Hungarian captain.Virginia gazed at the glittering
uniforms, resplendent in the sun, and at the sleek and well-fed horses,
and scalding tears came as she thought of the half-starved rabble of
Southern patriots on the burning prairies.Just then a sharp command
escaped in broken English from the Hungarian.The people in the yard of
the mansion parted, and the General himself walked proudly out of the
gate to the curb, where his charger was pawing the gutter.As he put
foot to the stirrup, the eye of the great man (once candidate, and again
to be, for President) caught the glint of red and white on the corner.For an instant he stood transfixed to the spot, with one leg in the air.Then he took it down again and spoke to a young officer of his staff,
who smiled and began to walk toward them.Little Eugenie's knees
trembled.She seized Virginia's arm, and whispered in agony."Oh, Jinny, you are to be arrested, after all.Oh, I wish you hadn't
been so bold!""Hush," said Virginia, as she prepared to slay the young officer with
a look.She felt like flying at his throat, and choking him for the
insolence of that smile.How dare he march undaunted to within six paces
of those eyes?The crowd drew back, But did Miss Carvel retreat?"Oh, I hope he will arrest me," she said passionately, to Eugenie."He will start a conflagration beyond the power of any Yankee to quell."No, those were not
the words, surely.He bowed very
low and said:

"Ladies, the General's compliments, and he begs that this much of the
sidewalk may be kept clear for a few moments."What was left for them, after that, save a retreat?But he was not
precipitate.Miss Virginia crossed the street with a dignity and bearing
which drew even the eyes of the body-guard to one side.And there she
stood haughtily until the guard and the General had thundered away.A
crowd of black-coated civilians, and quartermasters and other officers
in uniform, poured out of the basement of the house into the yards.One
civilian, a youngish man a little inclined to stoutness, stopped at the
gate, stared, then thrust some papers in his pocket and hurried down
the side street.Three blocks thence he appeared abreast of Miss Carvel.More remarkable still, he lifted his hat clear of his head.Hopper, with his newly acquired equanimity and poise,
startled her."May I have the pleasure," said that gentleman, "of accompanying you
home?"Eugenie giggled, Virginia was more annoyed than she showed."You must not come out of your way," she said."I am
sure you must go back to the store.Had Virginia but known, this occasional tartness in her speech gave
Eliphalet an infinite delight, even while it hurt him.His was a nature
which liked to gloat over a goal on the horizon He cared not a whit for
sweet girls; they cloyed.He
had revised his vocabulary for just such an occasion, and thrown out
some of the vernacular."Business is not so pressing nowadays, Miss Carvel," he answered, with a
shade of meaning."Then existence must be rather heavy for you," she said.She made
no attempt to introduce him to Eugenie."If we should have any more
victories like Bull Run, prosperity will come back with a rush," said
the son of Massachusetts."Southern Confederacy, with Missouri one of
its stars an industrial development of the South--fortunes in cotton."Virginia turned quickly, "Oh, how dare you?""How dare you
speak flippantly of such things?"His suavity was far from overthrown."I assure you that I want to see the
South win."What he did not know was that words seldom convince women.But he added something which reduced her incredulity for the time."Do
you cal'late," said he,--that I could work for your father, and wish
ruin to his country?""But you are a Yankee born," she exclaimed."There be a few sane Yankees," replied Mr.A remark
which made Eugenie laugh outright, and Virginia could not refrain from a
smile.But much against her will he walked home with her.She was indignant by
the time she reached Locust Street.He had never dared do such a thing
before, What had got into the man?Was it because he had become
a manager, and governed the business during her father's frequent
absences?Hopper's politics, he would always be to
her a low-born Yankee, a person wholly unworthy of notice.At the corner of Olive Street, a young man walking with long strides
almost bumped into them.He paused looked back, and bowed as if
uncertain of an acknowledgment.He had
been very close to her, and she had had time to notice that his coat was
threadbare.When she looked again, he had covered half the block.Why should she care if Stephen Brice had seen her in company with Mr.Eliphalet, too, had seen Stephen, and this had added zest to his
enjoyment.It was part of the fruits of his reward.He wished in that
short walk that he might meet Mr.Cluyme and Belle, and every man and
woman and child in the city whom he knew.From time to time he glanced
at the severe profile of the aristocrat beside him (he had to look up a
bit, likewise), and that look set him down among the beasts of prey.For she was his rightful prey, and he meant not to lose one tittle of
enjoyment in the progress of the game.Many and many a night in the bare
little back room at Miss Crane's, Eliphalet had gloated over the very
event which was now come to pass.Not a step of the way but what he had
lived through before.The future is laid open to such men as he.Since he had first seen the
black cloud of war rolling up from the South, a hundred times had he
rehearsed the scene with Colonel Carvel which had actually taken place
a week before.A hundred times had he prepared his speech and manner for
this first appearance in public with Virginia after he had forced the
right to walk in her company.The words he had prepared--commonplace, to
be sure, but carefully chosen--flowed from his lips in a continual nasal
stream.The girl answered absently, her feminine instinct groping after
a reason for it all.She brightened when she saw her father at the
doors and, saying good by to Eugenie, tripped up the steps, bowing to
Eliphalet coldly."Why, bless us, Jinny," said the Colonel, "you haven't been parading the
town in that costume!You'll have us in Lynch's slave pen by to-morrow
night.laughed he, patting her under the chin, "there's no
doubt about your sentiments, anyhow.""I've been over to Puss Russell's house," said she, breathless."They've
closed it up, you know--" (He nodded.)"And then we went--Eugenie and I,
to headquarters, just to see what the Yankees would do.""You must take care, honey,"
he said, lowering his voice."They suspect me now of communicating with
the Governor and McCulloch.Jinny, it's all very well to be brave, and
to stand by your colors.But this sort of thing," said he, stroking the
gown, "this sort of thing doesn't help the South, my dear, and only
sets spies upon us.Ned tells me that there was a man in plain clothes
standing in the alley last night for three hours.""Pa," cried the girl, "I'm so sorry."Suddenly searching his face with
a swift instinct, she perceived that these months had made it yellow and
lined."Pa, dear, you must come to Glencoe to-morrow and rest You must
not go off on any more trips.""It isn't the trips, Jinny There are duties, my dear, pleasant
duties--Jinny--"

"Yes?"The Colonel's eye had suddenly fallen on Mr.Hopper, who was still
standing at the bottom of the steps.He checked himself abruptly as
Eliphalet pulled off his hat,

"Howdy, Colonel?"Virginia was motionless, with her back to the intruder, She was frozen
by a presentiment.As she saw her father start down the steps, she
yearned to throw herself in front of him--to warn him of something; she
knew not what.Then she heard the Colonel's voice, courteous and kindly
as ever.And yet it broke a little as he greeted his visitor."Won't--won't you come in, Mr.Virginia started

"I don't know but what I will, thank you, Colonel," he answered; easily."I took the liberty of walking home with your daughter."Virginia fairly flew into the house and up the stairs.Gaining her room,
she shut the door and turned the key, as though he might pursue her
there.The man's face had all at once become a terror.She threw herself
on the lounge and buried her face in her hands, and she saw it still
leering at her with a new confidence.Presently she grew calmer; rising,
she put on the plainest of her scanty wardrobe, and went down the
stairs, all in a strange trepidation new to her.She had never been in
fear of a man before.She hearkened over the banisters for his voice,
heard it, and summoned all her courage.How cowardly she had been to
leave her father alone with him.Colfax
ignored him as completely as if his chair had been vacant He glanced at
that lady once, and smiled, for he was tasting the sweets of victory.It was Virginia who entertained him, and even the Colonel never guessed
what it cost her.Eliphalet himself marvelled at her change of manner,
and gloated over that likewise.Not a turn or a quiver of the victim's
pain is missed by your beast of prey.The Colonel was gravely polite,
but preoccupied.Had he wished it, he could not have been rude to a
guest.Hopper a cigar with the same air that he would
have given it to a governor."Thank'ee, Colonel, I don't smoke," he said, waving the bog away.Colfax flung herself out of the room.It was ten o'clock when Eliphalet reached Miss Crane's, and picked his
way up the front steps where the boarders were gathered."The war doesn't seem to make any difference in your business, Mr.Hopper," his landlady remarked, "where have you been so late?""I happened round at Colonel Carvel's this afternoon, and stayed for tea
with 'em," he answered, striving to speak casually.Abner Reed's room later than usual that
night.THE SCOURGE OF WAR

"Virginia," said Mrs.Colfax, the next morning on coming downstairs, "I
am going back to Bellegarde today.I really cannot put up with such a
person as Comyn had here to tea last night."It is safe to say that she had never accurately
gauged the force which Virginia's respect for her elders, and affection
for her aunt through Clarence, held in check.Now there had arisen in front of her a tall
person of authority, before whom she deferred instinctively.It was not
what Virginia said, for she would not stoop to tirade.Colfax sank
into a chair, seeing only the blurred lines of a newspaper the girl had
thrust into her hand."There has been a battle at Wilson's Creek," said Virginia, in an
emotionless voice."General Lyon is killed, for which I suppose we
should be thankful.More than seven hundred of the wounded are on their
way here.They are bringing them one hundred and twenty miles, from
Springfield to Rollo, in rough army wagons, with scarcely anything to
eat or drink.""At what time shall I order the carriage
to take you to Bellegarde?"Colfax leaned forward and caught the hem of her niece's gown."Oh,
let me stay," she cried, "let me stay."As you please, Aunt Lillian," she answered."You know that you may
always stay here.I only beg of you one thing, that when you have
anything to complain of, you will bring it to me, and not mention it
before Pa."Oh, Jinny," sobbed the lady, in tears again, "how can you be so cruel
at such a time, when my nerves are all in pieces?"But she did not lift her voice at dinner, which was very poor indeed for
Colonel Carvel's house.All day long Virginia, assisted by Uncle Ben and
Aunt Easter, toiled in the stifling kitchen, preparing dainties which
she had long denied herself.At evening she went to the station at
Fourteenth Street with her father, and stood amongst the people, pressed
back by the soldiers, until the trains came in.Alas, the heavy basket
which the Colonel carried on his arm was brought home again.The first
hundred to arrive, ten hours in a hot car without food or water, were
laid groaning on the bottom of great furniture vans, and carted to the
new House of Refuge Hospital, two miles to the south of the city.The next day many good women went there, Rebel and Union alike, to have
their hearts wrung.The new and cheap building standing in the hot sun
reeked with white wash and paint.The miserable men lay on the hard
floor, still in the matted clothes they had worn in battle.Those were
the first days of the war, when the wages of our passions first came to
appal us.Many of the wounds had not been tended since they were dressed
on the field weeks before.Colfax went too, with the Colonel and her niece, although she
declared repeatedly that she could not go through with such an
ordeal.Carvel had to assist her to the
waiting-room.Then he went back to the improvised wards to find Virginia
busy over a gaunt Arkansan of Price's army, whose pitiful, fever-glazed
eyes were following her every motion.His frontiersman's clothes,
stained with blackened blood, hung limp over his wasted body.At
Virginia's bidding the Colonel ran downstairs for a bucket of fresh
water, and she washed the caked dust from his face and hands.Brinsmade who got the surgeon to dress the man's wound, and to prescribe
some of the broth from Virginia's basket.For the first time since the
war began something of happiness entered her breast.Brinsmade who was everywhere that day, answering the
questions of distracted mothers and fathers and sisters who thronged
the place; consulting with the surgeons; helping the few who knew how to
work in placing mattresses under the worst cases; or again he might have
been seen seated on the bare floor with a pad on his knee, taking down
the names of dear ones in distant states,--that he might spend his night
writing to them.They put a mattress under the Arkansan.Virginia did not leave him until
he had fallen asleep, and a smile of peace was come upon his sunken
face.Dismayed at the fearful sights about her, awed by the groans that
rose on every side, she was choosing her way swiftly down the room to
join her father and aunt in the carriage below.She felt that another little while
in this heated, horrible place would drive her mad.She was almost at
the door when she came suddenly upon a sight that made her pause.An elderly lady in widow's black was kneeling beside a man groaning in
mortal agony, fanning away the flies already gathering about his face.He wore the uniform of a Union sergeant,--dusty and splotched and torn.A small Testament was clasped convulsively in the fingers of his right
band.Virginia lingered, whelmed in pity,
thrilled by a wonderful womanliness of her who knelt there.Her face the
girl had not even seen, for it was bent over the man.The sweetness of
her voice held Virginia as in a spell, and the sergeant stopped groaning
that he might listen:

"You have a wife?""A boy, ma'am--born the week--before I came--away.""I shall write to your wife," said the lady, so gently that Virginia
could scarce hear, "and tell her that you are cared for.He gave the address faintly--some little town in Minnesota.Then he
added, "God bless you, lady."Just then the chief surgeon came and stood over them.The lady turned
her face up to him, and tears sparkled in her eyes.Virginia felt them
wet in her own.Nobility, character,
efficiency,-all were written on that face.Nobility spoke in the large
features, in the generous mouth, in the calm, gray eyes.Virginia had
seen her often before, but not until now was the woman revealed to her."Doctor, could this man's life be saved if I took him to my home?"The surgeon got down beside her and took the man's pulse.For a while the doctor knelt there, shaking his head."He has
fainted," he said.The surgeon
smiled,--such a smile as a good man gives after eighteen hours of
amputating, of bandaging, of advising,--work which requires a firm hand,
a clear eye and brain, and a good heart.Brice," he said, "I shall be glad to get you permission
to take him, but we must first make him worth the taking.He glanced hurriedly about the busy room, and
then added, "We must have one more to help us.""I am afraid we must go, dear," he said, "your aunt is getting
impatient.""Won't you please go without me, Pa?""Perhaps I can be of
some use."The Colonel cast a wondering glance at the limp uniform, and went
away.The surgeon, who knew the Carvel family, gave Virginia a look of
astonishment.Brice's searching gaze that brought the color
to the girl's, face."Thank you, my dear," she said simply.As soon as he could get his sister-in-law off to Locust Street in the
carriage, Colonel Carvel came back.For two reeking hours he stood
against the newly plastered wall.Even he was surprised at the fortitude
and skill Virginia showed from the very first, when she had deftly
cut away the stiffened blue cloth, and helped to take off the rough
bandages.At length the fearful operation was finished, and the weary
surgeon, gathering up his box, expressed with all the energy left to
him, his thanks to the two ladies.The work of her hands had sustained
her while it lasted, but now the ordeal was come.She went down the
stairs on her father's arm, and out into the air.Brice was beside her, and had taken her by the hand.she was saying, "God will reward you for this act.You have
taught many of us to-day a lesson we should have learned in our Bibles."Virginia trembled with many emotions, but she answered nothing.The
mere presence of this woman had a strange effect upon the girl,--she was
filled with a longing unutterable.It was not because Margaret Brice
was the mother of him whose life had been so strangely blended with
hers--whom she saw in her dreams.And yet now some of Stephen's traits
seemed to come to her understanding, as by a revelation.Virginia had
labored through the heat of the day by Margaret Brice's side doing His
work, which levels all feuds and makes all women sisters.One brief
second had been needful for the spell.The Colonel bowed with that courtesy and respect which distinguished
him, and Mrs.Brice left them to go back into the room of torment, and
watch by the sergeant's pallet.Virginia's eyes followed her up the
stairs, and then she and her father walked slowly to the carriage.With
her foot on the step Virginia paused."Pa," she said, "do you think it would be possible to get them to let us
take that Arkansan into our house?""Why, honey, I'll ask Brinsmade if you like," said the Colonel."Here he
comes now, and Anne."It was Virginia who put the question to him."My dear," replied that gentleman, patting her, "I would do anything
in the world for you.I'll see General Fremont this very afternoon.Virginia," he added, soberly, "it is such acts as yours to-day that give
us courage to live in these times.""Oh, Jinny, I saw what you were doing for one of our men.It was well that Virginia did not see the smile on
the face of the commanding general when Mr.Brinsmade at length got to
him with her request.This was before the days when the wounded arrived
by the thousands, when the zeal of the Southern ladies threatened to
throw out of gear the workings of a great system.But the General, had
had his eye on Mr.Brinsmade, with dignity, "is a gentleman.When he gives his word, it is sacred, sir.""Even to an enemy," the General put in, "By George, Brinsmade, unless I
knew you, I should think that you were half rebel yourself.Well, well,
he may have his Arkansan."Brinsmade, when he conveyed the news to the Carvel house, did not
say that he had wasted a precious afternoon in the attempt to interview
his Excellency, the Commander in-chief.It was like obtaining an
audience with the Sultan or the Czar.Citizens who had been prominent
in affairs for twenty years, philanthropists and patriotic-spirited men
like Mr.Brinsmade, the mayor, and all the ex-mayors mopped their brows
in one of the general's anterooms of the big mansion, and wrangled with
beardless youths in bright uniforms who were part of the chain.The
General might have been a Richelieu, a Marlborough.His European notions
of uniformed inaccessibility he carried out to the letter.He was
a royal personage, seldom seen, who went abroad in the midst of a
glittering guard.It did not seem to weigh with his Excellency that
these simple and democratic gentlemen would not put up with this sort of
thing.That they who had saved the city to the Union were more or less
in communication with a simple and democratic President; that in all
their lives they had never been in the habit of sitting idly for two
hours to mop their brows.On the other hand, once you got beyond the gold lace and the etiquette,
you discovered a good man and a patriot.It was far from being the
General's fault that Mr.Hopper and others made money in mules and
worthless army blankets.Such things always have been, and always will
be unavoidable when this great country of ours rises from the deep sleep
of security into which her sons have lulled her, to demand her sword.We
shall never be able to realize that the maintenance of a standing army
of comfortable size will save millions in the end.So much for Democracy
when it becomes a catchword.The General was a good man, had he done nothing else than encourage the
Western Sanitary Commission, that glorious army of drilled men and women
who gave up all to relieve the suffering which the war was causing.Would that a novel--a great novel--might be written setting forth with
truth its doings.The hero of it could be Calvin Brinsmade, and a nobler
hero than he was never under a man's hand.For the glory of generals
fades beside his glory.Brice home from
her trying day in the hospital.Stephen, just returned from drill
at Verandah hall, met her at the door.She would not listen to his
entreaties to rest, but in the evening, as usual, took her sewing to the
porch behind the house, where there was a little breeze."Such a singular thing happened to-day, Stephen," she said."It was
while we were trying to save the life of a poor sergeant who had lost
his arm.I hope we shall be allowed to have him here."It was soon after I had come upon this poor fellow," she said."I saw
the--the flies around him.And as I got down beside him to fan them away
I had such a queer sensation.I knew that some one was standing behind
me, looking at me.Allerdyce came, and I asked him about the
man, and he said there was a chance of saving him if we could only get
help.Then some one spoke up,--such a sweet voice.It was that Miss
Carvel my dear, with whom you had such a strange experience when you
bought Hester, and to whose party you once went.Do you remember that
they offered us their house in Glencoe when the Judge was so ill?""She is a wonderful creature," his mother continued.And wasn't it a remarkable offer for a Southern woman to
make?They feel so bitterly, and--and I do not blame them."The good
lady put down on her lap the night-shirt she was making.And, my dear, her
capability astonished me.One might have thought that she had always
been a nurse.The experience was a dreadful one for me--what must
it have been for her.After the operation was over, I followed her
downstairs to where she was standing with her father in front of the
building, waiting for their carriage.I felt that I must say something
to her, for in all my life I have never seen a nobler thing done.When I
saw her there, I scarcely knew what to say.It was then three o'clock, and she had been working steadily in that
place since morning.I am sure she could not have borne it much longer.Sheer courage carried her through it, I know, for her hand trembled so
when I took it, and she was very pale.Her father, the Colonel, was with her, and he bowed to me with such
politeness.He had stood against the wall all the while we had worked,
and he brought a mattress for us.I have heard that his house is
watched, and that they have him under suspicion for communicating
with the Confederate leaders."I hope they will not get into any trouble.""I hope not, mother," said Stephen.It was two mornings later that Judge Whipple and Stephen drove to the
Iron Mountain depot, where they found a German company of Home Guards
drawn up.On the long wooden platform under the sheds Stephen
caught sight of Herr Korner and Herr Hauptmann amid a group of their
countrymen.Little Korner came forward to clasp his hands.The tears ran
on his cheeks, and he could not speak for emotion.Judge Whipple, grim
and silent, stood apart.But he uncovered his head with the others when
the train rolled in.Reverently they entered a car where the pine boxes
were piled one on another, and they bore out the earthly remains of
Captain Carl Richter.Far from the land of his birth, among those same oaks on Bloody Hill
where brave Lyon fell, he had gladly given up his life for the new
country and the new cause he had made his own.That afternoon in the cemetery, as the smoke of the last salute to a
hero hung in the flickering light and drifted upward through the
great trees, as the still air was yet quivering with the notes of the
bugle-call which is the soldiers requiem, a tall figure, gaunt and bent,
stepped out from behind the blue line of the troops.He carried in his hand a wreath of white roses--the first
of many to be laid on Richter's grave.And yet he had not filled it
with sadness.For many a month, and many a year, Stephen could not look
upon his empty place without a pang.He missed the cheery songs and the
earnest presence even more than he had thought.Carl Richter,--as his
father before him,--had lived for others.Both had sacrificed their
bodies for a cause.One of them might be pictured as he trudged with
Father Jahn from door to door through the Rhine country, or shouldering
at sixteen a heavy musket in the Landwehr's ranks to drive the tyrant
Napoleon from the beloved Fatherland Later, aged before his time,
his wife dead of misery, decrepit and prison-worn in the service of a
thankless country, his hopes lived again in Carl, the swordsman of Jena.Then came the pitiful Revolution, the sundering of all ties, the elder
man left to drag out his few weary days before a shattered altar.In
Carl a new aspiration had sprung up, a new patriotism stirred.His, too,
had been the sacrifice.Happy in death, for he had helped perpetuate
that great Union which should be for all time the refuge of the
oppressed.THE LIST OF SIXTY

One chilling day in November, when an icy rain was falling on the black
mud of the streets, Virginia looked out of the window.Her eye was
caught by two horses which were just skeletons with the skin stretched
over them.One had a bad sore on his flank, and was lame.They were
pulling a rattle-trap farm wagon with a buckled wheel.On the seat a
man, pallid and bent and scantily clad, was holding the reins in his
feeble hands, while beside him cowered a child of ten wrapped in a
ragged blanket.In the body of the wagon, lying on a mattress pressed
down in the midst of broken, cheap furniture and filthy kitchen ware,
lay a gaunt woman in the rain.Her eyes were closed, and a hump on the
surface of the dirty quilt beside her showed that a child must be there.From such a picture the girl fled in tears.But the sight of it, and of
others like it, haunted her for weeks.Through those last dreary days of
November, wretched families, which a year since had been in health and
prosperity, came to the city, beggars, with the wrecks of their homes.The history of that hideous pilgrimage across a state has never been
written.Still they came by the hundred, those families.The father of one, hale and strong when
they started, died of pneumonia in the public lodging-house.The walls
of that house could tell many tales to wring the heart.Brinsmade, did he choose to speak of his own charities.He found
time, between his labors at the big hospital newly founded, and his
correspondence, and his journeys of love,--between early morning and
midnight,--to give some hours a day to the refugees.Throughout December they poured in on the afflicted city, already
overtaxed.All the way to Springfield the road was lined with remains
of articles once dear--a child's doll, a little rocking-chair, a 
print that has hung in the best room, a Bible text.Anne Brinsmade, driven by Nicodemus, went from house to house to solicit
old clothes, and take them to the crowded place of detention.Christmas
was drawing near--a sorry Christmas, in truth.And many of the wanderers
were unclothed and unfed.More battles had been fought; factions had arisen among Union men.Louis to take charge of the Department,
and the other with his wondrous body-guard was gone.The most serious problem confronting the new general--was how to care
for the refugees.A council of citizens was called at headquarters, and
the verdict went forth in the never-to-be-forgotten Orders No."Inasmuch," said the General, "as the Secession army had driven these
people from their homes, Secession sympathizers should be made to
support them."He added that the city was unquestionably full of these.Indignation was rife the day that order was published.Sixty prominent
"disloyalists" were to be chosen and assessed to make up a sum of ten
thousand dollars."They may sell my house over my head before I will pay a cent," cried
Mr.Who were
to be on this mysterious list of "Sixty"?That was the all-absorbing
question of the town.It was an easy matter to pick the conspicuous
ones.Colonel Carvel was sure to be there, and Mr.Addison Colfax
lived for days in a fermented state of excitement which she declared
would break her down; and which, despite her many cares and worries,
gave her niece not a little amusement.For Virginia was human, and one
morning she went to her aunt's room to read this editorial from the
newspaper:-- "For the relief of many palpitating hearts it may be well
to state that we understand only two ladies are on the ten thousand
dollar list.""Jinny," she cried, "how can you be so cruel as to read me that, when
you know that I am in a state of frenzy now?It makes it an absolute certainty that Madame Jules and I will have to
pay.We are the only women of importance in the city."That afternoon she made good her much-uttered threat, and drove to
Bellegarde.Only the Colonel and Virginia and Mammy Easter and Ned were
left in the big house.Rosetta and Uncle Ben and Jackson had been
hired out, and the horses sold,--all save old Dick, who was running,
long-haired, in the fields at Glencoe.Christmas eve was a steel-gray day, and the sleet froze as it fell.Since morning Colonel Carvel had sat poking the sitting-room fire, or
pacing the floor restlessly.He was observed
night and day by Federal detectives.Virginia strove to amuse him, to
conceal her anxiety as she watched him.Well she knew that but for her
he would long since have fled southward, and often in the bitterness of
the night-time she blamed herself for not telling him to go.Ten years
had seemed to pass over him since the war had begun.All day long she had been striving to put away from her the memory of
Christmas eves past and gone of her father's early home-coming from the
store, a mysterious smile on his face; of Captain Lige stamping noisily
into the house, exchanging uproarious jests with Ned and Jackson.The
Captain had always carried under his arm a shapeless bundle which he
would confide to Ned with a knowing wink.And then the house would be
lighted from top to bottom, and Mr.Brinsmade came in for a long evening with Mr.Carvel over great bowls of
apple toddy and egg-nog.And Virginia would have her own friends in the
big parlor.That parlor was shut up now, and icy cold.Then there was Judge Whipple, the joyous event of whose year was his
Christmas dinner at Colonel Carvel's house.Brice's little table, and wondered whether he would miss
them as much as they missed him.War may break friendships, but it
cannot take away the sacredness of memories.The sombre daylight was drawing to an early close as the two stood
looking out of the sitting-room window.A man's figure muffled in
a greatcoat slanting carefully across the street caught their eyes.It was the same United States deputy marshal she had
seen the day before at Mr."Pa," she cried, "do you think he is coming here?""Pa, you must promise me to take down the mahogany bed in your room.I could not bear to see them take that.Let me put
it in the garret."The Colonel was distressed, but he spoke without a tremor.We must leave this house just as it is."Then he added,
strangely enough for him, "God's will be done."And Ned, who was cook and housemaid, came in with
his apron on."Does you want to see folks, Marse Comyn?"The Colonel rose, and went to the door himself.He was an imposing
figure as he stood in the windy vestibule, confronting the deputy.Virginia's first impulse was to shrink under the stairs.Then she came
out and stood beside her father.He was a young man with a smooth face, and
a frank brown eye which paid its tribute to Virginia.He did not appear
to relish the duty thrust upon him.He fumbled in his coat and drew from
his inner pocket a paper."Colonel Carvel," said he, "by order of Major General Halleck, I serve
you with this notice to pay the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars
for the benefit of the destitute families which the Rebels have driven
from their homes.In default of payment within a reasonable time such
personal articles will be seized and sold at public auction as will
satisfy the demand against you.""You may tell the
General that the articles may be seized.That I will not, while in my
right mind, be forced to support persons who have no claim upon me."It was said in the tone in which he might have refused an invitation to
dinner.He had gone into many houses that week;
had seen indignation, hysterics, frenzy.He had even heard men and women
whose sons and brothers were in the army of secession proclaim their
loyalty to the Union.But this dignity, and the quiet scorn of the girl
who had stood silent beside them, were new.He bowed, and casting his
eyes to the vestibule, was glad to escape from the house.Then he turned toward Virginia, thoughtfully
pulled his goatee, and laughed gently."Lordy, we haven't got three
hundred and fifty dollars to our names," said he.That fierce valley of the
Missouri, which belches fitful blizzards from December to March, is
sometimes quiet.Then the hot winds come up from the Gulf, and sleet
melts, and windows are opened.In those days the streets will be fetlock
deep in soft mud.It is neither summer, nor winter, nor spring, nor
anything.It was such a languorous afternoon in January that a furniture van,
accompanied by certain nondescript persons known as United States
Police, pulled up at the curb in front of Mr.Eugenie,
watching at the window across the street, ran to tell her father, who
came out on his steps and reviled the van with all the fluency of his
French ancestors.Mammy Easter opened the door, and then stood with her arms akimbo, amply
filling its place.Her lips protruded, and an expression of defiance
hard to describe sat on her honest black face.I 'low you knows dat jes as well as me."An embarrassed
silence, and then from Mammy, "Whaffor you laffin at?""Now I reckon you knows dat he ain't.Ef he was, you ain't come here
'quirin' in dat honey voice.""You tink I
dunno whaffor you come?You done come heah to rifle, an' to loot, an'
to steal, an' to seize what ain't your'n.You come heah when young Marse
ain't to home ter rob him.""Ned, whaffor you hidin'
yonder?Ef yo' ain't man to protect Marse Comyn's prop-ty, jes han' over
Marse Comyn's gun."The marshal and his men had stood, half amused, more than half baffled
by this unexpected resistance.Mammy Easter looked so dangerous that it
was evident she was not to be passed without extreme bodily discomfort."Who is
you to come heah 'quiring fo' her!I ain't agwine--"

"Mammy!"Mammy backed out of the door and clutched at
her bandanna."Mammy, what is all this noise about?""These heah men, Miss Jinny, was gwine f'r t' carry away all yo' pa's
blongin's.I jes' tol' 'em dey ain't comin' in ovah dis heah body."He caught sight of the face of
Miss Carvel within, and stopped abruptly."I have a warrant here from the Provost Marshal, ma'am, to seize
personal property to satisfy a claim against Colonel Carvel."Virginia took the order, read it, and handed it back."I do not see how
I am to prevent you," she said.I--I can't tell you how sorry I am.Then he
entered the chill drawing-room, threw open the blinds and glanced around
him."I expect all that we want is right here," he said.And at the sight of
the great chandelier, with its cut-glass crystals, he whistled.Then he
walked over to the big English Rothfield piano and lifted the lid.Involuntarily he rested himself on the mahogany
stool, and ran his fingers over the keys.They seemed to Virginia,
standing motionless in the ball, to give out the very chords of agony.The piano, too, had been her mother's.It had once stood in the brick
house of her grandfather Colfax at Halcyondale.The songs of Beatrice
lay on the bottom shelf of the what-not near by.No more, of an evening
when they were alone, would Virginia quietly take them out and play
them over to the Colonel, as he sat dreaming in the window with his
cigar,--dreaming of a field on the borders of a wood, of a young girl
who held his hand, and sang them softly to herself as she walked by his
side.And, when they reached the house in the October twilight, she had
played them for him on this piano.Often he had told Virginia of those
days, and walked with her over those paths.The deputy closed the lid, and sent out to the van for a truck.For the first time she heard the words of Mammy Easter."Come along upstairs wid yo' Mammy, honey.Dis ain't no place for us,
I reckon."Her words were the essence of endearment.And yet, while she
pronounced them, she glared unceasingly at the intruders."Oh, de good
Lawd'll burn de wicked!"Virginia went back into the room
and stood before the deputy."Isn't there something else you could take?"I have a necklace--"

"No, miss.And there ain't nothing quite
so salable as pianos."She watched them, dry-eyed, as they carried it away.Only Mammy Easter guessed at the pain in Virginia's breast, and
that was because there was a pain in her own.They took the rosewood
what-not, but Virginia snatched the songs before the men could
touch them, and held them in her arms.They seized the mahogany
velvet-bottomed chairs, her uncle's wedding present to her mother; and,
last of all, they ruthlessly tore up the Brussels carpet, beginning near
the spot where Clarence had spilled ice-cream at one of her children's
parties.She could not bear to look into the dismantled room when they had gone.Ned closed the blinds once
more, and she herself turned the key in the lock, and went slowly up the
stairs.CHAPTER V. THE AUCTION

"Stephen," said the Judge, in his abrupt way, "there isn't a great deal
doing.Let's go over to the Secesh property sales."The seizures and intended sale of
secession property had stirred up immense bitterness and indignation in
the city.There were Unionists (lukewarm) who denounced the measure as
unjust and brutal.The feelings of Southerners, avowed and secret, may
only be surmised.Rigid ostracism was to be the price of bidding on any
goods displayed, and men who bought in handsome furniture on that day
because it was cheap have still, after forty years, cause to remember
it.It was not that Stephen feared ostracism.Anne Brinsmade was almost the
only girl left to him from among his former circle of acquaintances.The Misses Russell showed him very
plainly that they disapproved of his politics.The hospitable days at
that house were over.Miss Catherwood, when they met on the street,
pretended not to see him, and Eugenie Renault gave him but a timid nod.The loyal families to whose houses he now went were mostly Southerners,
in sentiment against forced auctions.However, he put on his coat, and sallied forth into the sharp air, the
Judge leaning on his arm."Stephen," said he, presently, "I guess I'll do a little bidding."And, if he really wished to bid,
Stephen knew likewise that no consideration would stop him."You don't approve of this proceeding, sir, I suppose," said the Judge."Then," said the Judge, tartly, "by bidding, we help to support starving
Union families.You should not be afraid to bid, sir.""I am not afraid to bid, Judge Whipple."He did not see the smile on the
Judge's face."Then you will bid in certain things for me," said Mr.Here
he hesitated, and shook free the rest of the sentence with a wrench."Colonel Carvel always had a lot of stuff I wanted.Now I've got the
chance to buy it cheap."There was silence again, for the space of a whole block.Finally,
Stephen managed to say:-- "You'll have to excuse me, sir.cried the Judge, stopping in the middle of a cross-street, so
that a wagon nearly ran over his toes."I was once a guest in Colonel Carvel's house, sir.Neither the young man nor the old knew all it was costing the other to
say these things.The Judge took a grim pleasure in eating his heart.And as for Stephen, he often went to his office through Locust Street,
which was out of his way, in the hope that he might catch a glimpse of
Virginia.He had guessed much of the privations she had gone through.He knew that the Colonel had hired out most of his slaves, and he had
actually seen the United States Police drive across Eleventh Street with
the piano that she had played on.The Judge was laughing quietly,--not a pleasant laugh to hear,--as they
came to Morgan's great warerooms.A crowd blocked the pavement, and
hustled and shoved at the doors,--roughs, and soldiers off duty, and
ladies and gentlemen whom the Judge and Stephen knew, and some of whom
they spoke to.All of these were come out of curiosity, that they might
see for themselves any who had the temerity to bid on a neighbor's
household goods.The long hall, which ran from street to street, was
packed, the people surging backward and forward, and falling roughly
against the mahogany pieces; and apologizing, and scolding, and swearing
all in a breath.The Judge, holding tightly to Stephen, pushed his way
fiercely to the stand, vowing over and over that the commotion was a
secession trick to spoil the furniture and stampede the sale.In truth,
it was at the Judge's suggestion that a blue provost's guard was called
in later to protect the seized property.How many of those mahogany pieces, so ruthlessly tumbled about before
the public eye, meant a heartache!Wedding presents of long ago, dear to
many a bride with silvered hair, had been torn from the corner where the
children had played--children who now, alas, were grown and gone to war.Yes, that was the Brussels rug that had lain before the fire, and which
the little feet had worn in the corner.Those were the chairs the little
hands had harnessed, four in a row, and fallen on its side was the
armchair--the stage coach itself.There were the books, held up to
common gaze, that a beloved parent had thumbed with affection.Yes, and
here in another part of the hall were the family horses and the family
carriage that had gone so often back and forth from church with the
happy brood of children, now scattered and gone to war.As Stephen reached his place beside the Judge, Mr.And, if glances could have killed, many a bidder would have
dropped dead.The heavy dining-room table which meant so much to the
family went for a song to a young man recently come from Yankeeland,
whose open boast it was--like Eliphalet's secret one--that he would one
day grow rich enough to snap his fingers in the face of the Southern
aristocrats.Catherwood, his face
haggard and drawn, watched the sideboard he had given his wife on her
silver wedding being sold to a pawnbroker.Stephen looked in vain for Colonel Carvel--for Virginia.He did not want
to see them there.He knew by heart the list of things which had been
taken from their house.He understood the feeling which had sent the
Judge here to bid them in.When the auctioneer came to the Carvel list, and the well-known name was
shouted out, the crowd responded with a stir and pressed closer to the
stand.And murmurs were plainly heard in more than one direction."Now, gentlemen, and ladies," said the seller, "this here is a genuine
English Rothfield piano once belonging to Colonel Carvel, and the
celebrated Judge Colfax of Kaintucky."He lingered fondly over the
names, that the impression might have time to sink deep."This here
magnificent instrument's worth at the very least" (another pause)
"twelve hundred dollars.He struck a base note of the keys, then a treble, and they vibrated
in the heated air of the big hall.Had he hit the little C of the top
octave, the tinkle of that also might have been heard."Gentlemen and ladies, we have to begin somewheres.A menacing murmur gave place to the accusing silence.Some there were
who gazed at the Rothfield with longing eyes, but who had no intention
of committing social suicide.Suddenly a voice, the rasp of which
penetrated to St.The owner was
a seedy man with a straw-, drunkard's mustache.He was leaning
against the body of Mrs.Russell's barouche (seized for sale), and those
about him shrank away as from smallpox.His hundred-dollar offer was
followed by a hiss.When Judge Whipple drew himself up to his full six feet, that was a
warning to those that knew him.As he doubled the bid, the words came
out with the aggressive distinctness of a man who through a long life
has been used to opposition.He with the gnawed yellow mustache pushed
himself clear of the barouche, his smouldering cigar butt dropping to
the floor.And this is how Judge Whipple braved public opinion once more.As he
stood there, defiant, many were the conjectures as to what he could wish
to do with the piano of his old friend.Those who knew the Judge (and
there were few who did not) pictured to themselves the dingy little
apartment where he lived, and smiled.Whatever his detractors might have
said of him, no one was ever heard to avow that he had bought or sold
anything for gain.Could it have been of admiration for
the fine old man who towered there glaring defiance at those about him?"Give me a strong and consistent enemy," some great personage has said,
"rather than a lukewarm friend."Three score and five years the Judge
had lived, and now some were beginning to suspect that he had a heart.But it was let out to many more
that day, and they went home praising him who had once pronounced his
name with bitterness.Before he of the yellow mustache could pick up
his cigar from the floor and make another bid, the Judge had cried out
a sum which was the total of Colonel Carvel's assessment.Many recall
to this day how fiercely he frowned when the applause broke forth
of itself; and when he turned to go they made a path for him, in
admiration, the length of the hall, down which he stalked, looking
neither to the right nor left.Stephen followed him, thankful for the
day which had brought him into the service of such a man.And so it came about that the other articles were returned to Colonel
Carvel with the marshal's compliments, and put back into the cold parlor
where they had stood for many years.The men who brought them offered to
put down the carpet, but by Virginia's orders the rolls were stood up in
the corner, and the floor left bare.And days passed into weeks, and no
sign or message came from Judge Whipple in regard to the piano he had
bought.Virginia did not dare mention it to the Colonel.It had been carried by six sweating <DW64>s up the
narrow stairs into the Judge's office.Whipple's orders cleared a corner of his inner office and bedroom of
papers and books and rubbish, and there the bulky instrument was finally
set up.The Judge watched the
proceeding grimly, choking now and again from the dust that was raised,
yet uttering never a word.He locked the lid when the van man handed him
the key, and thrust that in his pocket.Stephen had of late found enough to do in St.He was the kind of
man to whom promotions came unsought, and without noise.In the autumn
he had been made a captain in the Halleck Guards of the State Militia,
as a reward for his indefatigable work in the armories and his knowledge
of tactics.Twice his company had been called out at night, and once
they made a campaign as far as the Merimec and captured a party of
recruits who were destined for Jefferson Davis.Brinsmade heard of his promotion and this exploit, and yet scarcely
a day went by that he did not see the young man at the big hospital.For
Stephen helped in the work of the Sanitary Commission too, and so strove
to make up in zeal for the service in the field which he longed to give.Brinsmade moved out to their place on the
Bellefontaine Road.This was to force Anne to take a rest.For the
girl was worn out with watching at the hospitals, and with tending
the destitute mothers and children from the ranks of the refugees.The
Brinsmade place was not far from the Fair Grounds,--now a receiving
camp for the crude but eager regiments of the Northern states.Brinsmade's, when the day's duty was done, the young Union officers
used to ride, and often there would be half a dozen of them to tea.That
house, and other great houses on the Bellefontaine Road with which this
history has no occasion to deal, were as homes to many a poor fellow who
would never see home again.Sometimes Anne would gather together such
young ladies of her acquaintance from the neighbor hood and the city as
their interests and sympathies permitted to waltz with a Union officer,
and there would be a little dance.To these dances Stephen Brice was
usually invited.One such occasion occurred on a Friday in January, and Mr.Brinsmade
himself called in his buggy and drove Stephen to the country early in
the afternoon.He and Anne went for a walk along the river, the surface
of which was broken by lumps of yellow ice.Gray clouds hung low in the
sky as they picked their way over the frozen furrows of the ploughed
fields.The grass was all a yellow-brown, but the north wind which
swayed the bare trees brought a touch of color to Anne's cheeks.Before
they realized where they were, they had nearly crossed the Bellegarde
estate, and the house itself was come into view, standing high on the
<DW72> above the withered garden."The shutters are up," said Stephen.Colfax had
come out here not long a--"

"She came out for a day just before Christina," said Anne, smiling, "and
then she ran off to Kentucky.I think she was afraid that she was one of
the two women on the list of Sixty.""It must have been a blow to her pride when she found that she was not,"
said Stephen, who had a keen remembrance of her conduct upon a certain
Sunday not a year gone.Impelled by the same inclination, they walked in silence to the house
and sat down on the edge of the porch.The only motion in the view was
the smoke from the slave quarters twisting in the wind, and the hurrying
ice in the stream.said Anne, with a sigh, "how she loved to romp!What good
times we used to have here together!"But you could not make her show
it.The other morning when she came out to our house I found her sitting
at the piano.I am sure there were tears in her eyes, but she would not
let me see them.She made some joke about Spencer Catherwood running
away.What do you think the Judge will do with that piano, Stephen?""The day after they put it in his room he came in with a great black
cloth, which he spread over it.And Anne, turning to him timidly, gave him a long,
searching look."I think that we ought to go back."They went out by the long entrance road, through the naked woods.Only a little while before he had had one of those
vivid dreams of Virginia which left their impression, but not their
substance, to haunt him.On those rare days following the dreams her
spirit had its mastery over his.He pictured her then with a glow on her
face which was neither sadness nor mirth,--a glow that ministered to
him alone.And yet, he did not dare to think that he might have won her,
even if politics and war had not divided them.When the merriment of the dance was at its height that evening, Stephen
stood at the door of the long room, meditatively watching the bright
gowns and the flash of gold on the uniforms as they flitted past.Presently the opposite door opened, and he heard Mr.Brinsmade's voice
mingling with another, the excitable energy of which recalled some
familiar episode.Almost--so it seemed--at one motion, the owner of the
voice had come out of the door and had seized Stephen's hand in a warm
grasp,--a tall and spare figure in the dress of a senior officer.The
military frock, which fitted the man's character rather than the man,
was carelessly open, laying bare a gold-buttoned white waistcoat and an
expanse of shirt bosom which ended in a black stock tie.The ends of the
collar were apart the width of the red clipped beard, and the mustache
was cropped straight along the line of the upper lip.The forehead rose
high, and was brushed carelessly free of the hair.The nose was almost
straight, but combative."The boy doesn't remember me," said the gentleman, in quick tones,
smiling at Mr."Yes, sir, I do," Stephen made haste to answer.He glanced at the star
on the shoulder strap, and said."Now in command at Camp Benton, Stephen," Mr."Won't
you sit down, General?""No," said the General, emphatically waving away the chair.Then his keen face suddenly lighted with amusement,--and
mischief, Stephen thought."So you've heard of me since we met, sir?"Guess you heard I was crazy," said the General, in his downright
way."He's been reading the lies in the newspapers too, Brinsmade," the
General went on rapidly."I'll make 'em eat their newspapers for saying
I was crazy.That's the Secretary of War's doings.Ever tell you what
Cameron did, Brinsmade?He and his party were in Louisville last fall,
when I was serving in Kentucky, and came to my room in the Galt House.Well, we locked the door, and Miller sent us up a good lunch and wine,
After lunch, the Secretary lay on my bed, and we talked things over.He
asked me what I thought about things in Kentucky.Secretary, here is the whole Union line from the
Potomac to Kansas.Here's McClellan in the East with one hundred miles
of front.Here's Fremont in the West with one hundred miles.Here we
are in Kentucky, in the centre, with three hundred miles to defend.McClellan has a hundred thousand men, Fremont has sixty thousand.You
give us fellows with over three hundred miles only eighteen thousand.''Two hundred
thousand before we get through,' said I. Cameron pitched up his hands
in the air.says he, 'where are they to come from?''The
northwest is chuck full of regiments you fellows at Washington won't
accept,' said I.Secretary, you'll need 'em all and
more before we get done with this Rebellion.'Well, sir, he was very
friendly before we finished, and I thought the thing was all thrashed
out.he goes back to Washington and gives it out that I'm
crazy, and want two hundred thousand men in Kentucky.Then I am ordered
to report to Halleck in Missouri here, and he calls me back from Sedalia
because he believes the lies."Stephen, who had in truth read the stories in question a month or two
before, could not conceal his embarrassment He looked at the man in
front of him,--alert, masterful intelligent, frank to any stranger who
took his fancy,--and wondered how any one who had talked to him could
believe them."They have to print something, General," he said."I'll give 'em something to print later on," answered the General,
grimly."Brinsmade, you fellows did have
a session with Fremont, didn't you?Anderson sent me over here last
September, and the first man I ran across at the Planters' House was
Appleton. ''To see Fremont,'
I said.'You don't think
Fremont'll see you, do you?''Well,' says Tom, 'go
'round to his palace at six to-morrow morning and bribe that Hungarian
prince who runs his body-guard to get you a good place in the line of
senators and governors and first citizens, and before nightfall you
may get a sight of him, since you come from Anderson.Not one man in
a hundred,' says Appleton, I not one man in a hundred, reaches his
chief-of-staff.'Next morning," the General continued in a staccato
which was often his habit, "had breakfast before daybreak and went
'round there.Place just swarming with Californians--army contracts."More
Californians, and by gad--old Baron Steinberger with his nose hanging
over the register.""Fremont was a little difficult to get at, General," said Mr."Things were confused and discouraged when those first contracts were
awarded.Fremont was a good man, and it wasn't his fault that the
inexperience of his quartermasters permitted some of those men to get
rich."To be sure
he was--didn't get along with Blair.These court-martials you're having
here now have stirred up the whole country.I guess we'll hear now how
those fortunes were made.To listen to those witnesses lie about each
other on the stand is better than the theatre."Stephen laughed at the comical and vivid manner in which the General set
this matter forth.He himself had been present one day of the sittings
of the court-martial when one of the witnesses on the prices of mules
was that same seedy man with the straw- mustache who had bid for
Virginia's piano against the Judge."Come, Stephen," said the General, abruptly, "run and snatch one of
those pretty girls from my officers."They deserve more, sir," answered Stephen.Whereupon the General laid
his hand impulsively on the young man's shoulder, divining what Stephen
did not say.said be; "you are doing the work in this war, not we.We
do the damage--you repair it.Brinsmade and you
gentlemen who help him, where would our Western armies be?Don't you
go to the front yet a while, young man.We need the best we have
in reserve.""You've had military
training of some sort?""He's a captain in the Halleck Guards, sir," said Mr.Brinsmade,
generously, "and the best drillmaster we've had in this city.He's seen
service, too, General."Stephen reddened furiously and started to protest, when the General
cried:-- "It's more than I have in this war.Come, come, I knew he was a
soldier.Let's see what kind of a strategist he'll make.Brinsmade, have
you got such a thing as a map?"Brinsmade had, and led the way back
into the library.The General shut the door, lighted a cigar with a
single vigorous stroke of a match, and began to smoke with quick puffs.Stephen was puzzled how to receive the confidences the General was
giving out with such freedom.When the map was laid on the table, the General drew a pencil from his
pocket and pointed to the state of Kentucky.Then he drew a line from
Columbus to Bowling Green, through Forts Donelson and Henry."Now, Stephen," said he, "there's the Rebel line.Show me the proper
place to break it."Stephen hesitated a while, and then pointed at the centre.He drew a heavy line across the
first, and it ran almost in the bed of the Tennessee River."Very question Halleck asked me the other day, and that's
how I answered it.Now, gentlemen, there's a man named Grant down in
that part of the country.Ever heard of him,
Brinsmade?He used to live here once, and a year ago he was less than I
was.The recollection of the scene in the street by the Arsenal that May
morning not a year gone came to Stephen with a shock."I saw him," he cried; "he was Captain Grant that lived on the Gravois
Road.But surely this can't be the same man who seized Paducah and was
in that affair at Belmont."They kicked him around Springfield awhile, after
the war broke out, for a military carpet-bagger.Then they gave him for
a regiment the worst lot of ruffians you ever laid eyes on.He made 'em march halfway across the
state instead of taking the cars the Governor offered.I guess
he is the man that chased the Rebs out of Belmont.Then his boys broke
loose when they got into the town.The Rebs
came back and chased 'em out into their boats on the river.Brinsmade,
you remember hearing about that."Grant did the coolest thing you ever saw.He sat on his horse at the
top of the bluff while the boys fell over each other trying to get on
the boat.Yes, sir, he sat there, disgusted, on his horse, smoking a
cigar, with the Rebs raising pandemonium all around him.And then, sir,"
cried the General, excitedly, "what do you think he did?Hanged if he
didn't force his horse right on to his haunches, slide down the whole
length of the bank and ride him across a teetering plank on to the
steamer.And the Rebs just stood on the bank and stared.They were so
astonished they didn't even shoot the man."And now, Stephen," he added, "just you run off and take hold
of the prettiest girl you can find.If any of my boys object, say I sent
you."It was little Tiefel, now a first
lieutenant with a bristly beard and tanned face, come to town on a few
days' furlough.He had been with Lyon at Wilson's Creek, and he had
a sad story to tell of how he found poor Richter, lying stark on that
bloody field, with a smile of peace upon his face.Strange that he
should at length have been killed by a sabre!It was a sad meeting for those two, since each reminded the other of
a dear friend they would see no more on earth.They went out to sup
together in the German style; and gradually, over his beer, Tiefel
forgot his sorrow.Stephen listened with an ache to the little man's
tales of the campaigns he had been through.So that presently Tiefel
cried out:

"Why, my friend, you are melancholy as an owl."He is no more crazy than I am," said Stephen, warmly--

"Is he not?"answered Tiefel, "then I will show you a mistake.You
recall last November he was out to Sedalia to inspect the camp there,
and he sleeps in a little country store where I am quartered.Now up
gets your General Sherman in the middle of the night,--midnight,--and
marches up and down between the counters, and waves his arms.So, says
he, 'land so,' says he, 'Sterling Price will be here, and Steele here,
and this column will take that road, and so-and-so's a damned fool.So he walks up and down for three eternal hours.Says
he, 'Pope has no business to be at Osterville, and Steele here at
Sedalia with his regiments all over the place.They must both go into
camp at La Mine River, and form brigades and divisions, that the troops
may be handled.'""If that's insanity," cried Stephen so strongly as to surprise the
little man; "then I wish we had more insane generals.It just shows
how a malicious rumor will spread.What Sherman said about Pope's and
Steele's forces is true as Gospel, and if you ever took the trouble to
look into that situation, Tiefel, you would see it."And Stephen brought
down his mug on the table with a crash that made the bystanders jump.It was not a month after that that Sherman's prophecy of the quiet
general who had slid down the bluff at Belmont came true.The whole
country bummed with Grant's praises.Moving with great swiftness and
secrecy up the Tennessee, in company with the gunboats of Commodore
Foote, he had pierced the Confederate line at the very point Sherman
had indicated.Fort Henry had fallen, and Grant was even then moving to
besiege Donelson.Brinsmade prepared to leave at once for the battlefield, taking with
him too Paducah physicians and nurses.All day long the boat was loading
with sanitary stores and boxes of dainties for the wounded.It was muggy
and wet--characteristic of that winter--as Stephen pushed through the
drays on the slippery levee to the landing.He had with him a basket his mother had put up.Brinsmade from the Judge It was while he was picking his way
along the crowded decks that he ran into General Sherman.The General
seized him unceremoniously by the shoulder."Good-by, Stephen," he said."Good-by, General," said Stephen, shifting his basket to shake hands."Ordered to Paducah," said the General.He pulled Stephen off the guards
into an empty cabin."Brice," said he, earnestly, "I haven't forgotten
how you saved young Brinsmade at Camp Jackson.They tell me that you are
useful here.I say, don't go in unless you have to.I don't mean force,
you understand.But when you feel that you can go in, come to me or
write me a letter.That is," he added, seemingly inspecting Stephen's
white teeth with approbation, "if you're not afraid to serve under a
crazy man."It has been said that the General liked the lack of effusiveness of
Stephen's reply.ELIPHALET PLAYS HIS TRUMPS

Summer was come again.Through interminable days, the sun beat down upon
the city; and at night the tortured bricks flung back angrily the heat
with which he had filled them.Great battles had been fought, and vast
armies were drawing breath for greater ones to come."Jinny," said the Colonel one day, "as we don't seem to be much use in
town, I reckon we may as well go to Glencoe."Virginia, threw her arms around her father's neck.For many months
she had seen what the Colonel himself was slow to comprehend--that his
usefulness was gone.The days melted into weeks, and Sterling Price and
his army of liberation failed to come.The vigilant Union general and
his aides had long since closed all avenues to the South.For, one fine
morning toward the end of the previous summer, when the Colonel was
contemplating a journey, he had read that none might leave the city
without a pass, whereupon he went hurriedly to the office of the Provost
Marshal.There he had found a number of gentlemen in the same plight,
each waving a pass made out by the Provost Marshal's clerks, and waiting
for that officer's signature.The Colonel also procured one of these,
and fell into line.The Marshal gazed at the crowd, pulled off his coat,
and readily put his name to the passes of several gentlemen going east.Bub Ballington, whom the Colonel knew, but pretended not
to."Not very profitable to be a minute-man, eh?"Ballington trying not to look indignant
as he makes for the door.A small silver bell rings on the Marshal's
desk, the one word: "Spot!"breaks the intense silence, which is one way
of saying that Mr.Ballington is detained, and will probably be lodged
that night at Government expense."Well, Colonel Carvel, what can I do for you this morning?"asked the
Marshal, genially.The Colonel pushed back his hat and wiped his brow."I reckon I'll wait
till next week, Captain," said Mr."It's pretty hot to travel
just now."There were many in the office who
would have liked to laugh, but it did not pay to laugh at some people.In the proclamation of martial law was much to make life less endurable
than ever.All who were convicted by a court-martial of being rebels
were to have property confiscated, and slaves set free.Then there was
a certain oath to be taken by all citizens who did not wish to have
guardians appointed over their actions.There were many who swallowed
this oath and never felt any ill effects.Jacob Cluyme was one, and
came away feeling very virtuous.Hopper did not have indigestion after taking it, but
Colonel Carvel would sooner have eaten, gooseberry pie, which he had
never tasted but once.That summer had worn away, like a monster which turns and gives hot
gasps when you think it has expired.It took the Arkansan just a month,
under Virginia's care, to become well enough to be sent to a Northern
prison He was not precisely a Southern gentleman, and he went to sleep
over the "Idylls of the King."But he was admiring, and grateful, and
wept when he went off to the boat with the provost's guard, destined
for a Northern prison.He had taken her away from
her aunt (who would have nothing to do with him), and had given her
occupation.She nor her father never tired of hearing his rough tales of
Price's rough army.His departure was about the time when suspicions were growing set.The
favor had caused comment and trouble, hence there was no hope of giving
another sufferer the same comfort.One of
the mysterious gentlemen who had been seen in the vicinity of Colonel
Carvel's house was arrested on the ferry, but he had contrived to be rid
of the carpet-sack in which certain precious letters were carried.Hopper's visits to Locust Street had
continued at intervals of painful regularity.It is not necessary to
dwell upon his brilliant powers of conversation, nor to repeat the
platitudes which he repeated, for there was no significance in Mr.The Colonel had found that out, and was
thankful.His manners were better; his English decidedly better.It was for her father's sake, of course, that Virginia bore with
him.She tried to be just, and it
occurred to her that she had never before been just.Again and again she
repeated to herself that Eliphalet's devotion to the Colonel at this
low ebb of his fortunes had something in it of which she did not suspect
him.Hopper as an uneducated Yankee
and a person of commercial ideals.But now he was showing virtues,--if
virtues they were,--and she tried to give him the benefit of the doubt.With his great shrewdness and business ability, why did he not take
advantage of the many opportunities the war gave to make a fortune?For Virginia had of late been going to the store with the Colonel,--who
spent his mornings turning over piles of dusty papers, and Mr.Hopper
had always been at his desk.After this, Virginia even strove to be kind to him, but it was uphill
work.The front door never closed after one of his visits that suspicion
was not left behind.Could it be that
there was a motive under all this plotting?He struck her inevitably as
the kind who would be content to mine underground to attain an end.The
worst she could think of him was that he wished to ingratiate himself
now, in the hope that, when the war was ended, he might become a partner
in Mr.She had put even this away as unworthy of her.Once she had felt compelled to speak to her father on the subject."I believe I did him an injustice, Pa," she said."Not that I like him
any better now.But I do think that if he had been as unscrupulous as I thought, he
would have deserted you long ago for something more profitable.He would
not be sitting in the office day after day making plans for the business
when the war is over."She remembered how sadly he had smiled at her over the top of his paper."You are a good girl, Jinny," he said.Toward the end of July of that second summer riots broke out in the
city, and simultaneously a bright spot appeared on Virginia's horizon.This took the form, for Northerners, of a guerilla scare, and an order
was promptly issued for the enrollment of all the able-bodied men in the
ten wards as militia, subject to service in the state, to exterminate
the roving bands.Whereupon her Britannic Majesty became extremely
popular,--even with some who claimed for a birthplace the Emerald Isle.Hundreds who heretofore had valued but lightly their British citizenship
made haste to renew their allegiance; and many sought the office of the
English Consul whose claims on her Majesty's protection were vague, to
say the least.For the first time,
when Virginia walked to the store with her father, Eliphalet was not
there."I don't blame him for not wanting to fight for the Yankees," she said."Then why doesn't he fight for the South he asked"

"Fight for the South!""I reckon not, too," said the Colonel, dryly.For the following week curiosity prompted Virginia to take that walk
with the Colonel.Hopper being still absent, she helped him to sort
the papers--those grimy reminders of a more prosperous time gone
by.Carvel would run across one which seemed to bring some
incident to his mind; for he would drop it absently on his desk, his
hand seeking his chin, and remain for half an hour lost in thought.The Colonel answered
them all truthfully--generally with that dangerous suavity for which he
was noted.Twice a seedy man with a gnawed yellow mustache had come in
to ask Eliphalet's whereabouts.On the second occasion this individual
became importunate."You don't know nothin' about him, you say?""I 'low I kin 'lighten you a little.""Good day, sir," said the Colonel."I guess you'll like to hear what I've got to say."Carvel in his natural voice, "show this man out."Ford slunk out without Ephum's assistance.But he half turned at the
door, and shot back a look that frightened Virginia."Oh, Pa," she cried, in alarm, "what did he mean?""I couldn't tell you, Jinny," he answered.But she noticed that he was
very thoughtful as they walked home.The next morning Eliphalet had not
returned, but a corporal and guard were waiting to search the store for
him.The Colonel read the order, and invited them in with hospitality.He even showed them the way upstairs, and presently Virginia heard them
all tramping overhead among the bales.Her eye fell upon the paper they
had brought, which lay unfolded on her father's desk.It was signed
Stephen A. Brice, Enrolling Officer.That very afternoon they moved to Glencoe, and Ephum was left in sole
charge of the store.At Glencoe, far from the hot city and the cruel
war, began a routine of peace.Virginia was a child again, romping
in the woods and fields beside her father.The color came back to her
cheeks once more, and the laughter into her voice.The two of them, and
Ned and Mammy, spent a rollicking hour in the pasture the freedom
of which Dick had known so long, before the old horse was caught and
brought back into bondage.After that Virginia took long drives with her
father, and coming home, they would sit in the summer house high above
the Merimec, listening to the crickets' chirp, and watching the day fade
upon the water.The Colonel, who had always detested pipes, learned to
smoke a corncob.He would sit by the hour, with his feet on the rail of
the porch and his hat tilted back, while Virginia read to him.Poe
and Wordsworth and Scott he liked, but Tennyson was his favorite.One afternoon when Virginia was sitting in the summer house alone, her
thoughts wandering back, as they sometimes did, to another afternoon
she had spent there,--it seemed so long ago,--when she saw Mammy Easter
coming toward her."Honey, dey's comp'ny up to de house.He's
on de porch, talkin' to your Pa.In truth, the solid figure of Eliphalet himself was on the path some
twenty yards behind her.His hat was in his hand; his hair was plastered
down more neatly than ever, and his coat was a faultless and sober
creation of a Franklin Avenue tailor.He carried a cane, which was
unheard of.Virginia sat upright, and patted her skirts with a gesture
of annoyance--what she felt was anger, resentment.Suddenly she rose,
swept past Mammy, and met him ten paces from the summer house."How-dy-do, Miss Virginia," he cried pleasantly."Your father had a
notion you might be here."Her greeting would have frozen a man
of ardent temperament.But it was not precisely ardor that Eliphalet
showed.There was something in
the man's air to-day.Her words seemed to relieve some tension in him."Well, I did, first of all.You're considerable smart, Miss Jinny, but
I'll bet you can't tell me where I was, now.""I cal'lated it might interest you to know
how I dodged the Sovereign State of Missouri.General Halleck made an
order that released a man from enrolling on payment of ten dollars.Then I was drafted into the Abe Lincoln Volunteers; I paid a
substitute.And so here I be, exercising life, and liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.""If your substitute gets
killed, I suppose you will have cause for congratulation."Eliphalet laughed, and pulled down his cuffs."That's his lookout,
I cal'late," said he.He glanced at the girl in a way that made her
vaguely uneasy.She turned from him, back toward the summer house.Eliphalet's eyes smouldered as they rested upon her figure."I've heard considerable about the beauties of this place.Would you
mind showing me 'round a bit?"Not since that first evening in Locust Street had it taken on such
assurance, And yet she could not be impolite to a guest."Certainly not," she replied, but without looking up.He came to the summer house, glanced around it with apparent
satisfaction, and put his foot on the moss-grown step.She leaped quickly into the doorway before him, and
stood facing him, framed in the climbing roses.He drew back,
staring in astonishment at the crimson in her face.She had been groping
wildly for excuses, and found none."Because," she said, "because I ask you not to."With dignity: "That
should be sufficient.""Well," replied Eliphalet, with an abortive laugh, "that's funny, now.Womenkind get queer notions, which I cal'late we've got to respect and
put up with all our lives--eh?"Her anger flared at his leer and at his broad way of gratifying her
whim.And she was more incensed than ever at his air of being at
home--it was nothing less.She strove still to hide her
resentment."There is a walk along the bluff," she said, coldly, "where the view is
just as good."But she purposely drew him into the right-hand path, which led, after
a little, back to the house.Despite her pace he pressed forward to her
side."Miss Jinny," said he, precipitately, "did I ever strike you as a
marrying man?"Virginia stopped, and put her handkerchief to her face, the impulse
strong upon her to laugh.Eliphalet was suddenly transformed again into
the common commercial Yankee.He was in love, and had come to ask her
advice."I never thought of you as of the marrying kind, Mr.Hopper," she
answered, her voice quivering.Indeed, he was irresistibly funny as he stood hot and ill at ease.The
Sunday coat bore witness to his increasing portliness by creasing across
from the buttons; his face, fleshy and perspiring, showed purple veins,
and the little eyes receded comically, like a pig's."Well, I've been thinking serious of late about getting married," he
continued, slashing the rose bushes with his stick."I don't cal'late
to be a sentimental critter.I'm not much on high-sounding phrases, and
such things, but I'd give you my word I'd make a good husband.""Please be careful of those roses, Mr."Beg pardon," said Eliphalet.He began to lose track of his tenses--that
was the only sign he gave of perturbation.Louis
without a cent, Miss Jinny, I made up my mind I'd be a rich man before
I left it.If I was to die now, I'd have kept that promise.I'm not
thirty-four, and I cal'late I've got as much money in a safe place as a
good many men you call rich.I'm not saying what I've got, mind you.I've stopped chewing--there was a time when I
done that."That is all very commendable, Mr.Hopper," Virginia said, stifling a
rebellious titter."But,--but why did you give up chewing?""I am informed that the ladies are against it," said Eliphalet,--"dead
against it.You wouldn't like it in a husband, now, would you?"This time the laugh was not to be put down."I confess I shouldn't," she
said."Thought so," he replied, as one versed.His tones took on a nasal
twang."Well, as I was saying, I've about got ready to settle down, and
I've had my eye on the lady this seven years.""The lady," said Eliphalet, bluntly, "is you."He glanced at her
bewildered face and went on rapidly: "You pleased me the first day I set
eyes on you in the store I said to myself, 'Hopper, there's the one for
you to marry.'I'm plain, but my folks was good people.I set to work
right then to make a fortune for you, Miss Jinny.I'm a plain business man with no frills.You're the kind that was raised in the lap of luxury.You'll need a man
with a fortune, and a big one; you're the sort to show it off.I've got
the foundations of that fortune, and the proof of it right here.And I
tell you,"--his jaw was set,--"I tell you that some day Eliphalet Hopper
will be one of the richest men in the West."He had stopped, facing her in the middle of the way, his voice strong,
his confidence supreme.At first she had stared at him in dumb wonder.Then, as she began to grasp the meaning of his harangue, astonishment
was still dominant,--sheer astonishment.But,
as he finished, the thatch of the summer house caught her eye.A vision
arose of a man beside whom Eliphalet was not worthy to crawl.She
thought of Stephen as he had stood that evening in the sunset, and this
proposal seemed a degradation.But she caught the look on Eliphalet's
face, and she knew that he would not understand.This was one who
rose and fell, who lived and loved and hated and died and was buried
by--money.For a second she looked into his face as one who escapes a pit gazes
over the precipice, and shuddered.As for Eliphalet, let it not be
thought that he had no passion.This was the moment for which he had
lived since the day he had first seen her and been scorned in the store.That type of face, that air,--these were the priceless things he would
buy with his money.Crazed with the very violence of his long-pent
desire, he seized her hand.He staggered back, and stood for a moment motionless, as though stunned.Then, slowly, a light crept into his little eyes which haunted her for
many a day."You--won't--marry me?"exclaimed Virginia, her face burning with
the shame of it.She was standing with her hands behind her, her back
against a great walnut trunk, the crusted branches of which hung over
the bluff.Even as he looked at her, Eliphalet lost his head, and
indiscretion entered his soul.You've got no notion of my
money, I say."If you owned the whole of
California, I would not marry you."He
slipped his hand into a pocket, as one used to such a motion, and drew
out some papers."I cal'late you ain't got much idea of the situation, Miss Carvel," he
said; "the wheels have been a-turning lately.You're poor, but I guess
you don't know how poor you are,--eh?The Colonel's a man of honor,
ain't he?"For her life she could not have answered,--nor did she even know why she
stayed to listen."Well," he said, "after all, there ain't much use in your lookin' over
them papers.I'll tell you what they say: they
say that if I choose, I am Carvel & Company."The little eyes receded, and he waited a moment, seemingly to prolong a
physical delight in the excitement and suffering of a splendid creature."I cal'late you despise me, don't you?"he went on, as if that, too,
gave him pleasure."But I tell you the Colonel's a beggar but for me.All you've got to do is to say you'll be my
wife, and I tear these notes in two.(He
made the motion with his hands.)"Carvel & Company's an old firm,--a
respected firm.You wouldn't care to see it go out of the family, I
cal'late."But she did none of the things he expected.She said, simply:--"Will you please follow me, Mr.And he followed her,--his shrewdness gone, for once.Save for the rise and fall of her shoulders she seemed calm.The path
wound through a jungle of waving sunflowers and led into the shade in
front of the house.His
pipe lay with its scattered ashes on the boards, and his head was bent
forward, as though listening.When he saw the two, he rose expectantly,
and went forward to meet them."Pa," she said, "is it true that you have borrowed money from this man?"Carvel angry once, and his soul had quivered.Terror, abject terror, seized him now, so that his knees smote together.As well stare into the sun as into the Colonel's face.In one stride
he had a hand in the collar of Eliphalet's new coat, the other pointing
down the path."It takes just a minute to walk to that fence, sir," he said sternly."If you are any longer about it, I reckon you'll never get past it.Hopper's gait down the flagstones was
an invention of his own.It was neither a walk, nor a trot, nor a run,
but a sort of sliding amble, such as is executed in nightmares.Singing
in his head was the famous example of the eviction of Babcock from the
store,--the only time that the Colonel's bullet had gone wide.And down
in the small of his back Eliphalet listened for the crack of a pistol,
and feared that a clean hole might be bored there any minute.Once
outside, he took to the white road, leaving a trail of dust behind him
that a wagon might have raised.Fear lent him wings, but neglected to
lift his feet.The Colonel passed his arm around his daughter, and pulled his goatee
thoughtfully.And Virginia, glancing shyly upward, saw a smile in the
creases about his mouth: She smiled, too, and then the tears hid him
from her.Strange that the face which in anger withered cowards and made men look
grave, was capable of such infinite tenderness,--tenderness and sorrow.The Colonel took Virginia in his arms, and she sobbed against his
shoulder, as of old."Yes--"

"Lige was right, and--and you, Jinny--I should never have trusted him.The sun was slanting in yellow bars through
the branches of the great trees, and a robin's note rose above the bass
chorus of the frogs.In the pauses, as she listened, it seemed as if she
could hear the silver sound of the river over the pebbles far below."Honey," said the Colonel,--"I reckon we're just as poor as white
trash.""Honey," he said again, after a pause, "I must keep my word and let him
have the business.""There is a little left, a very little," he continued slowly, painfully.It was left you by Becky--by your mother.It is in a railroad company in New York, and safe, Jinny.""Oh, Pa, you know that I do not care," she cried."It shall be yours and
mine together.And we shall live out here and be happy."He was in his familiar
posture of thought, his legs slightly apart, his felt hat pushed back,
stroking his goatee.But his clear gray eyes were troubled as they
sought hers, and she put her hand to her breast."Virginia," he said, "I fought for my country once, and I reckon I'm
some use yet awhile.It isn't right that I should idle here, while
the South needs me, Your Uncle Daniel is fifty-eight, and Colonel of a
Pennsylvania regiment.--Jinny, I have to go."It was in her blood as well as his.The Colonel
had left his young wife, to fight in Mexico; he had come home to lay
flowers on her grave.She knew that he thought of this; and, too, that
his heart was rent at leaving her.She put her hands on his shoulders,
and he stooped to kiss her trembling lips.They walked out together to the summer-house, and stood watching the
glory of the light on the western hills."Jinn," said the Colonel, "I
reckon you will have to go to your Aunt Lillian.But I know that my girl can take care of herself.In case--in case I do
not come back, or occasion should arise, find Lige.Let him take you to
your Uncle Daniel.He is fond of you, and will be all alone in Calvert
House when the war is over.And I reckon that is all I have to say.I
won't pry into your heart, honey.I
like the boy, and I believe he will quiet down into a good man."Virginia did not answer, but reached out for her father's hand and held
its fingers locked tight in her own.From the kitchen the sound of Ned's
voice rose in the still evening air."Sposin' I was to go to N' Orleans an' take sick and die,
     Laik a bird into de country ma spirit would fly."And after a while down the path the red and yellow of Mammy Easter's
bandanna was seen.Laws, if I ain't ramshacked de premises fo' you
bof.De co'n bread's gittin' cold."That evening the Colonel and Virginia thrust a few things into her
little leather bag they had chosen together in London.Virginia had
found a cigar, which she hid until they went down to the porch, and
there she gave it to him; when he lighted the match she saw that his
hand shook.Half an hour later he held her in his arms at the gate, and she heard
his firm tread die in the dust of the road.WITH THE ARMIES OF THE WEST

We are at Memphis,--for a while,--and the Christmas season is
approaching once more.And yet we must remember that war recognizes no
Christmas, nor Sunday, nor holiday.The brown river, excited by rains,
whirled seaward between his banks of yellow clay.Now the weather was
crisp and cold, now hazy and depressing, and again a downpour.A spirit possessed the place, a restless
spirit called William T. Sherman.He prodded Memphis and laid violent
hold of her.She groaned, protested, turned over, and woke up, peopled
by a new people.When these walked, they ran, and they wore a blue
uniform.Rain nor heat nor
tempest kept them in.And yet they joked, and Memphis laughed (what was
left of her), and recognized a bond of fellowship.The General joked,
and the Colonels and the Commissary and the doctors, down to the sutlers
and teamsters and the salt tars under Porter, who cursed the dishwater
Mississippi, and also a man named Eads, who had built the new-fangled
iron boxes officially known as gunboats.The like of these had
never before been seen in the waters under the earth.The loyal
citizens--loyal to the South--had been given permission to leave the
city.The General told the assistant quartermaster to hire their houses
and slaves for the benefit of the Federal Government.Likewise he laid
down certain laws to the Memphis papers defining treason.He gave
out his mind freely to that other army of occupation, the army of
speculation, that flocked thither with permits to trade in cotton.The
speculators gave the Confederates gold, which they needed most, for the
bales, which they could not use at all.The forefathers of some of these gentlemen were in old Egypt under
Pharaoh--for whom they could have had no greater respect and fear than
their descendants had in New Egypt for Grant or Sherman.And a certain acquaintance of ours
materially added to his fortune by selling in Boston the cotton which
cost him fourteen cents, at thirty cents.One day the shouting and the swearing and the running to and fro came
to a climax.Those floating freaks which were all top and drew nothing,
were loaded down to the guards with army stores and animals and wood and
men,--men who came from every walk in life.Whistles bellowed, horses neighed.The gunboats chased hither and
thither, and at length the vast processions paddled down the stream with
naval precision, under the watchful eyes of a real admiral.Residents of Memphis from the river's bank watched the pillar of smoke
fade to the southward and ruminated on the fate of Vicksburg.A little later he wrote to the
Commander-in-Chief at Washington, "The valley of the Mississippi is
America."Vicksburg taken, this vast Confederacy would be chopped in two.Night fell to the music of the paddles, to the scent of the officers'
cigars, to the blood-red vomit of the tall stacks and the smoky flame of
the torches.Then Christmas Day dawned, and there was Vicksburg lifted
two hundred feet above the fever swamps, her court-house shining in
the morning sun.Vicksburg, the well-nigh impregnable key to America's
highway.When old Vick made his plantation on the Walnut Hills, he chose
a site for a fortress of the future Confederacy that Vauban would have
delighted in.Yes, there were the Walnut Hills, high bluffs separated from the
Mississippi by tangled streams and bayous, and on their crests the
Parrotts scowled.It was a queer Christmas Day indeed, bright and warm;
no snow, no turkeys nor mince pies, no wine, but just hardtack and bacon
and foaming brown water.On the morrow the ill-assorted fleet struggled up the sluggish Yazoo,
past impenetrable forests where the cypress clutched at the keels, past
long-deserted cotton fields, until it came at last to the black ruins of
a home.It spread out by brigade
and division and regiment and company, the men splashing and paddling
through the Chickasaw and the swamps toward the bluffs.The Parrotts
began to roar.A certain regiment, boldly led, crossed the bayou at a
narrow place and swept resistless across the sodden fields to where the
bank was steepest.The fire from the battery scorched the hair of their
heads.But there they stayed, scooping out the yellow clay with torn
hands, while the Parrotts, with lowered muzzles, ploughed the <DW72> with
shells.There they stayed, while the blue lines quivered and fell back
through the forests on that short winter's afternoon, dragging their
wounded from the stagnant waters.But many were left to die in agony in
the solitude.Like a tall emblem of energy, General Sherman stood watching the attack
and repulse, his eyes ever alert.He paid no heed to the shells which
tore the limbs from the trees about him, or sent the swamp water in
thick spray over his staff.Now and again a sharp word broke from his
lips, a forceful home thrust at one of the leaders of his columns."Sixth Missouri, General," said an aide, promptly.The General sat late in the Admiral's gunboat that night, but when
he returned to his cabin in the Forest Queen, he called for a list of
officers of the Sixth Missouri.His finger slipping down the roll paused
at a name among the new second lieutenants."Yes, General, when it fell dark.""Let me see the casualties,--quick."That night a fog rolled up from the swamps, and in the morning
jack-staff was hid from pilot-house.Before the attack could be renewed,
a political general came down the river with a letter in his pocket
from Washington, by virtue of which he took possession of the three army
core, and their chief, subpoenaed the fleet and the Admiral, and went
off to capture Arkansas Post.Three weeks later, when the army was resting at Napoleon, Arkansas, a
self-contained man, with a brown beard arrived from Memphis, and took
command.He smoked incessantly in his
cabin.He had look in his face that
boded ill to any that might oppose him.Time and labor be counted
as nothing, compared with the accomplishment of an object.Back to
Vicksburg paddled the fleet and transports.Across the river from the
city, on the pasty mud behind the levee's bank were dumped Sherman's
regiments, condemned to week of ditch-digging, that the gunboats might
arrive at the bend of the Mississippi below by a canal, out of reach of
the batteries.Day in and day out they labored, officer and men.Sawing
off stumps under the water, knocking poisonous snakes by scores from the
branches, while the river rose and rose and rose, and the rain crept
by inches under their tent flies, and the enemy walked the parapet of
Vicksburg and laughed.Two gunboats accomplished the feat of running the
batteries, that their smiles might be sobered.To the young officers who were soiling their uniform with the grease of
saws, whose only fighting was against fever and water snakes, the news
of an expedition into the Vicksburg side of the river was hailed with
caps in the air.To be sure, the saw and axe, and likewise the levee and
the snakes, were to be there, too.But there was likely to be a little
fighting.The rest of the corps that was to stay watched grimly as the
detachment put off in the little 'Diligence' and 'Silver Wave'.All the night the smoke-pipes were batting against the boughs of oak and
cottonwood, and snapping the trailing vines.Some other regiments
went by another route.The ironclads, followed in hot haste by General
Sherman in a navy tug, had gone ahead, and were even then shoving with
their noses great trunks of trees in their eagerness to get behind the
Rebels.The Missouri regiment spread out along the waters, and were soon
waist deep, hewing a path for the heavier transports to come.Presently
the General came back to a plantation half under water, where Black
Bayou joins Deer Creek, to hurry the work in cleaning out that Bayou.The light transports meanwhile were bringing up more troops from a
second detachment.All through the Friday the navy great guns were
heard booming in the distance, growing quicker and quicker, until
the quivering air shook the hanging things in that vast jungle.Saws
stopped, and axes were poised over shoulders, and many times that day
the General lifted his head anxiously.As he sat down in the evening in
a slave cabin redolent with corn pone and bacon, the sound still hovered
among the trees and rolled along the still waters.It was three o'clock Saturday morning when
the sharp challenge of a sentry broke the silence.A <DW64>, white eyed,
bedraggled, and muddy, stood in the candle light under the charge of a
young lieutenant.The officer saluted, and handed the General a roll of
tobacco."I found this man in the swamp, sir.He has a message from the
Admiral--"

The General tore open the roll and took from it a piece of tissue paper
which he spread out and held under the candle.He turned to a staff
officer who had jumped from his bed and was hurrying into his coat."Kilby Smith
and all men here across creek to relief at once.I'll take canoe through
bayou to Hill's and hurry reenforcements."The staff officer paused, his hand on the latch of the door.You're not going through that sewer in a
canoe without an escort!""I guess they won't look for a needle in that haystack," the General
answered."Get back to your
regiment, Brice, if you want to go," he said.All through the painful march that
followed, though soaked in swamp water and bruised by cypress knees, he
thought of Sherman in his canoe, winding unprotected through the black
labyrinth, risking his life that more men might be brought to the rescue
of the gunboats.The story of that rescue has been told most graphically by Sherman
himself.How he picked up the men at work on the bayou and marched them
on a coal barge; how he hitched the barge to a navy tug; how he met the
little transport with a fresh load of troops, and Captain Elijah Brent's
reply when the General asked if he would follow him."As long as the
boat holds together, General."The boughs hammered
at the smoke-pipes until they went by the board, and the pilothouse fell
like a pack of cards on the deck before they had gone three miles and a
half.Then the indomitable Sherman disembarked, a lighted candle in his
hand, and led a stiff march through thicket and swamp and breast-deep
backwater, where the little drummer boys carried their drums on their
heads.At length, when they were come to some Indian mounds, they found
a picket of three, companies of the force which had reached the flat the
day before, and had been sent down to prevent the enemy from obstructing
further the stream below the fleet."The Admiral's in a bad way, sir," said the Colonel who rode up to meet
the General.Those clumsy ironclads of his can't move
backward or forward, and the Rebs have been peppering him for two days."Just then a fusillade broke from the thickets, nipping the branches from
the cottonwoods about them.The force swept forward, with the three picket companies in the swamp on
the right.And presently they came in sight of the shapeless ironclads
with their funnels belching smoke, a most remarkable spectacle.How
Porter had pushed them there was one of the miracles of the war.Then followed one of a thousand memorable incidents in the life of a
memorable man.General Sherman, jumping on the bare back of a scrawny
horse, cantered through the fields.And the bluejackets, at sight of
that familiar figure, roared out a cheer that might have shaken the
drops from the wet boughs.The Admiral and the General stood together on
the deck, their hands clasped.And the Colonel astutely remarked, as he
rode up in answer to a summons, that if Porter was the only man whose
daring could have pushed a fleet to that position, Sherman was certainly
the only man who could have got him out of it."Colonel," said the General, "that move was well executed, sir.Admiral,
did the Rebs put a bullet through your rum casks?And now," he added, wheeling on the Colonel when each had a glass
in his hand, "who was in command of that company on the right, in the
swamp?"He's a second lieutenant, General, in the Sixth Missouri.Captain
wounded at Hindman, and first lieutenant fell out down below.His name
is Brice, I believe."Some few days afterward, when the troops were slopping around again at
Young's Point, opposite Vicksburg, a gentleman arrived on a boat
from St.He paused on the levee to survey with concern and
astonishment the flood of waters behind it, and then asked an officer
the way to General Sherman's headquarters.The officer, who was greatly
impressed by the gentleman's looks, led him at once to a trestle bridge
which spanned the distance from the levee bank over the flood to a house
up to its first floor in the backwaters.The officer looked inquiringly at the gentleman, who gave his name.The officer could not repress a smile at the next thing that happened.Out hurried the General himself, with both hands outstretched.he cried, "if it isn't Brinsmade.Come right in, come
right in and take dinner.I'll send
and tell Grant you're here.Brinsmade, if it wasn't for you and your
friends on the Western Sanitary Commission, we'd all have been dead of
fever and bad food long ago.""I guess a
good many of the boys are laid up now," he added."I've come down to do what I can, General," responded Mr."I want to go through all the hospitals to see that our nurses
are doing their duty and that the stores are properly distributed.""You shall, sir, this minute," said the General.He dropped instantly
the affairs which he had on hand, and without waiting for dinner the
two gentlemen went together through the wards where the fever raged.The
General surprised his visitor by recognizing private after private in
the cots, and he always had a brief word of cheer to brighten their
faces, to make them follow him with wistful eyes as he passed beyond
them."That's poor Craig," he would say, "corporal, Third Michigan.They
tell me he can't live," and "That's Olcott, Eleventh Indiana.cried the General, when they were out in the air again, "how I wish
some of these cotton traders could get a taste of this fever.They keep
well--the vultures--And by the way, Brinsmade, the man who gave me no
peace at all at Memphis was from your city.Why, I had to keep a whole
corps on duty to watch him."As long as
I live I shall never forget it."He has always seemed
inoffensive, and I believe he is a prominent member of one of our
churches.""I guess that's so," answered the General, dryly."I ever I set eyes on
him again, he's clapped into the guardhouse.Brinsmade, presently, "have
you ever heard of Stephen Brice?You may
remember talking to him one evening at my house."He
paused on the very brink of relating again the incident at Camp Jackson,
when Stephen had saved the life of Mr."Brinsmade,
for three days I've had it on my mind to send for that boy.I like him," cried General Sherman, with tone
and gesture there was no mistaking.Brinsmade, who liked
Stephen, too, rejoiced at the story he would have to tell the widow."He
has spirit, Brinsmade.I told him to let me know when he was ready to go
to war.The first thing I hear of
him is that he's digging holes in the clay of Chickasaw Bluff, and his
cap is fanned off by the blast of a Parrott six feet above his head.Next thing he turns up on that little expedition we took to get Porter
to sea again.When we got to the gunboats, there was Brice's company
on the flank.He handled those men surprisingly, sir--surprisingly.I
shouldn't have blamed the boy if one or two Rebs got by him.But no, he
swept the place clean."By this time they had come back to the bridge
leading to headquarters, and the General beckoned quickly to an orderly."My compliments to Lieutenant Stephen Brice, Sixth Missouri, and ask him
to report here at once.Brice's company were swinging axes when the
orderly arrived, and Mr.Brice had an axe himself, and was up to his
boot tops in yellow mud.The orderly, who had once been an Iowa farmer, was near grinning when he
gave the General's message and saw the lieutenant gazing ruefully at his
clothes.Entering headquarters, Stephen paused at the doorway of the big room
where the officers of the different staffs were scattered about,
smoking, while the <DW64> servants were removing the dishes from the
table.The sunlight, reflected from the rippling water outside, danced
on the ceiling.At the end of the room sat General Sherman, his uniform,
as always, a trifle awry.His soft felt hat with the gold braid was
tilted forward, and his feet, booted and spurred, were crossed.Small
wonder that the Englishman who sought the typical American found him in
Sherman.The sound that had caught Stephen's attention was the General's voice,
somewhat high-pitched, in the key that he used in telling a story."Sin gives you a pretty square deal, boys, after all.Generally a man
says, 'Well, I can resist, but I'll have my fun just this once.'Stephen made his way to the General, whose bright eyes wandered rapidly
over him as he added:

"This is the condition my officers report in, Brinsmade,--mud from head
to heel."Stephen had sense enough to say nothing, but the staff officers laughed,
and Mr.Brinsmade smiled as he rose and took Stephen's hand."I am delighted to see that you are well, sir," said he, with that
formal kindliness which endeared him to all."Your mother will be
rejoiced at my news of you.You will be glad to hear that I left her
well, Stephen.""They are well, sir, and took pleasure in adding to a little box which
your mother sent.Judge Whipple put in a box of fine cigars, although he
deplores the use of tobacco.""He is ailing, sir, it grieves me to say.Your mother desired to have him moved to her house,
but he is difficult to stir from his ways, and he would not leave his
little room.We have got old Nancy, Hester's mother,
to stay with him at night, and Mrs.Brice divides the day with Miss
Jinny Carvel, who comes in from Bellegarde every afternoon."exclaimed Stephen, wondering if he heard aright.And at
the mention of her name he tingled."She has been much honored
for it.You may remember that the Judge was a close friend of her
father's before the war.And--well, they quarrelled, sir."When--when was the Judge taken ill, Mr.The
thought of Virginia and his mother caring for him together was strangely
sweet."Two days before I left, sir, Dr.Polk had warned him not to do so much.But the Doctor tells me that he can see no dangerous symptoms."Brinsmade how long he was to be with them."I am going on to the other camps this afternoon," said he."But I
should like a glimpse of your quarters, Stephen, if you will invite
me.Your mother would like a careful account of you, and Mr.Whipple,
and--your many friends in St."You will find my tent a little wet, air," replied Stephen, touched.Here the General, who had been sitting by watching them with a very
curious expression, spoke up."That's hospitality for you, Brinsmade!"Brinsmade made their way across plank and bridge to
Stephen's tent, and his mess servant arrived in due time with the
package from home.But presently, while they sat talking of many things,
the canvas of the fly was thrust back with a quick movement, and who
should come stooping in but General Sherman himself.He sat down on a
cracker box."Well, well, Brice," said the General, winking at Mr.Brinsmade, "I
think you might have invited me to the feast.The General chose one and lighted
it."Why, yes, sir, when I can.""Then light up, sir," said the General, "and sit down, I've been
thinking lately of court-martialing you, but I decided to come 'round
and talk it over with you first.That isn't strictly according to
the rules of the service."They began to draft, sir, and I couldn't stand it any longer."You were in the Home Guards, if I
remember right.Brinsmade tells me you were useful in many ways
What was your rank in the Home Guards?""A second lieutenant in temporary command, General.""Couldn't they do better for you than a second-lieutenancy?"Brinsmade spoke up, "They offered him
a lieutenant-colonelcy."The General was silent a moment: Then he said "Do you remember meeting
me on the boat when I was leaving St.Louis, after the capture of Fort
Henry?""Very well, General," he replied, General Sherman leaned
forward."And do you remember I said to you, 'Brice, when you get ready to come
into this war, let me know.'Then he said gravely, but with just a
suspicion of humor about his mouth:-- "General, if I had done that, you
wouldn't be here in my tent to-day."Like lightning the General was on his feet, his hand on Stephen's
shoulder."By gad, sir," he cried, delighted, "so I wouldn't."A STRANGE MEETING

The story of the capture of Vicksburg is the old, old story of failure
turned into success, by which man is made immortal.It involves the
history of a general who never retraced his steps, who cared neither
for mugwump murmurs nor political cabals, who took both blame and praise
with equanimity.Through month after month of discouragement, and work
gone for naught, and fever and death, his eyes never left his goal.And
by grace of the wisdom of that President who himself knew sorrow and
suffering and defeat and unjust censure, General Grant won.The canal abandoned, one red night fleet and transports
swept around the bend and passed the city's heights, on a red river.The Parrotts and the Dahlgrens roared, and the high bluffs flung out the
sound over the empty swamp land.Then there came the landing below, and the cutting loose from a
base--unheard of.Corps behind cursed corps ahead for sweeping the
country clear of forage.Confederate generals in
Mississippi were bewildered.One night, while crossing with his regiment a pontoon bridge, Stephen
Brice heard a shout raised on the farther shore.Sitting together on
a log under a torch, two men in slouch hats were silhouetted.That one
talking with rapid gestures was General Sherman.The impassive profile
of the other, the close-cropped beard and the firmly held cigar that
seemed to go with it,--Stephen recognized as that of the strange Captain
Grant who had stood beside him in the street by the Arsenal He had not
changed a whit.Motionless, he watched corps after corps splash by,
artillery, cavalry, and infantry, nor gave any sign that he heard their
plaudits.At length the army came up behind the city to a place primeval, where
the face of the earth was sore and tortured, worn into deep gorges by
the rains, and flung up in great mounds.Stripped of the green magnolias
and the cane, the banks of clay stood forth in hideous yellow nakedness,
save for a lonely stunted growth, or a bare trunk that still stood
tottering on the edge of a banks its pitiful withered roots reaching out
below.First of all there was a murderous assault, and a still more murderous
repulse.Three times the besiegers charged, sank their color staffs
into the redoubts, and three times were driven back.Then the blue army
settled into the earth and folded into the ravines.Three days in that
narrow space between the lines lay the dead and wounded suffering untold
agonies in the moist heat.Then came a truce to bury the dead, to bring
back what was left of the living.Like clockwork from the Mississippi's banks
beyond came the boom and shriek of the coehorns on the barges.The big
shells hung for an instant in the air like birds of prey, and then could
be seen swooping down here and there, while now and anon a shaft of
smoke rose straight to the sky, the black monument of a home.Here was work in the trenches, digging the flying sap by night and
deepening it by day, for officers and men alike.From heaven a host of
blue ants could be seen toiling in zigzags forward, ever forward, along
the rude water-cuts and through the hills.A waiting carrion from her
vantage point on high marked one spot then another where the blue ants
disappeared, and again one by one came out of the burrow to hurry down
the trench,--each with his ball of clay.In due time the ring of metal and sepulchred voices rumbled in the
ground beneath the besieged.Counter mines were started, and through the
narrow walls of earth commands and curses came.Above ground the saps
were so near that a strange converse became the rule.Both sides were starving, the one for tobacco and
the other for hardtack and bacon.These necessities were tossed across,
sometimes wrapped in the Vicksburg news-sheet printed on the white
side of a homely green wall paper.At other times other amenities were
indulged in.Hand-grenades were thrown and shells with lighted fuses
rolled down on the heads of acquaintances of the night before, who
replied from wooden coehorns hooped with iron.The Union generals learned (common item in a siege) that the citizens
of Vicksburg were eating mule meat.Not an officer or private in the
Vicksburg armies who does not remember the 25th of June, and the hour
of three in an afternoon of pitiless heat.Silently the long blue files
wound into position behind the earth barriers which hid them from the
enemy, coiled and ready to strike when the towering redoubt on the
Jackson road should rise heavenwards.By common consent the rifle
crack of day and night was hushed, and even the Parrotts were silent.Stillness closed around the white house of Shirley once more, but not
the stillness it had known in its peaceful homestead days.This was
the stillness of the death prayer.Eyes staring at the big redoubt were
dimmed.At last, to those near, a little wisp of blue smoke crept out.The sun was darkened, and a hot
blast fanned the upturned faces.In the sky, through the film of
shattered clay, little black dots scurried, poised, and fell again as
arms and legs and head less trunks and shapeless bits of wood and iron.Scarcely had the dust settled when the sun caught the light of fifty
thousand bayonets, and a hundred shells were shrieking across the
crater's edge.Earth to earth, alas, and dust to dust!Men who ran
across that rim of a summer's after-noon died in torture under tier upon
tier of their comrades,--and so the hole was filled.An upright cannon marks the spot where a scrawny oak once stood on
a scarred and baked hillside, outside of the Confederate lines at
Vicksburg.Under the scanty shade of that tree, on the eve of the
Nation's birthday, stood two men who typified the future and the past.As at Donelson, a trick of Fortune's had delivered one comrade of old
into the hands of another.Now she chose to kiss the one upon whom she
had heaped obscurity and poverty and contumely.He had ceased to think
or care about Fortune.And hence, being born a woman, she favored him.They noted the friendly greeting
of old comrades, and after that they saw the self-contained Northerner
biting his cigar, as one to whom the pleasantries of life were past and
gone.The South saw her General turn on his heel.Both sides honored him for the fight he had made.But war
does not reward a man according to his deserts.The next day--the day our sundered nation was born Vicksburg
surrendered: the obstinate man with the mighty force had conquered.See
the gray regiments marching silently in the tropic heat into the folds
of that blue army whose grip has choked them at last.Silently, too, the
blue coats stand, pity and admiration on the brick-red faces.The arms
are stacked and surrendered, officers and men are to be parolled when
the counting is finished.The formations melt away, and those who for
months have sought each other's lives are grouped in friendly talk.The
coarse army bread is drawn eagerly from the knapsacks of the blue, smoke
quivers above a hundred fires, and the smell of frying bacon brings a
wistful look into the gaunt faces.Tears stand in the eyes of many a man
as he eats the food his Yankee brothers have given him on the birthday
of their country.Stephen Brice, now a captain in General
Lauman's brigade, sees with thanksgiving the stars and stripes flutter
from the dome of that court-house which he had so long watched from
afar.Later on, down a side street, he pauses before a house with its
face blown away.On the verge of one of its jagged floors is an old
four-posted bed, and beside it a child's cot is standing pitifully,--the
tiny pillow still at the head and the little sheets thrown across the
foot.So much for one of the navy's shells.While he was thinking of the sadness of it all, a little scene was
acted: the side door of the house opened, a weeping woman came out, and
with her was a tall Confederate Colonel of cavalry.Gallantly giving her
his arm, he escorted her as far as the little gate, where she bade him
good by with much feeling.With an impulsive movement he drew some money
from his pocket, thrust it upon her, and started hurriedly away that
he might not listen to her thanks.Such was his preoccupation that
he actually brushed into Stephen, who was standing beside a tree."Excuse me, seh," he said contritely."Certainly," said Stephen, smiling; "it was my fault for getting in your
way.""Not at all, seh," said the cavalry Colonel; "my clumsiness, seh."He did not pass on, but stood pulling with some violence a very long
mustache."Damn you Yankees," he continued, in the same amiable tone,
"you've brought us a heap of misfortune.Why, seh, in another week we'd
been fo'ced to eat <DW65>s."The Colonel made such a wry face that Stephen laughed in spite of
himself.He had marked the man's charitable action, and admired his
attempt to cover it.The Colonel seemed to be all breadth, like a card.The face was scant, perchance from lack
of food, the nose large, with a curved rim, and the eyes blue gray.He
wore clay-flecked cavalry boots, and was six feet five if an inch, so
that Stephen's six seemed insignificant beside him."Captain," he said, taking in Stephen's rank, "so we won't qua'l as to
who's host heah.One thing's suah," he added, with a twinkle, "I've been
heah longest.Seems like ten yeahs since I saw the wife and children
down in the Palmetto State.I can't offer you a dinner, seh.We've
eaten all the mules and rats and sugar cane in town."(His eye seemed to
interpolate that Stephen wouldn't be there otherwise.)"But I can offer
you something choicer than you have in the No'th."Whereupon he drew from his hip a dented silver flask.The Colonel
remarked that Stephen's eyes fell on the coat of arms."Prope'ty of my grandfather, seh, of Washington's Army.My name is
Jennison,--Catesby Jennison, at your service, seh," he said."You have
the advantage of me, Captain.""My name is Brice," said Stephen.The big Colonel bowed decorously, held out a great, wide hand, and
thereupon unscrewed the flask.Now Stephen had never learned to like
straight whiskey, but he took down his share without a face.The exploit
seemed to please the Colonel, who, after he likewise had done the liquor
justice, screwed on the lid with ceremony, offered Stephen his arm with
still greater ceremony, and they walked off down the street together.Stephen drew from his pocket several of Judge Whipple's cigars, to which
his new friend gave unqualified praise.On every hand Vicksburg showed signs of hard usage.Houses with gaping
chasms in their sides, others mere heaps of black ruins; great trees
felled, cabins demolished, and here and there the sidewalk ploughed
across from curb to fence."Lordy I how my ears ache since your
damned coehorns have stopped.The noise got to be silence with us, seh,
and yesterday I reckoned a hundred volcanoes had bust.Tell me," said he
"when the redoubt over the Jackson road was blown up, they said a <DW65>
came down in your lines alive."Yes," said Stephen, smiling; "he struck near the place where my company
was stationed."I reckon he fell on it," said Colonel Catesby Jennison, as if it were a
matter of no special note."And now tell me something," said Stephen."How did you burn our
sap-rollers?"This time the Colonel stopped, and gave himself up to hearty laughter."Why, that was a Yankee trick, sure enough," he cried."Some ingenious
cuss soaked port fire in turpentine, and shot the wad in a large-bore
musket."The Colonel laughed again, still more heartily."Explosive
bullets!--Good Lord, it was all we could do to get percussion caps.Do you know how we got percussion caps, seh?Three of our
officers--dare-devils, seh--floated down the Mississippi on logs.One
fellow made his way back with two hundred thousand.He's the pride of
our Vicksburg army.A chivalrous man, a forlorn-hope
man.The night you ran the batteries he and some others went across to
your side in skiffs--in skiffs, seh, I say--and set fire to the houses
in De Soto, that we might see to shoot.And then he came back in the
face of our own batteries and your guns.That man was wounded by a trick
of fate, by a cussed bit of shell from your coehorns while eating his
dinner in Vicksburg.He's pretty low, now, poor fellow," added the
Colonel, sadly.demanded Stephen, fired with a desire to see the man."Well, he ain't a great ways from here," said the Colonel."Perhaps you
might be able to do something for him," he continued thoughtfully."I'd
hate to see him die.The doctor says he'll pull through if he can get
care and good air and good food."He seized Stephen's arm in a fierce
grip."No," said the Colonel, thoughtfully, as to himself, "you don't look
like the man to fool."Whereupon he set out with great strides, in marked contrast to his
former languorous gait, and after a while they came to a sort of gorge,
where the street ran between high banks of clay.There Stephen saw the
magazines which the Confederates had dug out, and of which he had heard.But he saw something, too, of which he had not heard, Colonel Catesby
Jennison stopped before an open doorway in the yellow bank and knocked.A woman's voice called softly to him to enter.They went into a room hewn out of the solid clay.Carpet was stretched
on the floor, paper was on the walls, and even a picture.There was
a little window cut like a port in a prison cell, and under it a bed,
beside which a middle-aged lady was seated.She had a kindly face which
seemed to Stephen a little pinched as she turned to them with a gesture
of restraint.She pointed to the bed, where a sheet lay limply over the
angles of a wasted frame.said the lady,--"it is the first time in two days that he has
slept."But the sleeper stirred wearily, and woke with a start.The face, so yellow and peaked, was of the type that grows even more
handsome in sickness, and in the great fever-stricken eyes a high spirit
burned.For an instant only the man stared at Stephen, and then he
dragged himself to the wall.The eyes of the other two were both fixed on the young Union Captain.cried Jennison, seizing Stephen's rigid arm, "does he look as
bad as that?"I--I know him," answered Stephen.He stepped quickly to the bedside,
and bent over it."This is too much, Jennison," came from the bed a voice that was
pitifully weak; "why do you bring Yankees in here?""Captain Brice is a friend of yours, Colfax," said the Colonel, tugging
at his mustache.I have met Captain Colfax--"

"Colonel, sir.""Colonel Colfax, before the war!And if he would like to go to St.Louis, I think I can have it arranged at once."In silence they waited for Clarence's answer Stephen well knew what was
passing in his mind, and guessed at his repugnance to accept a favor
from a Yankee.He wondered whether there was in this case a special
detestation.And so his mind was carried far to the northward to the
memory of that day in the summer-house on the Meramee heights.Virginia
had not loved her cousin then--of that Stephen was sure.But now,--now
that the Vicksburg army was ringing with his praise, now that he was
unfortunate--Stephen sighed.His comfort was that he would be the
instrument.The lady in her uneasiness smoothed the single sheen that covered the
sick man.From afar came the sound of cheering, and it was this that
seemed to rouse him.And then, with
some vehemence, "What is he doing in Vicksburg?"Stephen looked at Jennison, who winced."The city has surrendered," said that officer."Then you can afford to be generous," he said, with a bitter laugh."But you haven't whipped us yet, by a good deal.Jennison," he cried,
"Jennison, why in hell did you give up?""Colfax," said Stephen, coming forward, "you're too sick a man to talk.It may be that I can have you sent North
to-day.""You can do as you please," said Clarence, coldly, "with a--prisoner."Bowing to the lady, he strode out of
the room.Colonel Jennison, running after him, caught him in the street."He's sick--and God Almighty,
he's proud--I reckon," he added with a touch of humility that went
straight to Stephen's heart."I reckon that some of us are too derned
proud--But we ain't cold."And I hope, Colonel, that we may meet
again--as friends.""Hold on, seh," said Colonel Catesby Jennison; "we
may as well drink to that."Fortunately, as Stephen drew near the Court House, he caught sight of
a group of officers seated on its steps, and among them he was quick to
recognize General Sherman."Brice," said the General, returning his salute, "been celebrating this
glorious Fourth with some of our Rebel friends?""Yes, sir," answered Stephen, "and I came to ask a favor for one of
them."Seeing that the General's genial, interested expression did not
change, he was emboldened to go on."This is one of their colonels, sir.He is the man who floated down the river on a
log and brought back two hundred thousand percussion caps--"

"Good Lord," interrupted the General, "I guess we all heard of him after
that.What else has he done to endear himself?""Well, General, he rowed across the river in a skiff the night we ran
these batteries, and set fire to De Soto to make targets for their
gunners.""I'd like to see that man," said the General, in his eager way."What I was going to tell you, sir.After he went through all this, he
was hit by a piece of mortar shell, while sitting at his dinner.He's
rather far gone now, General, and they say he can't live unless he can
be sent North.I--I know who he is in St.And I thought that as
long as the officers are to be paroled I might get your permission to
send him up to-day.""I know the breed," said he, "I'll bet he didn't
thank you.""I like his grit," said the General, emphatically, "These young bloods
are the backbone of this rebellion, Brice.They
never did anything except horse-racing and cock-fighting.They ride like
the devil, fight like the devil, but don't care a picayune for anything.And, good Lord, how
they hate a Yankee!He's a cousin of that
fine-looking girl Brinsmade spoke of.Be a
pity to disappoint her--eh?""Why, Captain, I believe you would like to marry her yourself!Take my
advice, sir, and don't try to tame any wildcats.""I'm glad to do a favor for that young man," said the General, when
Stephen had gone off with the slip of paper he had given him."I like to
do that kind of a favor for any officer, when I can.Did you notice how
he flared up when I mentioned the girl?"This is why Clarence Colfax found himself that evening on a hospital
steamer of the Sanitary Commission, bound north for St.BELLEGARDE ONCE MORE

Supper at Bellegarde was not the simple meal it had been for a year past
at Colonel Carvel's house in town.Colfax was proud of her table,
proud of her fried chickens and corn fritters and her desserts.How
Virginia chafed at those suppers, and how she despised the guests whom
her aunt was in the habit of inviting to some of them!And when none
was present, she was forced to listen to Mrs.Colfax's prattle about the
fashions, her tirades against the Yankees."I'm sure he must be dead," said that lady, one sultry evening in July.Her tone, however, was not one of conviction.A lazy wind from the river
stirred the lawn of Virginia's gown.The girl, with her hand on the
wicker back of the chair, was watching a storm gather to the eastward,
across the Illinois prairie."I don't see why you say that, Aunt Lillian," she replied."Bad news
travels faster than good."It is cruel of him not to send us a line,
telling us where his regiment is."She had long since learned that the wisdom of
silence was the best for her aunt's unreasonableness.Certainly, if
Clarence's letters could not pass the close lines of the Federal troops,
news of her father's Texas regiment could not come from Red River."How was Judge Whipple to-day?"Brice,--isn't that her name?--doesn't take him to
her house.Virginia began to rock slowly, and her foot tapped the porch.Brice has begged the Judge to come to her.But he says he has
lived in those rooms, and that he will die there,--when the time comes."You have become quite a Yankee
yourself, I believe, spending whole days with her, nursing that old
man.""The Judge is an old friend of my father's; I think he would wish it,"
replied the girl, in a lifeless voice.Her speech did not reveal all the pain and resentment she felt.She
thought of the old man racked with pain and suffering in the heat, lying
patient on his narrow bed, the only light of life remaining the presence
of the two women.They came day by day, and often Margaret Brice had
taken the place of the old negress who sat with him at night.Yes, it was worship; it had been worship since the
day she and her father had gone to the little whitewashed hospital.Providence had brought them together at the Judge's bedside.The
marvellous quiet power of the older woman had laid hold of the girl in
spite of all barriers.Often when the Judge's pain was eased sufficiently for him to talk, he
would speak of Stephen.The mother never spoke of her son, but a light
would come into her eyes at this praise of him which thrilled Virginia
to see.And when the good lady was gone, and the Judge had fallen into
slumber, it would still haunt her.Was it out of consideration for her that Mrs.Brice would turn the Judge
from this topic which he seemed to love best?Virginia could not admit
to herself that she resented this.She had heard Stephen's letters to
the Judge.Strong and manly they were, with plenty
of praises for the Southern defenders of Vicksburg.Only yesterday
Virginia had read one of these to Mr.Well
that his face was turned to the window, and that Stephen's mother was
not there!"He says very little about himself," Mr."Had it
not been for Brinsmade, we should never know that Sherman had his eye on
him, and had promoted him.We should never have known of that exploit
at Chickasaw Bluff.But what a glorious victory was Grant's capture of
Vicksburg, on the Fourth of July!I guess we'll make short work of the
Rebels now."No, the Judge had not changed much, even in illness.Virginia laid the letter down, and tears started to her eyes as
she repressed a retort.It was not the first time this had happened.How strange
that, with all his thought of others, he should fall short here!One day, after unusual forbearance, Mrs.Brice had overtaken Virginia
on the stairway.Well she knew the girl's nature, and how difficult she
must have found repression."My dear," she had said, "you are a wonderful woman."But
Virginia had driven back to Bellegarde with a strange elation in her
heart.Some things the Judge had forborne to mention, and for this Virginia was
thankful.But she had overheard Shadrach telling old
Nancy how Mrs.Brice had pleaded with him to move it, that he might have
more room and air.And Colonel Carvel's name had
never once passed his lips.Many a night the girl had lain awake listening to the steamboats as they
toiled against the river's current, while horror held her.Horror lest
her father at that moment be in mortal agony amongst the heaps left by
the battle's surges; heaps in which, like mounds of ashes, the fire was
not yet dead.Fearful tales she had heard in the prison hospitals of
wounded men lying for days in the Southern sun between the trenches at
Vicksburg, or freezing amidst the snow and sleet at Donelson.What a life had been
Colonel Carvel's!Another, and he had lost his fortune, his home, his friends, all that
was dear to him.And that daughter, whom he loved best in all the world,
he was perchance to see no more.Colfax, yawning, had taken a book and gone to bed.Still Virginia
sat on the porch, while the frogs sang of rain, and the lightning
quivered across the eastern sky.She heard the crunch of wheels in the
gravel.A bar of light, peopled by moths, slanted out of the doorway and fell
on a closed carriage."Your cousin Clarence has come home, my dear," he said."He was among
the captured at Vicksburg, and is paroled by General Grant."Brinsmade, tell me--all--"

"No, he is not dead, but he is very low.Russell has been kind
enough to come with me."But they were all there in the light,
in African postures of terror,--Alfred, and <DW71>, and Mammy Easter, and
Ned.They lifted the limp figure in gray, and carried it into the hall
chamber, his eyes closed, his face waxen under a beard brown and shaggy.Heavily, Virginia climbed the stairs to break the news to her aunt.There is little need to dwell on the dark days which followed--Clarence
hanging between life and death.That his life was saved was due to
Virginia and to Mammy Easter, and in no particle to his mother.Colfax flew in the face of all the known laws of nursing, until Virginia
was driven to desperation, and held a council of war with Dr.Then
her aunt grew jealous, talked of a conspiracy, and threatened to send
for Dr.By spells she wept,
when they quietly pushed her from the room and locked the door.She
would creep in to him in the night during Mammy Easter's watches and
talk him into a raging fever.But Virginia slept lightly and took the
alarm.More than one scene these two had in the small hours, while Ned
was riding post haste over the black road to town for the Doctor.By the same trusty messenger did Virginia contrive to send a note to
Mrs.Brice, begging her to explain her absence to Judge Whipple.By day
or night Virginia did not leave Bellegarde.Polk, while
walking in the garden, found the girl fast asleep on a bench, her sewing
on her lap.Would that a master had painted his face as he looked down
at her!'Twas he who brought Virginia daily news of Judge Whipple.He had become more querulous
and exacting with patient Mrs.But often, when he got into his buggy the Doctor found
the seat filled with roses and fresh fruit.What Virginia's feelings were at this time no one will ever know.God
had mercifully given her occupation, first with the Judge, and later,
when she needed it more, with Clarence.It was she whom he recognized
first of all, whose name was on his lips in his waking moments.With
the petulance of returning reason, he pushed his mother away.Unless
Virginia was at his bedside when he awoke, his fever rose.He put his
hot hand into her cool one, and it rested there sometimes for hours.Then, and only then, did he seem contented.The wonder was that her health did not fail.People who saw her during
that fearful summer, fresh and with color in her cheeks, marvelled.Great-hearted Puss Russell, who came frequently to inquire, was quieted
before her friend, and the frank and jesting tongue was silent in that
presence.Anne Brinsmade came with her father and wondered.Her poise, her gentleness, her dignity, were the
effects which people saw.And this is why
we cannot of ourselves add one cubit to our stature.It is God who
changes,--who cleanses us of our levity with the fire of trial.Happy,
thrice happy, those whom He chasteneth.And yet how many are there who
could not bear the fire--who would cry out at the flame.Little by little Clarence mended, until he came to sit out on the porch
in the cool of the afternoon.Then he would watch for hours the tassels
stirring over the green fields of corn and the river running beyond,
while the two women sat by.Colfax's headaches came
on, and Virginia was alone with him, he would talk of the war; sometimes
of their childhood, of the mad pranks they played here at Bellegarde,
of their friends.Only when Virginia read to him the Northern account of
the battles would he emerge from a calm sadness into excitement; and
he clenched his fists and tried to rise when he heard of the capture of
Jackson and the fall of Port Hudson.Of love he spoke not a word, and
now that he was better he ceased to hold her hand.But often when she
looked up from her book, she would surprise his dark eyes fixed upon
her, and a look in them of but one interpretation.The Doctor came but every other day now, in the afternoon.It was his
custom to sit for a while on the porch chatting cheerily with Virginia,
his stout frame filling the rocking-chair.Polk's indulgence was
gossip--though always of a harmless nature: how Mr.Cluyme always
managed to squirm over to the side which was in favor, and how Maude
Catherwood's love-letter to a certain dashing officer of the Confederate
army had been captured and ruthlessly published in the hateful Democrat.It was the Doctor who gave Virginia news of the Judge, and sometimes he
would mention Mrs.Then Clarence would raise his head; and once
(she saw with trepidation) he had opened his lips to speak.One day the Doctor came, and Virginia looked into his face and divined
that he had something to tell her.He sat but a few moments, and when he
arose to go he took her hand."I have a favor to beg of you, Jinny," he said, "Judge has lost his
nurse.Do you think Clarence could spare you for a little while every
day?Polk continued, somewhat hurriedly for
him, "but the Judge cannot bear a stranger near him, and I am afraid to
have him excited while in this condition."And Clarence, watching, saw her color
go.Polk, "but her son Stephen has come home from the
army.He was transferred to Lauman's brigade, and then he was wounded."He jangled the keys in his pocket and continued "It seems that he had no
business in the battle.Johnston in his retreat had driven animals into
all the ponds and shot them, and in the hot weather the water was soon
poisoned.Brice was scarcely well enough to stand when they made
the charge, and he is now in a dreadful condition He is a fine fellow,"
added the Doctor, with a sigh, "General Sherman sent a special physician
to the boat with him.He is--" Subconsciously the Doctor's arm sought
Virginia's back, as though he felt her swaying.But he was looking at
Clarence, who had jerked himself forward in his chair, his thin hands
convulsively clutching at the arms of it.In his astonishment the Doctor passed his palm across his brow, and for
a moment he did not answer.Virginia had taken a step from him, and was
standing motionless, almost rigid, her eyes on his face.he said, repeating the word mechanically; "my God, I hope not.The danger is over, and he is resting easily.If he were not," he said
quickly and forcibly, "I should not be here."The Doctor's mare passed more than one fleet--footed trotter on the
road to town that day.And the Doctor's black servant heard his master
utter the word "fool" twice, and with great emphasis.For a long time Virginia stood on the end of the porch, until the
heaving of the buggy harness died on the soft road, She felt Clarence
gaze upon her before she turned to face him."Virginia, sit here a moment; I have something to tell you."She came and took the chair beside him, her heart beating, her breast
rising and falling.She looked into his eyes, and her own lashes fell
before the hopelessness there But he put out his fingers wasted by
illness, and she took them in her own.He began slowly, as if every word cost him pain.I cannot remember the time
when I did not love you, when I did not think of you as my wife.All I
did when we played together was to try to win your applause.That was my
nature I could not help it.Do you remember the day I climbed out on the
rotten branch of the big pear tree yonder to get you that pear--when
I fell on the roof of Alfred's cabin?It was
because you kissed it and cried over me.You are crying now," he said
tenderly.It isn't to make you sad that I am saying this."I have had a great deal of time to think lately, Jinny, I was not
brought up seriously,--to be a man.I have been thinking of that day
just before you were eighteen, when you rode out here.The grapes were purple, and a purple
haze was over there across the river.You were
grown a woman then, and I was still nothing but a boy.Do you remember
the doe coming out of the forest, and how she ran screaming when I tried
to kiss you?It was true what you said, that I was wild and utterly useless,
I had never served or pleased any but myself,--and you.I had never
studied or worked, You were right when you told me I must learn
something,--do something,--become of some account in the world."Clarence, after what you have done for the South?""Crossed the river and burned
houses.Floated down the river on a log
after a few percussion caps."And how many had the courage to do that?""Pooh," he said, "courage!If I did not
have that, I would send <DW71> to my father's room for his ebony box and
blow my brains out.No, Jinny, I am nothing but a soldier of fortune.I never possessed any quality but a wild spirit for adventure, to
shirk work.I wanted to go with Walker, you remember.I wanted to distinguish myself," he added with a gesture."But
that is all gone now, Jinny.Now
I see how an earnest life might have won you.She raised her head, frightened, and looked at him searchingly."One day," he said, "one day a good many years ago you and I and Uncle
Comyn were walking along Market Street in front of Judge Whipple's
office, and a slave auction was going on.A girl was being sold on whom
you had set your heart.There was some one in the crowd, a Yankee, who
bid her in and set her free.He saw her profile, her lips parted, her look far away, She inclined her
head."Yes," said her cousin, "so do I remember him.He has crossed my path
many times since, Virginia.And mark what I say--it was he whom you
had in mind on that birthday when you implored me to make something of
myself, It was Stephen Brice.""I dare anything, Virginia," he answered quietly.And I am sure that you did not realize that he was the ideal which you
had in mind.""The impression of him has never left it.Again, that
night at the Brinsmades', when we were in fancy dress, I felt that I had
lost you when I got back.He had been there when I was away, and gone
again."It was a horrible mistake, Max," she faltered."I was waiting for you
down the road, and stopped his horse instead.It--it was nothing--"

"It was fate, Jinny.How I hated that
man," he cried, "how I hated him?""Yes," he said, "hated!But now--"

"But now?"I have not--I could not tell you before: He
came into the place where I was lying in Vicksburg, and they told
him that my only chance was to come North, I turned my back upon him,
insulted him.Yet he went to Sherman and had me brought home--to you,
Virginia.If he loves you,--and I have long suspected that he does--"

"Oh, no," she cried, hiding her face "No.""I know he loves you, Jinny," her cousin continued calmly, inexorably.It was a brave
thing to do, and a generous.He
thought that he was saving me for you.He was giving up the hope of
marrying you himself."Unless you had seen her then, you had never
known the woman in her glory."Clarence Colfax, have you known and loved
me all my life that you might accuse me of this?"Jinny, do you mean it?"In answer she bent down with all that gentleness and grace that
was hers, and pressed her lips to his forehead.Long after she had
disappeared in the door he sat staring after her.But later, when Mammy Easter went to call her mistress for supper, she
found her with her face buried in the pillows.CHAPTER X. IN JUDGE WHIPPLE'S OFFICE

After this Virginia went to the Judge's bedside every day, in the
morning, when Clarence took his sleep.She read his newspapers to him
when he was well enough.She read the detested Missouri Democrat, which
I think was the greatest trial Virginia ever had to put up with.To have
her beloved South abused, to have her heroes ridiculed, was more than
she could bear.Once, when the Judge was perceptibly better, she flung
the paper out of the window, and left the room."My dear," he said, smiling admiration, "forgive an old bear.A selfish
old bear, Jinny; my only excuse is my love for the Union.When you are
not here, I lie in agony, lest she has suffered some mortal blow unknown
to me, Jinny.And if God sees fit to spare our great country, the day
will come when you will go down on your knees and thank Him for the
inheritance which He saved for your children.You are a good woman, my
dear, and a strong one.I have hoped that you will see the right.That you will marry a great citizen, one unwavering in his service and
devotion to our Republic."The Judge's voice trembled with earnestness
as he spoke.And the gray eyes under the shaggy brows were alight with
the sacred fire of his life's purpose.Undaunted as her spirit was, she
could not answer him then.Once, only once, he said to her: "Virginia, I loved your father better
than any man I ever knew.Please God I may see him again before I die."But sometimes at twilight his eyes would
rest on the black cloth that hid it.Virginia herself never touched that cloth to her it seemed the shroud
upon a life of happiness that was dead and gone.Virginia had not been with Judge Whipple during the critical week after
Stephen was brought home.But Anne had told her that his anxiety was
a pitiful thing to see, and that it had left him perceptibly weaker.So fast that on some days
Virginia, watching him, would send Ned or Shadrach in hot haste for Dr.At noon Anne would relieve Virginia,--Anne or her mother,--and
frequently Mr.For it is those who have
the most to do who find the most time for charitable deeds.As the hour
for their coming drew near, the Judge would be seeking the clock, and
scarce did Anne's figure appear in the doorway before the question had
arisen to his lips--"And how is my young Captain to-day?"That is what he called him,--"My young Captain."Virginia's choice of
her cousin, and her devotion to him, while seemingly natural enough,
had drawn many a sigh from Anne.She thought it strange that Virginia
herself had never once asked her about Stephen's condition and she spoke
of this one day to the Judge with as much warmth as she was capable of."Jinny's heart is like steel where a Yankee is concerned.If her best
friend were a Yankee--"

Judge Whipple checked her, smiling."She has been very good to one Yankee I know of," he said.Brice, I believe she worships her.""But when I said that Stephen was much better to-day, she swept out of
the room as if she did not care whether he lived or died.""Well, Anne," the Judge had answered, "you women are a puzzle to me.I
guess you don't understand yourselves," he added.That was a strange month in the life of Clarence Colfax,--the last
of his recovery, while he was waiting for the news of his exchange.Bellegarde was never more beautiful, for Mrs.Colfax had no whim of
letting the place run down because a great war was in progress.Though
devoted to the South, she did not consecrate her fortune to it.Clarence
gave as much as he could.Whole afternoons Virginia and he would sit in the shaded arbor seat;
or at the cool of the day descend to the bench on the lower tier of
the summer garden, to steep, as it were, in the blended perfumes of the
roses and the mignonettes and the pinks.Often through the night he pondered on the change in her.But he was troubled to analyze her gravity, her dignity.Was this
merely strength of character, the natural result of the trials through
which she had passed, the habit acquired of being the Helper and
comforter instead of the helped and comforted?Long years afterward the
brightly  portrait of her remained in his eye,--the simple linen
gown of pink or white, the brown hair shining in the sunlight, the
graceful poise of the head.And the background of flowers--flowers
everywhere, far from the field of war.Sometimes, when she brought his breakfast on a tray in the morning,
there was laughter in her eyes.In the days gone by they had been all
laughter.He said it over to himself
many, many times in the day.He would sit for a space, feasting his eyes
upon her until she lifted her look to his, and the rich color flooded
her face.He was not a lover to sit quietly by, was Clarence.And yet,
as the winged days flew on, that is what he did, It was not that she
did not respond to his advances, he did not make them.Was it the chivalry inherited from a long life of Colfaxes who
were gentlemen?Something of awe had crept into his feeling
for her.As the month wore on, and the time drew near for him to go back to the
war, a state that was not quite estrangement, and yet something very
like it, set in.Doubts bothered him, and he dared not
give them voice.By night he would plan his speeches,--impassioned,
imploring.To see her in her marvellous severity was to strike him dumb.Whether she loved him, whether she did not love
him, she would not give him up.Through the long years of their lives
together, he would never know.He was not a weak man now, was Clarence
Colfax.He was merely a man possessed of a devil, enchained by the power
of self-repression come upon her whom he loved.And day by day that power seemed to grow more intense,--invulnerable.Among her friends and in the little household it had raised Virginia to
heights which she herself did not seem to realize.She was become the
mistress of Bellegarde.Colfax was under its sway, and doubly
miserable because Clarence would listen to her tirades no more.Nor had
she taken pains to hide the sarcasm in her voice.His answer, bringing with it her remembrance of her husband at certain
times when it was not safe to question him, had silenced her.Addison
Colfax had not been a quiet man."Whenever Virginia is ready, mother," he had replied.He knew in his heart that if he were to ask her permission
to send for Dr.Posthelwaite to-morrow that she would say yes.Tomorrow
came,--and with it a great envelope, an official, answer to Clarence's
report that he was fit for duty once more.He
was to proceed to Cairo, there to await the arrival of the transport
Indianapolis, which was to carry five hundred officers and men from
Sandusky Prison, who were going back to fight once more for the
Confederacy.O that they might have seen the North, all those brave men
who made that sacrifice.That they might have realized the numbers and
the resources and the wealth arrayed against them!It was a cool day for September, a perfect day, an auspicious day, and
yet it went the way of the others before it.This was the very fulness
of the year, the earth giving out the sweetness of her maturity, the
corn in martial ranks, with golden plumes nodding.The forest still
in its glory of green.They walked in silence the familiar paths, and
Alfred, clipping the late roses for the supper table, shook his
white head as they passed him.The sun, who had begun to hurry on his
southward journey, went to bed at six.The few clothes Clarence was to
take with him had been packed by Virginia in his bag, and the two were
standing in the twilight on the steps of the house, when Ned came around
the corner.He called his young mistress by name, but she did not hear
him.She started as from a sleep, and paused.He wore that air of mystery so
dear to darkeys."Gemmen to see you, Miss Jinny."The <DW64> pointed to the lilac shrubbery.said Clarence, sharply: "If a man is
there, bring him here at once.""Reckon he won't come, Marse Clarence."said Ned, "He fearful skeered ob
de light ob day.He got suthin very pertickler fo' Miss Jinny.""No sah--yessah--leastwise I'be seed 'um.The word was hardly out of his mouth before Virginia had leaped down the
four feet from the porch to the flower-bed and was running across the
lawn toward the shrubbery.Parting the bushes after her, Clarence found
his cousin confronting a large man, whom he recognized as the carrier
who brought messages from the South."Pa has got through the lines," she said breathlessly."He--he came up
to see me."He went to Judge Whipple's rooms, ma'am.I
reckoned you knew it, Miss Jinny," Robinson added contritely."Clarence," she said, "I must go at once.""I will go with you," he said; "you cannot go alone."In a twinkling Ned
and <DW71> had the swift pair of horses harnessed, and the light carriage
was flying over the soft clay road toward the city.Brinsmade's place, the moon hung like a great round lantern under
the spreading trees about the house.Clarence caught a glimpse of his
cousin's face in the light.She was leaning forward, her gaze fixed
intently on the stone posts which stood like monuments between the
bushes at the entrance.Then she drew back again into the dark corner
of the barouche.She was startled by a sharp challenge, and the carriage
stopped.Looking out, she saw the provost's guard like black card
figures on the road, and Ned fumbling for his pass.On they drove into the city streets until the dark bulk of the Court
House loomed in front of them, and Ned drew rein at the little stairway
which led to the Judge's rooms.Virginia, leaping out of the carriage,
flew up the steps and into the outer office, and landed in the Colonel's
arms."Why do you risk your life in this way?If the
Yankees catch you--"

"They won't catch me, honey," he answered, kissing her.Then he held her
out at arm's length and gazed earnestly into her face.Trembling, she
searched his own."I'm not precisely young, my dear," he said, smiling.His hair was
nearly white, and his face scared.But he was a fine erect figure of a
man, despite the shabby clothes he wore, and the mud-bespattered boots."Pa," she whispered, "it was foolhardy to come here."I came to see you, Jinny, I reckon.And when I got home to-night and
heard Silas was dying, I just couldn't resist.He's the oldest friend
I've got in St.Louis, honey and now--now--"

"Pa, you've been in battle?""And you weren't hurt; I thank God for that," she whispered.After a
while: "Is Uncle Silas dying?"Polk is in there now, and says that he can't last
through the night.Silas has been asking for you, honey, over and over.He says you were very good to him,--that you and Mrs.Brice gave up
everything to nurse him.""She was here night and day until her son
came home.She is a noble woman--"

"Her son?"Silas has done nothing
the last half-hour but call his name.He says he must see the boy before
he dies.Polk says he is not strong enough to come.""Oh, no, he is not strong enough," cried Virginia.The Colonel looked
down at her queerly.She turned hurriedly, glanced around
the room, and then peered down the dark stairway.I wonder why he did not follow me up?"Then after a long pause, seeing her father said nothing, she added,
"Perhaps he was waiting for you to see me alone.I will go down to see
if he is in the carriage."The Colonel started with her, but she pulled him back in alarm."You will be seen, Pa," she cried.He stayed at the top of the passage, holding open the door that she
might have light.When she reached the sidewalk, there was Ned standing
beside the horses, and the carriage empty.Fust I seed was a man plump out'n Willums's, Miss Jinny.He was
a-gwine shufflin' up de street when Marse Clarence put out after him,
pos' has'e.She stood for a moment on the pavement in thought, and paused on the
stairs again, wondering whether it were best to tell her father.Perhaps
Clarence had seen--she caught her breath at the thought and pushed open
the door."Oh, Pa, do you think you are safe here?""Why, yes, honey, I
reckon so," he answered."Ned says he ran after a man who was hiding in an entrance.Pa, I am
afraid they are watching the place.""I don't think so, Jinny.I came here with Polk, in his buggy, after
dark."Virginia, listening, heard footsteps on the stairs, and seized her
father's sleeve."Think of the risk you are running, Pa," she whispered.She would have
dragged him to the closet.Brinsmade entered, and with him a lady veiled.How long
he stared at his old friend Virginia could not say.It seemed to her an
eternity.Brice has often told since how straight the Colonel
stood, his fine head thrown back, as he returned the glance.Brinsmade came forward, with his hand outstretched."Comyn," said he, his voice breaking a little, "I have known you these
many years as a man of unstained honor.God will judge whether I have done my duty.""I give
you my word of honor as a gentleman that I came into this city for no
other reason than to see my daughter.And hearing that my old friend was
dying, I could not resist the temptation, sir--"

Mr.How many men do you think would risk their
lives so, Mrs."Thank God he will now
die happy.I know it has been much on his mind.""And in his name, madam,--in the name of my oldest and best friend,--I
thank you for what you have done for him.I trust that you will allow me
to add that I have learned from my daughter to respect and admire you.I
hope that your son is doing well.""He is, thank you, Colonel Carvel.If he but knew that the Judge were
dying, I could not have kept him at home.Polk says that he must not
leave the house, or undergo any excitement."Just then the door of the inner room opened, and Dr.Brinsmade, and he patted Virginia."The Judge is still asleep," he said gently."And--he may not wake up in
this world."Silently, sadly, they went together into that little room where so
much of Judge Whipple's life had been spent.And
how completely they filled it,--these five people and the big Rothfield
covered with the black cloth.Virginia pressed her father's arm as they
leaned against it, and brushed her eyes.The Doctor turned the wick of
the night-lamp.What was that upon the sleeper's face from which they drew back?The divine light which is shed upon those
who have lived for others, who have denied themselves the lusts of the
flesh, For a long space, perhaps an hour, they stayed, silent save for
a low word now and again from the Doctor as he felt the Judge's heart.Tableaux from the past floated before Virginia's eyes.Of the old days,
of the happy days in Locust Street, of the Judge quarrelling with her
father, and she and Captain Lige smiling nearby.And she remembered how
sometimes when the controversy was finished the Judge would rub his nose
and say:

"It's my turn now, Lige."Whereupon the Captain would open the piano, and she would play the hymn
that he liked best.What was it in Silas Whipple's nature that courted the pain of memories?What pleasure could it have been all through his illness to look upon
this silent and cruel reminder of days gone by forever?She had heard
that Stephen Brice had been with the Judge when he had bid it in.She
wondered that he had allowed it, for they said that he was the only
one who had ever been known to break the Judge's will.Virginia's
eyes rested on Margaret Brice, who was seated at the head of the bed,
smoothing the pillows The strength of Stephen's features were in hers,
but not the ruggedness.Her features were large, indeed, yet stanch and
softened.The widow, as if feeling Virginia's look upon her, glanced up
from the Judge's face and smiled at her.The girl  with pleasure,
and again at the thought which she had had of the likeness between
mother and son.Still the Judge slept on, while they watched.And at length the thought
of Clarence crossed Virginia's mind.Whispering to her father, she stole out on tiptoe.Descending to the street, she was unable to gain any news of Clarence
from Ned, who was becoming alarmed likewise.Perplexed and troubled, she climbed the stairs again.No sound came from
the Judge's room Perhaps Clarence would be back at any moment.She sat down to think,--her elbows on the desk
in front of her, her chin in her hand, her eyes at the level of a line
of books which stood on end.--Chitty's Pleadings, Blackstone, Greenleaf
on Evidence.Absently; as a person whose mind is in trouble, she reached
out and took one of them down and opened it.Across the flyleaf, in a
high and bold hand, was written the name, Stephen Atterbury Brice.She dropped the book, and, rising abruptly, crossed quickly to the other
side of the room.Then she turned, hesitatingly, and went back.This was
his desk--his chair, in which he had worked so faithfully for the man
who lay dying beyond the door.For him whom they all loved--whose last
hours they were were to soothe.Wars and schisms may part our bodies,
but stronger ties unite our souls.Through Silas Whipple, through his
mother, Virginia knew that she was woven of one piece with Stephen
Brice.In a thousand ways she was reminded, lest she drive it from her
belief.She might marry another, and that would not matter.She sank again into his chair, and gave herself over to the thoughts
crowding in her heart.How the threads of his life ran next to hers, and
crossed and recrossed them.The slave auction, her dance with him, the
Fair, the meeting at Mr.Brinsmade's gate,--she knew them all.Her dreams of him--for she did dream
of him.And now he had saved Clarence's life that she might marry her
cousin.Again she glanced at the
signature in the book, as if fascinated by the very strength of it.She
turned over a few pages of the book, "Supposing the defendant's counsel
essays to prove by means of--" that was his writing again, a marginal,
note.There were marginal notes on every page--even the last was covered
with them, And then at the end, "First reading, February, 1858.Bought with some of money obtained by first article
for M.That capacity for work, incomparable gift, was what she had
always coveted the most.Again she rested her elbows on the desk and her
chin on her hands, and sighed unconsciously.She had not heard the step on the stair.She did not know that any one wage in the room until she heard his
voice, and then she thought that she was dreaming.Slowly she raised her face to his, unbelief and wonder in her
eyes,--unbelief and wonder and fright.But
when she met the quality of his look, the grave tenderness of it, she
trembled, and our rendered her own to the page where his handwriting
quivered and became a blur.He never knew the effort it cost her to rise and confront him.She
herself had not measured or fathomed the power which his very person
exhaled.He needed not to have
spoken for her to have felt that.She
knew alone that it was nigh irresistible, and she grasped the back of
the chair as though material support might sustain her."Not--not yet, They are waiting for the end."he asked in grave surprise, glancing at the door of the
Judge's room."I am waiting for my cousin," she said.Even as she spoke she was with this man again at the Brinsmade gate.Intuition told her that he, too, was
thinking of that time.Now he had found her at his desk, and, as if that
were not humiliation enough, with one of his books taken down and laid
open at his signature.Suffused, she groped for words to carry her on.He was here, and is gone
somewhere."He did not seem to take account of the speech.And his silence--goad
to indiscretion--pressed her to add:-- "You saved him, Mr.I--we
all--thank you so much.And that is not all I want to say.It is a poor
enough acknowledgment of what you did,--for we have not always treated
you well."Her voice faltered almost to faintness, as he raised his hand
in pained protest.But she continued: "I shall regard it as a debt I can
never repay.It is not likely that in my life to come I can ever help
you, but I shall pray for that opportunity.""I did nothing, Miss Carvel, nothing that the most unfeeling man in our
army would not do.Nothing that I would not have done for the merest
stranger.""You saved him for me," she said.She turned away from him for
very shame, and yet she heard him saying:-- "Yes, I saved him for you."His voice was in the very note of the sadness which has the strength
to suffer, to put aside the thought of self.A note to which her soul
responded with anguish when she turned to him with the natural cry of
woman."Oh, you ought not to have come here to-night."It does not matter much," he answered."I guessed it,--because my mother had left me.""Oh, you ought not to have come!""The Judge has been my benefactor," he answered quietly."I could walk,
and it was my duty to come."He smiled, "I had no carriage," he said.With the instinct of her sex she seized the chair and placed it under
him."You must sit down at once," she cried."But I am not tired," he replied."Oh, you must sit down, you must, Captain Brice."He started at the
title, which came so prettily from her lips, "Won't you please!"And, as the sun peeps out of a troubled sky, she smiled.He glanced at the book, and the bit of sky was crimson."It is your book," she stammered."I did not know that it was yours
when I took it down.I--I was looking at it while I was waiting for
Clarence.""It is dry reading," he remarked, which was not what he wished to say."And yet--"

"Yes?"The confession had slipped to her
lips.She was sitting on the edge of his desk, looking down at him.All the will that was left him averted his head.And the seal of honor was upon his speech.And he wondered if man were
ever more tempted.Then the evil spread its wings, and soared away into the night.Peace seemed to come upon them both, quieting the
tumult in their hearts, and giving them back their reason.Respect like
wise came to the girl,--respect that was akin to awe."My mother has me how faithfully you nursed the Judge, Miss Carvel.It
was a very noble thing to do.""Not noble at all," she replied hastily, "your mother did the most of
it, And he is an old friend of my father--"

"It was none the less noble," said Stephen, warmly, "And he quarrelled
with Colonel Carvel.""My father quarrelled with him," she corrected."It was well that I
should make some atonement.And yet mine was no atonement, I love Judge
Whipple.It was a--a privilege to see your mother every day--oh, how
he would talk of you!I think he loves you better than any one on this
earth.""Tell me about him," said Stephen, gently.Virginia told him, and into the narrative she threw the whole of her
pent-up self.How patient the Judge had been, and the joy he had derived
from Stephen's letters."You were very good to write to him so often,"
she said.It seemed like a dream to Stephen, like one of the many dreams
of her, the mystery of which was of the inner life beyond our ken.He
could not recall a time when she had not been rebellious, antagonistic.And now--as he listened to her voice, with its exquisite low tones and
modulations, as he sat there in this sacred intimacy, perchance to be
the last in his life, he became dazed.His eyes, softened, with supreme
eloquence cried out that she, was his, forever and forever.The magnetic
force which God uses to tie the worlds together was pulling him to her.Then the door swung open, and Clarence Colfax, out of breath, ran into
the room.He stopped short when he saw them, his hand fell to his sides,
and his words died on his lips.It was Stephen who rose to meet him, and with her eyes the girl followed
his motions.The broad and loosely built frame of the Northerner, his
shoulders slightly stooping, contrasted with Clarence's slighter figure,
erect, compact, springy.The Southerner's eye, for that moment, was
flint struck with the spark from the steel.Stephen's face, thinned by
illness, was grave.For an instant
they stood thus regarding each other, neither offering a hand.It was
Stephen who spoke first, and if there was a trace of emotion in his
voice, one who was listening intently failed to mark it."I am glad to see that you have recovered, Colonel Colfax," he said."I should indeed be without gratitude if I did not thank Captain Brice
for my life," answered Clarence.She had detected the
undue accent on her cousin's last words, and she glanced apprehensively
at Stephen."Miss Carvel has already thanked me sufficiently, sir," he said."I am
happy to have been able to have done you a good turn, and at the same
time to have served her so well.It is
to her your thanks are chiefly due.I believe that I am not going too
far, Colonel Colfax," he added, "when I congratulate you both."Before her cousin could recover, Virginia slid down from the desk and
had come between them.How her eyes shone and her lip trembled as she
gazed at him, Stephen has never forgotten.What a woman she was as she
took her cousin's arm and made him a curtsey."What you have done may seem a light thing to you, Captain Brice," she
said."That is apt to be the way with those who have big hearts.You
have put upon Colonel Colfax, and upon me, a life's obligation."When she began to speak, Clarence raised his head.As he glanced,
incredulous, from her to Stephen, his look gradually softened, and
when she had finished, his manner had become again frank, boyish,
impetuous--nay, penitent."Forgive me, Brice," he cried.I--I did you an injustice, and you, Virginia.I was a fool--a
scoundrel.""No, you were neither," he said.Then upon his face came the smile of
one who has the strength to renounce, all that is dearest to him--that
smile of the unselfish, sweetest of all.She was to see it once again, upon the features of one who bore a
cross,--Abraham Lincoln.Clarence looked, and then he turned away toward
the door to the stairway, as one who walks blindly, in a sorrow.His hand was on the knob when Virginia seemed to awake.She flew after
him:

"Wait!"Then she raised her eyes, slowly, to Stephen, who was standing
motionless beside his chair."My father is in the Judge's room," she said."I thought--"

"That he was an officer in the Confederate Army.She took
a step toward him, appealingly."Oh, he is not a spy," she cried."He has given Mr Brinsmade his word
that he came here for no other purpose than to see me.Then he heard
that the Judge was dying--"

"He has given his word to Mr."Then," said Stephen, "what Mr.Brinsmade sanctions is not for me to
question."She gave him yet another look, a fleeting one which he did not see.Then
she softly opened the door and passed into the room of the dying man.As for Clarence, he stood for a space staring
after them.Then he went noiselessly down the stairs into the street.LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT

When the Judge opened his eyes for the last time in this world, they
fell first upon the face of his old friend, Colonel Carvel.Twice he
tried to speak his name, and twice he failed.The third time he said it
faintly."Comyn, what are you doing here?"I reckon I came to see you, Silas," answered the Colonel."To see me die," said the Judge, grimly.Colonel Carvel's face twitched, and the silence in that little room
seemed to throb."Comyn," said the Judge again, "I heard that you had gone South to fight
against your country.Can it be that you have at last
returned in your allegiances to the flag for which your forefathers
died?"Poor Colonel Carvel

"I am still of the same mind, Silas," he said.The Judge turned his face away, his thin lips moving as in prayer.But
they knew that he was not praying, "Silas," said Mr.Carvel, "we were
friends for twenty years.Let us be friends again, before--"

"Before I die," the Judge interrupted, "I am ready to die.I have had a hard life, Comyn, and few friends.I--I did not know how to make them.Yet no man ever valued those few
more than!But," he cried, the stern fire unquenched to the last, "I
would that God had spared me to see this Rebellion stamped out.To those watching, his eyes seemed fixed on a
distant point, and the light of prophecy was in them."I would that
God had spared me to see this Union supreme once more.A high destiny is reserved for this nation--!I think the
highest of all on this earth."Amid profound silence he leaned back on
the pillows from which he had risen, his breath coming fast.None dared
look at the neighbor beside them."Would you not like to see a
clergyman, Judge?"The look on his face softened as he turned to her."No, madam," he answered; "you are clergyman enough for me.You are near
enough to God--there is no one in this room who is not worthy to stand
in the presence of death.Yet I wish that a clergyman were here, that
he might listen to one thing I have to say.When I was a boy I worked my
way down the river to New York, to see the city.He said to me, 'Sit down, my son, I want to talk to you.I said to him, 'No,
sir, I am not Senator Whipple's son.If the
bishop had wished to talk to me after that, Mrs.Brice, he might have
made my life a little easier--a little sweeter.I know that they are not
all like that.But it was by just such things that I was embittered when
I was a boy."He stopped, and when he spoke again, it was more slowly,
more gently, than any of them had heard him speak in all his life
before."I wish that some of the blessings which I am leaving now had
come to me then--when I was a boy.I might have done my little share in
making the world a brighter place to live in, as all of you have done.Yes, as all of you are now doing for me.I am leaving the world with a
better opinion of it than I ever held in life.God hid the sun from me
when I was a little child.Margaret Brice," he said, "if I had had such
a mother as you, I would have been softened then.I thank God that He
sent you when He did."The widow bowed her head, and a tear fell upon his pillow."I have done nothing," she murmured, "nothing.""So shall they answer at the last whom He has chosen," said the Judge."I was sick, and ye visited me.He has promised to remember those who do
that.He has
given you a son whom all men may look in the face, of whom you need
never be ashamed.Stephen," said the Judge, "come here."Stephen made his way to the bedside, but because of the moisture in his
eyes he saw but dimly the gaunt face.And yet he shrank back in awe at
the change in it.So must all of the martyrs have looked when the
fire of the <DW19>s licked their feet.So must John Bunyan have stared
through his prison bars at the sky."Stephen," he said, "you have been faithful in a few things.So shall
you be made ruler over many things.The little I have I leave to you,
and the chief of this is an untarnished name.I know that you will be
true to it because I have tried your strength.Listen carefully to what
I have to say, for I have thought over it long.In the days gone by our
fathers worked for the good of the people, and they had no thought of
gain.A time is coming when we shall need that blood and that bone in
this Republic.Wealth not yet dreamed of will flow out of this land, and
the waters of it will rot all save the pure, and corrupt all save the
incorruptible.Half-tried men wilt go down before that flood.You and
those like you will remember how your fathers governed,--strongly,
sternly, justly.Serve your city, serve your state, but above all serve
your country."He paused to catch his breath, which was coming painfully now, and
reached out his bony hand to seek Stephen's."I was harsh with you at
first, my son," he went on.And when I had tried
you I wished your mind to open, to keep pace with the growth of this
nation.I sent you to see Abraham Lincoln that you might be born
again--in the West.I saw it when you came back--I
saw it in your face.O God," he cried, with sudden eloquence."I would
that his hands--Abraham Lincoln's hands--might be laid upon all who
complain and cavil and criticise, and think of the little things in
life: I would that his spirit might possess their spirit!"They marvelled and were awed, for never in all his
days had such speech broken from this man."Good-by, Stephen," he said,
when they thought he was not to speak again."Hold the image of Abraham
Lincoln in front of you.You--you are a man after his
own heart--and--and mine."They started for ward, for his eyes
were closed.But presently he stirred again, and opened them."Brinsmade," he said, "Brinsmade, take care of my orphan girls.The <DW64> came forth, shuffling and sobbing, from the doorway."You ain't gwine away, Marse Judge?""Yes, Shadrach, good-by.You have served me well, I have left you
provided for."Shadrach kissed the hand of whose secret charity he knew so much.Then
the Judge withdrew it, and motioned to him to rise.And Colonel Carvel came from the corner where he had
been listening, with his face drawn.You were my friend when there was none other.You were
true to me when the hand of every man was against me.You--you have
risked your life to come to me here, May God spare it for Virginia."At the sound of her name, the girl started.And when she kissed him on the forehead, he trembled.Weakly he reached up and put his hands on her shoulders.The tears came and lay wet upon her lashes as she undid the
button at his throat.There, on a piece of cotton twine, hung a little key, She took it off,
but still his hands held her."I have saved it for you, my dear," he said."God bless you--" why did
his eyes seek Stephen's?--"and make your life happy.Virginia--will you
play my hymn--once more--once more?"They lifted the night lamp from the piano, and the medicine.It was
Stephen who stripped it of the black cloth it had worn, who stood by
Virginia ready to lift the lid when she had turned the lock.The girl's
exaltation gave a trembling touch divine to the well-remembered chords,
and those who heard were lifted, lifted far above and beyond the power
of earthly spell."Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom
        Lead Thou me on
        The night is dark, and I am far from home;
        Lead Thou me on.I do not ask to see
        The distant scene; one step enough for me."A sigh shook Silas Whipple's wasted frame, and he died.Brinsmade and the Doctor were the first to leave the little room
where Silas Whipple had lived and worked and died, Mr.Brinsmade bent
upon one of those errands which claimed him at all times.Virginia sat on, a vague fear haunting her,--a fear
for her father's safety.These questions, at first intruding upon her sorrow,
remained to torture her.Softly she stirred from the chair where she had sat before the piano,
and opened the door of the outer office.A clock in a steeple near by
was striking twelve.Only Stephen
saw her go; she felt his eyes following her, and as she slipped out
lifted hers to meet them for a brief instant through the opening of the
door.First of all she knew that the light in the outer office was burning
dimly, and the discovery gave her a shock.Fearfully searching the room for him, her gaze
was held by a figure in the recess of the window at the back of the
room.A solid, bulky figure it was, and, though uncertainly outlined
in the semi-darkness, she knew it.She took a step nearer, and a cry
escaped her.The man was Eliphalet Hopper.He got down from the sill with a motion
at once sheepish and stealthy.Her breath caught, and instinctively she
gave back toward the door, as if to open it again."I've got something I want to say to you, Miss
Virginia."But she
shivered and paused, horrified at the thought of what she was about to
do.Her father was in that room--and Stephen.She must keep them there,
and get this man away.She must not show fright before him, and yet she
could not trust her voice to speak just then.She must not let him know
that she was afraid of him--this she kept repeating to herself.Virginia never knew how she gathered the courage to pass him, even
swiftly, and turn up the gas.He started back, blinking as the
jet flared.For a moment she stood beside it, with her head high;
confronting him and striving to steady herself for speech."Judge Whipple--died--to-night."The dominating note in his answer was a whine, as if, in spite of
himself, he were awed."I ain't here to see the Judge."She felt her
lips moving, but knew not whether the words had come.The look in his little eyes was the filmy look of
those of an animal feasting."I came here to see you," he said, "--you."She was staring at him now,
in horror."And if you don't give me what I want, I cal'late to see some
one else--in there," said Mr.He smiled, for she was swaying, her lids half closed.By a supreme
effort she conquered her terror and looked at him.The look was in his
eyes still, intensified now."How dare you speak to me after what has happened!If Colonel
Carvel were here, he would--kill you."He flinched at the name and the word, involuntarily.He wiped his
forehead, hot at the very thought.Then,
remembering his advantage, he stepped close to her."He is here," he said, intense now."He is here, in that there room."Virginia struggled, and yet she refrained from crying
out."He never leaves this city without I choose.I can have him hung if
I choose," he whispered, next to her.she cried; "oh, if you choose!"Still his body crept closer, and his face closer."There's but one price to pay," he said hoarsely, "there's but one price
to pay, and that's you--you.I cal'late you'll marry me now."Delirious at the touch of her, he did not hear the door open.Her senses
were strained for that very sound.She heard it close again, and a
footstep across the room.She knew the step--she knew the voice, and her
heart leaped at the sound of it in anger.An arm in a blue sleeve came
between them, and Eliphalet Hopper staggered and fell across the books
on the table, his hand to his face.Towered was the impression that came to Virginia then, and so she
thought of the scene ever afterward.Small bits, like points of tempered
steel, glittered in Stephen's eyes, and his hands following up the
mastery he had given them clutched Mr.Twice Stephen
shook him so that his head beat upon the table.he cried, but he kept his voice low.And then, as if
he expected Hopper to reply: "Shall I kill you?"He turned slowly, and his hands fell from
Mr.Hopper's cowering form as his eyes met hers.Even he could not
fathom the appeal, the yearning, in their dark blue depths.And yet what
he saw there made him tremble."He--he won't touch me again while you
are here."Eliphalet Hopper raised himself from the desk, and one of the big books
fell with a crash to the floor.Then they saw him shrink, his eyes fixed
upon some one behind them.Before the Judge's door stood Colonel Carvel,
in calm, familiar posture, his feet apart, and his head bent forward as
he pulled at his goatee."What is this man doing here, Virginia?"She did not answer
him, nor did speech seem to come easily to Mr.Perhaps the sight of Colonel Carvel had brought before him too, vividly
the memory of that afternoon at Glencoe.All at once Virginia grasped the fulness of the power in this man's
hands.At a word from him her father would be shot as a spy--and Stephen
Brice, perhaps, as a traitor.But if Colonel Carvel should learn that he
had seized her,--here was the terrible danger of the situation.Well she
knew what the Colonel would do.She trusted in
his coolness that he would not.Before a word of reply came from any of the three, a noise was heard
on the stairway.There followed four seconds
of suspense, and then Clarence came in.She saw that his face wore a
worried, dejected look.It changed instantly when he glanced about
him, and an oath broke from his lips as he singled out Eliphalet Hopper
standing in sullen aggressiveness, beside the table."So you're the spy, are you?"Then he turned his
back and faced his uncle."I saw, him in Williams's entry as we drove
up.He strode to the open window at the back
of the office, and looked out, There was a roof under it."The sneak got in here," he said."He knew I was waiting for him in the
street.Hopper passed a heavy hand across the cheek where Stephen had struck
him."No, I ain't the spy," he said, with a meaning glance at the Colonel."I cal'late that he knows," Eliphalet replied, jerking his head toward
Colonel Carvel.What's to prevent my
calling up the provost's guard below?"he continued, with a smile that
was hideous on his swelling face.It was the Colonel who answered him, very quickly and very clearly.Stephen, who was watching him, could not tell
whether it were a grim smile that creased the corners of the Colonel's
mouth as he added.Hopper did not move, but his eyes shifted to Virginia's form.Stephen deliberately thrust himself between them that he might not see
her.said the Colonel, in the mild voice that
should have been an ominous warning.It
was clear that he had not reckoned upon all of this; that he had waited
in the window to deal with Virginia alone.But now the very force of a
desire which had gathered strength in many years made him reckless.His
voice took on the oily quality in which he was wont to bargain."Let's be calm about this business, Colonel," he said."We won't say
anything about the past.But I ain't set on having you shot.There's a
consideration that would stop me, and I cal'late you know what it is."But before he had taken a step Virginia
had crossed the room swiftly, and flung herself upon him.The last word came falteringly,
faintly."Let me go,--honey," whispered the Colonel, gently.His eyes did not
leave Eliphalet.He tried to disengage himself, but her fingers were
clasped about his neck in a passion of fear and love.And then, while
she clung to him, her head was raised to listen.The sound of Stephen
Brice's voice held her as in a spell.His words were coming coldly,
deliberately, and yet so sharply that each seemed to fall like a lash.Hopper, if ever I hear of your repeating what you have seen or
heard in this room, I will make this city and this state too hot for
you to live in.I know how you hide in areas, how you talk
sedition in private, how you have made money out of other men's misery.And, what is more, I can prove that you have had traitorous dealings
with the Confederacy.General Sherman has been good enough to call
himself a friend of mine, and if he prosecutes you for your dealings
in Memphis, you will get a term in a Government prison, You ought to be
hung.Colonel Carvel has shown you the door.FROM THE LETTERS OF MAJOR STEPHEN BRICE

Of the Staff of General Sherman on the March to the Sea, and on the
March from Savannah Northward.HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI GOLDSBORO, N.C.MARCH
24, 1865

DEAR MOTHER: The South Carolina Campaign is a thing of the past.I pause
as I write these words--they seem so incredible to me.We have marched
the four hundred and twenty-five miles in fifty days, and the General
himself has said that it is the longest and most important march ever
made by an organized army in a civilized country.I know that you will
not be misled by the words "civilized country."Not until the history of
this campaign is written will the public realize the wide rivers and
all but impassable swamps we have crossed with our baggage trains and
artillery.The roads (by courtesy so called) were a sea of molasses and
every mile of them has had to be corduroyed.For fear of worrying you I
did not write you from Savannah how they laughed at us for starting at
that season of the year.They said we would not go ten miles, and I most
solemnly believe that no one but "Uncle Billy" and an army organized and
equipped by him could have gone ten miles.You have probably remarked in the tone of my letters ever since we left
Kingston for the sea, a growing admiration for "my General."It seems very strange that this wonderful tactician can be the same man
I met that day going to the Arsenal in the streetcar, and again at Camp
Jackson.I am sure that history will give him a high place among the
commanders of the world.Certainly none was ever more tireless than
he.He never fights a battle when it can be avoided, and his march into
Columbia while threatening Charleston and Augusta was certainly a master
stroke of strategy.You should see him as
he rides through the army, an erect figure, with his clothes all angular
and awry, and an expanse of white sock showing above his low shoes.You can hear his name running from file to file; and some times the
new regiments can't resist cheering.He generally says to the
Colonel:--"Stop that noise, sir.On our march to the sea, if the orders were ever given to turn
northward, "the boys" would get very much depressed.One moonlight night
I was walking my horse close to the General's over the pine needles,
when we overheard this conversation between two soldiers:-- "Say, John,"
said one, "I guess Uncle Billy don't know our corps is goin' north.""I wonder if he does,'" said John."If I could only get a sight of them
white socks, I'd know it was all right."The General rode past without a word, but I heard him telling the story
to Mower the next day.I can find little if any change in his manner since I knew him first.He is brusque, but kindly, and he has the same comradeship with officers
and men--and even the <DW64>s who flock to our army.But few dare to
take advantage of it, and they never do so twice.I have been very near
to him, and have tried not to worry him or ask many foolish questions.Sometimes on the march he will beckon me to close up to him, and we have
a conversation something on this order:-- "There's Kenesaw, Brice.""Went beyond lines there with small party.Next day I thought Rebels would leave in the night.Got up before daylight, fixed telescope on stand, and waited.Saw one blue man creep up, very cautious,
looked around, waved his hat.This gives you but a faint idea of the vividness of his talk.When we
make a halt for any time, the general officers and their staffs flock
to headquarters to listen to his stories.When anything goes wrong, his
perception of it is like a lightning flash,--and he acts as quickly.By the way, I have just found the letter he wrote me, offering this
staff position.Please keep it carefully, as it is something I shall
value all my life.GAYLESVILLE, ALABAMA, October 25, 1864.MAJOR STEPHEN A. BRICE:

   Dear Sir,--The world goes on, and wicked men sound asleep.Davis
   has sworn to destroy my army, and Beauregard has come to do the
   work,--so if you expect to share in our calamity, come down.I
   offer you this last chance for staff duty, and hope you have had
   enough in the field.I do not wish to hurry you, but you can't get
   aboard a ship at sea.So if you want to make the trip, come to
   Chattanooga and take your chances of meeting me.Yours truly,

                  W. T. SHERMAN, Major General.One night--at Cheraw, I think it was--he sent for me to talk to him.I
found him lying on a bed of Spanish moss they had made for him.He asked
me a great many questions about St.Brinsmade,
especially his management of the Sanitary Commission."Brice," he said, after a while, "you remember when Grant sent me to
beat off Joe Johnston's army from Vicksburg.You were wounded then, by
the way, in that dash Lauman made.Grant thought he ought to warn me
against Johnston."'He's wily, Sherman,' said he."'Grant,' said I, 'you give me men enough and time enough to look over
the ground, and I'm not afraid of the devil.'"Nothing could sum up the man better than that.And now what a trick of
fate it is that he has Johnston before him again, in what we hope will
prove the last gasp of the war!He likes Johnston, by the way, and has
the greatest respect for him.I wish you could have peeped into our camp once in a while.In the rare
bursts of sunshine on this march our premises have been decorated with
gay red blankets, and sombre gray ones brought from the quartermasters,
and white Hudson's Bay blankets (not so white now), all being between
forked sticks.It is wonderful how the pitching of a few tents, and the
busy crackle of a few fires, and the sound of voices--sometimes merry,
sometimes sad, depending on the weather, will change the look of a
lonely pine knoll.I should be heartily ashamed
if a word of complaint ever fell from my lips.Whenever I
wake up at night with my feet in a puddle between the blankets, I think
of the men.The corduroy roads which our horses stumble over through the
mud, they make as well as march on.Our flies are carried in wagons,
and our utensils and provisions.They must often bear on their backs the
little dog-tents, under which, put up by their own labor, they crawl
to sleep, wrapped in a blanket they have carried all day, perhaps waist
deep in water.The food they eat has been in their haversacks for many a
weary mile, and is cooked in the little skillet and pot which have
also been a part of their burden.Then they have their musket and
accoutrements, and the "forty rounds" at their backs.Patiently,
cheerily tramping along, going they know not where, nor care much
either, so it be not in retreat.Ready to make roads, throw up works,
tear up railroads, or hew out and build wooden bridges; or, best of all,
to go for the Johnnies under hot sun or heavy rain, through swamp and
mire and quicksand.They marched ten miles to storm Fort McAllister.And
how the cheers broke from them when the pop pop pop of the skirmish line
began after we came in sight of Savannah!No man who has seen but not
shared their life may talk of personal hardship.We arrived at this pretty little town yesterday, so effecting a junction
with Schofield, who got in with the 3d Corps the day before.I am
writing at General Schofield's headquarters.There was a bit of a battle
on Tuesday at Bentonville, and we have come hither in smoke, as usual.But this time we thank Heaven that it is not the smoke of burning
homes,--only some resin the "Johnnies" set on fire before they left.ON BOARD DESPATCH BOAT "MARTIN."DEAR MOTHER: A most curious thing has happened.But I may as well begin
at the beginning.When I stopped writing last evening at the summons
of the General, I was about to tell you something of the battle of
Bentonville on Tuesday last.Mower charged through as bad a piece
of wood and swamp as I ever saw, and got within one hundred yards of
Johnston himself, who was at the bridge across Mill Creek.Of course we
did not know this at the time, and learned it from prisoners.As I have written you, I have been under fire very little since coming
to the staff.When the battle opened, however, I saw that if I stayed
with the General (who was then behind the reserves) I would see little
or nothing; I went ahead "to get information" beyond the line of battle
into the woods.I did not find these favorable to landscape views, and
just as I was turning my horse back again I caught sight of a commotion
some distance to my right.The Rebel skirmish line had fallen back just
that instant, two of our skirmishers were grappling with a third man,
who was fighting desperately.It struck me as singular that the fellow
was not in gray, but had on some sort of dark clothes.I could not reach them in the swamp on horseback, and was in the act of
dismounting when the man fell, and then they set out to carry him to the
rear, still farther to my right, beyond the swamp.I shouted, and one of
the skirmishers came up."We've got a spy, sir," he said excitedly.He was hid in the thicket yonder, lying flat on his face.He reckoned that our boys would run right over him and that he'd get
into our lines that way.Tim Foley stumbled on him, and he put up as
good a fight with his fists as any man I ever saw."That night I told the General, who
sent over to the headquarters of the 17th Corps to inquire.The word
came back that the man's name was Addison, and he claimed to be a Union
sympathizer who owned a plantation near by.He declared that he had been
conscripted by the Rebels, wounded, sent back home, and was now about to
be pressed in again.He had taken this method of escaping to our lines.It was a common story enough, but General Mower added in his message
that he thought the story fishy.This was because the man's appearance
was very striking, and he seemed the type of Confederate fighter who
would do and dare anything.He had a wound, which had been a bad one,
evidently got from a piece of shell.But they had been able to find
nothing on him.Sherman sent back word to keep the man until he could
see him in person.It was about nine o'clock last night when I reached
the house the General has taken.A prisoner's guard was resting outside,
and the hall was full of officers.They said that the General was
awaiting me, and pointed to the closed door of a room that had been the
dining room.Two candles were burning in pewter sticks on the bare mahogany table.There was the General sitting beside them, with his legs crossed,
holding some crumpled tissue paper very near his eyes, and reading.He
did not look up when I entered.I was aware of a man standing, tall and
straight, just out of range of the candles' rays.He wore the easy dress
of a Southern planter, with the broad felt hat.The head was flung back
so that there was just a patch of light on the chin, and the lids of the
eyes in the shadow were half closed.For the moment I felt precisely as I
had when I was hit by that bullet in Lauman's charge.I was aware of
something very like pain, yet I could not place the cause of it.But
this is what since has made me feel queer: you doubtless remember
staying at Hollingdean, when I was a boy, and hearing the story of Lord
Northwell's daredevil Royalist ancestor,--the one with the lace collar
over the dull-gold velvet, and the pointed chin, and the lazy scorn in
the eyes.Those eyes are painted with drooping lids.The first time I
saw Clarence Colfax I thought of that picture--and now I thought of the
picture first."Major Brice, do you know this gentleman?""His name is Colfax, sir--Colonel Colfax, I think"

"Thought so," said the General.I have thought much of that scene since, as I am steaming northward over
green seas and under cloudless skies, and it has seemed very unreal.I
should almost say supernatural when I reflect how I have run across this
man again and again, and always opposing him.I can recall just how he
looked at the slave auction, which seem, so long ago: very handsome,
very boyish, and yet with the air of one to be deferred to.It was
sufficiently remarkable that I should have found him in Vicksburg.But
now--to be brought face to face with him in this old dining room in
Goldsboro!I did not know how he
would act, but I went up to him and held out my hand, and said.--"How do
you do, Colonel Colfax?"I am sure that my voice was not very steady, for I cannot help liking
him And then his face lighted up and he gave me his hand.And he smiled
at me and again at the General, as much as to say that it was all over."We seem to run into each other, Major Brice," said he.I could see that the General, too,
was moved, from the way he looked at him.And he speaks a little more
abruptly at such times."Guess that settles it, Colonel," he said."I reckon it does, General," said Clarence, still smiling.The General
turned from him to the table with a kind of jerk and clapped his hand on
the tissue paper."These speak for themselves, sir," he said."It is very plain that they
would have reached the prominent citizens for whom they were intended if
you had succeeded in your enterprise.You were captured out of uniform
You know enough of war to appreciate the risk you ran."Call Captain Vaughan, Brice, and ask him to conduct the prisoner back."I asked him if I could write home for him or do anything else.Some day I shall tell you what he said.Then Vaughan took him out, and I heard the guard shoulder arms and tramp
away in the night.The General and I were left alone with the mahogany
table between us, and a family portrait of somebody looking down on
us from the shadow on the wall.A moist spring air came in at the open
windows, and the candles flickered.After a silence, I ventured to say:

"I hope he won't be shot, General.""Don't know, Brice," he answered.Hate to shoot him,
but war is war.Magnificent class he belongs to--pity we should have to
fight those fellows."He paused, and drummed on the table."Brice," said he, "I'm going to
send you to General Grant at City Point with despatches.I'm sorry Dunn
went back yesterday, but it can't be helped."You'll have to ride to Kinston.The railroad won't be through until
to-morrow: I'll telegraph there, and to General Easton at Morehead City.Tell Grant I expect to run up there in a
day or two myself, when things are arranged here.I turned to go, but Clarence Colfax was on my mind "General?""General, could you hold Colonel Colfax until I see you again?"It was a bold thing to say, and I quaked.And he looked at me in his
keen way, through and through "You saved his life once before, didn't
you?""You allowed me to have him sent home from Vicksburg, sir."He answered with one of his jokes--apropos of something he said on the
Court House steps at Vicksburg."Well, well," he said, "I'll see, I'll see.Thank God this war is pretty
near over.I'll let you know, Brice, before I shoot him."I rode the thirty odd miles to Kinston in--little more than three hours.A locomotive was waiting for me, and I jumped into a cab with a friendly
engineer.Soon we were roaring seaward through the vast pine forests.It was a lonely journey, and you were much in my mind.My greatest
apprehension was that we might be derailed and the despatches captured;
for as fast as our army had advanced, the track of it had closed again,
like the wake of a ship at sea.Guerillas were roving about, tearing up
ties and destroying bridges.There was one five-minute interval of excitement when, far down the
tunnel through the forest, we saw a light gleaming.The engineer said
there was no house there, that it must be a fire.But we did not slacken
our speed, and gradually the leaping flames grew larger and redder until
we were upon them.Not one gaunt figure stood between them and us.Not one shot broke the
stillness of the night.As dawn broke I beheld the flat, gray waters of
the Sound stretching away to the eastward, and there was the boat at the
desolate wharf beside the warehouse, her steam rising white in the chill
morning air.THE SAME, CONTINUED

             HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,
              CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 28, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I arrived here safely the day before yesterday, and I hope
that you will soon receive some of the letters I forwarded on that day.It is an extraordinary place, this City Point; a military city sprung up
like a mushroom in a winter.And my breath was quite taken away when I
first caught sight of it on the high table-land.The great bay in front
of it, which the Appomattox helps to make, is a maze of rigging and
smoke-pipes, like the harbor of a prosperous seaport.There are gunboats
and supply boats, schooners and square-riggers and steamers, all huddled
together, and our captain pointed out to me the 'Malvern' flying Admiral
Porter's flag.Barges were tied up at the long wharves, and these were
piled high with wares and flanked by squat warehouses.Although it
was Sunday, a locomotive was puffing and panting along the foot of the
ragged bank.High above, on the flat promontory between the two rivers, is the city
of tents and wooden huts, the great trees in their fresh faint green
towering above the low roofs.At the point of the bluff a large flag
drooped against its staff, and I did not have to be told that this was
General Grant's headquarters.There was a fine steamboat lying at the wharf, and I had hardly stepped
ashore before they told me she was President Lincoln's.I read the name
on her--the 'River Queen'.Yes, the President is here, too, with his
wife and family.There are many fellows here with whom I was brought up in Boston.I am
living with Jack Hancock, whom you will remember well.He is a captain
now, and has a beard.I went straight to General Grant's
headquarters,--just a plain, rough slat house such as a contractor might
build for a temporary residence.Only the high flagstaff and the Stars
and Stripes distinguish it from many others of the same kind.A group of
officers stood chatting outside of it, and they told me that the General
had walked over to get his mail.He is just as unassuming and democratic
as "my general."General Rankin took me into the office, a rude room,
and we sat down at the long table there.Presently the door opened,
and a man came in with a slouch hat on and his coat unbuttoned.We rose to our feet, and I saluted."General, this is Major Brice of General Sherman's staff.He has brought
despatches from Goldsboro," said Rankin.He nodded, took off his hat and laid it on the table, and reached out
for the despatches.While reading them he did not move, except to light
another cigar.I am getting hardened to unrealities,--perhaps I should
say marvels, now.It did not seem so
strange that this silent General with the baggy trousers was the man who
had risen by leaps and bounds in four years to be general-in-chief of
our armies.His face looks older and more sunken than it did on that
day in the street near the Arsenal, in St.Louis, when he was just a
military carpet-bagger out of a job.But
how different the impressions made by the man in authority and the same
man out of authority!He made a sufficient impression upon me then, as I told you at the time.That was because I overheard his well-merited rebuke to Hopper.But I
little dreamed that I was looking on the man who was to come out of the
West and save this country from disunion.And how quietly and simply he
has done it, without parade or pomp or vainglory.Of all those who, with
every means at their disposal, have tried to conquer Lee, he is the
only one who has in any manner succeeded.He has been able to hold him
fettered while Sherman has swept the Confederacy.And these are the two
men who were unknown when the war began.When the General had finished reading the despatches, he folded them
quickly and put them in his pocket."Sit down and tell me about this last campaign of yours, Major," he
said.I talked with him for about half an hour.He is a marked contrast to Sherman in this respect.I believe that
he only opened his lips to ask two questions.You may well believe that
they were worth the asking, and they revealed an intimate knowledge of
our march from Savannah.I was interrupted many times by the arrival
of different generals, aides, etc.He sat there smoking, imperturbable.Sometimes he said "yes" or "no," but oftener he merely nodded his head.Once he astounded by a brief question an excitable young lieutenant, who
floundered.The General seemed to know more than he about the matter he
had in hand.When I left him, he asked me where I was quartered, and said he hoped I
would be comfortable.Jack Hancock was waiting for me, and we walked around the city, which
even has barber shops.Everywhere were signs of preparation, for the
roads are getting dry, and the General preparing for a final campaign
against Lee.What a marvellous fight he has made with his
material.I think that he will be reckoned among the greatest generals
of our race.Of course, I was very anxious to get a glimpse of the President, and
so we went down to the wharf, where we heard that he had gone off for
a horseback ride.They say that he rides nearly every day, over the
corduroy roads and through the swamps, and wherever the boys see that
tall hat they cheer.They know it as well as the lookout tower on the
flats of Bermuda Hundred.He lingers at the campfires and swaps stories
with the officers, and entertains the sick and wounded in the hospitals.I believe that the great men don't change.Away with your Napoleons and your Marlboroughs and your Stuarts.These
are the days of simple men who command by force of character, as well as
knowledge.I believe that he will change the
world, and strip it of its vainglory and hypocrisy.In the evening, as we were sitting around Hancock's fire, an officer
came in."The President sends his compliments, Major, and wants to know if you
would care to pay him a little visit."If I would care to pay him a little visit!That officer had to hurry to
keep up with the as I walked to the wharf.He led me aboard the River
Queen, and stopped at the door of the after-cabin.Lincoln was sitting under the lamp, slouched down in his chair,
in the position I remembered so well.It was as if I had left him but
yesterday.He was whittling, and he had made some little toy for his son
Tad, who ran out as I entered.When he saw me, the President rose to his great height, a sombre,
towering figure in black.But the sad
smile, the kindly eyes in their dark caverns, the voice--all were just
the same.It was sad and lined
when I had known it, but now all the agony endured by the millions,
North and South, seemed written on it.I took his big, bony hand,
which reminded me of Judge Whipple's.Yes, it was just as if I had been
with him always, and he were still the gaunt country lawyer."Yes, sir," I said, "indeed I do."He looked at me with that queer expression of mirth he sometimes has.I didn't
think that any man could travel so close to Sherman and keep 'em.""They're unfortunate ways, sir," I said, "if they lead you to misjudge
me."He laid his hand on my shoulder, just as he had done at Freeport."I know you, Steve," he said."I shuck an ear of corn before I buy it.I've kept tab on you a little the last five years, and when I heard
Sherman had sent a Major Brice up here, I sent for you.""I tried very hard to get a glimpse of you
to-day, Mr."I'm glad to hear it, Steve," he said."Then you haven't joined the
ranks of the grumblers?You haven't been one of those who would have
liked to try running this country for a day or two, just to show me how
to do it?""No, sir," I said, laughing."I didn't think you were that kind,
Steve.Now sit down and tell me about this General of mine who wears
seven-leagued boots.What was it--four hundred and twenty miles in fifty
days?How many navigable rivers did he step across?"He began to count
on those long fingers of his."The Edisto, the Broad, the Catawba, the
Pedee, and--?""Is--is the General a nice man?""Yes, sir, he is that," I answered heartily."And not a man in the
army wants anything when he is around.You should see that Army of the
Mississippi, sir.They arrived in Goldsboro' in splendid condition."He got up and gathered his coat-tails under his arms, and began to walk
up and down the cabin.And, thinking the story of the white socks
might amuse him, I told him that."Well, now," he said, "any man that has a nickname like that is all
right.That's the best recommendation you can give the General--just
say 'Uncle Billy.'""You've given 'Uncle
Billy' a good recommendation, Steve," he said."Did you ever hear the
story of Mr."Well, when Wallace was hiring his gardener he asked him whom he had
been living with."'A ricommindation is it, sorr?Sure I have nothing agin Misther
Dalton, though he moightn't be knowing just the respict the likes of a
first-class garthener is entitled to.'"He seldom does, it seems, at his own stories.But
I could not help laughing over the "ricommindation" I had given the
General.He knew that I was embarrassed, and said kindly:-- "Now tell
me something about 'Uncle Billy's <DW15>s.'I hear that they have a most
effectual way of tearing up railroads."I told him of Poe's contrivance of the hook and chain, and how the
heaviest rails were easily overturned with it, and how the ties were
piled and fired and the rails twisted out of shape.The President
listened to every word with intense interest.he exclaimed, "we have got a general.Caesar burnt his
bridges behind him, but Sherman burns his rails.Then I began to tell him how
the <DW64>s had flocked into our camps, and how simply and plainly the
General had talked to them, advising them against violence of any kind,
and explaining to them that "Freedom" meant only the liberty to earn
their own living in their own way, and not freedom from work."We have got a general, sure enough," he cried."He talks to them
plainly, does he, so that they understand?I say to you, Brice," he went
on earnestly, "the importance of plain talk can't be overestimated.Any
thought, however abstruse, can be put in speech that a boy or a
<DW64> can grasp.Any book, however deep, can be written in terms that
everybody can comprehend, if a man only tries hard enough.When I was a
boy I used to hear the neighbors talking, and it bothered me so because
I could not understand them that I used to sit up half the night
thinking things out for myself.I remember that I did not know what the
word demonstrate meant.So I stopped my studies then and there and got a
volume of Euclid.Before I got through I could demonstrate everything in
it, and I have never been bothered with demonstrate since."I thought of those wonderfully limpid speeches of his: of the Freeport
debates, and of the contrast between his style and Douglas's.And I
understood the reason for it at last.I understood the supreme mind that
had conceived the Freeport Question.And as I stood before him then, at
the close of this fearful war, the words of the Gospel were in my mind.'So the last shall be first, and the first, last; for many be called,
but few chosen.'How I wished that all those who have maligned and tortured him could
talk with him as I had talked with him.To know his great heart would
disarm them of all antagonism.They would feel, as I feel, that his life
is so much nobler than theirs, and his burdens so much heavier, that
they would go away ashamed of their criticism.He said to me once, "Brice, I hope we are in sight of the end, now.I
hope that we may get through without any more fighting.I don't want to
see any more of our countrymen killed.And then," he said, as if talking
to himself, "and then we must show them mercy--mercy."I thought it a good time to mention Colfax's case.He has been on my
mind ever since.Once he sighed, and
he was winding his long fingers around each other while I talked.Lincoln," I concluded, "And if a
technicality will help him out, he was actually within his own skirmish
line at the time.The Rebel skirmishers had not fallen back on each side
of him.""Brice," he said, with that sorrowful smile, "a technicality might save
Colfax, but it won't save me.And I went on to tell of what he had done at Vicksburg, leaving
out, however, my instrumentality in having him sent north.(That seems to be a favorite expression of
his.)If it wasn't for them, the
South would have quit long ago."Then he looked at me in his funny way,
and said, "See here, Steve, if this Colfax isn't exactly a friend of
yours, there must be some reason why you are pleading for him in this
way.""Well, sir," I said, at length, "I should like to get him off on account
of his cousin, Miss Virginia Carvel.And I told him something about
Miss Carvel, and how she had helped you with the Union sergeant that day
in the hot hospital.And how she had nursed Judge Whipple.""She's a fine woman," he said."Those women have helped those men to
prolong this war about three years.""And yet we must save them for the nation's sake.They are to be the
mothers of our patriots in days to come.Is she a friend of yours, too,
Steve?""Not especially, sir," I answered finally."I have had to offend her
rather often.he cried, jumping up, "she's a daughter of Colonel Carvel.I
always had an admiration for that man.An ideal Southern gentleman of
the old school,--courteous, as honorable and open as the day, and as
brave as a lion.You've heard the story of how he threw a man named
Babcock out of his store, who tried to bribe him?""I heard you tell it in that tavern, sir.It
did me good to hear the Colonel praised."I always liked that story," he said."By the way, what's become of the
Colonel?""He got away--South, sir," I answered.He hasn't
been heard of since the summer of '63.And so
you want me to pardon this Colfax?""It would be presumptuous in me to go that far, sir," I replied."But I
hoped you might speak of it to the General when he comes.And I would be
glad of the opportunity to testify."He took a few strides up and down the room."Well, well," he said, "that's my vice--pardoning, saying yes.It's
always one more drink with me.It--" he smiled--"it makes me sleep
better.I've pardoned enough Rebels to populate New Orleans.Why," he
continued, with his whimsical look, "just before I left Washington, in
comes one of your Missouri senators with a list of Rebels who are shut
up in McDowell's and Alton.I said:-- "'Senator, you're not going to ask
me to turn loose all those at once?'"He said just what you said when you were speaking of Missouri a while
ago, that he was afraid of guerilla warfare, and that the war was nearly
over.And then what does he do but pull out another batch
longer than the first!you don't want me to turn these loose, too?'I think it will pay to be merciful.'"'Then durned if I don't,' I said, and I signed 'em."STEAMER "RIVER QUEEN."ON THE POTOMAC, April 9, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I am glad that the telegrams I have been able to send
reached you safely.I have not had time to write, and this will be but a
short letter.I am on the President's boat,
in the President's party, bound with him for Washington.And this is how
it happened: The very afternoon of the day I wrote you, General Sherman
himself arrived at City Point on the steamer 'Russia'.I heard the
salutes, and was on the wharf to meet him.That same afternoon he and
General Grant and Admiral Porter went aboard the River Queen to see
the President.How I should have liked to be present at that interview!After it was over they all came out of the cabin together General Grant
silent, and smoking, as usual; General Sherman talking vivaciously;
and Lincoln and the Admiral smiling and listening.I shall never expect to see such a sight again in all my days.You
can imagine my surprise when the President called me from where I was
standing at some distance with the other officers.He put his hand on my
shoulder then and there, and turned to General Sherman."Major Brice is a friend of mine, General," he said."He never told me that," said the General."I guess he's got a great many important things shut up inside of him,"
said Mr."But he gave you a good recommendation,
Sherman.He said that you wore white socks, and that the boys liked
you and called you 'Uncle Billy.'And I told him that was the best
recommendation he could give anybody."But the General only looked at me with those eyes that
go through everything, and then he laughed."Brice," he said, "You'll have my reputation ruined."Lincoln, "you don't want the Major right away, do
you?Let him stay around here for a while with me.He looked at the general-in-chief, who was smiling just
a little bit."I've got a sneaking notion that Grant's going to do
something."Lincoln," said my General, "you may have Brice.Be
careful he doesn't talk you to death--he's said too much already."I have no time now to tell you all that I have seen and heard.I have
ridden with the President, and have gone with him on errands of mercy
and errands of cheer.I have been almost within sight of what we hope is
the last struggle of this frightful war.I have listened to the guns of
Five Forks, where Sheridan and Warren bore their own colors in the front
of the charge, I was with Mr.Lincoln while the battle of Petersburg was
raging, and there were tears in his eyes.Then came the retreat of Lee and the instant pursuit of Grant,
and--Richmond.The quiet General did not so much as turn aside to enter
the smoking city he had besieged for so long.But I went there, with the
President.And if I had one incident in my life to live over again, I
should choose this.As we were going up the river, a disabled steamer
lay across the passage in the obstruction of piles the Confederates had
built.There were but a few of us in his
party, and we stepped into Admiral Porter's twelve-oared barge and were
rowed to Richmond, the smoke of the fires still darkening the sky.We
landed within a block of Libby Prison.With the little guard of ten sailors he marched the mile and a half
to General Weitzel's headquarters,--the presidential mansion of the
Confederacy.I shall remember him always as
I saw him that day, a tall, black figure of sorrow, with the high silk
hat we have learned to love.Unafraid, his heart rent with pity, he
walked unharmed amid such tumult as I have rarely seen.The windows
filled, the streets ahead of us became choked, as the word that the
President was coming ran on like quick-fire.The <DW64>s wept aloud and cried
hosannas.They pressed upon him that they might touch the hem of his
coat, and one threw himself on his knees and kissed the President's
feet.Still he walked on unharmed, past the ashes and the ruins.Not as a
conqueror was he come, to march in triumph.Though there were many times when we had to fight for a path through the
crowds, he did not seem to feel the danger.Was it because he knew that his hour was not yet come?To-day, on the boat, as we were steaming between the green shores of the
Potomac, I overheard him reading to Mr.Sumner:--

          "Duncan is in his grave;
        After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
        Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
        Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
        Can touch him further."WILLARD'S HOTEL, WASHINGTON, April 10, 1865.I have looked up the passage, and have written it in above.MAN OF SORROW

The train was late--very late.It was Virginia who first caught sight
of the new dome of the Capitol through the slanting rain, but she merely
pressed her lips together and said nothing.In the dingy brick station
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad more than one person paused to look
after them, and a kind-hearted lady who had been in the car kissed the
girl good-by."You think that you can find your uncle's house, my dear?"she asked,
glancing at Virginia with concern.Through all of that long journey she
had worn a look apart."Do you think you can find your uncle's house?"And then she smiled as she looked at the honest,
alert, and squarely built gentleman beside her.Whereupon the kind lady gave the Captain her hand."You look as if you
could, Captain," said she."Remember, if General Carvel is out of town,
you promised to bring her to me.""Yes, ma'am," said Captain Lige, "and so I shall."No sah, dat ain't de kerridge
you wants.Dat's it, lady, you'se lookin at it.Kerridge, kerridge,
kerridge!"Virginia tried bravely to smile, but she was very near to tears as she
stood on the uneven pavement and looked at the scrawny horses standing
patiently in the steady downpour.All sorts of people were coming
and going, army officers and navy officers and citizens of states and
territories, driving up and driving away.She was thinking then of the multitude who came here with aching
hearts,--with heavier hearts than was hers that day.How many of the
throng hurrying by would not flee, if they could, back to the peaceful
homes they had left?Destroyed,
like her own, by the war.Women with children at their breasts, and
mothers bowed with sorrow, had sought this city in their agony.Young
men and old had come hither, striving to keep back the thoughts of dear
ones left behind, whom they might never see again.And by the thousands
and tens of thousands they had passed from here to the places of blood
beyond."Do you know where General Daniel Carvel lives?""Yes, sah, reckon I does.Virginia sank back on the stuffy cushions of the rattle-trap, and then
sat upright again and stared out of the window at the dismal scene.They
were splashing through a sea of mud.Louis,
Captain Lige had done his best to cheer her, and he did not intend to
desist now."So this is Washington, Why, it don't
compare to St.Louis, except we haven't got the White House and the
Capitol.Jinny, it would take a scow to get across the street, and we
don't have ramshackly stores and <DW65> cabins bang up against fine
Houses like that.We don't
have any dirty pickaninnies dodging among the horses in our residence
streets.I declare, Jinny, if those aren't pigs!""I hope Uncle Daniel has some breakfast for you.You've had a good deal to put up with on this trip.""Lordy, Jinny," said the Captain, "I'd put up with a good deal more than
this for the sake of going anywhere with you.""Even to such a doleful place as this?""This is all right, if the sun'll only come out and dry things up and
let us see the green on those trees," he said, "Lordy, how I do love to
see the spring green in the sunlight!""Lige," she said, "you know you're just trying to keep up my spirits.You've been doing that ever since we left home.""No such thing," he replied with vehemence."There's nothing for you to
be cast down about.""Suppose I can't make your Black
Republican President pardon Clarence!"said the Captain, squeezing her hand and trying to appear
unconcerned.Just then the rattletrap pulled up at the sidewalk, the wheels of the
near side in four inches of mud, and the Captain leaped out and spread
the umbrella.They were in front of a rather imposing house of brick,
flanked on one side by a house just like it, and on the other by a
series of dreary vacant lots where the rain had collected in pools.They
climbed the steps and rang the bell.In due time the door was opened by
a smiling yellow butler in black."Yas, miss, But he ain't to home now."Didn't he get my telegram day before
yesterday?"He's done gone since Saturday, miss."And then, evidently impressed by
the young lady's looks, he added hospitably, "Kin I do anything fo' you,
miss?""I'm his niece, Miss Virginia Carvel, and this is Captain Brent."The yellow butler's face lighted up."Come right in, Miss Jinny, Done heerd de General speak of you
often--yas'm.De General'll be to home dis a'ternoon, suah.'Twill do
him good ter see you, Miss Jinny.Walk right
in, Cap'n, and make yo'selves at home.Lizbeth--Lizbeth!"Done seed her at
Calve't House."Very well, Lizbeth," said Virginia, listlessly sitting down on the hall
sofa."Yas'm," said Lizbeth, "jes' reckon we kin."She ushered them into a
walnut dining room, big and high and sombre, with plush-bottomed chairs
placed about--walnut also; for that was the fashion in those days.But the Captain had no sooner seated himself than he shot up again and
started out."To pay off the carriage driver," he said."I'm going to the White House in a little
while.""To see your Black Republican President," she replied, with alarming
calmness."Now, Jinny," he cried, in excited appeal, "don't go doin' any such fool
trick as that.Your Uncle Dan'l will be here this afternoon.And then the thing'll be fixed all right, and no
mistake."Her reply was in the same tone--almost a monotone--which she had used
for three days.It made the Captain very uneasy, for he knew when she
spoke in that way that her will was in it."And to lose that time," she answered, "may be to have him shot.""But you can't get to the President without credentials," he objected."What," she flashed, "hasn't any one a right to see the President?You
mean to say that he will not see a woman in trouble?Then all these
pretty stories I hear of him are false.They are made up by the
Yankees."He had some notion of the multitude of calls upon Mr.But he could not, he dared not,
remind her of the principal reason for this,--Lee's surrender and the
approaching end of the war.In the distant valley of the Mississippi he had only heard of
the President very conflicting things.He had heard him criticised and
reviled and praised, just as is every man who goes to the White House,
be he saint or sinner.And, during an administration, no man at a
distance may come at a President's true character and worth.The Captain
had seen Lincoln caricatured vilely.And again he had read and heard the
pleasant anecdotes of which Virginia had spoken, until he did not know
what to believe.As for Virginia, he knew her partisanship to, and undying love for, the
South; he knew the class prejudice which was bound to assert itself, and
he had seen enough in the girl's demeanor to fear that she was going to
demand rather than implore.She did not come of a race that was wont to
bend the knee."Well, well," he said despairingly, "you must eat some breakfast first,
Jinny."She waited with an ominous calmness until it was brought in, and then
she took a part of a roll and some coffee."This won't do," exclaimed the Captain."Why, why, that won't get you
halfway to Mr."You must eat enough, Lige," she said.He was finished in an incredibly short time, and amid the protestations
of Lizbeth and the yellow butler they got into the carriage again, and
splashed and rattled toward the White House.Once Virginia glanced out,
and catching sight of the bedraggled flags on the houses in honor of
Lee's surrender, a look of pain crossed her face.The Captain could not
repress a note of warning."Jinny," said he, "I have an idea that you'll find the President a good
deal of a man.Now if you're allowed to see him, don't get him mad,
Jinny, whatever you do.""If he is something of a man, Lige, he will not lose his temper with a
woman."And just then they came in sight of the house of
the Presidents, with its beautiful portico and its broad wings.And they
turned in under the dripping trees of the grounds.A carriage with a
black coachman and footman was ahead of them, and they saw two stately
gentlemen descend from it and pass the guard at the door.The Captain helped her out in his best manner, and gave some
money to the driver."I reckon he needn't wait for us this time, Jinny," said be.She shook
her head and went in, he following, and they were directed to the
anteroom of the President's office on the second floor.There were
many people in the corridors, and one or two young officers in blue who
stared at her.But her spirits sank when they came to the anteroom.It was full of all
sorts of people.Politicians, both prosperous and seedy, full faced and
keen faced, seeking office; women, officers, and a one-armed soldier
sitting in the corner.He was among the men who offered Virginia their
seats, and the only one whom she thanked.But she walked directly to the
doorkeeper at the end of the room."Then you'll have to wait your turn, sir," he said, shaking his head and
looking at Virginia."It's slow work waiting your turn,
there's so many governors and generals and senators, although the
session's over.And added, with an inspiration,
"I must see him.She saw instantly, with a woman's instinct, that these words had had
their effect.The old man glanced at her again, as if demurring."You're sure, miss, it's life and death?""Oh, why should I say so if it were not?""The orders are very strict," he said."But the President told me to
give precedence to cases when a life is in question.Just you wait a
minute, miss, until Governor Doddridge comes out, and I'll see what I
can do for you.In a little while the heavy door
opened, and a portly, rubicund man came out with a smile on his face.He broke into a laugh, when halfway across the room, as if the memory of
what he had heard were too much for his gravity.The doorkeeper slipped
into the room, and there was a silent, anxious interval.Captain Lige started forward with her, but she restrained him."Wait for me here, Lige," she said.She swept in alone, and the door closed softly after her.The room was
a big one, and there were maps on the table, with pins sticking in them.Could this fantastically tall, stooping figure before her be that of the
President of the United States?She stopped, as from the shock he gave
her.The lean, yellow face with the mask-like lines all up and down,
the unkempt, tousled hair, the beard--why, he was a hundred times more
ridiculous than his caricatures.He might have stood for many of the
poor white trash farmers she had seen in Kentucky--save for the long
black coat.Somehow that smile changed his face a
little."I guess I'll have to own up," he answered."My name is Virginia Carvel," she said."I have come all the way from
St."Miss Carvel," said the President, looking at her intently, "I have
rarely been so flattered in my life.I--I hope I have not disappointed
you.""Oh, you haven't," she cried, her eyes flashing, "because I am what you
would call a Rebel."The mirth in the dark corners of his eyes disturbed her more and more.And then she saw that the President was laughing."And have you a better name for it, Miss Carvel?""Because I
am searching for a better name--just now.""No, thank you," said Virginia; "I think that I can say what I have come
to say better standing."That reminds me of a story they tell
about General Buck Tanner.One day the
boys asked him over to the square to make a speech."'I'm all right when I get standing up, Liza,' he said to his wife.Only trouble is they come too cussed fast.How'm I going to stop 'em when I want to?'"'Well, I du declare, Buck,' said she, 'I gave you credit for some
sense.All you've got to do is to set down."So the General went over to the square and talked for about an hour
and a half, and then a Chicago man shouted to him to dry up."'Boys,' said he, 'it's jest every bit as bad for me as it is for you.You'll have to hand up a chair, boys, because I'm never going to get
shet of this goldarned speech any anther way.'"Lincoln had told this so comically that Virginia was forced to
laugh, and she immediately hated herself.A man who could joke at such
a time certainly could not feel the cares and responsibilities of his
office.And yet this was the President
who had conducted the war, whose generals had conquered the Confederacy.And she was come to ask him a favor.Lincoln," she began, "I have come to talk to you about my cousin,
Colonel Clarence Colfax.""I shall be happy to talk to you about your cousin, Colonel Colfax, Miss
Carvel."He is my first cousin," she retorted."Why didn't he come
with you?""He is Clarence Colfax, of St.Louis, now a Colonel in the army of the Confederate States."Virginia tossed her head in
exasperation."In General Joseph Johnston's army," she replied, trying to be patient."But now," she gulped, "now he has been arrested as a spy by General
Sherman's army.""And--and they are going to shoot him.""Oh, no, he doesn't," she cried."You don't know how brave he is!He
floated down the Mississippi on a log, out of Vicksburg, and brought
back thousands and thousands of percussion caps.He rowed across the
river when the Yankee fleet was going down, and set fire to De Soto so
that they could see to shoot."Lincoln, "that's a good starter.""Miss Carvel," said he, "that argument reminds me of a story about a man
I used to know in the old days in Illinois.His name was McNeil, and he
was a lawyer."One day he was defending a prisoner for assault and battery before
Judge Drake."'Judge, says McNeil, 'you oughtn't to lock this man up.It was a fair
fight, and he's the best man in the state in a fair fight.And, what's
more, he's never been licked in a fair fight in his life.'"'And if your honor does lock me up,' the prisoner put in, 'I'll give
your honor a thunderin' big lickin' when I get out.'"'Gentlemen,' said he, 'it's a powerful queer argument, but the Court
will admit it on its merits.The prisoner will please to step out on the
grass.'"She was striving against
something, she knew not what.Her breath was coming deeply, and she was
dangerously near to tears.She had come into
this man's presence despising herself for having to ask him a favor.Now she could not look into it
without an odd sensation.Told her a few funny stories--given quizzical
answers to some of her questions.Quizzical, yes; but she could not be
sure then there was not wisdom in them, and that humiliated her.She had
never conceived of such a man.And, be it added gratuitously, Virginia
deemed herself something of an adept in dealing with men.Lincoln, "to continue for the defence, I believe
that Colonel Colfax first distinguished himself at the time of Camp
Jackson, when of all the prisoners he refused to accept a parole."Startled, she looked up at him swiftly, and then down again."Yes,"
she answered, "yes.Lincoln, please don't hold that against
him."If she could only have seen his face then."My dear young lady," replied the President, "I honor him for it.I was
merely elaborating the argument which you have begun.On the other hand,
it is a pity that he should have taken off that uniform which he adorned
and attempted to enter General Sherman's lines as a civilian,--as a
spy."He had spoken these last words very gently, but she was too excited to
heed his gentleness.She drew herself up, a gleam in her eyes like the
crest of a blue wave in a storm.she cried; "it takes more courage to be a spy than anything
else in war.You are not content in, the North
with what you have gained.You are not content with depriving us of
our rights, and our fortunes, with forcing us back to an allegiance we
despise.You are not content with humiliating our generals and putting
innocent men in prisons.But now I suppose you will shoot us all.And
all this mercy that I have heard about means nothing--nothing--"

Why did she falter and stop?"Miss Carvel," said the President, "I am afraid from what I have heard
just now, that it means nothing."Oh, the sadness of that voice,--the
ineffable sadness,--the sadness and the woe of a great nation!And the
sorrow in those eyes, the sorrow of a heavy cross borne meekly,--how
heavy none will ever know.The pain of a crown of thorns worn for a
world that did not understand.No wonder Virginia faltered and
was silent.She looked at Abraham Lincoln standing there, bent and
sorrowful, and it was as if a light had fallen upon him.But strangest
of all in that strange moment was that she felt his strength.It was the
same strength she had felt in Stephen Brice.This was the thought that
came to her.Slowly she walked to the window and looked out across the green grounds
where the wind was shaking the wet trees, past the unfinished monument
to the Father of her country, and across the broad Potomac to Alexandria
in the hazy distance.The rain beat upon the panes, and then she knew
that she was crying softly to herself.She had met a force that she
could not conquer, she had looked upon a sorrow that she could not
fathom, albeit she had known sorrow.She turned and looked through her tears
at his face that was all compassion."Tell me about your cousin," he said; "are you going to marry him?"But in
that moment she could not have spoken anything but the truth to save her
soul.Lincoln," she said; "I was--but I did not love him.I--I think
that was one reason why he was so reckless.""The officer who happened to see Colonel Colfax captured is now in
Washington.When your name was given to me, I sent for him.Perhaps he
is in the anteroom now.I should like to tell you, first of all, that
this officer defended your cousin and asked me to pardon him."He strode to the bell-cord, and spoke a few
words to the usher who answered his ring.Then the door opened, and a young officer, spare,
erect, came quickly into the room, and bowed respectfully to the
President.He saw her lips part and the
color come flooding into her face.The President sighed But the light in her eyes was reflected in his own.It has been truly said that Abraham Lincoln knew the human heart.The officer still stood facing the President, the girl staring at his
profile.Lincoln,
"when you asked me to pardon Colonel Colfax, I believe that you told me
he was inside his own skirmish lines when he was captured."Suddenly Stephen turned, as if impelled by the President's gaze, and so
his eyes met Virginia's.He forgot time and place,--for the while even
this man whom he revered above all men.He saw her hand tighten on the
arm of her chair.He took a step toward her, and stopped."He put in a plea, a lawyer's plea, wholly unworthy of him, Miss
Virginia.He asked me to let your cousin off on a technicality.Just the exclamation escaped her--nothing more.The
crimson that had betrayed her deepened on her cheeks.Slowly the eyes
she had yielded to Stephen came back again and rested on the President.And now her wonder was that an ugly man could be so beautiful.Lawyer," the President continued, "that I
am not letting off Colonel Colfax on a technicality.I am sparing his
life," he said slowly, "because the time for which we have been waiting
and longing for four years is now at hand--the time to be merciful.She crossed the room, her head lifted, her heart
lifted, to where this man of sorrows stood smiling down at her.Lincoln," she faltered, "I did not know you when I came here.I
should have known you, for I had heard him--I had heard Major Brice
praise you.Oh," she cried, "how I wish that every man and woman and
child in the South might come here and see you as I have seen you
to-day.I think--I think that some of their bitterness might be taken
away."Abraham Lincoln laid his hands upon the girl.And Stephen, watching,
knew that he was looking upon a benediction.Lincoln, "I have not suffered by the South, I have
suffered with the South.Your sorrow has been my sorrow, and your pain
has been my pain.And what you have
gained," he added sublimely, "I have gained."The clouds were flying before the wind,
and a patch of blue sky shone above the Potomac.With his long arm he
pointed across the river to the southeast, and as if by a miracle a
shaft of sunlight fell on the white houses of Alexandria."In the first days of the war," he said, "a flag flew there in sight of
the place where George Washington lived and died.I used to watch
that flag, and thank God that Washington had not lived to see it.And
sometimes, sometimes I wondered if God had allowed it to be put in irony
just there.""I should have known that this was our punishment--that the sight of
it was my punishment.Before we could become the great nation He has
destined us to be, our sins must be wiped out in blood."I say in all sincerity, may you always love it.May the day come when
this Nation, North and South, may look back upon it with reverence.Thousands upon thousands of brave Americans have died under it for what
they believed was right.But may the day come again when you will love
that flag you see there now--Washington's flag--better still."He stopped, and the tears were wet upon Virginia's lashes.Lincoln went over to his desk and sat down before it.Then he began
to write, slouched forward, one knee resting on the floor, his lips
moving at the same time.When he got up again he seemed taller than
ever.he said, "I guess that will fix it.I'll have that sent to
Sherman.I have already spoken to him about the matter."He turned to Stephen
with that quizzical look on his face he had so often seen him wear."Steve," he said, "I'll tell you a story.The other night Harlan was
here making a speech to a crowd out of the window, and my boy Tad was
sitting behind him."'No,' says Tad, 'hang on to 'em.'That is what we intend to do,--hang on to 'em.Lincoln, putting his hand again on Virginia's
shoulder, "if you have the sense I think you have, you'll hang on, too."For an instant he stood smiling at their blushes,--he to whom the power
was given to set apart his cares and his troubles and partake of the
happiness of others.he said, "I am ten
minutes behind my appointment at the Department.Miss Virginia, you may
care to thank the Major for the little service he has done you.You can
do so undisturbed here.As he opened the door he paused and looked back at them.The smile
passed from his face, and an ineffable expression of longing--longing
and tenderness--came upon it.For a space, while his spell was upon them, they did not stir.Then
Stephen sought her eyes that had been so long denied him.It was Virginia who first found her voice, and she
called him by his name."Oh, Stephen," she said, "how sad he looked!"He was close to her, at her side.And he answered her in the earnest
tone which she knew so well."Virginia, if I could have had what I most wished for in the world, I
should have asked that you should know Abraham Lincoln."Then she dropped her eyes, and her breath came quickly."I--I might have known," she answered, "I might have known what he was.I had seen him in you, and I did not know.Do you remember that day when we were in the summer-house together at
Glencoe, long ago?"You were changed then," she said bravely."When I saw him," said Stephen, reverently, "I knew how little and
narrow I was."Then, overcome by the incense of her presence, he drew her to him until
her heart beat against his own.She did not resist, but lifted her face
to him, and he kissed her."Yes, Stephen," she answered, low, more wonderful in her surrender than
ever before.Then she hid her face against his blue coat.Oh, Stephen, how I have struggled against it!How I have tried to hate you, and couldn't.I tried to
insult you, I did insult you.And when I saw how splendidly you bore it,
I used to cry.""I loved you through it all," he said.She raised her head quickly, and awe was in her eyes."Because I dreamed of you," he answered."And those dreams used to linger
with me half the day as I went about my work.I used to think of them as
I sat in the saddle on the march.""I, too, treasured them," she said.Faintly, "I have no one but you--now."Once more he drew her to him, and she gloried in his strength."God help me to cherish you, dear," he said, "and guard you well."She drew away from him, gently, and turned toward the window."See, Stephen," she cried, "the sun has come out at last."For a while they were silent, looking out; the drops glistened on blade
and leaf, and the joyous new green of the earth entered into their
hearts.ANNAPOLIS

IT was Virginia's wish, and was therefore sacred.As for Stephen, he
little cared whither they went.And so they found themselves on that
bright afternoon in mid-April under the great trees that arch the
unpaved streets of old Annapolis.They stopped by direction at a gate, and behind it was a green cluster
of lilac bushes, which lined the walk to the big plum- house
which Lionel Carvel had built.Virginia remembered that down this walk
on a certain day in June, a hundred years agone, Richard Carvel had led
Dorothy Manners.They climbed the steps, tottering now with age and disuse, and Virginia
playfully raised the big brass knocker, brown now, that Scipio had been
wont to polish until it shone.Stephen took from his pocket the clumsy
key that General Carvel had given him, and turned it in the rusty lock.The door swung open, and Virginia stood in the hall of her ancestors.It was musty and damp this day as the day when Richard had come back
from England and found it vacant and his grandfather dead.But there,
at the parting of the stairs, was the triple-arched window which he had
described.Through it the yellow afternoon light was flooding now, even
as then, checkered by the branches in their first fringe of green.But
the tall clock which Lionel Carvel used to wind was at Calvert House,
with many another treasure.They went up the stairs, and reverently they walked over the bare
floors, their footfalls echoing through the silent house.A score of
scenes in her great-grandfather's life came to Virginia.Here was the
room--the cornet one at the back of the main building, which looked out
over the deserted garden--that had been Richard's mother's.She recalled
how he had stolen into it on that summer's day after his return, and had
flung open the shutters.They were open now, for their locks were off.The prie-dieu was gone, and the dresser.But the high bed was there,
stripped of its poppy counterpane and white curtains; and the steps by
which she had entered it.And next they went into the great square room that had been Lionel
Carvel's, and there, too, was the roomy bed on which the old gentleman
had lain with the gout, while Richard read to him from the Spectator.One side of it looked out on the trees in Freshwater Lane; and the other
across the roof of the low house opposite to where the sun danced on the
blue and white waters of the Chesapeake."Honey," said Virginia, as they stood in the deep recess of the window,
"wouldn't it be nice if we could live here always, away from the world?But you would never be content to do that," she said,
smiling reproachfully."You are the kind of man who must be in the midst
of things.In a little while you will have far more besides me to think
about."He was quick to catch the note of sadness in her voice."We all have our duty to perform in the world, dear," he answered."To think that I should have married a
Puritan!What would my great-great-great-great-grandfather say, who was
such a stanch Royalist?Why, I think I can see him frowning at me now,
from the door, in his blue velvet goat and silverlaced waistcoat.""He was well punished," retorted Stephen, "his own grandson was a Whig,
and seems to have married a woman of spirit.""I am sure that she did not allow my
great-grandfather to kiss her--unless she wanted to."And she looked up at him, half smiling, half pouting; altogether
bewitching."From what I hear of him, he was something of a man," said Stephen."I am glad that Marlborough Street isn't a crowded thoroughfare," said
Virginia.When they had seen the dining room, with its carved mantel and silver
door-knobs, and the ballroom in the wing, they came out, and Stephen
locked the door again.They walked around the house, and stood looking
down the terraces,--once stately, but crumbled now,--where Dorothy had
danced on the green on Richard's birthday.Beyond and below was the
spring-house, and there was the place where the brook dived under the
ruined wall,--where Dorothy had wound into her hair the lilies of the
valley before she sailed for London.The remains of a wall that had once held a balustrade marked the
outlines of the formal garden.The trim hedges, for seventy years
neglected, had grown incontinent.The garden itself was full of wild
green things coming up through the brown of last season's growth.But
in the grass the blue violets nestled, and Virginia picked some of these
and put them in Stephen's coat."You must keep them always," she said, "because we got them here."They spied a seat beside a hoary trunk.There on many a spring day
Lionel Carvel had sat reading his Gazette.The sun hung low over the old-world gables in the street beyond the
wall, and in the level rays was an apple tree dazzling white, like a
bride.The sweet fragrance which the day draws from the earth lingered
in the air."Stephen, do you remember that fearful afternoon of the panic, when you
came over from Anne Brinsmade's to reassure me?""But what made you think of it now?"But you were so strong, so calm,
so sure of yourself.I think that made me angry when I thought how
ridiculous I must have been."But do
you know what I had under my arm--what I was saving of all the things I
owned?""No," he answered; "but I have often wondered.""This house--this place made me think of it.It was Dorothy Manners's
gown, and her necklace.They were all the
remembrance I had of that night at Mr.Brinsmade's gate, when we came so
near to each other.""Virginia," he said, "some force that we cannot understand has brought
us together, some force that we could not hinder.It is foolish for me
to say so, but on that day of the slave auction, when I first saw you,
I had a premonition about you that I have never admitted until now, even
to myself.""Why, Stephen," she cried, "I felt the same way!""And then," he continued quickly, "it was strange that I should have
gone to Judge Whipple, who was an intimate of your father's--such a
singular intimate.And then came your party, and Glencoe, and that
curious incident at the Fair.""When I was talking to the Prince, and looked up and saw you among all
those people.""That was the most uncomfortable of all, for me.""Stephen," she said, stirring the leaves at her feet, "you might have
taken me in your arms the night Judge Whipple died--if you had wanted
to.I love you all the more for
that."Again she said:-- "It was through your mother, dearest, that we were
most strongly drawn together.I worshipped her from the day I saw her in
the hospital.I believe that was the beginning of my charity toward the
North.""My mother would have chosen you above all women, Virginia," he
answered.In the morning came to them the news of Abraham Lincoln's death.And the
same thought was in both their hearts, who had known him as it was given
to few to know him.How he had lived in sorrow; how he had died a martyr
on the very day of Christ's death upon the cross.And they believed that
Abraham Lincoln gave his life for his country even as Christ gave his
for the world.And so must we believe that God has reserved for this Nation a destiny
high upon the earth.Many years afterward Stephen Brice read again to his wife those sublime
closing words of the second inaugural:--

   "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the
   right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish
   the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him
   who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his children
   --to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace
   among ourselves and with all nations."AFTERWORD

The author has chosen St.Louis for the principal scene of this story
for many reasons.Grant and Sherman were living there before the Civil
War, and Abraham Lincoln was an unknown lawyer in the neighboring
state of Illinois.It has been one of the aims of this book to show the
remarkable contrasts in the lives of these great men who came out of the
West.Louis, which was founded by Laclede in 1765,
likewise became the principal meeting-place of two great streams of
emigration which had been separated, more or less, since Cromwell's day.To be sure, they were not all Cavaliers who settled in the tidewater
Colonies.There were Puritan settlements in both Maryland and Virginia.But the life in the Southern states took on the more liberal tinge which
had characterized that of the Royalists, even to the extent of affecting
the Scotch Calvinists, while the asceticism of the Roundheads was the
keynote of the Puritan character in New England.When this great country
of ours began to develop, the streams moved westward; one over what
became the plain states of Ohio and Indiana and Illinois, and the other
across the Blue Ridge Mountains into Kentucky and Tennessee.They mixed
along the line of the Ohio River.Louis, and, farther
west, in Kansas.The part played by
this people in the Civil War is a matter of history.The scope of this
book has not permitted the author to introduce the peasantry and trading
classes which formed the mass in this movement.But Richter, the type
of the university-bred revolutionist which emigrated after '48, is drawn
more or less from life.And the duel described actually took place in
Berlin.Louis is the author's birthplace, and his home, the home of those
friends whom he has known from childhood and who have always treated him
with unfaltering kindness.He begs that they will believe him when he
says that only such characters as he loves are reminiscent of those
he has known there.The city has a large population,--large enough to
include all the types that are to be found in the middle West.This book is written of a time when feeling ran high.It has been necessary to put strong speech into the mouths of the
characters.The breach that threatened our country's existence is healed
now.There is no side but Abraham Lincoln's side.And this side, with
all reverence and patriotism, the author has tried to take.Abraham Lincoln loved the South as well as the North."I bust right out crying, I do own, wen I hearn
          that, an' takin' his han' in mine, I tried to
          quiet him down a bit; telling him it wor bad fur
          his wownd to be so res'less (fur every time he
          tossed, thar kim a little leap o' blood from his
          breast); an' at last, about foore o'clock in the
          day, he opened his eyes quite sensible like, an'
          says to me, he says, 'Dear matey, is that you?Thank you fur coming to see me afore I die.'"'No, Bill, don't talk so,' I says, a strivin' to
          be cheerful like, tho' I seed death in his face,
          'You'll be well afore long.'"'Aye, well in heaven,' he says; and then, arter a
          minnit, 'Jerry,' he says, 'thar's a little bounty
          money as belongs to me in my knapsack, an' my
          month's wages.I want you, wen I am gone, to take
          it to my mother, an' tell her--'(he wor gaspin'
          fearful)--'as I died--fightin' fur my country--an'
          the flag.God bless you, Jerry--you hev been a
          good frien' to me, an' I knows as you'll do
          this--an' bid the boys good-by--fur me.'"I promised, wi' the tears streamin' down my
          cheeks; an' then we wor quiet a bit, fur it hurt
          Bill's breast to talk, an' I could not say a wured
          fur the choke in my throat.Arter a while he says,
          'Jerry, won't you sing me the hymn as I taught you
          aboard the transport?"I could hardly find v'ice to begin, but it wor
          Bill's dying wish, an' I made shift to sing as
          well as I could--

          "'We air marchin' on together
              To our etarnal rest;
           Niver askin' why we're ordered--
             For the Lord He knoweth best.is His word;
           Ranks all steady, muskets ready,
             In the army o' the Lord!"'Satan's hosts are all aroun' us,
             An' strive to enter in;
           But our outworks they are stronger
             Nor the dark brigades o' sin!Righteousness our sword;
           Truth the standard--in the vanguard--
             O' the army o' the Lord!"'Comrads, we air ever fightin'
             A battle fur the right;
           Ever on the on'ard movement
             Fur our home o' peace an' light.Heaven our reward,
          Comin' nearer, shinin' clearer--
             In the army o' the Lord!'"Arter I hed sung the hymn--an' it wor all I could
          do to get through--Bill seemed to be a sight
          easier.He lay still, smilin' like a child on the
          mother's breast.Pretty soon arter, the Major kim
          in; an' wen he seed Bill lookin' so peaceful, he
          says, says he, 'Why, cheer up, my lad!the sugeon
          sayd as how you wor in a bad way; but you look
          finely now;'--fur he didn't know it wor the death
          look coming over him.'You'll be about soon,'
          says the Major, 'an' fightin' fur the flag as
          brave as ever,'

          "Bill didn't say nothing--he seemed to be getting
          wild agin;--an' looked stupid like at our Major
          till he hearn the wureds about the flag.Then he
          caught his breath suddint like, an', afore we
          could stop him, he had sprang to his feet--shakin'
          to an' fro like a reed--but as straight as he ever
          wor on parade; an', his v'ice all hoarse an' full
          o' death, an' his arm in the air, he shouted,
          'Aye!we'll fight fur it
          till--' an' then we hearn a sort o' snap, an' he
          fell forred--dead!"We buried him that night, I an' my mates.I cut
          off a lock o' his hair fur his poor mother, afore
          we put the airth over him; an' giv it to her, wi'
          poor Bill's money, faithful an' true, wen we kim
          home.I've lived to be an old man since then, an'
          see the Major go afore me, as I hoped to sarve
          till my dyin' day; but Lord willing I shel go
          next, to win the Salwation as I've fitten for, by
          Bill's side, a sojer in Christ's army, in the
          Etarnal Jerusalem!"The boys took a long breath when Jerry had finished his story, and more
than one bright eye was filled with tears.The rough words, and plain,
unpolished manner of the old soldier, only heightened the impression
made by his story; and as he rose to go away, evidently much moved by
the painful recollections it excited, there was a hearty, "Thank you,
sergeant, for your story--it was real good!"Jerry only touched his cap
to the young soldiers, and marched off hastily, while the boys looked
after him in respectful silence.But young spirits soon recover from
gloomy influences, and in a few moments they were all chattering merrily
again."What a pity we must go home Monday!"cried Louie; "I wish we could camp
out forever!Oh, Freddy, do write a letter to General McClellan, and ask
him to let us join the army right away!Tell him we'll buy some new
india-rubber back-bones and stretch ourselves out big directly, if he'll
only send right on for us!""Perhaps he would, if he knew how jolly we can drill already!""I tell you what, boys, the very thing!let's have a
review before we go home.I'll ask all the boys and girls I know to come
and look on, and we might have quite a grand entertainment.We can march about all over, and fire off the cannons and
everything!"Yes, but how's General McClellan to hear anything about it?""Why--I don't know," said Peter, rather taken aback by this view of the
subject."Well, somehow--never mind, it will be grand fun, and I mean
to ask my father right away."Finally it was
concluded that it might make more impression on Mr.Schermerhorn's mind,
if the application came from the regiment in a body; so, running for
their swords and guns, officers and men found their places in the
battalion, and the grand procession started on its way--chattering all
the time, in utter defiance of that "article of war" which forbids
"talking in the ranks."Just as they were passing the lake, they heard
carriage wheels crunching on the gravel, and drew up in a long line on
the other side of the road to let the vehicle pass them; much to the
astonishment of two pretty young ladies and a sweet little girl, about
Freddy's age, who were leaning comfortably back in the handsome
barouche.exclaimed one of the ladies, "what in the world is all
this?"cried Peter, running up to the carriage, "why, these are the
Dashahed Zouaves, Miss Carlton.Good morning, Miss Jessie," to the little girl on the front seat, who
was looking on with deep interest."Oh, to be sure, I remember," said Miss Carlton, laughing; "come,
introduce the Zouaves, Peter; we are wild to know them!"The boys clustered eagerly about the carriage and a lively chat took
place.The Zouaves, some blushing and bashful, others frank and
confident, and all desperately in love already with pretty little
Jessie, related in high glee their adventures--except the celebrated
court martial--and enlarged glowingly upon the all-important subject of
the grand review.Colonel Freddy, of course, played a prominent part in all this, and with
his handsome face, bright eyes, and frank, gentlemanly ways, needed only
those poor lost curls to be a perfect picture of a soldier.He chattered
away with Miss Lucy, the second sister, and obtained her special promise
that she would plead their cause with Mr.Schermerhorn in case the
united petitions of the corps should fail.The young ladies did not know
of Mrs.Schermerhorn's departure, but Freddy and Peter together coaxed
them to come up to the house "anyhow."The carriage was accordingly
taken into the procession, and followed it meekly to the house; the
Zouaves insisting on being escort, much to the terror of the young
ladies; who were in constant apprehension that the rear rank and the
horses might come to kicks--not to say blows--and the embarrassment of
the coachman; who, as they were constantly stopping unexpectedly to turn
round and talk, didn't know "where to have them," as the saying is.However, they reached their destination in safety before long, and
found Mr.Schermerhorn seated on the piazza.He hastened forward to meet
them, with the cordial greeting of an old friend."Well, old bachelor," said Miss Carlton, gayly, as the young ladies
ascended the steps, "you see we have come to visit you in state, with
the military escort befitting patriotic young ladies who have four
brothers on the Potomac."Gone to Niagara and left me a 'lone lorn creetur;'" said Mr."Basely deserted me when my farming couldn't be
left.But how am I to account for the presence of the military,
mademoiselle?""Really, I beg their pardons," exclaimed Miss Carlton."They have come
on a special deputation to you, Mr.Schermerhorn, so pray don't let us
interrupt business."Thus apostrophised, the boys scampered eagerly up the steps; and Freddy,
a little bashful, but looking as bright as a button, delivered the
following brief oration: "Mr.Schermerhorn: I want--that is, the boys
want--I mean we all want--to have a grand review on Saturday, and ask
our friends to look on.Schermerhorn,
smiling; "but what will become of you good people when I tell you that
I have just received a letter from Mrs.Schermerhorn, asking me to join
her this week instead of next, and bring Peter with me."interrupted Peter; "can't you tell ma
I've joined the army for the war?"No, the army
must give you up, and lose a valuable member, Master Peter; but just
have the goodness to listen a moment.The review shall take place, but
as the camp will have to break up on Saturday instead of Monday, as I
had intended, the performances must come off to-morrow.The boys gave a delighted consent to this arrangement, and now the only
thing which dampened their enjoyment was the prospect of such a speedy
end being put to their camp life.what was the fun for a
fellow to be poked into a stupid watering place, where he must bother to
keep his hair parted down the middle, and a clean collar stiff enough to
choke him on from morning till night?"as Tom indignantly remarked to
George and Will the same evening."The fact is, this sort of thing is
_the_ thing for a _man_ after all!"an opinion in which the other _men_
fully concurred.But let us return to the piazza, where we have left the party.After a
few moments more spent in chatting with Mr.Schermerhorn, it was decided
to accept Colonel Freddy's polite invitation, which he gave with such a
bright little bow, to inspect the camp.You may be sure it was in
apple-pie order, for Jerry, who had taken the Zouaves under his special
charge, insisted on their keeping it in such a state of neatness as only
a soldier ever achieved.The party made an extremely picturesque
group--the gay uniforms of the Zouaves, and light summer dresses of the
ladies, charmingly relieved against the background of trees; while Mr.Schermerhorn's stately six feet, and somewhat portly proportions, quite
reminded one of General Scott; especially among such a small army; in
which George alone quite came up to the regulation "63 inches."Little Jessie ran hither and thither, surrounded by a crowd of adorers,
who would have given their brightest buttons, every "man" of them, to be
the most entertaining fellow of the corps.They showed her the battery
and the stacks of shining guns--made to stand up by Jerry in a wonderful
fashion that the boys never could hope to attain--the inside of all the
tents, and the smoke guard house (Tom couldn't help a blush as he looked
in); and finally, as a parting compliment (which, let me tell you, is
the greatest, in a boy's estimation, that can possibly be paid), Freddy
made her a present of his very largest and most gorgeous "glass agates;"
one of which was all the colors of the rainbow, and the other
patriotically adorned with the Stars and Stripes in enamel.Peter
climbed to the top of the tallest cherry tree, and brought her down a
bough at least a yard and a half long, crammed with "ox hearts;" Harry
eagerly offered to make any number of "stunning baskets" out of the
stones, and in short there never was such a belle seen before."Oh, a'int she jolly!"was the ruling opinion among the Zouaves.A
private remark was also circulated to the effect that "Miss Jessie was
stunningly pretty."The young ladies at last said good-by to the camp; promising faithfully
to send all the visitors they could to the grand review, and drove off
highly entertained with their visit.Schermerhorn decided to take
the afternoon boat for the city and return early Friday morning, and the
boys, left to themselves, began to think of dinner, as it was two
o'clock.A brisk discussion was kept up all dinner time you may be sure,
concerning the event to come off on the morrow."I should like to know, for my part, what we do in a review," said
Jimmy, balancing his fork artistically on the end of his finger, and
looking solemnly round the table."March about,
and form into ranks and columns, and all that first, then do charming
"parade rest," "'der humps!"and the rest of it; and finish off by
firing off our guns, and showing how we can't hit anything by any
possibility!""But I'm sure father won't let us have any powder," said Peter
disconsolately."You can't think how I burnt the end of my nose last
Fourth with powder!It was so sore I couldn't blow it for a week!"The boys all burst out laughing at this dreadful disaster, and George
said, "You weren't lighting it with the end of your nose, were you?""No; but I was stooping over, charging one of my cannon, and I dropped
the 'punk' right in the muzzle somehow, and, would you believe it, the
nasty thing went off and burnt my nose!and father said I shouldn't play
with powder any more, because I might have put out my eyes.""Well, we must take it out in marching, then," said Freddy, with a
tremendous sigh."No, hold on; I'll tell you what we can do!""I have
some 'double headers' left from the Fourth; we might fire them out of
the cannon; they make noise enough, I'm sure.I'll write to my mother
this afternoon and get them."The boys couldn't help being struck with the generosity of this offer,
coming from Tom after their late rather unkind treatment of him; and the
older ones especially were very particular to thank him for his present.As soon as dinner was over, he started for the house to ask Mr.As he hurried along the road, his
bright black eyes sparkling with the happiness of doing a good action,
he heard trotting steps behind him, felt an arm stealing round his neck,
schoolboy fashion, and there was Freddy."I ran after you all the way," he pantingly said."I want to tell you,
dear Tom, how much we are obliged to you for giving us your crackers,
and how sorry we are that we acted so rudely to you the other day.Please forgive us; we all like you so much, and we would feel as mean as
anything to take your present without begging pardon.George, Peter, and
I feel truly ashamed of ourselves every time we think of that abominable
court martial.""There, old fellow, don't say a word more about it!"was the hearty
response; and Tom threw his arm affectionately about his companion."It
was my fault, Freddy, and all because I was mad at poor old Jerry; how
silly!I was sorry for what I said right afterward.""Yes; I'll like you as long as I live!And so
we will leave the two on their walk to the house, and close this
abominably long chapter.THERE are really scarcely words enough in the dictionary properly to
describe the immense amount of drill got through with by the Dashahed
Zouaves between three o'clock that afternoon and twelve, noon, of the
following day.This Friday afternoon was going to be memorable in
history for one of the most splendid reviews on record.They almost ran
poor old Jerry off his legs in their eagerness to go over every possible
variety of exercise known to "Hardee's Tactics," and nearly dislocated
their shoulder blades trying to waggle their elbows backward and forward
all at once when they went at "double quick;" at the same time keeping
the other arm immovably pinioned to their sides.Then that wonderful
operation of stacking the rebellious guns, which obstinately clattered
down nine times and a half out of ten, had to be gone through with, and
a special understanding promulgated in the corps as to when Jerry's
"'der arms!"meant "shoulder arms," and when "order arms" (or bringing
all the muskets down together with a bang); and, in short, there never
was such a busy time seen in camp before.Friday morning dawned, if possible, still more splendidly than any of
the preceding days, with a cool, refreshing breeze, just enough snowy
clouds in the sky to keep off the fiery summer heat in a measure, and
not a headache nor a heartache among the Zouaves to mar the pleasure of
the day.The review was to come off at four o'clock, when the July sun
would be somewhat diminished in warmth, and from some hints that Jerry
let fall, Mrs.Lockitt, and the fat cook, Mrs.Mincemeat, were holding
high council up at the house, over a certain collation to be partaken of
at the end of the entertainments.As the day wore on the excitement of our friends the Zouaves increased.They could hardly either eat their dinners, or sit down for more than a
moment at a time; and when, about three o'clock, Mr.Schermerhorn
entered the busy little camp, he was surrounded directly with a crowd of
eager questioners, all talking at once, and making as much noise as a
colony of rooks."Patience, patience, my good friends!"Schermerhorn, holding
up a finger for silence.Tom, here are your 'double
headers,' with love from your mother.Fred, I saw your father to-day,
and they are all coming down to the review.George, here is a note left
for you in my box at the Post Office, and Dashahed Zouaves in
general--I have one piece of advice to give you.Get dressed quietly,
and then sit down and rest yourselves.You will be tired out by the end
of the afternoon, at all events; so don't frisk about more than you can
help at present;" and Mr.Schermerhorn left the camp; while the boys,
under strong pressure of Jerry, and the distant notes of a band which
suddenly began to make itself heard, dressed themselves as nicely as
they could, and sat down with heroic determination to wait for four
o'clock.Presently, carriages began to crunch over the gravel road one after
another, filled with merry children, and not a few grown people besides.Jourdain, with Bella, were among the first to arrive; and
soon after the Carltons' barouche drove up.Jessie, for some unknown
reason, was full of half nervous glee, and broke into innumerable little
trilling laughs when any one spoke to her.A sheet of lilac note paper,
folded up tight, which she held in her hand, seemed to have something to
do with it, and her soft brown curls and spreading muslin skirts were in
equal danger of irremediable "mussing," as she fidgetted about on the
carriage seat, fully as restless as any of the Zouaves.Schermerhorn received his guests on the piazza, where all the chairs
in the house, one would think, were placed for the company, as the best
view of the lawn was from this point.To the extreme right were the
white tents of the camp, half hidden by the immense trunk of a
magnificent elm, the only tree that broke the smooth expanse of the
lawn.On the left a thick hawthorne hedge separated the ornamental
grounds from the cultivated fields of the place, while in front the view
was bounded by the blue and sparkling waters of the Sound.Soon four o'clock struck; and, punctual to the moment, the Zouaves could
be seen in the distance, forming their ranks.Jerry, in his newest suit
of regimentals, bustled about here and there, and presently his voice
was heard shouting, "Are ye all ready now?and to
the melodious notes of "Dixie," performed by the band, which was
stationed nearer the house, the regiment started up the lawn!Jerry
marching up beside them, and occasionally uttering such mysterious
mandates as, "Easy in the centre!Oh, what a burst of delighted applause greeted them as they neared the
house!The boys hurrahed, the girls clapped their hands, ladies and
gentlemen waved their hats and handkerchiefs; while the Dashahed
Zouaves, too soldierly _now_ to grin, drew up in a long line, and stood
like statues, without so much as winking.And now the music died away, and everybody was as still as a mouse,
while Jerry advanced to the front, and issued the preliminary order:

"To the rear--open order!"and the rear rank straightway fell back;
executing, in fact, that wonderful "tekkinapesstoth'rare" which had
puzzled them so much on the first day of their drilling.Then came those
other wonderful orders:

          "P'_sent_ humps!And so on, at which the muskets flew backward and forward, up and down,
with such wonderful precision.The spectators were delighted beyond
measure; an enthusiastic young gentleman, with about three hairs on
each side of his mustache, who belonged to the Twenty-second Regiment,
declared "It was the best drill he had seen out of his company room!"a
celebrated artist, whose name I dare not tell for the world, sharpened
his pencil, and broke the point off three times in his hurry, and at
last produced the beautiful sketch which appears at the front of this
volume; while all the little boys who were looking on, felt as if they
would give every one of their new boots and glass agates to belong to
the gallant Dashahed Zouaves.[Illustration: "DOUBLE-QUICK."]After the guns had been put in every possible variety of position, the
regiment went through their marching.They broke into companies,
formed the line again, divided in two equal parts, called "breaking into
platoons," showed how to "wheel on the right flank," and all manner of
other mysteries.Finally, they returned to their companies, and on Jerry's giving the
order, they started at "double quick" (which is the most comical
tritty-trot movement you can think of), dashed down the <DW72> of the
lawn, round the great elm, up hill again full speed, and in a moment
more were drawn up in unbroken lines before the house, and standing once
again like so many statues.Round after round of applause greeted the
Zouaves, who kept their positions for a moment, then snatching off
their saucy little fez caps, they gave the company three cheers in
return, of the most tremendous description; which quite took away the
little remaining breath they had after the "double quick."Thus ended the first part of the review; and now, with the assistance of
their rather Lilliputian battery, and Tom's double headers, they went
through some firing quite loud enough to make the little girls start and
jump uncomfortably; so this part of the entertainment was brought to
rather a sudden conclusion.Jerry had just issued the order, "Close up
in ranks to dismiss," when Mr.Schermerhorn, who, with Miss Carlton and
Jessie, had left the piazza a few minutes before, came forward, saying,
"Have the goodness to wait a moment, Colonel; there is one more ceremony
to go through with."The boys looked at each other in silent curiosity, wondering what could
be coming; when, all at once, the chairs on the piazza huddled back in a
great hurry, to make a lane for a beautiful little figure, which came
tripping from the open door.It was Jessie; but a great change had been made in her appearance.Over
her snowy muslin skirts she had a short classic tunic of red, white, and
blue silk; a wreath of red and white roses and bright blue jonquils
encircled her curls, and in her hand she carried a superb banner.It
was made of dark blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe; on one side was
painted an American eagle, and on the other the words "Dashahed
Zouaves," surrounded with a blaze of glory and gold stars.She advanced
to the edge of the piazza, and in a clear, sweet voice, a little
tremulous, but very distinct, she said:

          "COLONEL AND BRAVE SOLDIERS:

          "I congratulate you, in the name of our friends,
          on the success you have achieved.You have shown
          us to-day what Young America can do; and as a
          testimonial of our high admiration, I present you
          the colors of your regiment!"Take them, as the assurance that our hearts are
          with you; bear them as the symbol of the Cause you
          have enlisted under; and should you fall beneath
          them on the field of battle, I bid you lay down
          your lives cheerfully for the flag of your
          country, and breathe with your last sigh the name
          of the Union!Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and the great tears swelled to his eyes as
he advanced to take the flag which Jessie held toward him.And now our
little Colonel came out bright, sure enough.Perhaps not another member
of the regiment, called upon to make a speech in this way, could have
thought of a word to reply; but Freddy's quick wit supplied him with
the right ideas; and it was with a proud, happy face, and clear voice
that he responded:

          "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

          "I thank you, in the name of my regiment, for the
          honor you have done us.Inspired by your praises,
          proud to belong to the army of the Republic, we
          hope to go on as we have begun.To your kindness
          we owe the distinguishing colors under which we
          march hereafter; and by the Union for which we
          fight, they shall never float over a retreating
          battalion!"the cheers and clapping of hands which followed this little speech!Everybody was looking at Freddy as he stood there, the colors in his
hand, and the bright flush on his cheek, with the greatest admiration.Of course, his parents weren't proud of him; certainly not!But the wonders were not at an end yet; for suddenly the band began
playing a new air, and to this accompaniment, the sweet voice of some
lady unseen, but which sounded to those who knew, wonderfully like Miss
Lucy Carlton's, sang the following patriotic ballad:

          "We will stand by our Flag--let it lead where it will--
          Our hearts and our hopes fondly cling to it still;
          Through battle and danger our Cause must be won--
          Yet forward!still unsullied and bright,
          As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night
          And the standard that guides us forever shall be
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"A handful of living--an army of dead,
          The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;
          What is it--as sad we retreat from the plain
          That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?to our country God-given,
          That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear
          In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;
          Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,
          And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.every star in it glows,
          The terror of traitors!And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,
          'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"As the song ended, there was another tumult of applause; and then the
band struck up a lively quickstep, and the company, with the Zouaves
marching ahead, poured out on the lawn toward the camp, where a
bountiful collation was awaiting them, spread on the regimental table.Two splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented the centre, and all manner
of "goodies," as the children call them, occupied every inch of space on
the sides.At the head of the table Jerry had contrived a canopy from a
large flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie, Colonel Freddy, with the
other officers, and some favored young ladies of their own age, took
their seats.The other children found places around the table, and a
merrier fete champetre never was seen.The band continued to play lively
airs from time to time, and I really can give you my word as an author,
that nobody looked cross for a single minute!Between you and me, little reader, there had been a secret arrangement
among the grown folks interested in the regiment, to get all this up in
such fine style.Every one had contributed something to give the Zouaves
their flag and music, while to Mr.Schermerhorn it fell to supply the
supper; and arrangements had been made and invitations issued since the
beginning of the week.The regiment, certainly, had the credit, however,
of getting up the review, it only having been the idea of their good
friends to have the entertainment and flag presentation.So there was a
pleasant surprise on both sides; and each party in the transaction, was
quite as much astonished and delighted as the other could wish.The long sunset shadows were rapidly stealing over the velvet sward as
the company rose from table, adding a new charm to the beauty of the
scene.Everywhere the grass was dotted with groups of elegant ladies and
gentlemen, and merry children, in light summer dresses and quaintly
pretty uniforms.The little camp, with the stacks of guns down its
centre, the bayonets flashing in the last rays of the sun, was all
crowded and brilliant with happy people; looking into the tents and
admiring their exquisite order, inspecting the bright muskets, and
listening eagerly or good-humoredly, as they happened to be children or
grown people, to the explanations and comments of the Zouaves.And on the little grassy knoll, where the flag staff was planted,
central figure of the scene, stood Colonel Freddy, silent and thoughtful
for the first time to-day, with Jerry beside him.The old man had
scarcely left his side since the boy took the flag; he would permit no
one else to wait upon him at table, and his eyes followed him as he
moved among the gay crowd, with a glance of the utmost pride and
affection.The old volunteer seemed to feel that the heart of a soldier
beat beneath the little dandy ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of the
young Colonel.Suddenly, the boy snatches up again the regimental
colors; the Stars and Stripes, and little Jessie's flag, and shakes
them out to the evening breeze; and as they flash into view and once
more the cheers of the Zouaves greet their colors, he says, with
quivering lip and flashing eye, "Jerry, if God spares me to be a man,
I'll live and die a soldier!"The soft evening light was deepening into night, and the beautiful
planet Venus rising in the west, when the visitors bade adieu to the
camp; the Zouaves were shaken hands with until their wrists fairly
ached; and then they all shook hands with "dear" Jessie, as Charley was
heard to call her before the end of the day, and heard her say in her
soft little voice how sorry she was they must go to-morrow (though she
certainly couldn't have been sorrier than _they_ were), and then the
good people all got into their carriages again, and drove off; waving
their handkerchiefs for good-by as long as the camp could be seen; and
so, with the sound of the last wheels dying away in the distance, ended
the very end of

                                THE GRAND REVIEW.AND now, at last, had come that "day of disaster," when Camp McClellan
must be deserted.The very sun didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,
thought the Zouaves; and it was positively certain that the past five
days, although they had occurred in the middle of summer, were the very
shortest ever known!Eleven o'clock was the hour appointed for the
breaking up of the camp, in order that they might return to the city by
the early afternoon boat."Is it possible we have been here a week?"exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat
down to breakfast."It seems as if we had only come yesterday.""What a jolly time it has been!""I don't want
to go to Newport a bit."To Baltimore--but I don't mean to Secesh!"added Tom, with a little
blush."I have a cousin in the Palmetto Guards at Charleston, and that's
one too many rebels in the family."cried George Chadwick; "the Pringles are a first rate
family; the rest of you are loyal enough, I'm sure!"and George gave
Tom such a slap on the back, in token of his good will, that it quite
brought the tears into his eyes.When breakfast was over, the Zouaves repaired to their tents, and
proceeded to pack their clothes away out of the lockers.They were not
very scientific packers, and, in fact, the usual mode of doing the
business was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy into their valises, and
then jump on them until they consented to come together and be locked.Presently Jerry came trotting down with a donkey cart used on the farm,
and under his directions the boys folded their blankets neatly up, and
placed them in the vehicle, which then drove off with its load, leaving
them to get out and pile together the other furnishings of the tents;
for, of course, as soldiers, they were expected to wind up their own
affairs, and we all know that boys will do considerable _hard work_ when
it comes in the form of _play_.Just as the cart, with its vicious
little wrong-headed steed, had tugged, and jerked, and worried itself
out of sight, a light basket carriage, drawn by two dashing black
Canadian ponies, drew up opposite the camp, and the reins were let fall
by a young lady in a saucy "pork pie" straw hat, who was driving--no
other than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside her.The boys eagerly
surrounded the little carriage, and Miss Carlton said, laughing, "Jessie
begged so hard for a last look at the camp, that I had to bring her."Really," repeated Freddy; "but I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie, just
in time to see us off.""You know soldiers take themselves away houses and all," said George;
"you will see the tents come down with a run presently."As he spoke, the donkey
cart rattled up, and Jerry, touching his cap to the ladies, got out, and
prepared to superintend the downfall of the tents.By his directions,
two of the Zouaves went to each tent, and pulled the stakes first from
one corner, then the other; then they grasped firmly the pole which
supported the centre, and when the sergeant ejaculated "Now!"the tents slid smoothly to the ground all at the same moment,
just as you may have made a row of blocks fall down by upsetting the
first one.And now came the last ceremony, the hauling down of the flag.shouted Jerry, and instantly a company was
detached, who brought the six little cannon under the flagstaff, and
charged them with the last of the double headers, saved for this
purpose; Freddy stood close to the flagstaff, with the halyards ready in
his hands.and the folds of the flag stream out proudly in the breeze, as it
rapidly descends the halyards, and flutters softly to the greensward.There was perfectly dead silence for a moment; then the voice of Mr.Schermerhorn was heard calling, "Come, boys, are you ready?Jump in,
then, it is time to start for the boat."The boys turned and saw the
carriages which had brought them so merrily to the camp waiting to
convey them once more to the wharf; while a man belonging to the farm
was rapidly piling the regimental luggage into a wagon.With sorrowful faces the Zouaves clustered around the pretty pony
chaise; shaking hands once more with Jessie, and internally vowing to
adore her as long as they lived.Then they got into the carriages, and
old Jerry grasped Freddy's hand with an affectionate "Good-by, my little
Colonel, God bless ye!Old Jerry won't never forget your noble face as
long as he lives."It would have seemed like insulting the old man to
offer him money in return for his loving admiration, but the handsome
gilt-edged Bible that found its way to him soon after the departure of
the regiment, was inscribed with the irregular schoolboy signature of
"Freddy Jourdain, with love to his old friend Jeremiah Pike."As for the regimental standards, they were found to be rather beyond
the capacity of a rockaway crammed full of Zouaves, so Tom insisted on
riding on top of the baggage, that he might have the pleasure of
carrying them all the way.Up he mounted, as brisk as a lamplighter,
with that monkey, Peter, after him, the flags were handed up, and with
three ringing cheers, the vehicles started at a rapid trot, and the
regiment was fairly off.They almost broke their necks leaning back to
see the last of "dear Jessie," until the locusts hid them from sight,
when they relapsed into somewhat dismal silence for full five minutes.As Peter was going on to Niagara with his father, Mr.Schermerhorn
accompanied the regiment to the city, which looked dustier and red
brickier (what a word!)than ever, now that they were fresh from the
lovely green of the country.Schermerhorn's advice, the party
took possession of two empty Fifth avenue stages which happened to be
waiting at the Fulton ferry, and rode slowly up Broadway to Chambers
street, where Peter and his father bid them good-by, and went off to the
depot.As Peter had declined changing his clothes before he left, they
had to travel all the way to Buffalo with our young friend in this
unusual guise; but, as people had become used to seeing soldiers
parading about in uniform, they didn't seem particularly surprised,
whereat Master Peter was rather disappointed.To go back to the Zouaves, however.When the stages turned into Fifth
avenue, they decided to get out; and after forming their ranks in fine
style, they marched up the avenue, on the sidewalk this time, stopping
at the various houses or street corners where they must bid adieu to one
and another of their number, promising to see each other again as soon
as possible.At last only Tom and Freddy were left to go home by themselves.As they
marched along, keeping faultless step, Freddy exclaimed, "I tell you
what, Tom!I mean to ask my father, the minute he comes home, to let me
go to West Point as soon as I leave school!I must be a soldier--I
can't think of anything else!""That's just what I mean to do!"cried Tom, with sparkling eyes; "and,
Fred, if you get promoted before me, promise you will have me in your
regiment, won't you?"answered Freddy; "but you're the oldest, Tom,
and, you know, the oldest gets promoted first; so mind you don't forget
me when you come to your command!"As he spoke, they reached his own home; and our hero, glad after all to
come back to father, mother, and sister, bounded up the steps, and rang
the bell good and _hard_, just to let Joseph know that a personage of
eminence had arrived.As the door opened, he turned gayly round, cap in
hand, saying, "Good-by, Maryland; you've left the regiment, but you'll
never leave the Union!"and the last words he heard Tom say were, "No,
by George, _never_!"*       *       *       *       *

And now, dear little readers, my boy friends in particular, the history
of Freddy Jourdain must close.He still lives in New York, and attends
Dr.Larned's school, where he is at the head of all his classes.The Dashahed Zouaves have met very often since the encampment, and had
many a good drill in their room--the large attic floor which Mr.Jourdain allowed them for their special accommodation, and where the
beautiful regimental colors are carefully kept, to be proudly displayed
in every parade of the Zouaves.When he is sixteen, the boy Colonel is to enter West Point Academy, and
learn to be a real soldier; while Tom--poor Tom, who went down to
Baltimore that pleasant July month, promising so faithfully to join
Freddy in the cadet corps, may never see the North again.And in conclusion let me say, that should our country again be in danger
in after years, which God forbid, we may be sure that first in the
field, and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant
young friend,

                                 COLONEL FREDDY.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of "Colonel
Freddy," and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed
and breathless interest.George and Helen couldn't help jumping up off
their seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when
anything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful
story that was seen "before it was printed," and a great many "oh's" and
"ah's" testified to their appreciation of the gallant "Dashahed
Zouaves."They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true
story of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had
been read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang
up once more, exclaiming; "Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,
mayn't I recruit a regiment and camp out too?"cried his sister; "I wish I had been Jessie; what a
pity it wasn't all true!""And what if I should tell you," said their mother, laughing, "that a
little bird has whispered in my ear that 'Colonel Freddy' was
wonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?""Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!"The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more
questions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time
they paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg
her to let them drive over to Mr.R----'s place, and find out all about
it.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at
last one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more
stories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,
which looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; "Aunt Fanny's
daughter hasn't forgotten us, after all!"and dressing himself in a
double quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,
forgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of
lightning and began pummelling on his sister's door with both fists;
shouting, "Come, get up!here's another Sock story for
us!"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen's
stockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to
their places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the
wrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the
whole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored
maxim, "The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;" George, meanwhile,
performing a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his
father opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down
stairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to
examine this second instalment of the Sock stories.They found it was
again a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read
"GERMAN SOCKS.""These must be more stories like that
dear 'Little White Angel.'"And so they proved to be; for, on their mother's commencing to read the
first story, it was found to be called, "God's Pensioners;" and
commenced, "It was a cold--" but stop!This book was to be devoted
to "Colonel Freddy;" but if you will only go to Mr.Leavitt's, the
publishers, you will there discover what was the rest of the second Sock
Stories.*       *       *       *       *

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Red, White, Blue Socks.In fact, it is on his
account that I am making these inquiries.""Ah, the gentleman of the pantuflos, whose trousers will not remain!Truly he has the ambition excessif to arrive
from the bed to go to the work without the dress or the wash.But," in
recognition of Grey's half serious impatience, "remain tranquil.The friend of my friend is ever the
same as my friend!He is truly not seducing to the eye, but without
doubt he will arrive a governor or a senator in good time.I shall gif
to him my second cousin.He attempted to rise, but was held down and vigorously shaken by Grey."I've half a mind to let you do it, and get chucked through the window
for your pains," said the editor, with a half laugh.This
is a more serious matter than you suppose."And Grey briefly recounted the incident of the mysterious attacks on
Starbottle and Richards.As he proceeded he noticed, however, that
the ironical light died out of Enriquez's eyes, and a singular
thoughtfulness, yet unlike his usual precise gravity, came over his
face.He twirled the ends of his penciled mustache--an unfailing sign of
Enriquez's emotion."The same accident that arrive to two men that shall be as opposite as
the gallant Starbottle and the excellent Richards shall not prove that
it come from Ramierez, though they both were at the fonda," he said
gravely."The cause of it have not come to-day, nor yesterday, nor
last week.The cause of it have arrive before there was any gallant
Starbottle or excellent Richards; before there was any American in
California--before you and I, my leetle brother, have lif!The cause
happen first--TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO!"The editor's start of impatient incredulity was checked by the
unmistakable sincerity of Enriquez's face."It is so," he went on
gravely; "it is an old story--it is a long story.I shall make him
short--and new."He stopped and lit a cigarette without changing his odd expression."It was when the padres first have the mission, and take the heathen and
convert him--and save his soul.It was their business, you comprehend,
my Pancho?The more heathen they convert, the more soul they save, the
better business for their mission shop.But the heathen do not always
wish to be 'convert;' the heathen fly, the heathen skidaddle, the
heathen will not remain, or will backslide.So the
holy fathers make a little game.You do not of a possibility comprehend
how the holy fathers make a convert, my leetle brother?"They take from the presidio five or six
dragons--you comprehend--the cavalry soldiers, and they pursue the
heathen from his little hut.When they cannot surround him and he fly,
they catch him with the lasso, like the wild hoss.The lasso catch
him around the neck; he is obliged to remain.Sometime he is dead, but the soul is save!I
see you wrinkle the brow--you flash the eye; you like it not?Believe
me, I like it not, neither, but it is so!"He shrugged his shoulders, threw away his half smoked cigarette, and
went on."One time a padre who have the zeal excessif for the saving of soul,
when he find the heathen, who is a young girl, have escape the soldiers,
he of himself have seize the lasso and flung it!He is lucky; he catch
her--but look you!She not only fly, but of
a surety she drag the good padre with her!He cannot loose himself, for
his riata is fast to the saddle; the dragons cannot help, for he is drag
so fast.On the instant she have gone--and so have the padre.It is not a young girl he have lasso, but the devil!You comprehend--it
is a punishment--a retribution--he is feenish!"For every year he must come back a spirit--on a spirit hoss--and swing
the lasso, and make as if to catch the heathen.He is condemn ever to
play his little game; now there is no heathen more to convert, he catch
what he can.My grandfather have once seen him--it is night and a storm,
and he pass by like a flash!My grandfather like it not--he is much
dissatisfied!My uncle have seen him, too, but he make the sign of
the cross, and the lasso have fall to the side, and my uncle have much
gratification.A vaquero of my father and a peon of my cousin have both
been picked up, lassoed, and dragged dead."Many peoples have died of him in the strangling.Sometime he is seen,
sometime it is the woman only that one sees--sometime it is but the
hoss.Of a truth, my friend, the
gallant Starbottle and the ambitious Richards have just escaped!"There was not the slightest
suggestion of mischief or irony in his tone or manner; nothing, indeed,
but a sincerity and anxiety usually rare with his temperament.It struck
him also that his speech had but little of the odd California slang
which was always a part of his imitative levity."Do you mean to say that this superstition is well known?"It is not more difficult to comprehend than your story."With it he seemed to have put on his old
levity."Come, behold, it is a long time between drinks!Let us to the
hotel and the barkeep, who shall give up the smash of brandy and the
julep of mints before the lasso of Friar Pedro shall prevent us the
swallow!Grey returned to the "Clarion" office in a much more satisfied
condition of mind.Whatever faith he held in Enriquez's sincerity, for
the first time since the attack on Colonel Starbottle he believed he had
found a really legitimate journalistic opportunity in the incident.The
legend and its singular coincidence with the outrages would make capital
"copy."No names would be mentioned, yet even if Colonel Starbottle recognized
his own adventure, he could not possibly object to this interpretation
of it.The editor had found that few people objected to be the hero of
a ghost story, or the favored witness of a spiritual manifestation.Nor
could Richards find fault with this view of his own experience, hitherto
kept a secret, so long as it did not refer to his relations with the
fair Cota.Summoning him at once to his sanctum, he briefly repeated the
story he had just heard, and his purpose of using it.To his surprise,
Richards's face assumed a seriousness and anxiety equal to Enriquez's
own.Grey," he said awkwardly, "and I ain't sayin'
it ain't mighty good newspaper stuff, but it won't do NOW, for the whole
mystery's up and the assailant found.""I didn't reckon ye were so keen on it," said Richards embarrassedly,
"and--and--it wasn't my own secret altogether.""Go on," said the editor impatiently."Well," said Richards slowly and doggedly, "ye see there was a fool that
was sweet on Cota, and he allowed himself to be bedeviled by her to ride
her cursed pink and yaller mustang.Naturally the beast bolted at once,
but he managed to hang on by the mane for half a mile or so, when it
took to buck-jumpin'.The first 'buck' threw him clean into the road,
but didn't stun him, yet when he tried to rise, the first thing he
knowed he was grabbed from behind and half choked by somebody.He was
held so tight that he couldn't turn, but he managed to get out his
revolver and fire two shots under his arm.The grip held on for a
minute, and then loosened, and the somethin' slumped down on top o' him,
but he managed to work himself around.And then--what do you think he
saw?--why, that thar hoss!with two bullet holes in his neck, lyin'
beside him, but still grippin' his coat collar and neck-handkercher in
his teeth!the rough that attacked Colonel Starbottle, the
villain that took me behind when I was leanin' agin that cursed fence,
was that same God-forsaken, hell-invented pinto hoss!"In a flash of recollection the editor remembered his own experience, and
the singular scuffle outside the stable door of the fonda.Undoubtedly
Cota had saved him from a similar attack."But why not tell this story with the other?"said the editor, returning
to his first idea."It won't do," said Richards, with dogged resolution."Yes," said Richards, with a darkening face."Again attacked, and by the
same hoss!Whether Cota was or was not knowin' its tricks,
she was actually furious at me for killin' it--and it's all over 'twixt
me and her.""Nonsense," said the editor impulsively; "she will forgive you!You
didn't know your assailant was a horse WHEN YOU FIRED.Look at the
attack on you in the road!"Richards shook his head with dogged hopelessness.I oughter guessed it was a hoss then--thar was nothin' else in
that corral.Cota's already gone away back to San Jose, and I reckon
the Ramierez has got scared of her and packed her off.So, on account
of its bein' HER hoss, and what happened betwixt me and her, you see my
mouth is shut.""And the columns of the 'Clarion' too," said the editor, with a sigh."I know it's hard, sir, but it's better so.I've reckoned mebbe she was
a little crazy, and since you've told me that Spanish yarn, it mout
be that she was sort o' playin' she was that priest, and trained that
mustang ez she did."After a pause, something of his old self came back into his blue eyes as
he sadly hitched up his braces and passed them over his broad shoulders."Yes, sir, I was a fool, for we've lost the only bit of real sensation
news that ever came in the way of the 'Clarion.'"A JACK AND JILL OF THE SIERRAS


It was four o'clock in the afternoon, and the hottest hour of the day
on that Sierran foothill.The western sun, streaming down the mile-long
<DW72> of close-set pine crests, had been caught on an outlying ledge of
glaring white quartz, covered with mining tools and debris, and
seemed to have been thrown into an incandescent rage.The air above it
shimmered and became visible.A white canvas tent on it was an object
not to be borne; the steel-tipped picks and shovels, intolerable to
touch and eyesight, and a tilted tin prospecting pan, falling over,
flashed out as another sun of insufferable effulgence.At such moments
the five members of the "Eureka Mining Company" prudently withdrew to
the nearest pine-tree, which cast a shadow so sharply defined on the
glistening sand that the impingement of a hand or finger beyond that
line cut like a knife.The men lay, or squatted, in this shadow,
feverishly puffing their pipes and waiting for the sun to slip beyond
the burning ledge.Yet so irritating was the dry air, fragrant with the
aroma of the heated pines, that occasionally one would start up and walk
about until he had brought on that profuse perspiration which gave
a momentary relief, and, as he believed, saved him from sunstroke.Suddenly a voice exclaimed querulously:--

"Derned if the blasted bucket ain't empty ag'in!Not a drop left, by
Jimminy!"A stare of helpless disgust was exchanged by the momentarily uplifted
heads; then every man lay down again, as if trying to erase himself."I did," said a reflective voice coming from a partner lying comfortably
on his back, "and if anybody reckons I'm going to face Tophet ag'in
down that <DW72>, he's mistaken!"The speaker was thirsty--but he had
principles."We must throw round for it," said the foreman, taking the dice from his
pocket.He cast; the lowest number fell to Parkhurst, a florid, full-blooded
Texan."All right, gentlemen," he said, wiping his forehead, and lifting
the tin pail with a resigned air, "only EF anything comes to me on that
bare stretch o' stage road,--and I'm kinder seein' things spotty and
black now, remember you ain't anywhar NEARER the water than you were!I
ain't sayin' it for myself--but it mout be rough on YOU--and"--

"Give ME the pail," interrupted a tall young fellow, rising.Cries of "Good old Ned," and "Hunky boy!"greeted him as he took the
pail from the perspiring Parkhurst, who at once lay down again."You
mayn't be a professin' Christian, in good standin', Ned Bray," continued
Parkhurst from the ground, "but you're about as white as they make 'em,
and you're goin' to do a Heavenly Act!I repeat it, gents--a Heavenly
Act!"Without a reply Bray walked off with the pail, stopping only in the
underbrush to pluck a few soft fronds of fern, part of which he put
within the crown of his hat, and stuck the rest in its band around
the outer brim, making a parasol-like shade above his shoulders.Thus
equipped he passed through the outer fringe of pines to a rocky trail
which began to descend towards the stage road.Here he was in the
full glare of the sun and its reflection from the heated rocks, which
scorched his feet and pricked his bent face into a rash.The descent was
steep and necessarily slow from the slipperiness of the desiccated pine
needles that had fallen from above.Nor were his troubles over when,
a few rods further, he came upon the stage road, which here swept in
a sharp curve round the flank of the mountain, its red dust, ground by
heavy wagons and pack-trains into a fine powder, was nevertheless so
heavy with some metallic substance that it scarcely lifted with the
foot, and he was obliged to literally wade through it.Yet there were
two hundred yards of this road to be passed before he could reach
that point of its bank where a narrow and precipitous trail dropped
diagonally from it, to creep along the mountain side to the spring he
was seeking.When he reached the trail, he paused to take breath and wipe the
blinding beads of sweat from his eyes before he cautiously swung
himself over the bank into it.A single misstep here would have sent him
headlong to the tops of pine-trees a thousand feet below.Holding his
pail in one hand, with the other he steadied himself by clutching the
ferns and brambles at his side, and at last reached the spring--a niche
in the mountain side with a ledge scarcely four feet wide.He had merely
accomplished the ordinary gymnastic feat performed by the members of the
Eureka Company four or five times a day!He held his wrists to cool their throbbing pulses in the clear,
cold stream that gurgled into its rocky basin; he threw the water over
his head and shoulders; he swung his legs over the ledge and let the
overflow fall on his dusty shoes and ankles.Gentle and delicious rigors
came over him.He sat with half closed eyes looking across the dark
olive depths of the canyon between him and the opposite mountain.A hawk
was swinging lazily above it, apparently within a stone's throw of him;
he knew it was at least a mile away.Thirty feet above him ran the stage
road; he could hear quite distinctly the slow thud of hoofs, the dull
jar of harness, and the labored creaking of the Pioneer Coach as it
crawled up the long ascent, part of which he had just passed.He thought
of it,--a slow drifting cloud of dust and heat, as he had often seen
it, abandoned by even its passengers, who sought shelter in the wayside
pines as they toiled behind it to the summit,--and hugged himself in
the grateful shadows of the spring.It had passed out of hearing and
thought, he had turned to fill his pail, when he was startled by a
shower of dust and gravel from the road above, and the next moment he
was thrown violently down, blinded and pinned against the ledge by the
fall of some heavy body on his back and shoulders.His last flash of
consciousness was that he had been struck by a sack of flour slipped
from the pack of some passing mule.It was probably
not long, for his chilled hands and arms, thrust by the blow on his
shoulders into the pool of water, assisted in restoring him.He came
to with a sense of suffocating pressure on his back, but his head and
shoulders were swathed in utter darkness by the folds of some soft
fabrics and draperies, which, to his connecting consciousness, seemed as
if the contents of a broken bale or trunk had also fallen from the pack.With a tremendous effort he succeeded in getting his arm out of the
pool, and attempted to free his head from its blinding enwrappings.In
doing so his hand suddenly touched human flesh--a soft, bared arm!With
the same astounding discovery came one more terrible: that arm belonged
to the weight that was pressing him down; and now, assisted by his
struggles, it was slowly slipping toward the brink of the ledge and the
abyss below!With a desperate effort he turned on his side, caught the
body,--as such it was,--dragged it back on the ledge, at the same
moment that, freeing his head from its covering,--a feminine skirt,--he
discovered it was a woman!She had been also unconscious, although the touch of his cold, wet hand
on her skin had probably given her a shock that was now showing itself
in a convulsive shudder of her shoulders and a half opening of her eyes.Suddenly she began to stare at him, to draw in her knees and feet toward
her, sideways, with a feminine movement, as she smoothed out her skirt,
and kept it down with a hand on which she leaned.She was a tall,
handsome girl, from what he could judge of her half-sitting figure in
her torn silk dust-cloak, which, although its cape and one sleeve were
split into ribbons, had still protected her delicate, well-fitting gown
beneath."What--is it?--what has happened?"she said faintly, yet with a slight
touch of formality in her manner."You must have fallen--from the road above," said Bray hesitatingly.she repeated, with a slight frown, as if to
concentrate her thought.She glanced upward, then at the ledge before
her, and then, for the first time, at the darkening abyss below.The
color, which had begun to return, suddenly left her face here, and
she drew instinctively back against the mountain side."Yes," she half
murmured to herself, rather than to him, "it must be so.I was walking
too near the bank--and--I fell!"Then turning to him, she said, "And you
found me lying here when you came.""I think," stammered Bray, "that I was here when you fell, and I--I
broke the fall."She lifted her handsome gray eyes to him, saw the dust, dirt, and leaves
on his back and shoulders, the collar of his shirt torn open, and a
few spots of blood from a bruise on his forehead.Her black eyebrows
straightened again as she said coldly, "Dear me!I am very sorry; I
couldn't help it, you know."But you, are you sure you are not injured?"I'm not hurt," she said, helping herself to her feet by the aid of the
mountain-side bushes, and ignoring his proffered hand."But," she
added quickly and impressively, glancing upward toward the stage road
overhead, "why don't they come?I must have
been here a long time; it's too bad!""Yes," she said impatiently, "of course!I got out of the coach to walk uphill on the bank under
the trees.My foot must have slipped up
there--and--I--slid--down.Bray did not like to say he had only just recovered consciousness.But on turning around in her
impatience, she caught sight of the chasm again, and lapsed quite white
against the mountain side."Let me give you some water from the spring," he said eagerly, as she
sank again to a sitting posture; "it will refresh you."He looked hesitatingly around him; he had neither cup nor flask, but he
filled the pail and held it with great dexterity to her lips.She drank
a little, extracted a lace handkerchief from some hidden pocket, dipped
its point in the water, and wiped her face delicately, after a certain
feline fashion.Then, catching sight of some small object in the fork of
a bush above her, she quickly pounced upon it, and with a swift sweep
of her hand under her skirt, put on HER FALLEN SLIPPER, and stood on her
feet again."How does one get out of such a place?"she asked fretfully, and then,
glancing at him half indignantly, "why don't you shout?""I was going to tell you," he said gently, "that when you are a little
stronger, we can get out by the way I came in,--along the trail."He pointed to the narrow pathway along the perilous incline.Somehow,
with this tall, beautiful creature beside him, it looked more perilous
than before.She may have thought so too, for she drew in her breath
sharply and sank down again.she asked suddenly, opening her
gray eyes upon him.she went on, almost
impertinently.He stopped, and then it suddenly occurred
to him that after all there was no reason for his being bullied by this
tall, good-looking girl, even if he HAD saved her.He gave a little
laugh, and added mischievously, "Just like Jack and Jill, you know."she said sharply, bending her black brows at him."Jack and Jill," he returned carelessly; "I broke my crown, you know,
and YOU,"--he did not finish.She stared at him, trying to keep her face and her composure; but a
smile, that on her imperious lips he thought perfectly adorable, here
lifted the corners of her mouth, and she turned her face aside.But
the smile, and the line of dazzling little teeth it revealed, were
unfortunately on the side toward him.Emboldened by this, he went on,
"I couldn't think what had happened.At first I had a sort of idea that
part of a mule's pack had fallen on top of me,--blankets, flour, and all
that sort of thing, you know, until"--

Her smile had vanished."Well," she said impatiently, "until?"I'm afraid I gave you a shock; my hand was
dripping from the spring."She  so quickly that he knew she must have been conscious at the
time, and he noticed now that the sleeve of her cloak, which had been
half torn off her bare arm, was pinned together over it.When and how
had she managed to do it without his detecting the act?"At all events," she said coldly, "I'm glad you have not received
greater injury from--your mule pack.""I think we've both been very lucky," he said simply.She did not reply, but remained looking furtively at the narrow trail."I thought I heard voices," she said, half rising.You say there's no use--there's only this way out of it!""I might go up first, and perhaps get assistance--a rope or chair," he
suggested.she cried, with a horrified glance at the
abyss.I should be over that ledge before you came back!There's a dreadful fascination in it even now.I think I'd rather
go--at once!I never shall be stronger as long as I stay near it; I may
be weaker."She gave a petulant little shiver, and then, though paler and evidently
agitated, composed her tattered and dusty outer garments in a deft,
ladylike way, and leaned back against the mountain side, He saw her also
glance at his loosened shirt front and hanging neckerchief, and with a
heightened color he quickly re-knotted it around his throat.They moved
from the ledge toward the trail."But it's only wide enough for ONE, and I never--NEVER--could even stand
on it a minute alone!""We will go together, side by side," he
said quietly, "but you will have to take the outside.""I shall keep hold of you," he explained; "you need not fear that.He untied the large bandanna silk handkerchief
which he wore around his shoulders, knotted one end of it firmly to his
belt, and handed her the other."Do you think you can hold on to that?""I--don't know,"--she hesitated.He pointed to a girdle of yellow
leather which caught her tunic around her small waist."Yes," she said eagerly, "it's real leather."He gently slipped the edge of the handkerchief under it and knotted it.They were thus linked together by a foot of handkerchief."I feel much safer," she said, with a faint smile."But if I should fall," he remarked, looking into her eyes, "you would
go too!"It would be really Jack
and Jill this time.""Now I must take YOUR arm," he said
laughingly; "not you MINE."He passed his arm under hers, holding it
firmly.For the first few steps her
uncertain feet took no hold of the sloping mountain side, which seemed
to slip sideways beneath her.He was literally carrying her on his
shoulder.But in a few moments she saw how cleverly he balanced himself,
always leaning toward the hillside, and presently she was able to help
him by a few steps."It's nothing; I carry a pail of water up here without spilling a drop."She stiffened slightly under this remark, and indeed so far overdid her
attempt to walk without his aid, that her foot slipped on a stone,
and she fell outward toward the abyss.But in an instant his arm was
transferred from her elbow to her waist, and in the momentum of his
quick recovery they both landed panting against the mountain side."I'm afraid you'd have spilt the pail that time," she said, with a
slightly heightened color, as she disengaged herself gently from his
arm."No," he answered boldly, "for the pail never would have stiffened
itself in a tiff, and tried to go alone.""Of course not, if it were only a pail," she responded.The trail was growing a little steeper
toward the upper end and the road bank.Bray was often himself obliged
to seek the friendly aid of a manzanita or thornbush to support them.Bray listened; he could hear at intervals a far-off shout; then a nearer
one--a name--"Eugenia."A sudden glow of
pleasure came over him--he knew not why, except that she did not look
delighted, excited, or even relieved."Only a few yards more," he said, with an unaffected half sigh."Then I'd better untie this," she suggested, beginning to fumble at the
knot of the handkerchief which linked them.Their heads were close together, their fingers often met; he would have
liked to say something, but he could only add: "Are you sure you will
feel quite safe?It is a little steeper as we near the bank.""You can hold me," she replied simply, with a superbly unconscious
lifting of her arm, as she yielded her waist to him again, but without
raising her eyes.He did,--holding her rather tightly, I fear, as they clambered up the
remaining <DW72>, for it seemed to him as a last embrace.As he lifted
her to the road bank, the shouts came nearer; and glancing up, he saw
two men and a woman running down the hill toward them.In that instant she had slipped the tattered dust-coat from her
shoulder, thrown it over her arm, set her hat straight, and was calmly
awaiting them with a self-possession and coolness that seemed to
shame their excitement.He noticed, too, with the quick perception of
unimportant things which comes to some natures at such moments, that
she had plucked a sprig of wild myrtle from the mountain side, and was
wearing it on her breast."You have alarmed us beyond measure--kept the stage waiting, and now it
is gone!"said the younger man, with brotherly brusqueness.As these questions were all uttered in the same breath, Eugenia replied
to them collectively."It was so hot that I kept along the bank here,
while you were on the other side.I heard the trickle of water somewhere
down there, and searching for it my foot slipped.This gentleman"--she
indicated Bray--"was on a little sort of a trail there, and assisted me
back to the road again."The two men and the woman turned and stared at Bray with a look of
curiosity that changed quickly into a half contemptuous unconcern.They
saw a youngish sort of man, with a long mustache, a two days' growth of
beard, a not overclean face, that was further streaked with red on the
temple, a torn flannel shirt, that showed a very white shoulder beside
a sunburnt throat and neck, and soiled white trousers stuck into muddy
high boots--in fact, the picture of a broken-down miner.But their
unconcern was as speedily changed again into resentment at the perfect
ease and equality with which he regarded them, a regard the more
exasperating as it was not without a suspicion of his perception of some
satire or humor in the situation.I--er"--

"The lady has thanked me," interrupted Bray, with a smile.said the younger man to Eugenia, ignoring Bray."Not far," she answered, with a half appealing look at Bray."Only a few feet," added the latter, with prompt mendacity, "just a
little slip down."The three new-comers here turned away, and, surrounding Eugenia,
conversed in an undertone.Quite conscious that he was the subject of
discussion, Bray lingered only in the hope of catching a parting glance
from Eugenia.The words "YOU do it," "No, YOU!""It would come better
from HER," were distinctly audible to him.To his surprise, however,
she suddenly broke through them, and advancing to him, with a dangerous
brightness in her beautiful eyes, held out her slim hand.Neworth, my brother, Harry Neworth, and my aunt, Mrs.Dobbs," she
said, indicating each one with a graceful inclination of her handsome
head, "all think I ought to give you something and send you away.I
believe that is the way they put it.I come to
ask you to let me once more thank you for your good service to me
to-day--which I shall never forget."When he had returned her firm
handclasp for a minute, she coolly rejoined the discomfited group."She's no sardine," said Bray to himself emphatically, "but I suspect
she'll catch it from her folks for this.I ought to have gone away at
once, like a gentleman, hang it!"He was even angrily debating with himself whether he ought not to follow
her to protect her from her gesticulating relations as they all trailed
up the hill with her, when he reflected that it would only make matters
worse.And with it came the dreadful reflection that as yet he had
not carried the water to his expecting and thirsty comrades.He
had forgotten them for these lazy, snobbish, purse-proud San
Franciscans--for Bray had the miner's supreme contempt for the moneyed
trading classes.He flung himself over
the bank, and hastened recklessly down the trail to the spring.But here
again he lingered--the place had become suddenly hallowed.He gazed eagerly around on the ledge for any
trace that she had left--a bow, a bit of ribbon, or even a hairpin that
had fallen from her.As the young man slowly filled the pail he caught sight of his own
reflection in the spring.It certainly was not that of an Adonis!He laughed honestly; his sense of humor had saved him from many an
extravagance, and mitigated many a disappointment before this.She
was a plucky, handsome girl--even if she was not for him, and he might
never set eyes on her again.Yet it was a hard pull up that trail once
more, carrying an insensible pail of water in the hand that had once
sustained a lovely girl!He remembered her reply to his badinage,
"Of course not--if it were only a pail," and found a dozen pretty
interpretations of it.He was too poor and
too level headed for that!And he was unaffectedly and materially tired,
too, when he reached the road again, and rested, leaving the spring and
its little idyl behind.By this time the sun had left the burning ledge of the Eureka Company,
and the stage road was also in shadow, so that his return through its
heavy dust was less difficult.And when he at last reached the camp, he
found to his relief that his prolonged absence had been overlooked by
his thirsty companions in a larger excitement and disappointment; for
it appeared that a well-known San Francisco capitalist, whom the
foreman had persuaded to visit their claim with a view to advance and
investment, had actually come over from Red Dog for that purpose, and
had got as far as the summit when he was stopped by an accident, and
delayed so long that he was obliged to go on to Sacramento without
making his examination."That was only his excuse--mere flap-doodle!"interrupted the
pessimistic Jerrold."He was foolin' you; he'd heard of suthin better!The idea of calling that affair an 'accident,' or one that would stop
any man who meant business!""A d----d fool woman's accident," broke in the misogynist Parkhurst,
"and it's true!That's what makes it so cussed mean.For there's allus
a woman at the bottom of such things--bet your life!Think of 'em comin'
here.Thar ought to be a law agin it.""Why, what does that blasted fool of a capitalist do but bring with him
his daughter and auntie to'see the wonderful scenery with popa
dear!'as if it was a cheap Sunday-school panorama!And what do these
chuckle-headed women do but get off the coach and go to wanderin'
about, and playin' 'here we go round the mulberry bush' until one of 'em
tumbles down a ravine.and 'dear popa'
was up and down the road yellin' 'Me cheyld!And then there
was camphor and sal volatile and eau de cologne to be got, and the coach
goes off, and 'popa dear' gets left, and then has to hurry off in a
buggy to catch it.So WE get left too, just because that God-forsaken
fool, Neworth, brings his women here."Under this recital poor Bray sat as completely crushed as when the fair
daughter of Neworth had descended upon his shoulders at the spring.It was HIS delay and dalliance with her
that had checked Neworth's visit; worse than that, it was his subsequent
audacity and her defense of him that would probably prevent any renewal
of the negotiations.He had shipwrecked his partners' prospects in his
absurd vanity and pride!He did not dare to raise his eyes to their
dejected faces.He would have confessed everything to them, but the
same feeling of delicacy for her which had determined him to keep her
adventures to himself now forever sealed his lips.How might they not
misconstrue his conduct--and HERS!Perhaps something of this was visible
in his face."Come, old man," said the cheerful misogynist, with perfect innocence,
"don't take it so hard.Some time in a man's life a woman's sure to get
the drop on him, as I said afore, and this yer woman's got the drop on
five of us!But--hallo, Ned, old man--what's the matter with your head?"He laid his hand gently on the matted temple of his younger partner."I had--a slip--on the trail," he stammered."Had to go back again for
another pailful.That's what delayed me, you know, boys," he added.ejaculated Parkhurst, clapping him on the back and twisting
him around by the shoulders so that he faced his companions.Look at him, gentlemen; and he says it's 'nothing.'That's how a MAN
takes it!HE didn't go round yellin' and wringin' his hands and sayin'
'Me pay-l!He just humped himself and trotted
back for another.And yet every drop of water in that overset bucket
meant hard work and hard sweat, and was as precious as gold."Luckily for Bray, whose mingled emotions under Parkhurst's eloquence
were beginning to be hysterical, the foreman interrupted.it's time we got to work again, and took another heave at
the old ledge!But now that this job of Neworth's is over--I don't mind
tellin' ye suthin."As their leader usually spoke but little, and to
the point, the four men gathered around him."Although I engineered this
affair, and got it up, somehow, I never SAW that Neworth standing on
this ledge!The look of superstition
which Bray and the others had often seen on this old miner's face,
and which so often showed itself in his acts, was there."And though I
wanted him to come, and allowed to have him come, I'm kinder relieved
that he didn't, and so let whatsoever luck's in the air come to us five
alone, boys, just as we stand."The next morning Bray was up before his companions, and although it was
not his turn, offered to bring water from the spring.He was not in love
with Eugenia--he had not forgotten his remorse of the previous day--but
he would like to go there once more before he relentlessly wiped out her
image from his mind.And he had heard that although Neworth had gone on
to Sacramento, his son and the two ladies had stopped on for a day or
two at the ditch superintendent's house on the summit, only two miles
away.She might pass on the road; he might get a glimpse of her again
and a wave of her hand before this thing was over forever, and he should
have to take up the daily routine of his work again.It was not love--of
THAT he was assured--but it was the way to stop it by convincing himself
of its madness.Besides, in view of all the circumstances, it was his
duty as a gentleman to show some concern for her condition after the
accident and the disagreeable contretemps which followed it.He found the
spring had simply lapsed into its previous unsuggestive obscurity,--a
mere niche in the mountain side that held only--water!The stage road
was deserted save for an early, curly-headed schoolboy, whom he found
lurking on the bank, but who evaded his company and conversation.He returned to the camp quite cured of his fancy.His late zeal as a
water-carrier had earned him a day or two's exemption from that duty.His place was taken the next afternoon by the woman-hating Parkhurst,
and he was the less concerned by it as he had heard that the same
afternoon the ladies were to leave the summit for Sacramento.The new water-bringer was
as scandalously late in his delivery of the precious fluid as his
predecessor!His unfortunate
partners, toiling away with pick and crowbar on the burning ledge, were
clamorous from thirst, and Bray was becoming absurdly uneasy.It could
not be possible that Eugenia's accident had been repeated!The mystery
was presently cleared, however, by the abrupt appearance of Parkhurst
running towards them, but WITHOUT HIS PAIL!The cry of consternation and
despair which greeted that discovery was, however, quickly changed by
a single breathless, half intelligible sentence he had shot before him
from his panting lips.And he was holding something in his outstretched
palm that was more eloquent than words.In an instant they had him under the shade of the pine-tree, and were
squatting round him like schoolboys.His story, far from being brief, was incoherent and at times seemed
irrelevant, but that was characteristic.They would remember that he had
always held the theory that, even in quartz mining, the deposits were
always found near water, past or present, with signs of fluvial erosion!He didn't call himself one of your blanked scientific miners, but his
head was level!It was all very well for them to say "Yes, yes!"NOW,
but they didn't use to!when he got to the spring, he noticed
that there had been a kind of landslide above it, of course, from water
cleavage, and there was a distinct mark of it on the mountain side,
where it had uprooted and thrown over some small bushes!Excited as Bray was, he recognized with a hysterical sensation the track
made by Eugenia in her fall, which he himself had noticed."When I saw that," continued Parkhurst, more rapidly and coherently,
"I saw that there was a crack above the hole where the water came
through--as if it had been the old channel of the spring.I widened it
a little with my clasp knife, and then--in a little pouch or pocket of
decomposed quartz--I found that!Not only that, boys," he continued,
rising, with a shout, "but the whole <DW72> above the spring is a mass of
seepage underneath, as if you'd played a hydraulic hose on it, and it's
ready to tumble and is just rotten with quartz!"The men leaped to their feet; in another moment they had snatched picks,
pans, and shovels, and, the foreman leading, with a coil of rope thrown
over his shoulders, were all flying down the trail to the highway.The spring was not on THEIR claim; it was known to
others; it was doubtful if Parkhurst's discovery with his knife amounted
to actual WORK on the soil.They must "take it up" with a formal notice,
and get to work at once!In an hour they were scattered over the mountain side, like bees
clinging to the fragrant <DW72> of laurel and myrtle above the spring.An
excavation was made beside it, and the ledge broadened by a dozen
feet.Even the spring itself was utilized to wash the hastily filled
prospecting pans.And when the Pioneer Coach slowly toiled up the road
that afternoon, the passengers stared at the scarcely dry "Notice of
Location" pinned to the pine by the road bank, whence Eugenia had fallen
two days before!Eagerly and anxiously as Edward Bray worked with his companions, it was
with more conflicting feelings.There was a certain sense of desecration
in their act.How her proud lip would have curled had she seen him--he
who but a few hours before would have searched the whole <DW72> for
the treasure of a ribbon, a handkerchief, or a bow from her dress--now
delving and picking the hillside for that fortune her accident had so
mysteriously disclosed.Mysteriously he believed, for he had not fully
accepted Parkhurst's story.That gentle misogynist had never been an
active prospector; an inclination to theorize without practice and to
combat his partners' experience were all against his alleged process of
discovery, although the gold was actually there; and his conduct that
afternoon was certainly peculiar.He did but little of the real
work; but wandered from man to man, with suggestions, advice, and
exhortations, and the air of a superior patron.This might have been
characteristic, but mingled with it was a certain nervous anxiety and
watchfulness.He was continually scanning the stage road and the trail,
staring eagerly at any wayfarer in the distance, and at times falling
into fits of strange abstraction.At other times he would draw near to
one of his fellow partners, as if for confidential disclosure, and then
check himself and wander aimlessly away.And it was not until evening
came that the mystery was solved.The prospecting pans had been duly washed and examined, the <DW72> above
and below had been fully explored and tested, with a result and promise
that outran their most sanguine hopes.There was no mistaking the fact
that they had made a "big" strike.That singular gravity and reticence,
so often observed in miners at these crises, had come over them as
they sat that night for the last time around their old camp-fire on
the Eureka ledge, when Parkhurst turned impulsively to Bray."Roll over
here," he said in a whisper."I want to tell ye suthin!"Bray "rolled" beyond the squatting circle, and the two men gradually
edged themselves out of hearing of the others.In the silent abstraction
that prevailed nobody noticed them."It's got suthin to do with this discovery," said Parkhurst, in a low,
mysterious tone, "but as far as the gold goes, and our equal rights to
it as partners, it don't affect them.If I," he continued in a slightly
patronizing, paternal tone, "choose to make you and the other boys
sharers in what seems to be a special Providence to ME, I reckon we
won't quarrel on it.It's one
of those things ye read about in books and don't take any stock in!But
we've got the gold--and I've got the black and white to prove it--even
if it ain't exactly human."His voice sank so low, his manner was so impressive, that despite his
known exaggeration, Bray felt a slight thrill of superstition.Meantime
Parkhurst wiped his brow, took a folded slip of paper and a sprig of
laurel from his pocket, and drew a long breath."When I got to the spring this afternoon," he went on, in a nervous,
tremulous, and scarcely audible voice, "I saw this bit o' paper, folded
note-wise, lyin' on the ledge before it.On top of it was this sprig
of laurel, to catch the eye.I ain't the man to pry into other folks'
secrets, or read what ain't mine.But on the back o' this note was
written 'To Jack!'It's a common enough name, but it's a singular thing,
ef you'll recollect, thar ain't ANOTHER Jack in this company, not on the
whole ridge betwixt this and the summit, except MYSELF!So I opened it,
and this is what it read!"He held the paper sideways toward the leaping
light of the still near camp-fire, and read slowly, with the emphasis of
having read it many times before."'I want you to believe that I, at least, respect and honor your honest,
manly calling, and when you strike it rich, as you surely will, I hope
you will sometimes think of Jill.'"In the thrill of joy, hope, and fear that came over Bray, he could see
that Parkhurst had not only failed to detect his secret, but had not
even connected the two names with their obvious suggestion."But do you
know anybody named Jill?""It's no NAME," said Parkhurst in a sombre voice, "it's a THING!""Yes, a measure--you know--two fingers of whiskey.""Oh, a 'gill,'" said Bray."That's what I said, young man," returned Parkhurst gravely.Bray choked back a hysterical laugh; spelling was notoriously not one of
Parkhurst's strong points."But what has a 'gill' got to do with it?""It's one of them Sphinx things, don't you see?A sort of riddle or
rebus, you know.You've got to study it out, as them old chaps did."Pints, I suppose," said Bray."QUARTZ, and there you are.So I looked about me for quartz, and sure
enough struck it the first pop."Bray cast a quick look at Parkhurst's grave face.The man was evidently
impressed and sincere.or you'll spoil the charm, and bring us ill luck!I really don't know that you ought to have told
me," added the artful Bray, dissembling his intense joy at this proof of
Eugenia's remembrance."But," said Parkhurst blankly, "you see, old man, you'd been the last
man at the spring, and I kinder thought"--

"Don't think," said Bray promptly, "and above all, don't talk; not a
word to the boys of this.I've
got to go to San Francisco next week, and I'll take care of it and think
it out!"He knew that Parkhurst might be tempted to talk, but without
the paper his story would be treated lightly.Parkhurst handed him the
paper, and the two men returned to the camp-fire.The superstition of the lover is
no less keen than that of the gambler, and Bray, while laughing at
Parkhurst's extravagant fancy, I am afraid was equally inclined to
believe that their good fortune came through Eugenia's influence.At least he should tell her so, and her precious note became now an
invitation as well as an excuse for seeking her.The only fear that
possessed him was that she might have expected some acknowledgment of
her note before she left that afternoon; the only thing he could not
understand was how she had managed to convey the note to the spring,
for she could not have taken it herself.But this would doubtless be
explained by her in San Francisco, whither he intended to seek her.His
affairs, the purchasing of machinery for their new claim, would no doubt
give him easy access to her father.But it was one thing to imagine this while procuring a new and
fashionable outfit in San Francisco, and quite another to stand before
the "palatial" residence of the Neworths on Rincon Hill, with the
consciousness of no other introduction than the memory of the Neworths'
discourtesy on the mountain, and, even in his fine feathers, Bray
hesitated.At this moment a carriage rolled up to the door, and Eugenia,
an adorable vision of laces and silks, alighted.Forgetting everything else, he advanced toward her with outstretched
hand.He saw her start, a faint color come into her face; he knew he
was recognized; but she stiffened quickly again, the color vanished, her
beautiful gray eyes rested coldly on him for a moment, and then, with
the faintest inclination of her proud head, she swept by him and entered
the house.But Bray, though shocked, was not daunted, and perhaps his own pride was
awakened.He ran to his hotel, summoned a messenger, inclosed her note
in an envelope, and added these lines:--


DEAR MISS NEWORTH,--I only wanted to thank you an hour ago, as I should
like to have done before, for the kind note which I inclose, but which
you have made me feel I have no right to treasure any longer, and to
tell you that your most generous wish and prophecy has been more than
fulfilled.Yours, very gratefully,

EDMUND BRAY.Within the hour the messenger returned with the still briefer reply:--

"Miss Neworth has been fully aware of that preoccupation with his good
fortune which prevented Mr.Bray from an earlier acknowledgment of her
foolish note."Cold as this response was, Bray's heart leaped.She HAD lingered on the
summit, and HAD expected a reply.He seized his hat, and, jumping into
the first cab at the hotel door, drove rapidly back to the house.He
had but one idea, to see her at any cost, but one concern, to avoid a
meeting with her father first, or a denial at her very door.He dismissed the cab at the street corner and began to reconnoitre the
house.It had a large garden in the rear, reclaimed from the adjacent
"scrub oak" infested sand hill, and protected by a high wall.If he
could scale that wall, he could command the premises.It was a bright
morning; she might be tempted into the garden.A taller scrub oak grew
near the wall; to the mountain-bred Bray it was an easy matter to swing
himself from it to the wall, and he did.But his momentum was so great
that he touched the wall only to be obliged to leap down into the garden
to save himself from falling there.He heard a little cry, felt his feet
strike some tin utensil, and rolled on the ground beside Eugenia and her
overturned watering-pot.They both struggled to their feet with an astonishment that turned to
laughter in their eyes and the same thought in the minds of each."But we are not on the mountains now, Mr.Bray," said Eugenia, taking
her handkerchief at last from her sobering face and straightening
eyebrows."But we are quits," said Bray.I only
came here to tell you why I could not answer your letter the same day.I
never got it--I mean," he added hurriedly, "another man got it first."She threw up her head, and her face grew pale."ANOTHER man got it," she
repeated, "and YOU let another man"--

"No, no," interrupted Bray imploringly.One of my
partners went to the spring that afternoon, and found it; but he neither
knows who sent it, nor for whom it was intended."He hastily recounted
Parkhurst's story, his mysterious belief, and his interpretation of
the note.The color came back to her face and the smile to her lips and
eyes."I had gone twice to the spring after I saw you, but I couldn't
bear its deserted look without you," he added boldly.Here, seeing her
face grew grave again, he added, "But how did you get the letter to the
spring?and how did you know that it was found that day?"It was her turn to look embarrassed and entreating, but the combination
was charming in her proud face."I got the little schoolboy at the
summit," she said, with girlish hesitation, "to take the note.He knew
the spring, but he didn't know YOU.I told him--it was very foolish, I
know--to wait until you came for water, to be certain that you got the
note, to wait until you came up, for I thought you might question him,
or give him some word.""But," she added,
and her lip took a divine pout, "he said he waited TWO HOURS; that you
never took the LEAST CONCERN of the letter or him, but went around the
mountain side, peering and picking in every hole and corner of it, and
then he got tired and ran away.Of course I understand it now, it wasn't
YOU; but oh, please; I beg you, Mr.Bray released the little hand which he had impulsively caught, and which
had allowed itself to be detained for a blissful moment."And now, don't you think, Mr.Bray," she added demurely, "that you had
better let me fill my pail again while you go round to the front door
and call upon me properly?""But your father"--

"My father, as a well-known investor, regrets exceedingly that he did
not make your acquaintance more thoroughly in his late brief interview.He is, as your foreman knows, exceedingly interested in the mines on
Eureka ledge.She led him to a little
door in the wall, which she unbolted."And now 'Jill' must say good-by
to 'Jack,' for she must make herself ready to receive a Mr.And when Bray a little later called at the front door, he was
respectfully announced.He called another day, and many days after.He
came frequently to San Francisco, and one day did not return to his old
partners.He had entered into a new partnership with one who he declared
"had made the first strike on Eureka mountain."BILSON'S HOUSEKEEPER


I

When Joshua Bilson, of the Summit House, Buckeye Hill, lost his wife,
it became necessary for him to take a housekeeper to assist him in the
management of the hotel.Already all Buckeye had considered this a mere
preliminary to taking another wife, after a decent probation, as the
relations of housekeeper and landlord were confidential and delicate,
and Bilson was a man, and not above female influence.There was,
however, some change of opinion on that point when Miss Euphemia Trotter
was engaged for that position.Buckeye Hill, which had confidently
looked forward to a buxom widow or, with equal confidence, to the
promotion of some pretty but inefficient chambermaid, was startled
by the selection of a maiden lady of middle age, and above the medium
height, at once serious, precise, and masterful, and to all appearances
outrageously competent.More carefully "taking stock" of her, it was
accepted she had three good points,--dark, serious eyes, a trim but
somewhat thin figure, and well-kept hands and feet.These, which in
so susceptible a community would have been enough, in the words of one
critic, "to have married her to three men," she seemed to make of little
account herself, and her attitude toward those who were inclined to make
them of account was ceremonious and frigid.Indeed, she seemed to occupy
herself entirely with looking after the servants, Chinese and Europeans,
examining the bills and stores of traders and shopkeepers, in a fashion
that made her respected and--feared.It was whispered, in fact, that
Bilson stood in awe of her as he never had of his wife, and that he was
"henpecked in his own farmyard by a strange pullet."Nevertheless, he always spoke of her with a respect and even a reverence
that seemed incompatible with their relative positions.It gave rise
to surmises more or less ingenious and conflicting: Miss Trotter had a
secret interest in the hotel, and represented a San Francisco syndicate;
Miss Trotter was a woman of independent property, and had advanced large
sums to Bilson; Miss Trotter was a woman of no property, but she was
the only daughter of--variously--a late distinguished nobleman, a ruined
millionaire, and a foreign statesman, bent on making her own living.Miss Euphemia Trotter, or "Miss E. Trotter," as she
preferred to sign herself, loathing her sentimental prefix, was really
a poor girl who had been educated in an Eastern seminary, where
she eventually became a teacher.She had survived her parents and a
neglected childhood, and had worked hard for her living since she
was fourteen.She had been a nurse in a hospital, an assistant in a
reformatory, had observed men and women under conditions of pain and
weakness, and had known the body only as a tabernacle of helplessness
and suffering; yet had brought out of her experience a hard philosophy
which she used equally to herself as to others.That she had ever
indulged in any romance of human existence, I greatly doubt; the lanky
girl teacher at the Vermont academy had enough to do to push herself
forward without entangling girl friendships or confidences, and so
became a prematurely hard duenna, paid to look out for, restrain, and
report, if necessary, any vagrant flirtation or small intrigue of her
companions.A pronounced "old maid" at fifteen, she had nothing to
forget or forgive in others, and still less to learn from them.It was spring, and down the long <DW72>s of Buckeye Hill the flowers were
already effacing the last dented footprints of the winter rains, and the
winds no longer brought their monotonous patter.In the pine woods there
were the song and flash of birds, and the quickening stimulus of the
stirring aromatic sap.Miners and tunnelmen were already forsaking
the direct road for a ramble through the woodland trail and its sylvan
charms, and occasionally breaking into shouts and horseplay like great
boys.The schoolchildren were disporting there; there were some older
couples sentimentally gathering flowers side by side.Miss Trotter was
also there, but making a short cut from the bank and express office, and
by no means disturbed by any gentle reminiscence of her girlhood or any
other instinctive participation in the wanton season.Spring came, she
knew, regularly every year, and brought "spring cleaning" and other
necessary changes and rehabilitations.This year it had brought also
a considerable increase in the sum she was putting by, and she
was, perhaps, satisfied in a practical way, if not with the blind
instinctiveness of others.She was walking leisurely, holding her gray
skirt well over her slim ankles and smartly booted feet, and clear of
the brushing of daisies and buttercups, when suddenly she stopped.A few
paces before her, partly concealed by a myrtle, a young woman, startled
at her approach, had just withdrawn herself from the embrace of a young
man and slipped into the shadow.Nevertheless, in that moment, Miss
Trotter's keen eyes had recognized her as a very pretty Swedish girl,
one of her chambermaids at the hotel.Miss Trotter passed without a
word, but gravely.She was not shocked nor surprised, but it struck
her practical mind at once that if this were an affair with impending
matrimony, it meant the loss of a valuable and attractive servant; if
otherwise, a serious disturbance of that servant's duties.She must look
out for another girl to take the place of Frida Pauline Jansen, that
was all.It is possible, therefore, that Miss Jansen's criticism of Miss
Trotter to her companion as a "spying, jealous old cat" was unfair.This
companion Miss Trotter had noticed, only to observe that his face and
figure were unfamiliar to her.His red shirt and heavy boots gave no
indication of his social condition in that locality.He seemed more
startled and disturbed at her intrusion than the girl had been, but
that was more a condition of sex than of degree, she also knew.In
such circumstances it is the woman always who is the most composed and
self-possessed.A few days after this, Miss Trotter was summoned in some haste to the
office.Chris Calton, a young man of twenty-six, partner in the Roanoke
Ledge, had fractured his arm and collar-bone by a fall, and had been
brought to the hotel for that rest and attention, under medical advice,
which he could not procure in the Roanoke company's cabin.She had
a retired, quiet room made ready.When he was installed there by the
doctor she went to see him, and found a good-looking, curly headed young
fellow, even boyish in appearance and manner, who received her with that
air of deference and timidity which she was accustomed to excite in the
masculine breast--when it was not accompanied with distrust.It struck
her that he was somewhat emotional, and had the expression of one who
had been spoiled and petted by women, a rather unusual circumstance
among the men of the locality.Perhaps it would be unfair to her to say
that a disposition to show him that he could expect no such "nonsense"
THERE sprang up in her heart at that moment, for she never had
understood any tolerance of such weakness, but a certain precision and
dryness of manner was the only result of her observation.She adjusted
his pillow, asked him if there was anything that he wanted, but took her
directions from the doctor, rather than from himself, with a practical
insight and minuteness that was as appalling to the patient as it was an
unexpected delight to Dr."I see you quite understand me, Miss
Trotter," he said, with great relief."I ought to," responded the lady dryly."I had a dozen such cases, some
of them with complications, while I was assistant at the Sacramento
Hospital."returned the doctor, dropping gladly into purely
professional detail, "you'll see this is very simple, not a comminuted
fracture; constitution and blood healthy; all you've to do is to see
that he eats properly, keeps free from excitement and worry, but does
not get despondent; a little company; his partners and some of the boys
from the Ledge will drop in occasionally; not too much of THEM, you
know; and of course, absolute immobility of the injured parts."The lady
nodded; the patient lifted his blue eyes for an instant to hers with
a look of tentative appeal, but it slipped off Miss Trotter's dark
pupils--which were as abstractedly critical as the doctor's--without
being absorbed by them.When the door closed behind her, the doctor
exclaimed: "By Jove!"Do what
she says, and we'll pull you through in no time.she's able to
adjust those bandages herself!"This, indeed, she did a week later, when the surgeon had failed to call,
unveiling his neck and arm with professional coolness, and supporting
him in her slim arms against her stiff, erect buckramed breast, while
she replaced the splints with masculine firmness of touch and serene
and sexless indifference.His stammered embarrassed thanks at the
relief--for he had been in considerable pain--she accepted with a
certain pride as a tribute to her skill, a tribute which Dr.Duchesne
himself afterward fully indorsed.On re-entering his room the third or fourth morning after his advent at
the Summit House, she noticed with some concern that there was a slight
flush on his cheek and a certain exaltation which she at first thought
presaged fever.But an examination of his pulse and temperature
dispelled that fear, and his talkativeness and good spirits convinced
her that it was only his youthful vigor at last overcoming his
despondency.A few days later, this cheerfulness not being continued,
Dr.Duchesne followed Miss Trotter into the hall."We must try to keep
our patient from moping in his confinement, you know," he began, with
a slight smile, "and he seems to be somewhat of an emotional nature,
accustomed to be amused and--er--er--petted.""His friends were here yesterday," returned Miss Trotter dryly, "but I
did not interfere with them until I thought they had stayed long enough
to suit your wishes.""I am not referring to THEM," said the doctor, still smiling; "but you
know a woman's sympathy and presence in a sickroom is often the best of
tonics or sedatives."Miss Trotter raised her eyes to the speaker with a half critical
impatience."The fact is," the doctor went on, "I have a favor to ask of you for our
patient.It seems that the other morning a new chambermaid waited upon
him, whom he found much more gentle and sympathetic in her manner than
the others, and more submissive and quiet in her ways--possibly because
she is a foreigner, and accustomed to servitude.I suppose you have no
objection to HER taking charge of his room?"Not from wounded vanity, but
from the consciousness of some want of acumen that had made her make a
mistake.She had really believed, from her knowledge of the patient's
character and the doctor's preamble, that he wished HER to show some
more kindness and personal sympathy to the young man, and had even been
prepared to question its utility!She saw her blunder quickly, and at
once remembering that the pretty Swedish girl had one morning taken the
place of an absent fellow servant, in the rebound from her error, she
said quietly: "You mean Frida!she can look after his
room, if he prefers her."But for her blunder she might have added
conscientiously that she thought the girl would prove inefficient, but
she did not.She remembered the incident of the wood; yet if the girl
had a lover in the wood, she could not urge it as a proof of incapacity.She gave the necessary orders, and the incident passed.Visiting the patient a few days afterward, she could not help noticing a
certain shy gratitude in Mr.Calton's greeting of her, which she quietly
ignored.This forced the ingenuous Chris to more positive speech.He dwelt with great simplicity and enthusiasm on the Swedish girl's
gentleness and sympathy."You have no idea of--her--natural tenderness,
Miss Trotter," he stammered naively.Miss Trotter, remembering the
wood, thought to herself that she had some faint idea of it, but did not
impart what it was.He spoke also of her beauty, not being clever enough
to affect an indifference or ignorance of it, which made Miss Trotter
respect him and smile an unqualified acquiescence.But when he spoke of her as "Miss Jansen," and said she was so
much more "ladylike and refined than the other servants," she replied by
asking him if his bandages hurt him, and, receiving a negative answer,
graciously withdrew.Indeed, his bandages gave him little trouble now, and his improvement
was so marked and sustained that the doctor was greatly gratified,
and, indeed, expressed as much to Miss Trotter, with the conscientious
addition that he believed the greater part of it was due to her capable
nursing!"Yes, ma'am, he has to thank YOU for it, and no one else!"Miss Trotter raised her dark eyes and looked steadily at him.Accustomed
as he was to men and women, the look strongly held him.He saw in her
eyes an intelligence equal to his own, a knowledge of good and evil, and
a toleration and philosophy, equal to his own, but a something else that
was as distinct and different as their sex.And therein lay its charm,
for it merely translated itself in his mind that she had very pretty
eyes, which he had never noticed before, without any aggressive
intellectual quality.came the man's propensity to
reason.It meant of course but ONE thing; he saw it all now!If HE, in
his preoccupation and coolness, had noticed her eyes, so also had the
younger and emotional Chris.It
was that which had stimulated his recovery, and she was wondering if he,
the doctor, had observed it.He smiled back the superior smile of our
sex in moments of great inanity, and poor Miss Trotter believed he
understood her.A few days after this, she noticed that Frida Jansen was
wearing a pearl ring and a somewhat ostentatious locket.Bilson had told her that the Roanoke Ledge was very rich,
and that Calton was likely to prove a profitable guest.It became her business, however, some days later, when Mr.Calton was so
much better that he could sit in a chair, or even lounge listlessly
in the hall and corridor.It so chanced that she was passing along
the upper hall when she saw Frida's pink cotton skirt disappear in an
adjacent room, and heard her light laugh as the door closed.But the
room happened to be a card-room reserved exclusively for gentlemen's
poker or euchre parties, and the chambermaids had no business there.Miss Trotter had no doubt that Mr.Calton was there, and that Frida knew
it; but as this was an indiscretion so open, flagrant, and likely to be
discovered by the first passing guest, she called to her sharply.She
was astonished, however, at the same moment to see Mr.Calton walking in
the corridor at some distance from the room in question.Indeed, she was
so confounded that when Frida appeared from the room a little flurried,
but with a certain audacity new to her, Miss Trotter withheld her
rebuke, and sent her off on an imaginary errand, while she herself
opened the card-room door.Bilson, her employer;
his explanation was glaringly embarrassed and unreal!Miss Trotter
affected obliviousness, but was silent; perhaps she thought her employer
was better able to take care of himself than Mr.A week later this tension terminated by the return of Calton to Roanoke
Ledge, a convalescent man.A very pretty watch and chain afterward were
received by Miss Trotter, with a few lines expressing the gratitude of
the ex-patient.Bilson was highly delighted, and frequently borrowed
the watch to show to his guests as an advertisement of the healing
powers of the Summit Hotel.Calton sent to the more attractive
and flirtatious Frida did not as publicly appear, and possibly Mr.Since that discovery, Miss Trotter had felt herself debarred from taking
the girl's conduct into serious account, and it did not interfere with
her work.II

One afternoon Miss Trotter received a message that Mr.Calton desired
a few moments' private conversation with her.A little curious, she had
him shown into one of the sitting-rooms, but was surprised on entering
to find that she was in the presence of an utter stranger!This was
explained by the visitor saying briefly that he was Chris's elder
brother, and that he presumed the name would be sufficient introduction.Miss Trotter smiled doubtfully, for a more distinct opposite to Chris
could not be conceived.The stranger was apparently strong, practical,
and masterful in all those qualities in which his brother was charmingly
weak.Miss Trotter, for no reason whatever, felt herself inclined to
resent them."I reckon, Miss Trotter," he said bluntly, "that you don't know anything
of this business that brings me here.At least," he hesitated, with a
certain rough courtesy, "I should judge from your general style and gait
that you wouldn't have let it go on so far if you had, but the fact is,
that darned fool brother of mine--beg your pardon!--has gone and got
himself engaged to one of the girls that help here,--a yellow-haired
foreigner, called Frida Jansen.""I was not aware that it had gone so far as that," said Miss Trotter
quietly, "although his admiration for her was well known, especially to
his doctor, at whose request I selected her to especially attend to your
brother.""The doctor is a fool," broke in Mr."He only thought
of keeping Chris quiet while he finished his job."Calton," continued Miss Trotter, ignoring the
interruption, "I do not see what right I have to interfere with the
matrimonial intentions of any guest in this house, even though or--as
you seem to put it--BECAUSE the object of his attentions is in its
employ."Calton stared--angrily at first, and then with a kind of wondering
amazement that any woman--above all a housekeeper--should take such a
view."But," he stammered, "I thought you--you--looked after the conduct
of those girls.""I'm afraid you've assumed too much," said Miss Trotter placidly."My
business is to see that they attend to their duties here.Frida Jansen's
duty was--as I have just told you--to look after your brother's room.And as far as I understand you, you are not here to complain of her
inattention to that duty, but of its resulting in an attachment on your
brother's part, and, as you tell me, an intention as to her future,
which is really the one thing that would make my 'looking after her
conduct' an impertinence and interference!If you had come to tell me
that he did NOT intend to marry her, but was hurting her reputation, I
could have understood and respected your motives."Calton felt his face grow red and himself discomfited.He had come
there with the firm belief that he would convict Miss Trotter of a grave
fault, and that in her penitence she would be glad to assist him in
breaking off the match.On the contrary, to find himself arraigned and
put on his defense by this tall, slim woman, erect and smartly buckramed
in logic and whalebone, was preposterous!But it had the effect of
subduing his tone."You don't understand," he said awkwardly yet pleadingly."My brother is
a fool, and any woman could wind him round her finger.She knows he is rich and a partner in the Roanoke Ledge.I've said he was a fool--but,
hang it all!that's no reason why he should marry an ignorant girl--a
foreigner and a servant--when he could do better elsewhere.""This would seem to be a matter between you and your brother, and not
between myself and my servant," said Miss Trotter coldly."If you
cannot convince HIM, your own brother, I do not see how you expect me
to convince HER, a servant, over whom I have no control except as a
mistress of her WORK, when, on your own showing, she has everything
to gain by the marriage.Bilson, the proprietor, to
threaten her with dismissal unless she gives up your brother,"--Miss
Trotter smiled inwardly at the thought of the card-room incident,--"it
seems to me you might only precipitate the marriage."His reason told him
that she was right.More than that, a certain admiration for her
clear-sightedness began to possess him, with the feeling that he would
like to have "shown up" a little better than he had in this interview.If Chris had fallen in love with HER--but Chris was a fool and wouldn't
have appreciated her!"But you might talk with her, Miss Trotter," he said, now completely
subdued."Even if you could not reason her out of it, you might find
out what she expects from this marriage.If you would talk to her as
sensibly as you have to me"--

"It is not likely that she will seek my assistance as you have," said
Miss Trotter, with a faint smile which Mr.Calton thought quite pretty,
"but I will see about it."Whatever Miss Trotter intended to do did not transpire.She certainly
was in no hurry about it, as she did not say anything to Frida that day,
and the next afternoon it so chanced that business took her to the bank
and post-office.Her way home again lay through the Summit woods.It
recalled to her the memorable occasion when she was first a witness to
Frida's flirtations.Bilson's presumed gallantries,
however, seemed inconsistent, in Miss Trotter's knowledge of the world,
with a serious engagement with young Calton.She was neither shocked nor
horrified by it, and for that reason she had not thought it necessary to
speak of it to the elder Mr.Her path wound through a thicket fragrant with syringa and southernwood;
the faint perfume was reminiscent of Atlantic hillsides, where, long
ago, a girl teacher, she had walked with the girl pupils of the Vermont
academy, and kept them from the shy advances of the local swains.She
smiled--a little sadly--as the thought occurred to her that after this
interval of years it was again her business to restrain the callow
affections.Should she never have the matchmaking instincts of her sex;
never become the trusted confidante of youthful passion?Young Calton
had not confessed his passion to HER, nor had Frida revealed her secret.Only the elder brother had appealed to her hard, practical common sense
against such sentiment.Was there something in her manner that forbade
it?She wondered if it was some uneasy consciousness of this quality
which had impelled her to snub the elder Calton, and rebelled against
it.It was quite warm; she had been walking a little faster than her usual
deliberate gait, and checked herself, halting in the warm breath of the
syringas.Here she heard her name called in a voice that she recognized,
but in tones so faint and subdued that it seemed to her part of her
thoughts.She turned quickly and beheld Chris Calton a few feet
from her, panting, partly from running and partly from some nervous
embarrassment.His handsome but weak mouth was expanded in an
apologetic smile; his blue eyes shone with a kind of youthful appeal so
inconsistent with his long brown mustache and broad shoulders that she
was divided between a laugh and serious concern."I saw you--go into the wood--but I lost you," he said, breathing
quickly, "and then when I did see you again--you were walking so fast
I had to run after you.I wanted--to speak--to you--if you'll let me.I
won't detain you--I can walk your way."Miss Trotter was a little softened, but not so much as to help him out
with his explanation.She drew her neat skirts aside, and made way for
him on the path beside her."You see," he went on nervously, taking long strides to her shorter
ones, and occasionally changing sides in his embarrassment, "my brother
Jim has been talking to you about my engagement to Frida, and trying to
put you against her and me.He said as much to me, and added you half
promised to help him!But I didn't believe him--Miss Trotter!--I know
you wouldn't do it--you haven't got it in your heart to hurt a poor
girl!He says he has every confidence in you--that you're worth a dozen
such girls as she is, and that I'm a big fool or I'd see it.I don't
say you're not all he says, Miss Trotter; but I'm not such a fool as he
thinks, for I know your GOODNESS too.I know how you tended me when
I was ill, and how you sent Frida to comfort me.You know, too,--for
you're a woman yourself,--that all you could say, or anybody could,
wouldn't separate two people who loved each other."Miss Trotter for the first time felt embarrassed, and this made her a
little angry."I don't think I gave your brother any right to speak
for me or of me in this matter," she said icily; "and if you are quite
satisfied, as you say you are, of your own affection and Frida's, I do
not see why you should care for anybody'sinterference.""Now you are angry with me," he said in a doleful voice which at any
other time would have excited her mirth; "and I've just done it.Oh,
Miss Trotter, don't!I didn't mean to say your talk
was no good.I didn't mean to say you couldn't help us.He reached out his hand, grasped her slim fingers in his own, and
pressed them, holding them and even arresting her passage.The act was
without familiarity or boldness, and she felt that to snatch her hand
away would be an imputation of that meaning, instead of the boyish
impulse that prompted it.She gently withdrew her hand as if to continue
her walk, and said, with a smile:--

"Then you confess you need help--in what way?"Was
it possible that this common, ignorant girl was playing and trifling
with her golden opportunity?"Then you are not quite sure of her?""She's so high spirited, you know," he said humbly, "and so attractive,
and if she thought my friends objected and were saying unkind things
of her,--well!"--he threw out his hands with a suggestion of hopeless
despair--"there's no knowing what she might do."Miss Trotter's obvious thought was that Frida knew on which side her
bread was buttered; but remembering that the proprietor was a widower,
it occurred to her that the young woman might also have it buttered on
both sides.Her momentary fancy of uniting two lovers somehow weakened
at this suggestion, and there was a hardening of her face as she said,
"Well, if YOU can't trust her, perhaps your brother may be right.""I don't say that, Miss Trotter," said Chris pleadingly, yet with a
slight wincing at her words; "YOU could convince her, if you would only
try.Only let her see that she has some other friends beside myself.Miss Trotter, I'll leave it all to you--there!If you will only
help me, I will promise not to see her--not to go near her again--until
you have talked with her.Even my brother would not object
to that.And if he has every confidence in you, I'm showing you I've
more--don't you see?Come, now, promise--won't you, dear Miss Trotter?"He again took her hand, and this time pressed a kiss upon her slim
fingers.Indeed, it seemed to
her, in the quick recurrence of her previous sympathy, as if a hand
had been put into her loveless past, grasping and seeking hers in its
loneliness.None of her school friends had ever appealed to her like
this simple, weak, and loving young man.Perhaps it was because they
were of her own sex, and she distrusted them.Nevertheless, this momentary weakness did not disturb her good common
sense.She looked at him fixedly for a moment, and then said, with a
faint smile, "Perhaps she does not trust YOU.He felt himself reddening with a strange embarrassment.It was not so
much the question that disturbed him as the eyes of Miss Trotter; eyes
that he had never before noticed as being so beautiful in their color,
clearness, and half tender insight.He dropped her hand with a new-found
timidity, and yet with a feeling that he would like to hold it longer."I mean," she said, stopping short in the trail at a point where a
fringe of almost impenetrable "buckeyes" marked the extreme edge of the
woods,--"I mean that you are still very young, and as Frida is
nearly your own age,"--she could not resist this peculiarly feminine
innuendo,--"she may doubt your ability to marry her in the face of
opposition; she may even think my interference is a proof of it; but,"
she added quickly, to relieve his embarrassment and a certain abstracted
look with which he was beginning to regard her, "I will speak to her,
and," she concluded playfully, "you must take the consequences."He said "Thank you," but not so earnestly as his previous appeal might
have suggested, and with the same awkward abstraction in his eyes.Miss
Trotter did not notice it, as her own eyes were at that moment fixed
upon a point on the trail a few rods away."Look," she said in a lower
voice, "I may have the opportunity now for there is Frida herself
passing."It was indeed the
young girl walking leisurely ahead of them.There was no mistaking
the smart pink calico gown in which Frida was wont to array her rather
generous figure, nor the long yellow braids that hung Marguerite-wise
down her back.With the consciousness of good looks which she always
carried, there was, in spite of her affected ease, a slight furtiveness
in the occasional swift turn of her head, as if evading or seeking
observation."I will overtake her and speak to her now," continued Miss Trotter."I
may not have so good a chance again to see her alone.You can wait here
for my return, if you like."he stammered, with a
faint, tentative smile."Perhaps--don't you think?--I had better go
first and tell her you want to see her.You see,
she might"--He stopped."It was part of your promise, you know, that you
were NOT to see her again until I had spoken.She has just gone into the
grove."Without another word the young man turned away, and she presently saw
him walking toward the pine grove into which Frida had disappeared.Then
she cleared a space among the matted moss and chickweed, and, gathering
her skirts about her, sat down to wait.The unwonted attitude, the
whole situation, and the part that she seemed destined to take in this
sentimental comedy affected her like some quaint child's play out of her
lost youth, and she smiled, albeit with a little heightening of color
and lively brightening of her eyes.Indeed, as she sat there listlessly
probing the roots of the mosses with the point of her parasol, the
casual passer-by might have taken herself for the heroine of some love
tryst.She had a faint consciousness of this as she glanced to the right
and left, wondering what any one from the hotel who saw her would think
of her sylvan rendezvous; and as the recollection of Chris kissing her
hand suddenly came back to her, her smile became a nervous laugh, and
she found herself actually blushing!He
was walking directly towards her with slow, determined steps, quite
different from his previous nervous agitation, and as he drew nearer she
saw with some concern an equally strange change in his appearance: his
colorful face was pale, his eyes fixed, and he looked ten years older."I came back to tell you," he said, in a voice from which all trace of
his former agitation had passed, "that I relieve you of your promise.It
won't be necessary for you to see--Frida.I thank you all the same, Miss
Trotter," he said, avoiding her eyes with a slight return to his boyish
manner."It was kind of you to promise to undertake a foolish errand for
me, and to wait here, and the best thing I can do is to take myself off
now and keep you no longer.Sometime I may tell
you, but not now."asked Miss Trotter quickly, premising Frida's
refusal from his face.He hesitated a moment, then he said gravely, "Yes.Don't ask me any
more, Miss Trotter, please.He paused, and then, with a
slight, uneasy glance toward the pine grove, "Don't let me keep you
waiting here any longer."He took her hand, held it lightly for a
moment, and said, "Go, now."Miss Trotter, slightly bewildered and unsatisfied, nevertheless passed
obediently out into the trail.He gazed after her for a moment, and
then turned and began rapidly to ascend the <DW72> where he had first
overtaken her, and was soon out of sight.Miss Trotter continued her way
home; but when she had reached the confines of the wood she turned, as
if taking some sudden resolution, and began slowly to retrace her steps
in the direction of the pine grove.What she expected to see there,
possibly she could not have explained; what she actually saw after a
moment's waiting were the figures of Frida and Mr.Her respected employer wore an air of somewhat ostentatious
importance mingled with rustic gallantry.Frida's manner was also
conscious with gratified vanity; and although they believed themselves
alone, her voice was already pitched into a high key of nervous
affectation, indicative of the peasant.But there was nothing to suggest
that Chris had disturbed them in their privacy and confidences.Yet he
had evidently seen enough to satisfy himself of her faithlessness.Miss Trotter waited only until they had well preceded her, and then took
a shorter cut home.She was quite prepared that evening for an interview
which Mr.She found him awkward and embarrassed in her
cool, self-possessed presence.He said he deemed it his duty to inform
her of his approaching marriage with Miss Jansen; but it was because he
wished distinctly to assure her that it would make no difference in Miss
Trotter's position in the hotel, except to promote her to the entire
control of the establishment.He was to be married in San Francisco at
once, and he and his wife were to go abroad for a year or two; indeed,
he contemplated eventually retiring from business.Bilson
was uneasily conscious during this interview that he had once paid
attentions to Miss Trotter, which she had ignored, she never betrayed
the least recollection of it.She thanked him for his confidence and
wished him happiness.Sudden as was this good fortune to Miss Trotter, an independence she
had so often deservedly looked forward to, she was, nevertheless,
keenly alive to the fact that she had attained it partly through Chris's
disappointment and unhappiness.Her sane mind taught her that it was
better for him; that he had been saved an ill-assorted marriage; that
the girl had virtually rejected him for Bilson before he had asked
her mediation that morning.Yet these reasons failed to satisfy her
feelings.It seemed cruel to her that the interest which she had
suddenly taken in poor Chris should end so ironically in disaster to
her sentiment and success to her material prosperity.She thought of his
boyish appeal to her; of what must have been his utter discomfiture in
the discovery of Frida's relations to Mr.Bilson that afternoon, but
more particularly of the singular change it had effected in him.How
nobly and gently he had taken his loss!How much more like a man he
looked in his defeat than in his passion!The element of respect which
had been wanting in her previous interest in him was now present in her
thoughts.It prevented her seeking him with perfunctory sympathy and
worldly counsel; it made her feel strangely and unaccountably shy of any
other expression.Bilson evidently desired to avoid local gossip until after his
marriage, he had enjoined secrecy upon her, and she was also debarred
from any news of Chris through his brother, who, had he known of Frida's
engagement, would have naturally come to her for explanation.It also
convinced her that Chris himself had not revealed anything to his
brother.III

When the news of the marriage reached Buckeye Hill, it did not, however,
make much scandal, owing, possibly, to the scant number of the sex
who are apt to disseminate it, and to many the name of Miss Jansen was
unknown.Bilson would be absent for a year,
and that the superior control of the Summit Hotel would devolve upon
Miss Trotter, DID, however, create a stir in that practical business
community.Every one knew
that to Miss Trotter's tact and intellect the success of the hotel had
been mainly due.Possibly, the satisfaction of Buckeye Hill was due to
something else.Slowly and insensibly Miss Trotter had achieved a social
distinction; the wives and daughters of the banker, the lawyer, and the
pastor had made much of her, and now, as an independent woman of means,
she stood first in the district.Guests deemed it an honor to have a
personal interview with her.The governor of the State and the Supreme
Court judges treated her like a private hostess; middle-aged Miss
Trotter was considered as eligible a match as the proudest heiress
in California.The old romantic fiction of her past was revived
again,--they had known she was a "real lady" from the first!She
received these attentions, as became her sane intellect and cool
temperament, without pride, affectation, or hesitation.Only her dark
eyes brightened on the day when Mr.Bilson's marriage was made known,
and she was called upon by James Calton."I did you a great injustice," he said, with a smile."I don't understand you," she replied a little coldly."Why, this woman and her marriage," he said; "you must have known
something of it all the time, and perhaps helped it along to save
Chris.""You are mistaken," returned Miss Trotter truthfully."Then I have wronged you still more," he said briskly, "for I thought at
first that you were inclined to help Chris in his foolishness.Now I see
it was your persuasions that changed him.""Let me tell you once for all, Mr.Calton," she returned with an
impulsive heat which she regretted, "that I did not interfere in any way
with your brother's suit.He spoke to me of it, and I promised to see
Frida, but he afterwards asked me not to.Calton, "WHATEVER you did, it was most efficacious,
and you did it so graciously and tactfully that it has not altered
his high opinion of you, if, indeed, he hasn't really transferred his
affections to you."Luckily Miss Trotter had her face turned from him at the beginning of
the sentence, or he would have noticed the quick flush that suddenly
came to her cheek and eyes.Yet for an instant this calm, collected
woman trembled, not at what Mr.Calton might have noticed, but at what
SHE had noticed in HERSELF.Calton, construing her silence and
averted head into some resentment of his familiar speech, continued
hurriedly:--

"I mean, don't you see, that I believe no other woman could have
influenced my brother as you have.""You mean, I think, that he has taken his broken heart very lightly,"
said Miss Trotter, with a bitter little laugh, so unlike herself that
Mr.He's regularly cut up, you
know!More like a gloomy crank than
the easy fool he used to be," he went on, with brotherly directness."It
wouldn't be a bad thing, you know, if you could manage to see him, Miss
Trotter!In fact, as he's off his feed, and has some trouble with his
arm again, owing to all this, I reckon, I've been thinking of advising
him to come up to the hotel once more till he's better.So long as SHE'S
gone it would be all right, you know!"By this time Miss Trotter was herself again.She reasoned, or thought
she did, that this was a question of the business of the hotel, and
it was clearly her duty to assent to Chris's coming.The strange yet
pleasurable timidity which possessed her at the thought she ignored
completely.Luckily, she was so much shocked by the change in
his appearance that it left no room for any other embarrassment in the
meeting.His face had lost its fresh color and round outline; the lines
of his mouth were drawn with pain and accented by his drooping mustache;
his eyes, which had sought hers with a singular seriousness, no longer
wore the look of sympathetic appeal which had once so exasperated her,
but were filled with an older experience.Indeed, he seemed to have
approximated so near to her own age that, by one of those paradoxes of
the emotions, she felt herself much younger, and in smile and eye showed
it; at which he  faintly.But she kept her sympathy and inquiries
limited to his physical health, and made no allusion to his past
experiences; indeed, ignoring any connection between the two.He had
been shockingly careless in his convalescence, had had a relapse in
consequence, and deserved a good scolding!His relapse was a reflection
upon the efficacy of the hotel as a perfect cure!She should treat him
more severely now, and allow him no indulgences!I do not know that
Miss Trotter intended anything covert, but their eyes met and he 
again.Ignoring this also, and promising to look after him occasionally,
she quietly withdrew.But about this time it was noticed that a change took place in Miss
Trotter.Always scrupulously correct, and even severe in her dress, she
allowed herself certain privileges of color, style, and material.She,
who had always affected dark shades and stiff white cuffs and collars,
came out in delicate tints and laces, which lent a brilliancy to her
dark eyes and short crisp black curls, slightly tinged with gray.One warm summer evening she startled every one by appearing in white,
possibly a reminiscence of her youth at the Vermont academy.The
masculine guests thought it pretty and attractive; even the women
forgave her what they believed a natural expression of her prosperity
and new condition, but regretted a taste so inconsistent with her age.For all that, Miss Trotter had never looked so charming, and the faint
autumnal glow in her face made no one regret her passing summer.One evening she found Chris so much better that he was sitting on
the balcony, but still so depressed that she was compelled so far to
overcome the singular timidity she had felt in his presence as to ask
him to come into her own little drawing-room, ostensibly to avoid the
cool night air.It was the former "card-room" of the hotel, but now
fitted with feminine taste and prettiness.She arranged a seat for him
on the sofa, which he took with a certain brusque boyish surliness, the
last vestige of his youth."It's very kind of you to invite me in here," he began bitterly, "when
you are so run after by every one, and to leave Judge Fletcher just
now to talk to me, but I suppose you are simply pitying me for being a
fool!""I thought you were imprudent in exposing yourself to the night air on
the balcony, and I think Judge Fletcher is old enough to take care of
himself," she returned, with the faintest touch of coquetry, and a smile
which was quite as much an amused recognition of that quality in herself
as anything else."And I'm a baby who can't," he said angrily.After a pause he burst out
abruptly: "Miss Trotter, will you answer me one question?""Did you know--that--woman was engaged to Bilson when I spoke to you in
the wood?"she answered quickly, but without the sharp resentment she had
shown at his brother's suggestion.Bilson told
me the same evening.""And I only knew it when news came of their marriage," he said bitterly."But you must have suspected something when you saw them together in the
wood," she responded."When I saw them together in the wood?"Miss Trotter was startled, and stopped short.Was it possible he had not
seen them together?She was shocked that she had spoken; but it was too
late to withdraw her words."Yes," she went on hurriedly, "I thought
that was why you came back to say that I was not to speak to her."He looked at her fixedly, and said slowly: "You thought that?I returned before I had reached the wood--because--because--I had
changed my mind!"I did not love
the girl--I never loved her--I was sick of my folly.Sick of deceiving
you and myself any longer.Now you know why I didn't go into the wood,
and why I didn't care where she was nor who was with her!""I don't understand," she said, lifting her clear eyes to his coldly."Of course you don't," he said bitterly.And when you do understand you will hate and despise me--if you do not
laugh at me for a conceited fool!Hear me out, Miss Trotter, for I am
speaking the truth to you now, if I never spoke it before.I never asked
the girl to marry me!I never said to HER half what I told to YOU, and
when I asked you to intercede with her, I never wanted you to do it--and
never expected you would.""May I ask WHY you did it then?"said Miss Trotter, with an acerbity
which she put on to hide a vague, tantalizing consciousness."You would not believe me if I told you, and you would hate me if you
did."He stopped, and, locking his fingers together, threw his hands
over the back of the sofa and leaned toward her."You never liked me,
Miss Trotter," he said more quietly; "not from the first!From the day
that I was brought to the hotel, when you came to see me, I could see
that you looked upon me as a foolish, petted boy.When I tried to catch
your eye, you looked at the doctor, and took your speech from him.And
yet I thought I had never seen a woman so great and perfect as you were,
and whose sympathy I longed so much to have.You may not believe me, but
I thought you were a queen, for you were the first lady I had ever seen,
and you were so different from the other girls I knew, or the women who
had been kind to me.You may laugh, but it's the truth I'm telling you,
Miss Trotter!"He had relapsed completely into his old pleading, boyish way--it had
struck her even as he had pleaded to her for Frida!"I knew you didn't like me that day you came to change the bandages.Although every touch of your hands seemed to ease my pain, you did it so
coldly and precisely; and although I longed to keep you there with me,
you scarcely waited to take my thanks, but left me as if you had
only done your duty to a stranger.And worst of all," he went on more
bitterly, "the doctor knew it too--guessed how I felt toward you, and
laughed at me for my hopelessness!That made me desperate, and put me up
to act the fool.Yes, Miss Trotter; I thought it mighty clever
to appear to be in love with Frida, and to get him to ask to have her
attend me regularly.And when you simply consented, without a word or
thought about it and me, I knew I was nothing to you."Duchesne's
strange scrutiny of her, of her own mistake, which she now knew might
have been the truth--flashed across her confused consciousness in swift
corroboration of his words.It was a DOUBLE revelation to her; for what
else was the meaning of this subtle, insidious, benumbing sweetness that
was now creeping over her sense and spirit and holding her fast.She
felt she ought to listen no longer--to speak--to say something--to get
up--to turn and confront him coldly--but she was powerless.Her reason
told her that she had been the victim of a trick--that having deceived
her once, he might be doing so again; but she could not break the spell
that was upon her, nor did she want to.She must know the culmination of
this confession, whose preamble thrilled her so strangely."The girl was kind and sympathetic," he went on, "but I was not so great
a fool as not to know that she was a flirt and accustomed to attention.I suppose it was in my desperation that I told my brother, thinking he
would tell you, as he did.He would not tell me what you said to him,
except that you seemed to be indignant at the thought that I was only
flirting with Frida.Then I resolved to speak with you myself--and I
did.I know it was a stupid, clumsy contrivance.It never seemed so
stupid before I spoke to you.It never seemed so wicked as when you
promised to help me, and your eyes shone on me for the first time with
kindness.And it never seemed so hopeless as when I found you touched
with my love for another.You wonder why I kept up this deceit until you
promised.Well, I had prepared the bitter cup myself--I thought I ought
to drink it to the dregs."She turned quietly, passionately, and, standing up, faced him with a
little cry.He rose too, and catching her hands in his, said, with a white face,
"Because I love you."*****

Half an hour later, when the under-housekeeper was summoned to receive
Miss Trotter's orders, she found that lady quietly writing at the table.Among the orders she received was the notification that Mr.Calton's
rooms would be vacated the next day.When the servant, who, like most of
her class, was devoted to the good-natured, good-looking, liberal Chris,
asked with some concern if the young gentleman was no better, Miss
Trotter, with equal placidity, answered that it was his intention to put
himself under the care of a specialist in San Francisco, and that
she, Miss Trotter, fully approved of his course.She finished her
letter,--the servant noticed that it was addressed to Mr.Bilson at
Paris,--and, handing it to her, bade that it should be given to a groom,
with orders to ride over to the Summit post-office at once to catch the
last post.As the housekeeper turned to go, she again referred to the
departing guest."It seems such a pity, ma'am, that Mr.Calton couldn't
stay, as he always said you did him so much good."But when the door closed she gave a hysterical little laugh,
and then, dropping her handsome gray-streaked head in her slim hands,
cried like a girl--or, indeed, as she had never cried when a girl.Calton's departure became known the next day, some
lady guests regretted the loss of this most eligible young bachelor.Miss Trotter agreed with them, with the consoling suggestion that he
might return for a day or two.He did return for a day; it was thought
that the change to San Francisco had greatly benefited him, though some
believed he would be an invalid all his life.Meantime Miss Trotter attended regularly to her duties, with the
difference, perhaps, that she became daily more socially popular and
perhaps less severe in her reception of the attentions of the masculine
guests.It was finally whispered that the great Judge Boompointer was a
serious rival of Judge Fletcher for her hand.When, three months later,
some excitement was caused by the intelligence that Mr.Bilson was
returning to take charge of his hotel, owing to the resignation of Miss
Trotter, who needed a complete change, everybody knew what that meant.A few were ready to name the day when she would become Mrs.Boompointer;
others had seen the engagement ring of Judge Fletcher on her slim
finger.Nevertheless Miss Trotter married neither, and by the time Mr.Bilson had returned she had taken her holiday, and the Summit House knew
her no more.Three years later, and at a foreign Spa, thousands of miles distant from
the scene of her former triumphs, Miss Trotter reappeared as a handsome,
stately, gray-haired stranger, whose aristocratic bearing deeply
impressed a few of her own countrymen who witnessed her arrival, and
believed her to be a grand duchess at the least.They were still
more convinced of her superiority when they saw her welcomed by the
well-known Baroness X., and afterwards engaged in a very confidential
conversation with that lady.But they would have been still more
surprised had they known the tenor of that conversation."I am afraid you will find the Spa very empty just now," said the
baroness critically."But there are a few of your compatriots here,
however, and they are always amusing.You see that somewhat faded blonde
sitting quite alone in that arbor?That is her position day after day,
while her husband openly flirts or is flirted with by half the women
here.Quite the opposite experience one has of American women, where
it's all the other way, is it not?And there is an odd story about her
which may account for, if it does not excuse, her husband's neglect.They're very rich, but they say she was originally a mere servant in a
hotel.""You forget that I told you I was once only a housekeeper in one," said
Miss Trotter, smiling.I mean that this woman was a mere peasant, and frightfully
ignorant at that!"Miss Trotter put up her eyeglass, and, after a moment's scrutiny,
said gently, "I think you are a little severe.That was the name of her FIRST
husband.I am told she was a widow who married again--quite a
fascinating young man, and evidently her superior--that is what is so
funny.said Miss Trotter after a pause, in
a still gentler voice.He has gone on an excursion with a party of ladies to
the Schwartzberg.You will find HER very stupid,
but HE is very jolly, though a little spoiled by women.Miss Trotter smiled, and presently turned the subject.But the baroness
was greatly disappointed to find the next day that an unexpected
telegram had obliged Miss Trotter to leave the Spa without meeting the
Caltons."I had meant," he said,
with painful precision, "to say nothing to-night, and act as--I cannot.He got uncertainly to his feet, hesitating."Ladies, you will not be alarmed."The four players caught his eye, and
nodded.There is no danger here, more than--I
am since disinfected.Monsieur Jolivet, my compatriot--You see, you
understand.For a space, the distant hum of the streets invaded the room.Then
Heywood's book of music slapped the floor like a pistol-shot.Quick as he was, the dark-eyed girl stood blocking his way.They confronted each other, man and woman, as if for a combat of will.The outbreak of voices was cut short; the whole company stood, like
Homeric armies, watching two champions.Chantel, however, broke
the silence.He went to the school sick this
morning.Swollen axillae--the poor fool, not to know!--et
puis--enfin--He is dead."Heywood pitched his cap on the green field of the billiard-cloth.Sudden, hot and cold, like the thrust of a knife, it struck Rudolph that
he had heard the voice of this first victim,--the peevish voice which
cried so weakly for a little silence, at early daylight, that very
morning.A little silence: and he had received the great.A gecko fell from the ceiling, with a tiny thump that made all start.He
had struck the piano, and the strings answered with a faint, aeolian
confusion.Then, as they regarded one another silently, a rustle, a
flurry, sounded on the stairs.A woman stumbled into the loft, sobbing,
crying something inarticulate, as she ran blindly toward them, with
white face and wild eyes.She halted abruptly, swayed as though to fall,
and turned, rather by instinct than by vision, to the other women.protested Gilly, with a helpless stare.Why did you ever let me
come back?The face and the voice came to Rudolph like another trouble across a
dream.This trembling, miserable heap, flung
into the arms of the dark-eyed girl, was Mrs."Go on," said the girl, calmly.She had drawn the woman down beside her
on the rattan couch, and clasping her like a child, nodded toward the
piano."Go on, as if the doctor hadn't--hadn't stopped.""Come, Chantel, chantez!He took the stool in
leap-frog fashion, and struck a droll simultaneous discord."Come on.--
Well, then, catch me on the chorus!""Pour qu' j' finisse
Mon service
Au Tonkin je suis parti!"To a discreet set of verses, he rattled a bravado accompaniment.Presently Chantel moved to his side, and, with the same spirit, swung
into the chorus.The tumbled white figure on the couch clung to her
refuge, her bright hair shining below the girl's quiet, thoughtful face.In his riot of emotions, Rudolph found an over-mastering shame.A
picture returned,--the Strait of Malacca, this woman in the blue
moonlight, a Mistress of Life, rejoicing, alluring,--who was now the
single coward in the room.The question was quick and
revolting.As quickly, a choice of sides was forced on him.He
understood these people, recalled Heywood's saying, and with that, some
story of a regiment which lay waiting in the open, and sang while the
bullets picked and chose.All together: as now these half-dozen men
were roaring cheerfully:--


"Ma Tonkiki, ma Tonkiki, ma Tonkinoise,
Yen a d'autr's qui m' font les doux yeux,
Mais c'est ell' que j'aim' le mieux!"CHAPTER IV


THE SWORD-PEN

"Wutzler was missing last night," said Heywood, lazily.He had finished
breakfast, and lighted a short, fat, glossy pipe.Poor old Wutz, he's getting worse and
worse.Chantel's right, I fancy: it's the native wife."The rest never feel so,--Nesbit, and Sturgeon, and
that lot.But then, they don't fall so low as to marry theirs.""By the way," he sneered, on the landing, "until this scare blows over,
you'd better postpone any such establishment, if you intend--"

"I do not," stammered Rudolph.To his amazement, the other clapped him on the shoulder.The sallow face and cynical gray eyes lighted, for the first
time, with something like enthusiasm.Next moment they had darkened
again, but not before he had said gruffly, "You're not a bad
little chap."Morosely, as if ashamed of this outburst, he led the way through the
bare, sunny compound, and when the gate had closed rattling behind
them, stated their plans concisely and sourly."No work to-day, not a
stroke!We'll just make it a holiday, catchee good time.--What?I won't work, and you can't.We'll go out first and see Captain Kneebone."And when
Rudolph, faithful to certain tradesmen snoring in Bremen, would have
protested mildly, he let fly a stinging retort, and did not regain his
temper until they had passed the outskirts of the village.Yet even the
quarrel seemed part of some better understanding, some new, subtle bond
between two lonely men.Before them opened a broad field dotted with curious white disks, like
bone buttons thrown on a green carpet.Near at hand, coolies trotted and
stooped, laying out more of these circular baskets, filled with tiny
dough-balls.Makers of rice-wine, said Heywood; as he strode along
explaining, he threw off his surly fit.The brilliant sunlight, the
breeze stirring toward them from a background of drooping bamboos, the
gabble of coolies, the faint aroma of the fermenting _no-me_ cakes,
began, after all, to give a truant sense of holiday.Almost gayly, the companions threaded a marshy path to the river, and
bargained with a shrewd, plump woman who squatted in the bow of a
sampan.She chaffered angrily, then laughed at some unknown saying of
Heywood's, and let them come aboard.Summoned by voluble scolding, her
husband appeared, and placidly labored at the creaking sweep.They
slipped down a river of bronze, between the oozy banks; and the
war-junks, the naked fisherman, the green-coated ruins of forts, drifted
past like things in reverie, while the men lay smoking, basking in
bright weather.They looked up into serene spaces, and forgot the umbra
of pestilence.Heywood, now lazy, now animated, exchanged barbaric words with the
boat-woman.As their tones rose and fell, she laughed.Long afterward,
Rudolph was to remember her, a wholesome, capable figure in faded blue,
darting keen glances from her beady eyes, flashing her white teeth in a
smile, or laughing till the green pendants of false jade trembled in
her ears.Wu," said Heywood, between smoke-rings, "and she is a
lady of humor.We are discussing the latest lawsuit, which she describes
as suing a flea and winning the bite.Her maiden name was the Pretty
Lily.She is captain of this sampan, and fears that her husband does not
rate A.Where the river disembogued, the Pretty Lily, cursing and shrilling,
pattering barefoot about her craft, set a matting sail and caught the
breeze.Over the copper surface of the roadstead, the sampan drew out
handily.Ahead, a black, disreputable little steamer lay anchored, her
name--two enormous hieroglyphics painted amidships--staring a bilious
yellow in the morning sun.Under these, at last, the sampan came
bumping, unperceived or neglected.Overhead, a pair of white shoes protruded from the rail in a blue film
of smoke.They twitched, as a dry cackle of laughter broke out.Outboard popped a ruddy little face, set in
the green circle of a _topi_, and contorted with laughter.cried the apparition, as though illustrating
a point.Leaning his white sleeves on the rail, cigar in one fist,
Tauchnitz volume in the other, he roared down over the side a passage of
prose, from which his visitors caught only the words "Ginger Dick" and
"Peter Russet," before mirth strangled him."God bless a man," he cried, choking, "that can make a lonesome old
beggar laugh, out here!How he ever thinks up--But he's took
to writing plays, they tell me."Fat lot
o' good they are, for skippers, and planters, and gory exiles!Be-george, I'll write him a chit!Plays be damned; we
want more stories!"Red and savage, he hurled the book fluttering into the sea, then swore
in consternation.My
intention was, ye know, to fling the bloomin' cigar!"Heywood, laughing, rescued the volume on a long bamboo."Just came out on the look-see, captain," he called up."That hole's no worse
with plague than't is without.Got two cases on board, myself--coolies.Stowed 'em topside, under the boats.--Come up here, ye castaway!Come
up, ye goatskin Robinson Crusoe, and get a white man's chow!"He received them on deck,--a red, peppery little officer, whose shaven
cheeks and close gray hair gave him the look of a parson gone wrong, a
hedge-priest run away to sea.Two tall Chinese boys scurried about with
wicker chairs, with trays of bottles, ice, and cheroots, while he barked
his orders, like a fox-terrier commanding a pair of solemn dock-rats.The white men soon lounged beside the wheel-house.Rudolph, wondering if they saw him wince, listened with painful
eagerness.But the captain disposed of that subject very simply.He stared up at the grimy awning."What I'm thinking
is, will that there Dacca babu at Koprah slip me through his blessed
quarantine for twenty-five dollars.Their talk drifted far away from Rudolph, far from China itself, to
touch a hundred ports and islands, Cebu and Sourabaya, Tavoy and
Selangor.They talked of men and women, a death at Zamboanga, a birth at
Chittagong, of obscure heroism or suicide, and fortunes made or lost;
while the two boys, gentle, melancholy, gliding silent in bright blue
robes, spread a white tablecloth, clamped it with shining brass, and
laid the tiffin.Then the talk flowed on, the feast made a tiny clatter
of jollity in the slumbering noon, in the silence of an ocean and a
continent.And when at last the visitors clambered down the iron side,
they went victorious with Spanish wine."Mind ye," shouted Captain Kneebone, from the rail, "that don't half
exhaust the subjeck o' lott'ries!Why, luck"--He shook both fists aloft,
triumphantly, as if they had been full of money.I've a
tip from Calcutta that--Never mind.Bar sells, when that fortch'n comes,
my boy, the half's yours!Sweeping his arm violently, to threaten the coast
of China and the whole range of his vision,--

"You're the one man," he roared, "that makes all this mess--worth a
cowrie!"Heywood laughed, waved his helmet, and when at last he turned, sat
looking downward with a queer smile."What would a chap ever do without 'em?Old
Kneebone there: his was always that--a fortune in a lottery, and then
Home!He waved his helmet again, before stretching out to sleep."Do
you know, I believe--he _would_ take me."The clinkered hills, quivering in the west, sank gradually into the
heated blur above the plains.As gradually, the two men sank
into dreams.Furious, metallic cries from the Pretty Lily woke them, in the blue
twilight.She had moored her sampan alongside a flight of stone steps,
up which, vigorously, with a bamboo, she now prodded her husband.He
contended, snarling, but mounted; and when Heywood's silver fell
jingling into her palm, lighted his lantern and scuffed along, a
churlish guide.At the head of the slimy stairs, Heywood rattled a
ponderous gate in a wall, and shouted.Some one came running, shot
bolts, and swung the door inward.The lantern showed the tawny, grinning
face of a servant, as they passed into a small garden, of dwarf orange
trees pent in by a lofty, whitewashed wall."These grounds are yours, Hackh," said Heywood."Your predecessor's boy;
and there"--pointing to a lonely barrack that loomed white over the
stunted grove--"there's your house.A Portuguese nunnery, it was, built years ago.My boys are helping set
it to rights; but if you don't mind, I'd like you to stay on at my
beastly hut until this--this business takes a turn.He
nodded at the fat little orange trees."We may live to take our chow
under those yet, of an evening.The lantern skipped before them across the garden, through a penitential
courtyard, and under a vaulted way to the main door and the road.With
Rudolph, the obscure garden and echoing house left a sense of magical
ownership, sudden and fleeting, like riches in the Arabian Nights.The
road, leaving on the right a low hill, or convex field, that heaved
against the lower stars, now led the wanderers down a lane of hovels,
among dim squares of smoky lamplight.Wu, their lantern-bearer, had turned back, and they had begun to pass a
few quiet, expectant shops, when a screaming voice, ahead, outraged the
evening stillness.At the first words, Heywood doubled his pace.Here's a lark--or a tragedy."Jostling through a malodorous crowd that blockaded the quarrel, they
gained the threshold of a lighted shop.Against a rank of orderly
shelves, a fat merchant stood at bay, silent, quick-eyed, apprehensive.Before him, like an actor in a mad scene, a sobbing ruffian, naked to
the waist, convulsed with passion, brandished wild fists and ranted with
incredible sounds.When breath failed, he staggered, gasping, and swept
his audience with the glazed, unmeaning stare of drink or lunacy.The
merchant spoke up, timid and deprecating.As though the words were
vitriol, the other started, whirled face to face, and was seized with a
new raving.Something protruded at his waistband, like a rudimentary, Darwinian
stump.To this, all at once, his hand flung back.With a wrench and a
glitter, he flourished a blade above his head.Heywood sprang to
intervene, in the same instant that the disturber of trade swept his arm
down in frenzy.Against his own body, hilt and fist thumped home, with
the sound as of a football lightly punted.He turned, with a freezing
look of surprise, plucked at the haft, made one step calmly and
tentatively toward the door, stumbled, and lay retching and coughing.The fat shop-keeper wailed like a man beside himself.He gabbled,
imploring Heywood."Yes, yes," he repeated
irritably, staring down at the body, but listening to the stream
of words.Murmurs had risen, among the goblin faces blinking in the doorway.Behind them, a sudden voice called out two words which were caught up
and echoed harshly in the street."Never called me that before," he said quickly.He flung back a hurried sentence to the merchant, caught Rudolph's arm,
and plunged into the crowd.The yellow men gave passage mechanically,
but with lowering faces.Once free in the muddy path, he halted quickly,
and looked about."Might have known," he grumbled."Never called me 'Foreign Dog' before,
or 'Jesus man,' He set 'em on."In the dim light, at the outskirts of the
rabble, a man was turning away, with an air of contempt or unconcern.The long, pale, oval face, the hard eyes gleaming with thought, had
vanished at a glance.A tall, slight figure, stooping in his long robe,
he glided into the darkness.For all his haste, the gait was not the
gait of a coolie."That," said Heywood, turning into their former path, "that was Fang,
the Sword-Pen, so-called.Of the two most dangerous
men in the district, he's one."They had swung along briskly for several
minutes, before he added: "The other most dangerous man--you've met him
already.If I'm not mistaken, he's no less a person than the Reverend
James Earle."exclaimed Rudolph, in dull bewilderment.We must find him to-night, and
report."He strode forward, with no more comment.At his side, Rudolph moved as a
soldier, carried onward by pressure and automatic rhythm, moves in the
apathy of a forced march.The day had been so real, so wholesome, full
of careless talk and of sunlight.And now this senseless picture blotted
all else, and remained,--each outline sharper in memory, the smoky lamp
brighter, the blow of the hilt louder, the smell of peanut oil more
pungent.The episode, to him, was a disconnected, unnecessary fragment,
one bloody strand in the whole terrifying snarl.But his companion
stalked on in silence, like a man who saw a pattern in the web of
things, and was not pleased.CHAPTER V


IN TOWN

Night, in that maze of alleys, was but a more sinister day.The same
slant-eyed men, in broken files, went scuffing over filthy stone, like
wanderers lost in a tunnel.The same inexplicable noises endured, the
same smells.Under lamps, the shaven foreheads still bent toward
microscopic labor.The curtained window of a fantan shop still glowed in
orange translucency, and from behind it came the murmur and the endless
chinking of cash, where Fortune, a bedraggled, trade-fallen goddess,
split hairs with coolies for poverty or zero.Nothing was altered in
these teeming galleries, except that turbid daylight had imperceptibly
given place to this other dimness, in which lanterns swung like tethered
fire-balloons.Life went on, mysteriously, without change or sleep.While the two white men shouldered their way along, a strange chorus
broke out, as though from among the crowded carcasses in a butcher's
stall.Shrill voices rose in unearthly discord, but the rhythm was
not of Asia.He halted where, between the
butcher's and a book-shop, the song poured loud through an open doorway.Nodding at a placard, he added: "Here we are: 'Jesus Religion Chapel.''There is a gate that stands ajar.'That being the
case, in you go!"Entering a long, narrow room, lighted from sconces at either side, they
sat down together, like schoolmates, on a low form near the door.From a
dais across at the further end, the vigorous white head of Dr.Earle
dominated the company,--a strange company, of lounging Chinamen who
sucked at enormous bamboo pipes, or squinted aimlessly at the vertical
inscriptions on the walls, or wriggling about, stared at the
late-comers, nudged their neighbors, and pointed, with guttural
exclamations.The song had ended, and the padre was lifting up his
giant's voice.To Rudolph, the words had been mere sound and fury, but
for a compelling honesty that needed no translation.This man was not
preaching to heathen, but talking to men.His eyes had the look of one
who speaks earnestly of matters close at hand, direct, and simple.Along
the forms, another and another man forgot to plait his queue, or squirm,
or suck laboriously at his pipe.When
some waif from the outer labyrinth scuffed in, affable, impudent,
hailing his friends across the room, he made but a ripple of unrest,
and sank gaping among the others like a fish in a pool.Even Heywood sat listening--with more attention than respect, for once
he muttered, "Rot!"Toward the close, however, he leaned across and
whispered, "The old boy reels it off rather well to-night.Rudolph, for his part, sat watching and listening, surprised by a new
and curious thought.A band of huddled converts sang once more, in squealing discords, with
an air of sad, compulsory, and diabolic sarcasm.A few "inquirers"
slouched forward, and surrounding the tall preacher, questioned him
concerning the new faith.The last, a broad, misshapen fellow with
hanging jowls, was answered sharply.He stood arguing, received another
snub, and went out bawling and threatening, with the contorted face and
clumsy flourishes of some fabulous hero on a screen.The missionary approached smiling, but like a man who has finished the
day's work."That fellow--Good-evening: and welcome to our Street Chapel, Mr.Hackh--That fellow," he glanced after the retreating figure, "he's a
lesson in perseverance, gentlemen.A merchant, well-to-do: he has a
lawsuit coming on--notorious--and tries to join us for protection.Cheaper to buy a little belief, you know, than to pay Yamen fines.Every night he turns up, grinning and bland.I tell him it won't do, and
out he goes, snorting like a dragon."Rudolph's impulse came to a head.Earle," he stammered, "I owe you a gratitude.You spoke to these
people so--as--I do not know.But I listened, I felt--Before always are
they devils, images!And after I hear you, they are as men."The other shook his great head like a silver mane, and laughed."My dear young man," he replied, "they're remarkably like you and me."After a pause, he added soberly:--

"Images?His deep voice altered, his eyes lighted shrewdly, as he turned
to Heywood."Quite," said the young man, readily."If you don't mind, padre, you
made Number One talk.In a few brief sentences, he pictured the death in the
shop.--So, like winking!The beggar gave himself the iron, fell down,
and made finish.Now what I pieced out, from his own bukhing, and the
merchant's, was this:--

"The dead man was one Au-yoeng, a cormorant-fisher.Some of his best
birds died, he had a long run of bad luck, and came near starving.So he
contrived, rather cleverly, to steal about a hundred catties of Fuh-kien
hemp.The owner, this merchant, went to the elders of Au-yoeng's
neighborhood, who found and restored the hemp, nearly all.But the neighbors kept after this cormorant fellow,
worked one beastly squeeze or another, ingenious baiting, devilish--Rot!Well, they pushed him
down-hill--poor devil, showing that's always possible, no bottom!He
brooded, and all that, till he thought the merchant and the Jesus
religion were the cause of all.So bang he goes down the
pole,--gloriously drunk,--marches into his enemy's shop, and uses that
knife.The joke is now on the merchant, eh?""Just a moment," begged the padre."One thread I don't follow--the
religion.Thought I told you," said Heywood."One of yours--big,
mild chap--Chok Chung.""Yes," the deep bass rumbled in the empty chapel, "he's one of us."Must be, sir," prompted the younger."The mob, meanwhile, just stood
there, dumb,--mutes and audience, you know.All at once, the hindmost
began squalling 'Foreign Dog,' 'Goat Man.'We stepped outside, and
there, passing, if you like, was that gentle bookworm, Mr.echoed the padre, as in doubt.Why, doctor," cried Heywood, "that long, pale chap,--lives over
toward the Dragon Spring.Confucian, very strict; keen reader; might be
a mandarin, but prefers the country gentleman sort; bally
mischief-maker, he's done more people in the eye than all the Yamen
hacks and all their false witnesses together!Hence his nickname--the
Sword-Pen."Earle sharpened his heavy brows, and studied the floor."Fang, the Sword-Pen," he growled; "yes, there will be trouble.Saul of Tarsus.--We're not the Roman
Church," he added, with his first trace of irritation.Once more he meditated; then heaved his big shoulders to let slip the
whole burden."One day at a time," he laughed."Thank you for telling us.--You see,
Mr.The only fault is, they're just human
beings.They talked of things indifferent; and when the young men were stumbling
along the streets, he called after them a resounding "Good-night!--and stood a resolute, gigantic silhouette, filling, as a right
Doone filled their doorframe, the entrance to his deserted chapel.At his gate, felt Rudolph, they had unloaded some weight of
responsibility.He had not only accepted it, but lightened them further,
girt them, by a word and a look.Somehow, for the first time since
landing, Rudolph perceived that through this difficult, troubled,
ignorant present, a man might burrow toward a future gleam.As for Heywood, he still marched on grimly, threading
the stuffed corridors like a man with a purpose."Catchee bymby, though.To lose sight of any man for twenty-four hours, nowadays,--Well,
it's not hardly fair.They turned down a black lane, carpeted with dry rubbish.At long
intervals, a lantern guttering above a door showed them a hand's-breadth
of the dirty path, a litter of broken withes and basket-weavers' refuse,
between the mouldy wall of the town and a row of huts, no less black and
silent.In this greasy rift the air lay thick, as though smeared into
a groove.Suddenly, among the hovels, they groped along a checkered surface of
brick-work.The flare of Heywood's match revealed a heavy wooden door,
which he hammered with his fist.After a time, a disgruntled voice
within snarled something in the vernacular.Wutzler, you old pirate, open up!"A bar clattered down, the door swung back, and there, raising a
glow-worm lantern of oiled paper, stood such a timorous little figure as
might have ventured out from a masquerade of gnomes.The wrinkled face
was Wutzler's, but his weazened body was lost in the glossy black folds
of a native jacket, and below the patched trousers, his bare ankles and
coolie-sandals of straw moved uneasily, as though trying to hide behind
each other."Kom in," said this hybrid, with a nervous cackle."I thought you are
thiefs.Following through a toy courtyard, among shadow hints of pigmy shrubs
and rockery, they found themselves cramped in a bare, clean cell,
lighted by a European lamp, but smelling of soy and Asiatics.Stiff
black-wood chairs lined the walls.A distorted landscape on rice-paper,
narrow scarlet panels inscribed with black cursive characters, pith
flowers from Amoy, made blots of brightness."It iss not moch, gentlemen," sighed Wutzler, cringing."But I am ver'
glad.""And we came all the way to see
you."Oh, allow me," mumbled their host, in a flutter."My--she--I will
speak, I go bring you."He shuffled away, into some further chamber."Eat it," he whispered, "whether you can or not!Pleases the old one, no
bounds.We're his only visitors--"

"Here iss not moch whiskey."Wutzler came shambling in, held a bottle
against the light, and squinted ruefully at the yellow dregs."I will
gif you a _kong_ full, but I haf not."They heard his angry whispers, and a small
commotion of the household,--brazen dishes clinking, squeals, titters,
and tiny bare feet skipping about,--all the flurry of a rabbit-hutch in
Wonderland.Once, near the threshold, a chubby face, very pale, with
round eyes of shining jet, peered cautious as a mouse, and popped out of
sight with a squeak.Wutzler, red with excitement, came and went like an
anxious waiter, bringing in the feast."Here iss not moch," he repeated sadly.But there were bits of pig-skin
stewed in oil; bean-cakes; steaming buns of wheat-flour, stuffed with
dice of fat pork and lumps of sugar; three-cornered rice puddings,
_no-me_ boiled in plantain-leaf wrappers; with the last of the whiskey,
in green cups.While the two men ate, the shriveled outcast beamed
timidly, hovering about them, fidgeting."Herr Hackh," he suddenly exclaimed, in a queer, strained voice, "you do
not know how dis yong man iss goot!He hass to me--_immer_--" He
choked, turned away, and began fussing with the pith flowers; but not
before Rudolph had seen a line glistening down the sun-dried cheeks.Cadging for chow, does one acquire merit?"retorted Heywood,
over his shoulder."You talk like a bonze, Wutz.""I'd rather
hear the sing-song box.""_Ach so_, I forget!"Still whimpering, Wutzler dragged something from a
corner, squatted, and jerked at a crank, with a noise of ratchets."She
blay not so moch now," he snuffled."Captain Kneepone he has gifen her,
when she iss all op inside for him.I haf rebaired, but she blay only
one song yet.A man does not know, Herr Hackh, what he may be.Once I
haf piano, and viola my own, yes, and now haf I diss small, laffing,
sick teufel!"He rose, and faced Heywood with a trembling, passionate
gesture."But diss yong man, he stand by der oldt fellow!"Behind him, with a whirring sound, a metallic voice assailed them in a
gabble of words, at first husky and broken, then clear, nasal, a voice
from neither Europe nor Asia, but America:--


"Then did I laff?Ooh, aha-ha ha ha,
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!I could not help but laffing,
Ooh, aha-ha..."


From a throat of tin, it mocked them insanely with squealing,
black-hearted guffaws.Heywood sat smoking, with the countenance of a
stoic; but when the laughter in the box was silent, he started abruptly."We're off, old chap," he announced.Just came to see you were
all up-standing.Don't let--er--anything carry
you off."At the gate, Wutzler held aloft his glow-worm lantern.he mumbled, "Der plagues--dey will forget me.All zo many shoots, _kugel_, der bullet,--'_gilt's mir, oder gilt es
dir?_' Men are dead in der Silk-Weafer Street.Dey haf hong up nets, and
dorns, to keep out der plague's-goblins off deir house.Listen, now, dey
beat gongs!--But we are white men.You--you tell me zo, to-night!"He
blubbered something incoherent, but as the gate slammed they heard the
name of God, in a broken benediction.They had groped out of the cleft, and into a main corridor, before
Heywood paused."Queer it
should get into me so.But I hate being laughed at by--anybody."A confused thunder of gongs, the clash of cymbals smothered in the
distance, maintained a throbbing uproar, pierced now and then by savage
yells, prolonged and melancholy.As the two wanderers listened,--

"Where's the comfort," said Heywood, gloomily, "of knowing somebody's
worse off?--No, I wasn't thinking of Wutzler, then.why,
over there, it's goblins they're scaring away.Think, behind their nets
and thorns, what wretches--women, too, and kids--may be crouched down,
quaking, sick with terror.Humph!--I don't mind saying"--for a moment
his hand lay on Rudolph's shoulder--"that I loathe giving this muck-hole
the satisfaction--I'd hate to go Out here, that's all."CHAPTER VI


THE PAGODA

He was spared that inconvenience.The untimely rain and cold, some
persons said, the few days of untimely heat following, had drowned or
dried, frozen or burnt out, the seeds of peril.But accounts varied,
reasons were plentiful.Soldiers had come down from the chow city,
two-score _li_ inland, and charging through the streets, hacking and
slashing the infested air, had driven the goblins over the walls, with a
great shout of victory.A priest had freighted a kite with all the evil,
then cut it adrift in the sky.A mob had dethroned the God of Sickness,
and banished his effigy in a paper junk, launched on the river at night,
in flame.A geomancer proclaimed that a bamboo grove behind the town
formed an angle most correct, germane, and pleasant to the Azure Dragon
and the White Tiger, whose occult currents, male and female, run
throughout Nature.For any or all of these reasons, the town was
delivered.The pestilence vanished, as though it had come but to grant
Monsieur Jolivet his silence, and to add a few score uncounted living
wretches to the dark, mighty, imponderable host of ancestors.The relief, after dragging days of uncertainty, came to Rudolph like a
sea-breeze to a stoker.To escape and survive,--the bare experience
seemed to him at first an act of merit, the deed of a veteran.The
interim had been packed with incongruity.There had been a dinner with
Kempner, solemn, full of patriotism and philosophy; a drunken dinner at
Teppich's; another, and a worse, at Nesbit's; and the banquet of a
native merchant, which began at four o'clock on melon-seeds, tea, black
yearling eggs, and a hot towel, and ended at three in the morning on
rice-brandy and betel served by unreal women with chalked faces and
vermilion-spotted lips, simpering and melancholy.By day, there was
work, or now and then a lesson with Dr.Earle's teacher, a little aged
Chinaman of intricate, refined, and plaintive courtesy.Under his
guidance Rudolph learned rapidly, taking to study as a prodigal might
take to drink.And with increasing knowledge came increasing
tranquillity; as when he found that the hideous cry, startling him at
every dawn, was the signal not for massacre, but buffalo-milk.Then, too, came the mild excitement of moving into his own house, the
Portuguese nunnery.Through its desolate, lime-coated spaces, his meagre
belongings were scattered all too easily; but the new servants, their
words and ways, not only kept his hands full, but gave strange food for
thought.The silent evenings, timed by the plash of a frog in a pool, a
cry from the river, or the sing-song of a "boy" improvising some endless
ballad below-stairs; drowsy noons above the little courtyard, bare and
peaceful as a jail; homesick moments at the window, when beyond the
stunted orangery, at sunset, the river was struck amazingly from bronze
to indigo, or at dawn flashed from pearl-gray to flowing brass;--all
these, and nights between sleep and waking, when fancy peopled the
echoing chambers with the visionary lives, now ended, of meek, brown
sisters from Goa or Macao, gave to Rudolph intimations, vague, profound,
and gravely happy, as of some former existence almost recaptured.Once
more he felt himself a householder in the Arabian tales.And yet, when his life was growing all but placid, across it shot some
tremor of disquieting knowledge.One evening, after a busy day among his piece-goods, he had walked
afield with Heywood, and back by an aimless circuit through the
twilight.His companion had been taciturn, of late; and they halted,
without speaking, where a wide pool gleamed toward a black, fantastic
belt of knotted willows and sharp-curving roofs.Through these broke the
shadow of a small pagoda, jagged as a war-club of shark's teeth.Vesper
cymbals clashed faintly in a temple, and from its open door the first
plummet of lamplight began to fathom the dark margin.A short bridge
curved high, like a camel's hump, over the glimmering half-circle of a
single arch.Close by, under a drooping foreground of branches, a stake
upheld an oblong placard of neat symbols, like a cartouche to explain
a painting."It is very beautiful," ventured Rudolph, twisting up his blond
moustache with satisfaction.I would say--picturesque, no?""Very," said Heywood, absently."And the placard, so finishing, so artistic--That says?"Heywood glanced carelessly at the
upright sentence.That's a notice:--

"'Girls May Not be Drowned in This Pond.'"Without reply, Rudolph followed,
gathering as he walked the force of this tremendous hint.Slow,
far-reaching, it poisoned the elegiac beauty of the scene, alienated the
night, and gave to the fading country-side a yet more ancient look,
sombre and implacable.He was still pondering this, when across their
winding foot-path, with a quick thud of hoofs, swept a pair of
equestrian silhouettes.It was half glimpse, half conjecture,--the tough
little ponies trotting stubbornly, a rider who leaned across laughing,
and a woman who gayly cried at him: "You really do understand me, don't
you?"The two jogging shadows melted in the bamboo tracery, like things
blown down the wind.But for years Rudolph had known the words, the
laugh, the beguiling cadence, and could have told what poise of the head
went with them, what dangerous glancing light.Suddenly, without reason,
he felt a gust of rage.The memory of her weakness was lost in the shining
memory of her power.He should be riding there, in the dusk of this
lonely and cruel land.Heywood had thrown after them a single gloomy stare, down the pointed
aisle of bamboos."Chantel--He bounds in the saddle, and he
bounds afoot!"Rudolph knew that he had hated Chantel at sight.He could not bring himself, next day, to join their party for tiffin at
the Flowery Pagoda.But in the midst of his brooding, Teppich and the
fat Sturgeon assailed the nunnery gate with pot-valiant blows and
shouts.They had brought chairs, to carry him off; and being in no mood
to fail, though panting and struggling, they packed him into a
palanquin with many bottles of the best wine known to Fliegelman and
Sons.By a short cut through the streets--where checkered sunshine,
through the lattice roof, gave a muddy, subdued light as in a roiled
aquarium--the revelers passed the inland wall.Here, in the shade,
grooms awaited them with ponies; and scrambling into saddle, they
trotted off through gaps in the bamboos, across a softly rolling
country.Tortuous foot-paths of vivid pink wound over brilliant green
terraces of young paddy.The pink crescents of new graves scarred the
hillsides, already scalloped and crinkled with shelving abodes of the
venerable dead.Great hats of farmers stooping in the fields, gleamed in
the sun like shields of brass.Over knolls and through hollows the
little cavalcade jogged steadily, till, mounting a gentle eminence, they
wound through a grove of camphor and Flame-of-the-Forest.Above the
branches rose the faded lilac shaft of an ancient pagoda, ruinously
adorned with young trees and wild shrubs clinging in the cornices.At the foot of this aged fantasy in stone, people were laughing.The
three riders broke cover in time to see Mrs.Forrester, flushed and
radiant, end some narrative with a droll pantomime.She stood laughing,
the life and centre of a delighted group."And Gilbert Forrester," she cried, turning archly on her husband,
"said that wasn't funny!"Gilly tugged his gray moustache, in high good-nature.Chantel, Nesbit,
and Kempner laughed uproariously, the padre and the dark-eyed Miss Drake
quietly, Heywood more quietly, while even stout, uneasy Mrs.Earle
smiled as in duty bound.A squad of Chinese boys, busy with
tiffin-baskets, found time to grin.To this lively actress in the white
gown they formed a sylvan audience under the gnarled boughs and
the pagoda.called the white-haired giant, indulgently, to the
dismounting trio.Hackh, you should have come spurring."Rudolph advanced, pale, but with a calmness of which, afterward, he was
justly proud.The heroine of the moment turned toward him quickly, with
a look more natural, more sincere, than she had ever given him."I've heard so much about
you!"Was there a club, from which he had stolen out while she wept,
ignominiously, in that girl's arms?And then of a sudden he perceived,
with a fatuous pleasure, how well she knew him, to know that he had
never spoken.His English, as he drew up a stool beside Miss Drake, was
wild and ragged; but he found her an astonishing refuge.For the first
time, he recalled that this quiet girl had been beautiful, the other
night; and though now by day that beauty was rather of line than of
color, he could not understand how it had been overlooked.Tiffin,
meanwhile, sped by like an orgy.He remembered asking so many questions,
about the mission hospital and her school for orphans, that the girl
began at last to answer with constraint, and with puzzled, sidelong
scrutiny.He remembered how even the tolerant Heywood shot a questioning
glance toward his wine-glass.He remembered telling a brilliant story,
and reciting "Old Captain Mau in Vegesack,"--rhymes long forgotten, now
fluent and spontaneous.Through it, as
through a haze, he saw a pair of wide blue eyes shining with startled
admiration.But the best came when the sun had lowered behind the grove, the company
grown more silent, and Mrs.Forrester, leaning beside the door of the
tower, turned the great pegs of a Chinese lute.The notes tinkled like a
mandolin, but with now and then an alien wail, a lament unknown to the
West."Sing for us," begged the dark-eyed girl; "a native song."The
other smiled, and bending forward as if to recollect, began in a low
voice, somewhat veiled, but musical and full of meaning."The Jasmine
Flower," first; then, "My Love is Gathering Dolichos"; and then she
sang the long Ballad of the Rice,--of the husband and wife planting side
by side, the springing of the green blades, the harvest by millions upon
millions of sheaves, the wealth of the State, more fragrant to ancestors
than offerings of spice:--


"...O Labor and Love and hallowed Land!Think you these things are but still to come?Think you they are but near at hand,
Only now and here?--Behold.In her plaintive interlude, the slant-eyed servants watched her, nodding
and muttering under the camphor trees."And here's a song of exile," she said.--Rudolph had never seen her face like this, bending intently
above the lute.It was as though in the music she found and disclosed
herself, without guile."...Blue was the sky,
And blue the rice-pool water lay
Holding the sky;
Blue was the robe she wore that day.Why
Must life bear all away,
Away, away,
Ah, my beloved, why?"A murmur of praise went round the group, as she put aside the
instrument."The sun's getting low," she said lightly, "and I _must_ see that view
from the top."Chantel was rising, but sat down again with a scowl, as
she turned to Rudolph.Inside, with echoing steps, they mounted in a squalid well, obscurely
lighted from the upper windows, toward which decaying stairs rose in a
dangerous spiral, without guard-rail.A misstep being no trifle, Rudolph
offered his hand for the mere safety; but she took it with a curious
little laugh.Once, at a halt, she stood very
close, with eyes shining large in the dusk.Her slight body trembled,
her head shook with stifled merriment, like a girl overcome by mischief."You and I here!--I never
dreamed you could be funny.It made me so proud of you, down there!"He muttered something vague; and--the stairs ending in ruin at the
fourth story--handed her carefully through the window to a small outer
balustrade.As they stood together at the rail, he knew not whether to
be angry, suspicious, or glad."I love this prospect," she began quietly."That's why I wanted you to
come."Beyond the camphors, a wide, strange landscape glowed in the full,
low-streaming light.The ocean lay a sapphire band in the east; in the
west, on a long ridge, undulated the gray battlements of a city, the
antique walls, warmed and glorified, breasting the flood of sunset.All
between lay vernal fields and hillocks, maidenhair sprays of bamboo, and
a wandering pattern of pink foot-paths.Slowly along one of these, a
bright-gowned merchant rode a white pony, his bells tinkling in the
stillness of sea and land.Everywhere, like other bells more tiny and
shrill, sounded the trilling of frogs.As the two on the pagoda stood listening,--

"It was before Rome," she declared thoughtfully."Before Egypt, and has
never changed.You and I are just--" She broke off, humming:--


"Only here and now?Behold
They were the same in years of old!"Her mood  the scene: the aged continuity of life oppressed him.Yet he chose rather to watch the straggling battlements, far off, than
to meet her eyes or see her hair gleaming in the sun.Through many
troubled days he had forgotten her, despised her, bound his heart in
triple brass against a future in her hateful neighborhood; and now,
beside her at this time-worn rail, he was in danger of being happy.Suddenly, with an impulse that must have been generous,
she rested her hand on his arm.At these close quarters, her tremulous voice and searching upward glance
meant that she alone understood all his troubles.He started, turned for
some rush of overwhelming speech, when a head popped through the window
behind them.His lean young
face was very droll and knowing."Thank you so much, Maurice," she answered, perhaps dryly."You're a
dear, to climb all those dreadful stairs."said Heywood, with his gray eyes fastened on Rudolph, "no
trouble."When the company were mounted, and trooping downhill through the camphor
shadow, Heywood's pony came sidling against Rudolph's, till legging
chafed legging."You blossomed, old boy," he whispered."Quite the star, after your
comedy turn.""What price sympathy on
a pagoda?"For that moment, Rudolph could have struck down the one sure friend he
had in China.CHAPTER VII


IPHIGENIA

"Don't chop off a hen's head with a battle-axe."Heywood, still with a
malicious, friendly quirk at the corners of his mouth, held in his
fretful pony.Rudolph stood bending a whip viciously.They two had
fetched a compass about the town, and now in the twilight were parting
before the nunnery gate."A tiff's the last thing I'd want with you.The
lady, in confidence, is not worth--"

"I do not wish," declared Rudolph, trembling,--"I do not wish you to say
those things, so!"laughed the other, and his pony wheeled at the word."I'll give
you one month--no: you're such a good, thorough little chap, it will
take longer--two months, to change your mind.Only"--he looked down at
Rudolph with a comic, elderly air--"let me observe, our yellow people
have that rather neat proverb.A hen's head, dear chap,--not with a
battle-axe!No sorrows of Werther, now,
over such"--He laughed again."Don't scowl, I'll be good.You'll supply the word, in two months!"He let the pony have his way, and was off in a clatter.Lonely, fuming
with resentment, Rudolph stared after him.What could he know, this
airy, unfeeling meddler, so free with his advice and innuendo?Let him
go, then, let him canter away.He had seen quickly, guessed with a
diabolic shrewdness, yet would remain on the surface, always, of a
mystery so violent and so profound.The young man stalked into his
vacant nunnery in a rage, a dismal pomp of emotion: reason telling him
that a friend had spoken sense, imagination clothing him in the sceptred
pall of tragedy.Yet one of these unwelcome words had stuck: he was Werther, it was
true--a man who came too late.Another word was soon fulfilled; for the
hot weather came, sudden, tropical, ferocious.Without gradation, the
vernal days and languid noons were gone in a twinkling.The change came
like another act of a play.One morning--though the dawn stirred cool
and fragrant as all dawns before--the "boy" laid out Rudolph's white
tunic, slipped in the shining buttons, smeared pipe-clay on his heaviest
helmet; and Rudolph, looking from his window, saw that on the river, by
the same instinct, boatmen were stretching up their bamboo awnings.Breakfast was hardly ended, before river, and convex field, and huddling
red tiles of the town, lay under a blurred, quivering distortion.At night, against a glow of fiery umber, the western hills
broke sharp and thin as sheet-iron, while below them rose in flooding
mirage a bright strip of magical water.Thus, in these days, he rode for his exercise while the sun still lay
behind the ocean; and thus her lively, pointed face and wide blue eyes,
wondering or downcast or merry, were mingled in his thoughts with the
first rousing of the world, the beat of hoofs in cool silences, the wide
lights of creation over an aged, weary, alien empire.Their ponies
whinnying like old friends, they met, by chance or appointment, before
the power of sleep had lifted from eyes still new and strange against
the morning.Sometimes Chantel the handsome rode glowering beside them,
sometimes Gilly, erect and solid in the saddle, laid upon their talk all
the weight of his honest, tired commonplaces.But one morning she cantered up alone, laughing at her escape.His pony
bolted, and they raced along together as comrades happily join forces in
a headlong dream.Quivering bamboo swept behind them; the river, on
their other hand, met and passed in hurrying panorama.They had no time
for words, but only laughter.Words, indeed, had never yet advanced them
beyond that moment on the pagoda.And now, when their ponies fell into
a shambling trot, came the first impulse of speech.Her glowing face was now averted, her gesture was not for
him, but for the scene.The river, up which they had fled, now rested broad and quiet as a
shallow lake, burnished faintly, brooded over by a floating, increasing
light, not yet compounded into day.Tussocks, innumerable clods and
crumbs of vivid green, speckled all the nearer water.On some of these
storks meditated,--sage, pondering heads and urbane bodies perched high
on the frailest penciling of legs.In the whole expanse, no movement
came but when a distant bird, leaving his philosophic pose, plunged
downward after a fish.Beyond them rose a shapeless mound or isle, like
some half-organic monster grounded in his native ooze."Are you all excuses, like the
others?"I am not afraid of anything--now," retorted Rudolph, and with truth,
after the dash of their twilight encounter."Go see what's on that island," she answered.Twice
I've seen natives land there and hurry away.Nesbit was too lazy to
try; Dr.Maurice Heywood refused to
mire his horse for a whim.In a rare flush of pride, Rudolph wheeled his stubborn mount and bullied
him down the bank.A poor horseman, he would have outstripped Curtius to
the gulf.But no sooner had his dancing pony consented to make the first
rebellious, sidelong plunge, than he had small joy of his boast.Fore-legs sank floundering, were hoisted with a terrified wrench of the
shoulders, in the same moment that hind-legs went down as by suction.The pony squirmed, heaved, wrestled in a frenzy, and churning the red
water about his master's thighs, went deeper and fared worse.With a
clangor of wings, the storks rose, a streaming rout against the sky,
trailed their tilted legs, filed away in straggling flight, like figures
interlacing on a panel.At the height of his distress, Rudolph caught a
whirling glimpse of the woman above him, safe on firm earth, easy in her
saddle, and laughing.Quicksand, then, was a joke,--but he could not
pause for this added bewilderment.The pony, using a skill born of agony, had found somewhere a solid verge
and scrambled up, knee-deep, well out from the bank.With a splash,
Rudolph stood beside him among the tufts of salad green.As he patted
the trembling flanks, he heard a cry from the shore.She might laugh, but now he
would see this folly through.He tore off his coat, flung it across the
saddle, waded out alone through the tussocks, and shooting forward full
length in the turbid water, swam resolutely for the island.Sky and water brightened while he swam; and as he rose, wrapped in the
leaden weight of dripping clothes, the sun, before and above him,
touched wonderfully the quaggy bank and parched grasses.He lurched
ashore, his feet caked with enormous clods as of melting chocolate.A
filthy scramble left him smeared and disheveled on the summit.The mound lay vacant, a tangled patch, a fragment of
wilderness.Yet as he stood panting, there rose a puny, miserable sound.The distress, it might be, of some small
animal--a rabbit dying in a forgotten trap.Faint as illusion, a wail, a
thin-spun thread of sorrow, broke into lonely whimpering, and ceased.He
moved forward, doubtfully, and of a sudden, in the scrubby level of the
isle, stumbled on the rim of a shallow circular depression.At first, he could not believe the discovery; but next instant--as at
the temple pond, though now without need of placard or interpreter--he
understood.This bowl, a tiny crater among the weeds, showed like some
paltry valley of Ezekiel, a charnel place of Herod's innocents, the
battlefield of some babes' crusade.A chill struck him, not from the
water or the early mists.In stupor, he viewed that savage fact.Through the stillness of death sounded again the note of living
discontent.He was aware also of some stir, even before he spied, under
a withered clump, the saffron body of an infant girl, feebly squirming.By a loathsome irony, there lay beside her an earthen bowl of rice, as
an earnest or symbol of regret.Blind pity urged him into the atrocious hollow.Seeing no further than
the present rescue, he caught up the small unclean sufferer, who moaned
the louder as he carried her down the bank, and waded out through the
sludge.To hold the squalling mouth above water, and swim, was no simple
feat; yet at last he came floundering among the tussocks, wrapped the
naked body in his jacket, and with infinite pains tugged his terrified
pony along a tortuous bar to the land.Once in the river-path, he stood gloomily, and let Mrs.Forrester canter
up to join him.But what can you have
brought back?He turned on her a muddy, haggard face, without enthusiasm, and gently
unfolded the coat.The man and the woman looked down together, in
silence, at the child.He had some foolish hope that she would take it,
that his part was ended.Like an outlandish doll, with face contorted
and thick-lidded eyes shut tightly against the sunshine, the outcast
whimpered, too near the point of death for even the rebellion of
arms and legs.The woman in the saddle gave a short, incredulous cry.Her face, all gay
curiosity, had darkened in a shock of disgust.Such a nasty little--Why
did--What do you propose doing with it?"Rudolph shook his head, like a man caught in some stupid blunder."I never thought of that," he explained heavily.With a sombre, disappointed air, he obeyed; then looked up, as if in her
face he read strange matter."I can't bear," she added quickly, "to see any kind of suffering.Why
did--It's all my fault for sending you!We were having such a good ride
together, and now I've spoiled it all, with this.--Poor little filthy
object!"She turned her hands outward, with a helpless, dainty gesture.His thoughts, then, had wronged
her.Drenched and downhearted, holding this strange burden in his
jacket, he felt that he had foolishly meddled in things inevitable,
beyond repair.Yet some vague, insurgent instinct, which
would not down, told him that there had been a disappointment.Then suddenly he mounted, bundle and all, and turned his willing pony
homeward."Come," he said; and for the first time, unwittingly, had taken charge.Without waiting, he beckoned her to follow.They rode stirrup to stirrup, silent as in their escape at
dawn, and as close bodily, but in spirit traveling distant parallels.He
gave no thought to that, riding toward his experiment.Near the town, at
last, he reined aside to a cluster of buildings,--white walls and rosy
tiles under a great willow."You may save your steps," she declared, with sudden petulance."The
hospital's more out of funds than ever, and more crowded.Rudolph nodded back at her, with a queer smile, half reckless and half
confident."Then," he replied, dismounting, "I will replenish my nunnery."Squatting coolies sprang up and raced to hold his pony.Others, in the
shade of the wall, cackled when they saw a Son of the Red-Haired so
beplastered and sopping.A few pointed at his bundle, with grunts of
sudden interest; and a leper, bearing the visage as of a stone lion
defaced by time, cried something harshly.At his words, the whole band
of idlers began to chatter.An
uneasy light troubled the innocent blue eyes, which had not even a
glance for him."No, I shan't get down," she said angrily."It's just what might
be--Your little brat will bring no good to any of us."He flung away defiantly, strode through the gate, and calling aloud,
traversed an empty compound, already heated by the new-risen sun.A
cooler fringe of veranda, or shallow cloister, lined a second court.Two
figures met him,--the dark-eyed Miss Drake, all in white, and behind
her a shuffling, grinning native woman, who carried a basin, in which
permanganate of potash swam gleaming like diluted blood.With one droll look of amusement, the girl had
understood, and regained that grave yet happy, friendly composure which
had the virtue, he discovered, of being easily forgotten, to be met each
time like something new.The naked mite lay very still, the breath weakly fluttered.A somewhat
nauseous gift, the girl raised her arms and received it gently, without
haste,--the saffron body appearing yet more squalid against the
Palladian whiteness of her tunic, plain and cool as drapery in marble.And followed by the
black-trousered woman, she moved quickly away to offer battle with
death.A plain, usual fact, it seemed, involving no more surprise than
repugnance.Her face had hardly altered; and yet Rudolph, for the first
time in many days, had caught the fleeting brightness of compassion.Mere light of the eyes, a half-imagined glory, incongruous in the sharp
smell of antiseptics, it left him wondering in the cloister.He knew now
what had been missing by the river."I was naked, and"--how ran the
lines?He turned to go, recalling in a whirl snatches of truth he had
never known since boyhood, never seen away from home.Across a court the padre hailed him,--a tall, ungainly patriarch under
an enormous mushroom helmet of solar pith,--and walking along beside,
listened shrewdly to his narrative.The
padre, nodding, frowning slightly, stood at ease, all angles and loose
joints, as if relaxed by the growing heat.The leper, without, harangued from his place apart, in a raucous voice
filled with the solitary pride of intellect."Well, men shall revile you," growled Dr."He says we steal
children, to puncture their eyes for magic medicine!"Then, heaving his wide shoulders,--

"Oh, well!"he said wearily, "thanks, anyhow.Come see us, when we're
not so busy?Good!--Look out these fellows don't fly at you."Tired and befouled, Rudolph passed through into the torrid glare.The
leper cut short his snarling oration.But without looking at him, the
young man took the bridle from the coolie.He had
seen a child, and two women.And yet it was with a pang he found that
Mrs.CHAPTER VIII


THE HOT NIGHT

Rudolph paced his long chamber like a wolf,--a wolf in summer, with too
thick a coat.In sweat of body and heat of mind, he crossed from window
to window, unable to halt.A faintly sour smell of parched things, oppressing the night without
breath or motion, was like an interminable presence, irritating,
poisonous.The punkah, too, flapped incessant, and only made the lamp
gutter.Broad leaves outside shone in mockery of snow; and like snow the
stifled river lay in the moonlight, where the wet muzzles of buffaloes
glistened, floating like knots on sunken logs, or the snouts of
crocodiles.Birds fluttered, sleepless and wretched.Coolies, flung
asleep on the burnt grass, might have been corpses, but for the sound of
their troubled breathing."If I could believe," he groaned, sitting with hands thrust through his
hair."If I believe in her--But I came too late."He sprang up from it, wiped the drops off
his forehead, and paced again.The collar
of his tunic strangled him.He stuffed his fingers underneath, and
wrenched; then as he came and went, catching sight in a mirror, was
shocked to see that, in Biblical fashion, he had rent his garments."This is bad," he thought, staring.He shouted, clapped his hands for a servant, and at last, snatching a
coat from his unruffled boy, hurried away through stillness and
moonlight to the detested club.On the stairs a song greeted him,--a
fragment with more breath than melody, in a raw bass:--


"Jolly boating weather,
And a hay harvest breeze!"The loft was like a cave heated by subterranean fires.Two long punkahs
flapped languidly in the darkness, with a whine of pulleys.Under a
swinging lamp, in a pool of light and heat, four men sat playing cards,
their tousled heads, bare arms, and cinglets torn open across the chest,
giving them the air of desperadoes."Jolly boating weather," wheezed the fat Sturgeon.He stood apart in
shadow, swaying on his feet."What would you give," he propounded
thickly, "for a hay harvest breeze?"He climbed, or rolled, upon the billiard-table, turned head toward
punkah, and suddenly lay still,--a gross white figure, collapsed and
sprawling."How much does he think a man can stand?"snapped Nesbit, his lean
Cockney face pulled in savage lines.He'll die
to-night, drinking.""Die yourself," mumbled the singer, "'m goin' sleep.A groan from the players, and the vicious flip of a card, acknowledged
the hit.Rudolph joined them, ungreeting and ungreeted.The game went on
grimly, with now and then the tinkle of ice, or the popping of soda
bottles.Sharp cords and flaccid folds in Wutzler's neck, Chantel's
brown cheeks, the point of Heywood's resolute chin, shone wet and
polished in the lamplight.All four men scowled pugnaciously, even the
pale Nesbit, who was winning.Bad temper filled the air, as palpable as
the heat and stink of the burning oil.Only Heywood maintained a febrile gayety, interrupting the game
perversely, stirring old Wutzler to incoherent speech.cried the outcast, with sudden enthusiasm."In your
paper _Tit-bit_, I read.How dey climb der walls op, yes, but Rome is
safed by a flook of geeze.Gracious me, der History iss great sopjeck!I lern moch.--But iss Rome yet a fortify town?"Chantel rapped out a Parisian oath."Do we play cards," he cried sourly, "or listen to the chatter of
senility?""No, Wutz, that town's no longer fortified," he answered slowly."Geese
live there, still, as in--many other places."Chantel examined his finger-tips as though for some defect; then,
snatching up the cards, shuffled and dealt with intense precision."I read alzo," stammered Wutzler, like a timid scholar encouraged to
lecture, "I read zo how your Englishman, Rawf Ralli, he spreadt der fine
clock for your Queen, and lern your Queen smoking, no?"He mopped his
lean throat with the back of his hand.Next instant he whirled on
Rudolph in fury.--"Is this a game, or Idiot's Joy?""I'm playing my best," explained Rudolph, sulkily."Then your best is the worst I ever saw!Chantel laughed, without merriment; Rudolph flung down his cards,
stalked to the window, and stood looking out, in lonely, impotent rage.A long time passed, marked by alarming snores from the billiard-table.The half-naked watchers played on, in ferocious silence.Chantel broke out as though the talk
had but paused a moment."Fools will always sit in, when they do not
know.They rush into the water, also, and play the hero!"Heywood had left his cards,
risen, and crossing the room, stood looking over Rudolph's shoulder into
the snowy moonlight.On the shoulder his hand rested, as by accident."It's the heat, old chap," he said wearily."Don't mind what we say
to-night."Rudolph made no sign, except to move from under his hand, so that, with
their quarrel between them, the two men stared out across the blanched
roofs and drooping trees, where long black shadows at last crept
toward the dawn.They make it for the rest of us, so easily!Do you know," his voice rose
and quickened, "do you know, the other end of town is in an uproar?We
murder children, it appears, for medicine!"Rudolph started, turned, but now sat quiet under Heywood's grasp.Chantel, in the lamplight, watched the punkahs with a hateful smile."The Gascons are not all dead," he murmured."They plunge us all into a
turmoil, for the sake of a woman."He made a sudden startling gesture,
like a man who has lost control."For the sake," he cried angrily, "of a
person we all know!She is nothing more--"

There was a light scuffle at the window.Chantel," began Heywood, with a sharp and dangerous courtesy, "we
are all unlike ourselves to-night.I am hardly the person to remind you,
but this club is hardly the place--"

"Oh, la la!"The other snapped his fingers, and reverting to his native
tongue, finished his sentence wildly.Heywood advanced in long strides deliberately, as if
gathering momentum for a collision.Before his blow could fall, he was
sent spinning.Rudolph, his cheeks on fire, darted past and dealt, full
force, a clumsy backhand sweep of the arm.Light and quick as a leopard,
Chantel was on foot, erect, and even while his chair crashed on the
floor, had whipped out a handkerchief.Heywood," he said, stanching his lips, in icy
composure.His eyes held an odd gleam of satisfaction.Sturgeon to
see your friend to-morrow morning.Not without dignity, he turned, stepped quickly to the stairs, saluted
gravely, and went down.panted Nesbit, wrestling with Rudolph.Heywood wrenched the captive loose, but only to shake him violently, and
thrust him into a chair."I've a great mind, myself, to
run after the bounder and kick him.But that sort of thing--you did
enough.Chantel took you on,
exactly as he wanted."Wutzler came slinking back from his
refuge in the shadows.With arms folded, he eyed them sternly.By Jove,
you must let me fight that beast.The idiot, nobody fights duels
any more.I've always--His cuffs are always dirty, too, on the inside!"Rudolph leaned back, like a man refreshed and comforted, but his laugh
was unsteady, and too boisterous."Pistol-bullets--they fly on the wings of
chance!My dear young gentleman," scoffed his friend, "there's not a
pair of matched pistols in the settlement.And if there were, Chantel
has the choice.He paused, in a silence that grew somewhat menacing.From a slit in the
wall the wheel of the punkah-thong whined insistently,--rise and fall,
rise and fall of peevish complaint, distressing as a brain-fever bird."Swords, of course," continued Heywood.Fencing,--oh, I hate the man, and the art's by-gone, if you like, but
he's a beautiful swordsman!Rudolph still lay back, but now with a singular calm."It's just as well," he declared quietly.Heywood loosed a great breath, a sigh of vast relief."So you're there, too, eh?If you're another expert--Bravo!We'll beat him at his own
game!Hoist with his own what-d'-ye-call-it!I'd give anything"--He
thumped the table, and pitched the cards broadcast, like an explosion of
confetti, in a little carnival of glee."You old Sly-boots!--But are you
sure?"I am not afraid," replied Rudolph, modestly.He trained his young
moustache upward with steady fingers, and sat very quiet, thinking long
thoughts."Now let him come, as the Lord Mayor said
of the hare.With an even chance--And what a load off
one's mind!"He moved away to the window, as though searching for air.Instead of
moonlight, without, there swam the blue mist of dawn."Not a word must ever reach old Gilly," he mused."If you think," retorted the clerk, stiffly, "I don't know the proper
course of be'aviour!The tall silhouette in the window made no reply, but stood grumbling
privately: "A club!Yes, where we drink out of jam-pots--dead cushions,
dead balls--no veranda--fellow that soils the inside of his cuffs first!We're a pack of beach-combers."He propped his elbows on the long sill, and leaned out, venting
fragments of disgust.Then of a sudden he turned, and beckoned eagerly.Gray vapors from river and paddy-field, lingering
like steam in a slow breeze, paled and dispersed in the growing light,
as the new day, worse than the old, came sullenly without breath or
respite.A few twilight shapes were pattering through the narrow
street--a squad of Yamen runners haling a prisoner."The Sword-Pen remains active," said Heywood, thoughtfully."That dingy
little procession, do you know, it's quite theatrical?Even Rudolph could spare a misgiving from his own difficulty while he
watched the prisoner.It was Chok Chung, the plump Christian merchant,
slowly trudging toward the darkest of human courts, to answer for the
death of the cormorant-fisher.Rudolph saw again
the lighted shop, the tumbled figure retching on the floor; and with
these came a memory of that cold and scornful face, thinking so cruelly
among the unthinking rabble.The Sword-Pen had written something in
the dark."I go find out"; and Wutzler was away, as keen as a village gossip."Trouble's comin'," Nesbit asserted glibly.He stretched his arms, with a weary howl."That's the
first yawn I've done to-night.I'm off--seek
my downy."Alone with the grunting sleeper, the two friends sat for a long time and
watched the flooding daylight."What," began Rudolph, suddenly, and his voice trembled, "what is your
true opinion?You are so kind, and I was just a fool.That other day, I
would not listen.Now tell me, so--as you were to die next.Can I truly be proud of--of her?"He leaned forward, white and eager, waiting for the truth like a dicer
for the final throw.Poor old Gilly Forrester slaves here to send her junketing in Japan,
Kashmir, Ceylon, Home.What Chantel said--well, between the two of us,
I'm afraid he's right.So precious few of us, and trouble ahead.The natives lashing themselves into a state of mind, or being lashed.The least spark--Rough work ahead, and here we are at swords' points.""And the joke is," Rudolph added quietly, "I do not know a sword's point
from a handle."Heywood turned, glowered, and twice failed to speak."Rudie--old boy," he stammered, "that man--Preposterous!Rudolph stared straight ahead, without hope, without illusions, facing
the haggard light of morning.A few weeks ago he might have wept; but
now his laugh, short and humorous, was worthy of his companion."I do not care, more," he answered."Luck, so called I it, when I
escaped the militar' service.Luck, to pass into the _Ersatz!_--I
do not care, now.CHAPTER IX


PASSAGE AT ARMS

"Boy."Forrester bym-by come, you talkee he, master no got, you
chin-chin he come-back."The long-coated boy scuffed away, across the chunam floor, and
disappeared in the darkness.Heywood submitted his head once more to the
nimble hands of his groom, who, with horse-clippers and a pair of
enormous iron shears, was trimming the stubborn chestnut locks still
closer.The afternoon glow, reflected from the burnt grass and white
walls of the compound, struck upward in the vault-spaces of the ground
floor, and lighted oddly the keen-eyed yellow mafoo and his serious
young master.Nesbit, pert as a jockey, sat on the table swinging his feet furiously."Sturgeon would take it all right, of course," he said, with airy
wisdom."Not the least," Heywood assented gloomily.If I were commissioned to tell 'em outright--'The youngster can't
fence'--why, we might save the day.But our man won't even listen to
that.Chantel will see, on the spot, directly they
face.No fear: he's worked up to the pitch of
killing.He'll lunge first, and be surprised afterward.--So regrettable!Such remorse!--Oh, I know _him!_"

The Cockney fidgeted for a time.His face--the face of a street-bred
urchin--slowly worked into lines of abnormal cunning.Now--my boy used to be learn-pidgin at Chantel's.Knows that
'ouse inside out--loafs there now, the beggar, with Chantel's cook.Why
not send him over--prowling, ye know--fingers the bric-a-brac, bloomin'
ass, and breaks a sword-blade.'Can secure, all
plopah,' Accident, ye know.Heywood chuckled, and bowed his head to the horse-clippers.This afternoon's rather late for
accidents.You make me feel like Pompey on his galley: 'This thou
shouldst have done, and not have spoken on't,'--Besides, those swords
belonged to Chantel's father.He began as a gentleman.--But you're a
good sort, Nesbit, to take the affair this fashion."Lost in smoke, the clerk grumbled that the gory affair was unmentionable
nonsense.Then suddenly the gray eyes lighted, became both shrewd and
distant; a malicious little smile stole about the corners of his mouth.And this
one--by Jove, it won't leave either of 'em a leg to stand on!--Here,
mafoo, makee finish!"He sprang up, clapped a helmet on the shorn head, and stalked out into
the sunlight.We must pick up our young
Hotspur."The clerk followed, through the glowing compound and the road.In the
shade of the nunnery gate they found Rudolph, who, raising his rattan,
saluted them with a pale and stoic gravity.he asked; and turning, took a slow, cool survey of the
nunnery, as though looking his last--from the ditch at their feet to the
red tiles, patched with bronze mould, that capped the walls and the
roof."I never left any place with less regret.The three men had covered some ground before Rudolph broke the silence."You'll find a few little things up there in my strong-box, Maurice.Some are marked for you, and the rest--will you send them Home, please?""I hope neither of you will misunderstand me.I'm horribly
afraid, but not--but only because this fellow will make me look absurd."I cannot bear to
have him laugh, also!Heywood clapped him on the shoulder, and gave a queer cough."If that's all, never you fear!'Once in a
while we can finish in style.'Eh?--Rudie, you blooming German, I--I
think we must have been brothers!Heywood spoke with a strange alacrity, and tried again to cough.This
time, however, there was no mistake--he was laughing.Rudolph shot at him one glance of startled unbelief, and then, tossing
his head, marched on without a word.The two at his side were no companions--not even presences.He
went alone, conscious only of the long flood of sunset, and the black
interlacing pattern of bamboos.The one friendly spirit had deserted,
laughing; yet even this last and worst of earthly puzzles did not
matter.It was true, what he had read; this, which they called death,
was a lonely thing.On a broken stone bench, Sturgeon, sober and dejected, with puffy
circles under his eyes, sat waiting.A long parcel, wrapped in green
baize, lay across his knees.At his
feet wandered a path, rankly matted with burnt weeds, and bordered with
green bottle-ends, the "dimples" choked with discs of mud.The place was
a deserted garden, where the ruins of a European house--burnt by natives
in some obscure madness, years ago--sprawled in desolation among wild
shrubs.A little way down the path stood Teppich and Chantel, each with
his back turned and his hands clasped, like a pair of sulky Napoleons,
one fat, one slender.The wooden pretense of their attitude set Rudolph,
for an instant, to laughing silently and bitterly.This final
scene,--what justice, that it should be a mean waste, the wreck of silly
pleasure-grounds, long forgotten, and now used only by grotesque
play-actors.He must die, in both action and setting, without dignity.It was some comfort, he became aware, to find that the place was fairly
private.Except for the breach by which they had entered, the blotched
and spotted compound walls stood ruinous yet high, shutting out all but
a rising slant of sunlight, and from some outpost line of shops, near
by, the rattle of an abacus and the broken singsong of argument, now
harsh, now drowsy.Heywood had been speaking earnestly to Sturgeon:--

"A little practice--try the balance of the swords.Most certainly," croaked that battered convivialist.He rose, and waddled down the path.Rudolph saw Chantel turn, frowning,
then nod and smile.The nod was courteous, the smile full of satire."Right-oh," he puffed, tugging from the baize cover a shining pair of
bell-hilted swords.His puffy eyes turned furtively
toward Rudolph."May be bad form, Hackh, but--we all wish you luck, I
fancy."Then, in a burst of candor, "Wish that unspeakable ass felt as
seedy as I do--heat-stroke--drop dead--that sort of thing."Still grumbling treason, this strange second rejoined his principal."Jackets off," commanded Heywood; and in their cinglets, each with sword
under arm, the two friends took shelter behind a ragged clump of
plantains.The yellow leaves, half dead with drought and blight, hung
ponderous as torn strips of sheet metal in the lifeless air.Behind this tattered screen, Rudolph studied, for a moment, the lethal
object in his hand.It was very graceful,--the tapering, three-cornered
blade, with shallow grooves in which blood was soon to run, the silver
hilt where his enemy's father had set, in florid letters, the name of
"H.B.A. Chantel," and a date.How long ago, he thought, the steel
was forged for this day."Come, show me how to begin; so that I
can stand up to him."Slowly, easily, his long limbs transformed with a sudden
youthful grace, Heywood moved through the seven positions of On
Guard.Rudolph learned only that his own clumsy imitation was hopeless."Once more.--He can't see us."Again and again, more and more rapidly, they performed the motions of
this odd rehearsal.Suddenly Heywood stepped back, and lowering his
point, looked into his pupil's face, long and earnestly."For the last time," he said: "won't you let me tell him?Rudolph hung his head, like a stubborn child."Do you still think," he answered coldly, "that I would beg off?"With a hopeless gesture of impatience, Heywood stepped forward briskly.And as their blades clashed softly
together, a quick light danced in his eyes."Here's how our friend will
stick you!"His point cut a swift little circle, and sped home.By a
wild instinct, the novice beat it awkwardly aside.His friend laughed,
poised again, disengaged again, but in mid-career of this heartless
play, stumbled and came pitching forward.Rudolph darted back, swept his
arm blindly, and cried out; for with the full impetus of the mishap, a
shock had run from wrist to elbow.He dropped his sword, and in
stupefaction watched the red blood coursing down his forearm, and his
third finger twitching convulsively, beyond control.I say,
that's a bad one."With a stick and a handkerchief, he twisted on a
tourniquet, muttering condolence: "Pain much?Then, dodging out from the
plantain screen, and beckoning,--"All you chaps!Nesbit came running, but at sight of the bloody victim, pulled up short.he whispered, first with a stare, then a grin of mysterious
joy.Sturgeon gave a sympathetic whistle, and stolidly unwound bandages.At first the two Napoleons remained aloof, but at last, yielding to
indignant shouts, haughtily approached.Heywood wiped his sword-blade very carefully on a plantain leaf; then
stood erect, to address them with a kind of cool severity."I regret this more than anybody," he declared, pausing, and picking his
words."We were at practice, and my friend had the misfortune to be run
through the arm."Chantel flung out his hands, in a motion at once furious and impudent.What a farce!--Will you tell me, please, since your friend has
disabled himself"--

Heywood wheeled upon him, scornfully."You have no right to such an expression," he stated, with a coldness
which conveyed more rage than the other man's heat.It's I who have spoiled your--arrangement, and therefore I am
quite ready to take up my friend's quarrel.""I have no quarrel with you," replied Chantel, contemptuously."You saw
last night how he--"

"He was quicker than I, that's all.By every circumstance, I'm the
natural proxy.Besides"--the young man appealed to the company,
smiling--"besides, what a pity to postpone matters, and spoil the
occasion, when Doctor Chantel has gone to the trouble of a clean shirt."The doctor recoiled, flung up a trembling arm, and as quickly dropped
it.His handsome face burned darker, then faded with a mortal pallor,
and for one rigid moment, took on such a strange beauty as though it
were about to be translated into bronze.His brown fingers twitched,
became all nerves and sinews and white knuckles.Then, stepping
backward, he withdrew from the circle."Since we are all so--irregular.Rudolph gave a choking cry, and would have come forward; but Sturgeon
clung to the wounded arm, and bound on his bandage.he scolded, as though addressing a horse; then
growled in Heywood's ear, "Why did _you_ go lose your temper?"We can't let him walk over us, though."The young man held the
sword across his throat, and whispered, "Only angry up to here!"And indeed, through the anxious preliminary silence, he stood waiting as
cool and ready as a young centurion.His adversary, turning back the sleeves of the unfortunate white linen,
picked up the other sword, and practiced his fingering on the silver
hilt, while the blade answered as delicately as the bow to a violinist.At last he came forward, with thin lips and hard, thoughtful eyes, like
a man bent upon dispatch.Both men saluted formally, and sprang
on guard.From the first twitter of the blades, even Rudolph knew the outcome.Heywood, his face white and anxious in the failing light, fought at full
stretch, at the last wrench of skill.Chantel, for the moment, was
fencing; and though his attacks came ceaseless and quick as flame, he
was plainly prolonging them, discarding them, repeating, varying,
whether for black-hearted merriment, or the vanity of perfect form, or
love of his art.Graceful, safe, easy, as though performing the grand
salute, he teased and frolicked, his bright blade puzzling the sight,
scattering like quicksilver in the endless whirl and clash.Teppich was gaping foolishly, Sturgeon shaking his head, the Cockney,
with narrow body drawn together, watching, shivering, squatting on toes
and finger-tips, like a runner about to spring from a mark.Rudolph,
dizzy with pain and suspense, nursed his forearm mechanically.The
hurried, silver ring of the hilts dismayed him, the dust from the garden
path choked him like an acrid smoke.Suddenly Chantel, dropping low like a deflected arrow, swooped in with
fingers touching the ground.On "three feet," he had delivered the blow
so long withheld.But Heywood, by some
desperate sleight, had parried the certainty, and even tried a riposte.Still afoot and fighting, he complained testily above the sword-play:--

"Don't shout like that!Above the sword-play, too, came gradually a murmur of voices.Through
the dust, beyond the lunging figures, Rudolph was distantly aware of
crowded bodies, of yellow faces grinning or agape, in the breach of the
compound wall.Men of the neighboring hamlet had gathered, to watch the
foreign monsters play at this new, fantastic game.Shaven heads bobbed,
saffron arms pointed, voices, sharp and guttural, argued scornfully.The hilts rang, the blades grated faster.But now it was plain that
Heywood could do no more, by luck or inspiration.Fretted by his clumsy
yet strong and close defense, Chantel was forcing on the end.Instantly, all saw the weaker blade fly wide, the
stronger swerve, to dart in victorious,--and then saw Doctor Chantel
staggering backward, struck full in the face by something round and
heavy.Another struck a bottle-end, and burst into milk-white fragments, like a
bomb.A third, rebounding from Teppich's girdle, left him bent and
gasping.Strange yells broke out, as from a tribe of apes.The air was
thick with hurtling globes.Cocoanuts rained upon the company,
tempestuously, as though an invisible palm were shaken by a hurricane.Among them flew sticks, jagged lumps of sun-dried clay, thick scales
of plaster.cried Nesbit, "the bloomin' coolies!"First to recover, he
skipped about, fielding and hurling back cocoanuts.A small but raging phalanx crowded the gap in the wall, throwing
continually, howling, and exhorting one another to rush in.cried Heywood, and started, sword in hand.But it was Nesbit who, wrenching a pair of loose bottles from the path,
brandishing them aloft like clubs, and shouting the unseemly
battle-cries of a street-fighter, led the white men into this deadly
breach.At the first shock, the rioters broke and scattered, fled round
corners of the wall, crashed through bamboos, went leaping across
paddy-fields toward the river.The tumult--except for lonely howls in
the distance--ended as quickly as it had risen.The little band of
Europeans returned from the pursuit, drenched with sweat, panting, like
a squad of triumphant football players; but no one smiled."That explains it," grumbled Heywood.He pointed along the path to
where, far off, a tall, stooping figure paced slowly toward the town,
his long robe a moving strip of color, faint in the twilight."The
Sword-Pen dropped some remarks in passing."The others nodded moodily, too breathless for reply.Nesbit's forehead
bore an ugly cut, Rudolph's bandage was red and sopping.Chantel, more
rueful than either, stared down at a bleeding hand, which held two
shards of steel.He had fallen, and snapped his sword in the rubble of
old masonry."No more blades," he said, like a child with a broken toy; "there are no
more blades this side of Saigon."Heywood mopped his dripping and fiery cheeks.He tossed a piece of silver to one who wailed in the ditch,--a forlorn
stranger from Hai-nan, lamenting the broken shells and empty baskets of
his small venture.--"Contribution, you chaps.A bad day for imported
cocoanuts.Wish I carried some money: this chit system is
damnable.--Meanwhile, doctor, won't you forget anything I was rude
enough to say?And come join me in a peg at the club?CHAPTER X


THREE PORTALS

Not till after dinner, that evening, did Rudolph rouse from his stupor.With the clerk, he lay wearily in the upper chamber of Heywood's house.The host, with both his long legs out at window, sat watching the smoky
lights along the river, and now and then cursing the heat."After all," he broke silence, "those cocoanuts came time enough."said Nesbit, jauntily; and fingering the plaster
cross on his wounded forehead, drawled: "You might think I'd done a bit
o' dueling myself, by the looks.--But I had _some_ part.But for me, you might never have
thought o' that--"

"Idiot!"snapped Heywood, and pulling in his legs, rose and stamped
across the room.A glass of ice and tansan smashed on the floor.Rudolph was on foot,
clutching his bandaged arm as though the hurt were new.Felt soles scuffed in the darkness, and through the door, his yellow
face wearing a placid and lofty grin, entered Ah Pat, the compradore."One coolie-man hab-got chit."He handed a note to his master, who snatched it as though glad of the
interruption, bent under the lamp, and scowled.The writing was in a crabbed, antique German character:--

"Please to see bearer, in bad clothes but urgent._Um Gottes willen_--" It straggled off, illegible.The signature, "Otto
Wutzler," ran frantically into a blot."You talkee he, come topside."The messenger must have been waiting, however, at the stairhead; for no
sooner had the compradore withdrawn, than a singular little coolie
shuffled into the room.Lean and shriveled as an opium-smoker, he wore
loose clothes of dirty blue,--one trousers-leg rolled up.The brown
face, thin and comically small, wore a mask of inky shadow under a
wicker bowl hat.His eyes were cast down in a strange fashion, unlike
the bold, inquisitive peering of his countrymen,--the more strange, in
that he spoke harshly and abruptly, like a racer catching breath.His dialect was the vilest and surliest form of the
colloquial "Clear Speech.""You can speak and act more civilly," retorted Heywood, "or taste the
bamboo."The man did not answer, or look up, or remove his varnished hat.Still
downcast and hang-dog, he sidled along the verge of the shadow, snatched
from the table the paper and a pencil, and choosing the darkest part of
the wall, began to write.The lamp stood between him and the company:
Heywood alone saw--and with a shock of amazement--that he did not print
vertically as with a brush, but scrawled horizontally.He tossed back
the paper, and dodged once more into the gloom.The postscript ran in the same shaky hand:--

"Send way the others both."cried the young master of the house; and then over his shoulder,
"Excuse us a moment--me, I should say."He led the dwarfish coolie across the landing, to the deserted
dinner-table.The creature darted past him, blew out one candle, and
thrust the other behind a bottle, so that he stood in a wedge of shadow."Eng-lish speak I ver' badt," he whispered; and then with something
between gasp and chuckle, "but der _pak-wa_ goot, no?When der live
dependt, zo can mann--" He caught his breath, and trembled in a
strong seizure.You
_are_ a coolie"--Wutzler's conical wicker-hat ducked as from a blow.I mean, you're--"

The shrunken figure pulled itself together."You are right," he whispered, in the vernacular."To-night I am a
coolie--all but the eyes.Heywood stepped back to the door, and popped his head out.All day I ran
about the town, finding out.The trial of Chok Chung, your--_our_
Christian merchant--I saw him 'cross the hall.'They kept asking, 'Do
you follow the foreign dogs and goats?'But he would only answer, 'I
follow the Lord Jesus.'So then they beat out his teeth with a heavy
shoe, and cast him into prison.Now they wait, to see if his padre will
interfere with the law.The suit is certainly brought by
Fang the scholar, whom they call the Sword-Pen.""That much," said Heywood, "I could have told you."Wutzler glanced behind him fearfully, as though the flickering shadows
might hear.Since dark I ran everywhere, watching, listening to
gossip.I painted my skin with mangrove-bark water.He patted his right leg, where the roll of trousers bound his
thigh.It says, 'I am a
Heaven-and-Earth man.'"The other faltered, and hung his head."My--my wife's cousin, he is a Grass
Sandal.He taught her the verses at home, for safety.--We mean no harm,
now, we of the Triad.But there is another secret band, having many of
our signs.Fang the scholar heads their
lodge.They meet to-night," said the outcast, in sudden grief and
passion.Are _you_ married to
these people?Does the knowledge come so cheap, or at a price?All these
years--darkness--sunken--alone"--He trembled violently, but regained his
voice.This very night they swear in recruits, and set the
day."Right," said Heywood, curtly.Wutzler's head dropped on his breast again.The varnished hat gleamed
softly in the darkness."I--I dare not stay," he sobbed.You came away without it!--We sit tight, then, and wait in
ignorance."The droll, withered face, suddenly raised, shone with great tears that
streaked the mangrove stain."My head sits loosely already, with what I have done to-night.I found a
listening place--next door: a long roof.You can hear and see them--But
I could not stay."I didn't mean--Here, have
a drink."The man drained the tumbler at a gulp; stood without a word, sniffing
miserably; then of a sudden, as though the draught had worked, looked up
bold and shrewd."Do _you_ dare go to the place I show you, and
hide?Heywood started visibly, paused, then laughed."_Tu quoque_ is good argument.Can you smuggle
me?--Then come on."He stepped lightly across the landing, and called
out, "You chaps make yourselves at home, will you?And as he followed the
slinking form downstairs, he grumbled, "If at all, perhaps."The moon still lurked behind the ocean, making an aqueous pallor above
the crouching roofs.The two men hurried along a "goat" path, skirted
the town wall, and stole through a dark gate into a darker maze of
lonely streets.Drawing nearer to a faint clash of cymbals in some
joss-house, they halted before a blind wall."In the first room," whispered the guide, "a circle is drawn on the
floor.Put your right foot there, and say, 'We are all in-the-circle
men,' If they ask, remember: you go to pluck the White Lotus.These men
hate it, they are Triad brothers, they will let you pass.You come from
the East, where the Fusang cocks spit orient pearls; you studied in the
Red Flower Pavilion; your eyes are bloodshot because"--He lectured
earnestly, repeating desperate nonsense, over and over.They held a hurried catechism in the dark."There," sighed Wutzler, at last, "that is as much as we can hope.They will pass you through hidden ways.--But you are very
rash.Receiving no answer, he sighed more heavily, and gave a complicated
knock.Bars clattered within, and a strip of dim light widened.said a harsh but guarded voice, with a strong Hakka brogue."A brother," answered the outcast, "to pluck the White Lotus.Aid,
brothers.--Go in, I can help no further.If you are caught, slide down,
and run westward to the gate which is called the Meeting of
the Dragons."Beside a leaf-point flame of peanut-oil,
a broad, squat giant sat stiff and still against the opposite wall, and
stared with cruel, unblinking eyes.If the stranger were the first white
man to enter, this motionless grim janitor gave no sign.On the earthen
floor lay a small circle of white lime.Heywood placed his right foot
inside it."We are all in-the-circle men."Out from shadow glided a tall native with a halberd, who opened a door
in the far corner.In the second room, dim as the first, burned the same smoky orange light
on the same table.But here a twisted <DW36>, his nose long and
pendulous with elephantiasis, presided over three cups of tea set in a
row.Heywood lifted the central cup, and drank.asked the second guard, in a soft and husky
bass.As he spoke, the great nose trembled slightly."No, I will bite ginger," replied the white man."It is a melon-face--a green face with a red heart.""Pass," said the <DW36>, gently.He pulled a cord--the nose quaking
with this exertion--and opened the third door.A venerable man in gleaming silks--a
grandfather, by his drooping rat-tail moustaches--sat fanning himself.In the breath of his black fan, the lamplight tossed queer shadows
leaping, and danced on the table of polished camagon.Except for this
unrest, the aged face might have been carved from yellow soapstone.But
his slant eyes were the sharpest yet."You have come far," he said, with sinister and warning courtesy.Too far, thought Heywood, in a sinking heart; but answered:--

"From the East, where the Fusang cocks spit orient pearls.""The book," said Heywood, holding his wits by his will, "the book was
Ten Thousand Thousand Pages.""The waters of the deluge crosswise flow.""And what"--the aged voice
rose briskly--"what saw you on the waters?""The Eight Abbots, floating," answered Heywood, negligently.--"But," ran
his thought, "he'll pump me dry.""Why," continued the examiner, "do you look so happy?"It seemed a hopeful sign; but
the keen old eyes were far from satisfied."Why have you such a sensual face?""Pass," said the old man, regretfully.And Heywood, glancing back from
the mouth of a dark corridor, saw him, beside the table of camagon,
wagging his head like a judge doubtful of his judgment.The narrow passage, hot, fetid, and blacker than the wholesome night
without, crooked about sharp corners, that bruised the wanderer's hands
and arms.Suddenly he fell down a short flight of slimy steps, landing
in noisome mud at the bottom of some crypt.A trap, a suffocating well,
he thought; and rose filthy, choked with bitterness and disgust.Only
the taunting justice of Wutzler's argument, the retort _ad hominem_, had
sent him headlong into this dangerous folly.He had scolded a coward
with hasty words, and been forced to follow where they led.Behind him, a door closed, a bar scraped softly into
place.Before him, as he groped in rage and self-reproach, rose a vault
of solid plaster, narrow as a chimney.But presently, glancing upward, he saw a small cluster of stars
blinking, voluptuous, immeasurably overhead.Their pittance of light, as
his eyesight cleared, showed a ladder rising flat against the wall.He
reached up, grasped the bamboo rungs, hoisted with an acrobatic wrench,
and began to climb cautiously.Above, faint and muffled, sounded a murmur of voices.CHAPTER XI


WHITE LOTUS

He was swarming up, quiet as a thief, when his fingers clawed the bare
plaster.The ladder hung from the square end of a protruding beam, above
which there were no more rungs.Then, to his great relief, something blacker than the starlight gathered
into form over his head,--a slanting bulk, which gradually took on a
familiar meaning.He chuckled, reached for it, and fingering the rough
edge to avoid loose tiles, hauled himself up to a foothold on the beam,
and so, flinging out his arms and hooking one knee, scrambled over and
lay on a ribbed and mossy surface, under the friendly stars.The outcast
and his strange brethren had played fair: this was the long roof, and
close ahead rose the wall of some higher building, an upright blackness
from which escaped two bits of light,--a right angle of hairbreadth
lines, and below this a brighter patch, small and ragged.Here, louder,
but confused with a gentle scuffing of feet, sounded the voices of the
rival lodge.Toward these he crawled, stopping at every creak of the tiles.Once a
broken roll snapped off, and slid rattling down the roof.He sat up,
every muscle ready for the sudden leap and shove that would send him
sliding after it into the lower darkness.It fell but a short distance,
into something soft.Gradually he relaxed, but lay very still.Nothing
followed; no one had heard.He tried again, crawled forward his own length, and brought up snug and
safe in the angle where roof met wall.The voices and shuffling feet
were dangerously close.He sat up, caught a shaft of light full in his
face, and peered in through the ragged chink.Two legs in bright,
wrinkled hose, and a pair of black shoes with thick white soles, blocked
the view.For a long time they shifted, uneasy and tantalizing.He could
hear only a hubbub of talk,--random phrases without meaning.The legs
moved away, and left a clear space.But at the same instant, a grating noise startled him, directly
overhead, out of doors.The thin right angle of light spread instantly
into a brilliant square.With a bang, a wooden shutter slid open.Heywood lay back swiftly, just as a long, fat bamboo pipe, two sleeves,
and the head of a man in a red silk cap were thrust out into the
night air."_ sighed the man, and puffed at his bamboo.Heywood tried to blot himself against the wall.The lounger, propped on
elbows, finished his smoke, spat upon the tiles, and remained, a pensive
silhouette."_ he sighed again; then knocking out the bamboo, drew in his
head.Not until the shutter slammed, did Heywood shake the burning
sparks from his wrist.In the same movement, however, he raised head and shoulders to spy
through the chink.This time the bright-hosed legs were gone.He saw
clear down a brilliant lane of robes and banners, multicolored, and
shining with embroidery and tinsel,--a lane between two ranks of crowded
men, who, splendid with green and blue and yellow robes of ceremony,
faced each other in a strong lamplight, that glistened on their oily
cheeks.Under the crowded rows of shaven
foreheads, their eyes blinked, deep-set and expectant.At the far end of
the loft, through two circular arches or giant hoops of rattan, Heywood
at last descried a third arch, of swords; beyond this, a tall incense
jar smouldering gray wisps of smoke, beside a transverse table twinkling
with candles like an altar; and over these, a black image with a pale,
carved face, seated bolt upright before a lofty, intricate, gilded
shrine of the Patriot War-God.A tall man in dove-gray silk with a high scarlet turban moved athwart
the altar, chanting as he solemnly lifted one by one a row of symbols: a
round wooden measure, heaped with something white, like rice, in which
stuck a gay cluster of paper flags; a brown, polished abacus; a mace
carved with a dragon, another carved with a phoenix; a rainbow robe,
gleaming with the plumage of Siamese kingfishers.All these, and more,
he displayed aloft and replaced among the candles.When his chant ended, a brisk little man in yellow stepped forward into
the lane."O Fragrant Ones," he shrilled, "I bring ten thousand recruits, to join
our army and swear brotherhood.Behind him, a squad of some dozen barefoot wretches, in coolie clothes,
with queues un-plaited, crawled on all fours through the first arch.They crouched abject, while the tall Master of Incense in the dove-gray
silk sternly examined their sponsor.In the outer darkness, Heywood craned and listened till neck and
shoulders ached.He could make nothing of the florid verbiage.With endless ritual, the crawling novices reached the arch of swords.They knelt, each holding above his head a lighted bundle of
incense-sticks,--red sparks that quivered like angry fireflies.Above
them the tall Master of Incense thundered:--

"O Spirits of the Hills and Brooks, the Land, the swollen seeds of the
ground, and all the Veins of Earth; O Thou, young Bearer of the Axe that
cleared the Hills; O Imperial Heaven, and ye, Five Dragons of the Five
Regions, with all the Holy Influences who pass and instantly re-pass
through unutterable space:--draw near, record our oath, accept the
draught of blood."He raised at arm's length a heavy baton, which, with a flowing movement,
unrolled to the floor a bright yellow scroll thickly inscribed.From
this he read, slowly, an interminable catalogue of oaths.Heywood could
catch only the scolding sing-song of the responses:--

"If any brother shall break this, let him die beneath ten thousand
knives.""--Who violates this, shall be hurled down into the great sky.""--Let thunder from the Five Regions annihilate him."Silence followed, broken suddenly by the frenzied squawking of a fowl,
as suddenly cut short.Near the chink, Heywood heard a quick struggling
and beating.The shutter grated open, a flood of light poured out.Within reach, in that radiance, a pair of sinewy yellow hands gripped
the neck of a white cock.The wretched bird squawked once more, feebly,
flapped its wings, and clawed the air, just as a second pair of arms
reached out and sliced with a knife.The cock's head flew off upon the
tiles.Hot blood spattered on Heywood's cheek.Half blinded, but not
daring to move, he saw the knife withdrawn, and a huge goblet held out
to catch the flow.Then arms, goblet, and convulsive wings jerked out of
sight, and the shutter slid home."Twice they've not seen me," thought Heywood.It was darker, here, than
he had hoped.He rose more boldly to the peep-hole.Under the arch of swords, the new recruits, now standing upright,
stretched one by one their wrists over the goblet.The Incense Master
pricked each yellow arm, to mingle human blood with the blood of the
white cock; then, from a brazen vessel, filled the goblet to the brim.It passed from hand to hand, like a loving-cup.Each novice raised it,
chanted some formula, and drank.Suddenly, in the pale face of the black image seated before the shrine,
the eyes turned, scanning the company with a cold contempt.The voice, level and ironic, was that of Fang, the Sword-Pen:--

"O Fragrant Ones, when shall the foreign monsters perish like this
cock?"A man in black, with a red wand, bowed and answered harshly:--

"The time, Great Elder Brother, draws at hand.""The hour," replied the Red Wand, "shall be when the Black Dog barks."Heywood pressed his ear against the chink, and listened, his five senses
fused into one.No answer came, but presently a rapid, steady clicking, strangely
familiar and commonplace.The Red Wand stood by the
abacus, rattling the brown beads with flying fingers, like a shroff.Plainly, it was no real calculation, but a ceremony before the answer.The listener clapped his ear to the crevice.Would that answer, he
wondered, be a month, a week, to-morrow?The shutter banged, the light streamed, down went Heywood against the
plaster.Thick dregs from the goblet splashed on the tiles.A head, the
flattened profile of the brisk man in yellow, leaned far out from the
little port-hole.Grunting, he shook the inverted cup, let it dangle
from his hands, stared up aimlessly at the stars, and then--to Heywood's
consternation--dropped his head to meditate, looking straight down."He sees me," thought Heywood, and held himself ready, trembling.But
the fellow made no sign, the broad squat features no change.The pose
was that of vague, comfortable thought.Yet his vision seemed to rest,
true as a plumb-line, on the hiding-place.Was he in doubt?--he could
reach down lazily, and feel.Worst of all, the greenish pallor in the eastern sky had imperceptibly
turned brighter; and now the ribbed edge of a roof, across the way,
began to glow like incandescent silver.The head and the dangling goblet were slowly pulled in, just before the
moonlight, soft and sullen through the brown haze of the heat, stole
down the wall and spread upon the tiles.But
Heywood drew a free breath: those eyes had been staring into vacancy."Now, then," he thought, and sat up to the cranny; for the rattle of the
abacus had stopped."The counting is complete," announced the Red Wand slowly, "the hours
are numbered.The day--"

Movement, shadow, or nameless instinct, made the listener glance upward
swiftly.He caught the gleam of yellow silk, the poise and downward jab,
and with a great heave of muscles went shooting down the slippery
channel of the cock's blood.A spearhead grazed his scalp, and smashed
a tile behind him.As he rolled over the edge, the spear itself whizzed
by him into the dark."The chap saw," he thought, in mid-air; "beastly clever--all the time--"

He landed on the spear-shaft, in a pile of dry rubbish, snatched up the
weapon, and ran, dimly conscious of a quiet scurrying behind and above
him, of silent men tumbling after, and doors flung violently open.He raced blindly, but whipped about the next corner, leaving the moon at
his back.Westward, somebody had told him, to the gate where
dragons met.There had been no uproar; but running his hardest down the empty
corridors of the streets, he felt that the pack was gaining.Ahead
loomed something gray, a wall, the end of a blind alley.Scale it, or
make a stand at the foot,--he debated, racing.Before the decision came,
a man popped out of the darkness.Heywood shifted his grip, drew back
the spear, but found the stranger bounding lightly alongside, and
muttering,--

"To the west-south, quick!I fool those who follow--"

Obeying, Heywood dove to the left into the black slit of an alley, while
the other fugitive pattered straight on into the seeming trap, with a
yelp of encouragement to the band who swept after.Heywood ran on, fell, rose and ran, fell again, losing
his spear.A pair of trembling hands eagerly helped him to his feet."My cozin's boy, he ron quick," said Wutzler."Dose fellows, dey not
catch him!Wutzler, ready and certain of his
ground, led the tortuous way through narrow and greasy galleries, along
the side of a wall, and at last through an unlighted gate, free of
the town.In the moonlight he stared at his companion, cackled, clapped his
thighs, and bent double in unholy convulsions."Oh, I wait zo fearful, you
kom zo fonny!"For a while he clung, shaking, to the young man's arm."My friendt, zo fonny you look!At last he regained
himself, stood quiet, and added very pointedly, "What did _yow_ lern?"Phew!--Oh, I say, what did they mean?The man became, once more, as keen as
a gossip."I do not know," The conical hat wagged sagely.He
pointed across the moonlit spaces._Schlafen Sie wohl_."The two men wrung each other's hands."Shan't forget this, Wutz.""Oh, for me--all you haf done--" The outcast turned away, shaking his
head sadly.Never did Heywood's fat water-jar glisten more welcome than when he
gained the vaulted bath-room.He ripped off his blood-stained clothes,
scrubbed the sacrificial clots from his hair, and splashed the cool
water luxuriously over his exhausted body.When at last he had thrown a
kimono about him, and wearily climbed the stairs, he was surprised to
see Rudolph, in the white-washed room ahead, pacing the floor and
ardently twisting his little moustache.As Heywood entered, he wheeled,
stared long and solemnly.He stalked forward, and with his sound left
hand grasped Heywood's right."This afternoon, you--"

"My dear boy, it's too hot."This afternoon," he persisted, with tragic voice and eyes, "this
afternoon I nearly was killed.""So was I.--Which seems to meet that."I feel--If you knew what I--My
life--"

The weary stoic in the blue kimono eyed him very coldly, then plucked
him by the sleeve.--"Come here, for a bit."Both men leaned from the window into the hot, airless night.A Chinese
rebeck wailed, monotonous and nasal.Heywood pointed at the moon, which
now hung clearly above the copper haze."The moon," replied his friend, wondering."Good.--You know, I was afraid you might just see Rudie Hackh."The rebeck wailed a long complaint before he added:--

"If I didn't like you fairly well--The point is--Good old Cynthia!That
bally orb may not see one of us to-morrow night, next week, next
quarter.'Through this same Garden, and for us in vain.'CHAPTER XII


THE WAR BOARD

"Rigmarole?"drawled Heywood, and abstained from glancing at Chantel.However, Gilly, their rigmarole _may_ mean business.On that
supposition, I made my notes urgent to you chaps."Forrester, tugging his gray moustache, and
studying the floor.Rigmarole or not, your plan is
thoroughly sound: stock one house, and if the pinch comes, fortify."Chantel drummed on Heywood's long table, and smiled quaintly, with eyes
which roved out at window, and from mast to bare mast of the few small
junks that lay moored against the distant bank.He bore himself, to-day,
like a lazy cock of the walk.The rest of the council, Nesbit, Teppich,
Sturgeon, Kempner, and the great snow-headed padre, surrounded the table
with heat-worn, thoughtful faces.When they looked up, their eyes went
straight to Heywood at the head; so that, though deferring to his
elders, the youngest man plainly presided.Chantel turned suddenly, merrily, his teeth flashing in a laugh."If we are then afraid, let us all take a jonc down the river," he
scoffed, "or the next vessel for Hongkong!"Gilly's tired, honest eyes saw only the plain statement."We can't run away from a rumor,
you know.But we should lose face no
end--horribly.""Let's come to facts," urged Heywood.To my knowledge, one pair of good rifles, mine and Sturgeon's.Ammunition--uncertain, but limited.Two revolvers: my Webley.450, and
that little thing of Nesbit's, which is not man-stopping.Every one but you, padre: fit only for spring snipe, anyway, or bamboo
partridge.Hackh has just taken over, from this house, the only real
weapons in the settlement--one dozen old Mausers, Argentine, calibre.765.My predecessor left 'em, and three cases of cartridges.I've kept
the guns oiled, and will warrant the lot sound.--Now, who'll lend me
spare coolies, and stuff for sand-bags?"Forrester looked up, with an injured air."As the
senior here, except Dr.Earle, I naturally thought the choice would be
my house."cried two or three voices from the foot of the table."It
should be--Farthest off--"

All talked at once, except Chantel, who eyed them leniently, and smiled
as at so many absurd children.Kempner--a pale, dogged man, with a
pompous white moustache which pouted and bristled while he spoke--rose
and delivered a pointless oration."Ignoring race and creed," he droned,
"we must stand together--"

Heywood balanced a pencil, twirled it, and at last took to drawing.On
the polished wood he scratched, with great pains, the effigy of a pig,
whose snout blared forth a gale of quarter-notes.he muttered; then resumed, as if no one had interrupted:
"Very good of you, Gilly.But with your permission, I see five
points.--Here's a rough sketch, made some time ago."He tossed on the table a sheet of paper.Forrester spread it, frowning,
while the others leaned across or craned over his chair."All out of whack, you see," explained the draughtsman; "but here are my
points, Gilly.One: your house lies quite inland, with four sides to
defend: the river and marsh give Rudie's but two and a fraction.Not hardly: we'd soon stop that, as you'll see, if they dare.Anyhow,--point two,--your house is all hillocks behind, and shops
roundabout: here's just one low ridge, and the rest clear field.Third:
the Portuguese built a well of sorts in the courtyard; water's deadly, I
dare say, but your place has no well whatever.And as to four,
suppose--in a sudden alarm, say, those cut off by land could run another
half-chance to reach the place by river.--By the way, the nunnery has a
bell to ring."Gilbert Forrester shoved the map along to his neighbor, and cleared his
throat."Gentlemen," he declared slowly, "you once did me the honor to say that
in--in a certain event, you would consider me as acting head.Frankly, I
confess, my plans were quite--ah!--vague.I wish to--briefly, to resign,
in favor of this young--ah--bachelor.""Don't go rotting me," complained Heywood, and his sallow cheeks turned
ruddy.And five is this: your
compound's very cramped, where the nunnery could shelter the goodly
blooming fellowship of native converts."Chantel laughed heartily, and stretched his legs at ease under the
table.[Illustration: Portuguese Nunnery:--Sketch Map.]he chuckled, preening his moustache."Your mythical
siege--it will be brief!For me, I vote no to that: no rice-Christians
filling their bellies--eating us into a surrender!"He made a pantomime
of chop-sticks.One or two nodded, approving the retort.Heywood, slightly lifting his
chin, stared at the speaker coldly, down the length of their
council-board."Our everlasting shame, then," he replied quietly."It will be
everlasting, if we leave these poor devils in the lurch, after cutting
them loose from their people.Excuse me, padre, but it's no time to
mince our words.The padre, who had looked up, looked down quickly,
musing, and smoothed his white hair with big fingers that
somewhat trembled."Besides," continued the speaker, in a tone of apology, "we'll need 'em
to man the works.Meantime, you chaps must lend coolies, eh?With rising spirits, he traced an eager finger along the map."I must
run a good strong bamboo scaffold along the inside wall, with plenty of
sand-bags ready for loopholing--specially atop the servants' quarters
and pony-shed, and in that northeast angle, where we'll throw up a
mound or platform.--What do you say?Chantel, humming a tune, reached for his helmet, and rose.He paused,
struck a match, and in an empty glass, shielding the flame against the
breeze of the punkah, lighted a cigarette."Since we have appointed our dictator," he began amiably, "we may
repose--"

From the landing, without, a coolie bawled impudently for the master of
the house.He was gone a noticeable time, but came back smiling.He held aloft a scrap of Chinese paper, scrawled on
with pencil.They wait for more
ammunition--'more shoots,' the text has it.The Hak Kau--their Black
Dog--is a bronze cannon, nine feet long, cast at Rotterdam in 1607.He
writes, 'I saw it in shed last night, but is gone to-day.Gentlemen, for a timid man, our friend does not scamp his reports.Chantel, still humming, had moved toward the door.All at once he
halted, and stared from the landward window.Cymbals clashed
somewhere below.The noise drew nearer, more brazen,
and with it a clatter of hoofs.Heywood spoke with
a slow, mischievous drawl; but he crossed the room quickly.Below, by the open gate, a gay grotesque rider reined in a piebald pony,
and leaning down, handed to the house-boy a ribbon of scarlet paper.Behind him, to the clash of cymbals, a file of men in motley robes
swaggered into position, wheeled, and formed the ragged front of a
Falstaff regiment.Overcome by the scarlet ribbon, the long-coated "boy"
bowed, just as through the gate, like a top-heavy boat swept under an
arch, came heaving an unwieldy screened chair, borne by four broad men:
not naked and glistening coolies, but "Tail-less Horses" in proud
livery.Before they could lower their shafts, Heywood ran clattering
down the stairs.Slowly, cautiously, like a little fat old woman, there clambered out
from the broadcloth box a rotund man, in flowing silks, and a conical,
tasseled hat of fine straw.He waddled down the compound path, shading
with his fan a shrewd, bland face, thoughtful, yet smooth as a babe's.The watchers in the upper room saw Heywood greet him with extreme
ceremony, and heard the murmur of "Pray you, I pray you," as with
endless bows and deprecations the two men passed from sight, within the
house.The visitor did not join the company, but
from another room, now and then, sounded his clear-pitched voice, full
of odd and courteous modulations.When at last the conference ended, and
their unmated footsteps crossed the landing, a few sentences echoed from
the stairway."That is all," declared the voice, pleasantly."The Chow Ceremonial
says, 'That man is unwise who knowingly throws away precious things.'And in the Analects we read, 'There is merit in dispatch.'"Heywood's reply was lost, except the words, "stupid people.""In every nation," agreed the placid voice.What says the
Viceroy of Hupeh: 'They see a charge of bird-shot, and think they are
tasting broiled owl.'"A safe walk, Your Excellency."The cymbals struck up, the cavalcade, headed by ragamuffin lictors with
whips, went swaying past the gate.Heywood, when he returned,
was grinning."Hates this station, I fancy, much
as we hate it.""Intimated he could beat me at chess," laughed the young man, "and will
bet me a jar of peach wine to a box of Manila cigars!"Chantel, from a derisive dumb-show near the window, had turned to waddle
solemnly down the room.At sight of Heywood's face he stopped guiltily.All the laughter was gone from the voice and the hard gray
eyes."Yesterday we humored you tin-soldier fashion, but to-day let's
put away childish things.--I like that magistrate, plainly, a damned
deal better than I like you.When you or I show one half his ability,
we're free to mock him--in my house."For the first time within the memory of any man present, the mimic
wilted."I--I did not know," he stammered, "that old man was your friend."Very
quiet, and a little flushed, he took his seat among the others.Still more quiet, Heywood appealed to the company."Part for his hard luck--stuck down, a three-year term, in this
neglected hole.Fang, the Sword-Pen, in
great favor up there.--What?The dregs of the town are all stirred
up--bottomside topside--danger point.He, in case--you know--can't give
us any help.His chief's fairly itching to
cashier him.--Spoke highly of your hospital work, padre, but said, 'Even
good deeds may be misconstrued.'--In short, gentlemen, without saying a
word, he tells us honestly in plain terms, 'Sorry, but look out for
yourselves.'"A beggar rattled his bowl of cash in the road, below; from up the river
sounded wailing cries."Did he mention," said the big padre, presently, "the case against my
man, Chok Chung?"Heywood's eyes became evasive, his words reluctant."The magistrate dodged that--that unpleasant subject.Without rising, he seemed to
grow in bulk and stature, and send his vision past the company, into
those things which are not, to confound the things which are.'He buries His workmen, but carries on
His work.'"The man spoke in a heavy, broken voice, as though it were
his body that suffered."But it comes hard to hear, from a young man, so
good a friend, after many years"--The deep-set eyes returned, and with a
sudden lustre, made a sharp survey from face to face."If I have made my
flock a remnant--aliens--rejected--tell me, what shall I do?I
have shut eyes and conscience, and never meddled, never!--not even when
money was levied for the village idols.And here's a man beaten, cast
into prison--"

He shoved both fists out on the table, and bowed his white head.But yours--and his.--To keep one, I desert the
other."We're all quite helpless," said Heywood, gently.It's a long
way to the nearest gunboat.""Tell me," repeated the other, stubbornly.At the same moment it happened that the cries came louder along the
river-bank, and that some one bounded up the stairs.All morning he had gone about his errands very
calmly, playing the man of action, in a new philosophy learned
overnight.But now he forgot to imitate his teacher, and darted in, so
headlong that all the dogs came with him, bouncing and barking."Look," he called, stumbling toward the farther window, while Flounce
the terrier and a wonk puppy ran nipping at his heels.CHAPTER XIII


THE SPARE MAN

Beyond the scant greenery of Heywood's garden--a ropy little banyan, a
low rank of glossy whampee leaves, and the dusty sage-green tops of
stunted olives--glared the river.Wide, savage sunlight lay so hot upon
it, that to aching eyes the water shone solid, like a broad road of
yellow clay.Only close at hand and by an effort of vision, appeared the
tiny, quiet lines of the irresistible flood pouring toward the sea;
there whipped into the pool of banyan shade black snippets and tails of
reflection, darting ceaselessly after each other like a shoal of
frightened minnows.But elsewhere the river lay golden, solid, and
painfully bright.Things afloat, in the slumberous procession of all
Eastern rivers, swam downward imperceptibly, now blurred, now outlined
in corrosive sharpness.The white men stood crowding along the spacious window.The dogs barked
outrageously; but at last above their din floated, as before, the high
wailing cries.A heaping cairn of round-bellied, rosy-pink earthen jars
came steering past, poled by a naked statue of new copper, who balanced
precariously on the edge of his hidden raft.No sound came from him; nor
from the funeral barge which floated next, where still figures in white
robes guarded the vermilion drapery of a bier, decked with vivid green
boughs.After the mourners' barge, at some distance, came hurrying a boat
crowded with shining yellow bodies and dull blue jackets.Long bamboo
poles plied bumping along her gunwale, sticking into the air all about
her, many and loose and incoordinate, like the ribs of an unfinished
basket.From the bow spurted a white puff of smoke.The dull report of a
musket lagged across the water.The bullet skipped like a schoolboy's pebble, ripping out little rags of
white along that surface of liquid clay.The line of fire thus revealed, revealed the mark.Untouched, a black
head bobbed vigorously in the water, some few yards before the boat.The
saffron crew, poling faster, yelled and cackled at so clean a miss,
while a coolie in the bow reloaded his matchlock.The fugitive head labored like that of a man not used to swimming, and
desperately spent.It now gave a quick twist, and showed a distorted
face, almost of the same color with the water.The mouth gaped black in a sputtering cry, then closed choking,
squirted out water, and gaped once more, to wail clearly:--

"I am Jesus Christ!"In the broad, bare daylight of the river, this lonely and sudden
blasphemy came as though a person in a dream might declare himself to a
waking audience of skeptics.The cry, sharp with forlorn hope, rang like
an appeal."Why--look," stammered Heywood.Just as he turned to elbow through his companions, and just as the cry
sounded again, the matchlock blazed from the bow.The
swimmer, who had reached the shallows, suddenly rose with an incredible
heave, like a leaping salmon, flung one bent arm up and back in the
gesture of the Laocooen, and pitched forward with a turbid splash.The
quivering darkness under the banyan blotted everything: death had
dispersed the black minnows there, in oozy wriggles of shadow; but next
moment the fish-tail stripes chased in a more lively shoal.The gleaming
potter, below his rosy cairn, stared.Heywood, after his impulse of rescue, stood very quiet.The clutching figure, bolt upright in the soaked remnant of prison
rags, had in that leap and fall shown himself for Chok Chung, the
Christian.He had sunk in mystery, to become at one forever with the
drunken cormorant-fisher.Obscene delight raged in the crowded boat, with yells and laughter, and
flourish of bamboo poles."Come away from the window," said Heywood; and then to the white-haired
doctor: "Your question's answered, padre.He
jerked his thumb back toward the river.Nonsense--Cat--and--mouse game, I tell you; those devils let
him go merely to--We'll never know--Of course!Plain as your nose--To
stand by, and never lift a hand!Look here,
why--Acquitted, then set on him--But we'll _never_ know!--Fang watching
on the spot.A calm "boy," in sky-blue gown, stood beside them, ready to speak.The
dispute paused, while they turned for his message.It was a
disappointing trifle: Mrs.Forrester waited below for her husband, to
walk home."Can't leave now," snapped Gilly."I'll be along, tell her--"

"Had she better go alone?"The other swept a fretful eye about the company."But this business begins to look urgent.--Here, somebody we can spare.You go, Hackh, there's a good chap."Chantel dropped the helmet he had caught up.Bowing stiffly, Rudolph
marched across the room and down the stairs.His face, pale at the late
spectacle, had grown red and sulky, "Can spare me, can you?--I'm the
one."Viewing himself thus, morosely, as rejected of men, he reached the
compound gate to fare no better with the woman.She stood waiting in the
shadow of the wall; and as he drew unwillingly near, the sight of
her--to his shame and quick dismay--made his heart leap in welcome.She
wore the coolest and severest white, but at her throat the same small
furbelow, every line of which he had known aboard ship, in the days of
his first exile and of his recent youth.It was now as though that youth
came flooding back to greet her.He forgot everything, except that for a few priceless
moments they would be walking side by side.She faced him with a start, never so young and beautiful as now--her
blue eyes wide, scornful, and blazing, her cheeks red and lips
trembling, like a child ready to cry."I did not want _you_" she said curtly.Pride forged the retort for him, at a blow.He explained
in the barest of terms, while she eyed him steadily, with every sign of
rising temper."I can spare you, too," she whipped out; then turned to walk away,
holding her helmet erect, in the poise of a young goddess, pert
but warlike.In two strides, however, he
had overtaken her."I am under orders," he stated grimly.Her pace gradually slackened in the growing heat; but she went forward
with her eyes fixed on the littered, sunken flags of their path.This
rankling silence seemed to him more unaccountable and deadly than all
former mischances, and left him far more alone.From the sultry tops of
bamboos, drooping like plants in an oven, an amorous multitude of
cicadas maintained the buzzing torment of steel on emery wheels, as
though the universal heat had chafed and fretted itself into a dry,
feverish utterance.Forrester looked about, quick and angry,
like one ready to choke that endless voice.But for the rest, the two
strange companions moved steadily onward.In an alley of checkered light a buffalo with a wicker nose-ring, and
heavy, sagging horns that seemed to jerk his head back in agony, heaved
toward them, ridden by a naked yellow infant in a nest-like saddle of
green fodder.Scenting with fright the disgusting presence of white
aliens, the sleep-walking monster shied, opened his eyes, and lowered
his blue muzzle as if to charge.said Rudolph, and catching the woman roughly about the
shoulders, thrust her behind him.She clutched him tightly by the
wounded arm.The buffalo stared irresolute, with evil eyes.The naked boy in the
green nest brushed a swarm of flies from his handful of sticky
sweetmeats, looked up, pounded the clumsy shoulders, and shrilled a
command.Staring doubtfully, and trembling, the buffalo swayed past, the
wrinkled armor of his gray hide plastered with dry mud as with yellow
ochre.To the slow click of hoofs, the surly monster, guided by a little
child, went swinging down the pastoral shade,--ancient yet living shapes
from a picture immemorial in art and poetry."Please," begged Rudolph, trying with his left hand to loosen her grip.For a second they stood close, their fingers interlacing.With a touch
of contempt, he found that she still trembled, and drew short breath.She tore her hand loose, as though burned.It _was_
all true, then.She caught aside her skirts angrily, and started forward in all her
former disdain.But this, after their brief alliance, was not to be
tolerated.If anybody
has a right--"

After several paces, she flashed about at him in a whirl of words:--

"All alike, every one of you!And I was fool enough to think you were
different!"The conflict in her eyes showed real, beyond suspicion.And you dare talk of rights, and
come following me here--"

"Lucky I did," retorted Rudolph, with sudden spirit; and holding out his
wounded arm, indignantly: "That scratch, if you know how it came--"

"I know, perfectly."She stared as at some crowning impudence.You came off cheaply.--I know all you said.But the one
thing I'll never understand, is where you found the courage, after he
struck you, at the club.You'll always have _that_ to admire!""After he struck"--A light broke in on Rudolph, somehow.she called, in a strangely altered voice, which brought
him up short.He explained, sulkily at first, but ending in a kind of generous rage."So I couldn't even stand up to him.And except for Maurice Heywood--Oh,
you need not frown; he's the best friend I ever had."Forrester had walked on, with the same cloudy aspect, the same
light, impatient step.He felt the greater surprise when, suddenly
turning, she raised toward him her odd, enticing, pointed face, and the
friendly mischief of her eyes.she echoed, in the same half-whisper as when she had
flattered him, that afternoon in the dusky well of the pagoda stairway.she cried, with a bewildering laugh, of
delight and pride."I hate people all prim and circumspect, and
you--You'd have flown back there straight at him, before my--before all
the others.That's why I like you so!--But you must leave that horrid,
lying fellow to me."All unaware, she had led him along the blinding white wall of the
Forrester compound, and halted in the hot shadow that lay under the
tiled gateway.As though timidly, her hand stole up and rested on
his forearm.The confined space, narrow and covered, gave to her voice a
plaintive ring."That's twice you protected me, and I hurt you.--You
_are_ different.When you
did--that, for me, yesterday, didn't it seem different and rather
splendid, and--like a book?""It seemed nonsense," replied Rudolph, sturdily.She laughed again, and at close range watched him from under consciously
drooping lashes that almost veiled a liquid brilliancy.Everywhere the
cicadas kept the heat vibrating with their strident buzz.It recalled
some other widespread mist of treble music, long ago.The trilling of
frogs, that had been, before."You dear, brave boy," she said slowly.Do you know what I'd like--Oh, there's the _amah!"_

She drew back, with an impatient gesture.Earle's waiting for me.--I hate to leave you."The stealthy brightness of her admiration changed to a slow, inscrutable
appeal.And with an
instant, bold, and tantalizing grimace, she had vanished within.*       *       *       *       *

To his homeward march, her cicadas shrilled the music of fifes.He, the
despised, the man to spare, now cocked up his helmet like fortune's
minion, dizzy with new honors.And now she, she of all the world, had spoken words which he feared and
longed to believe, and which even said still less than her searching and
mysterious look.On the top of his exultation, he reached the nunnery, and entered his
big, bare living-room, to find Heywood stretched in a wicker chair.I've asked myself to tiffin," drawled the lounger, from a
little tempest of blue smoke, tossed by the punkah."How's the fair
Bertha?--Mausers all right?And by the way, did you make that inventory
of provisions?"Rudolph faced him with a sudden conviction of guilt, of treachery to a
leader."Yes," he stammered; "I--I'll get it for you."He passed into his bedroom, caught up the written list from a table, and
for a moment stood as if dreaming.Before him the Mausers, polished and
orderly, shone in their new rack against the lime-coated wall.Though
appearing to scan them, Rudolph saw nothing but his inward confusion."After all this man did for me," he mused.What had loosed the bond,
swept away all the effects?An imp in white and red livery,
Peng, the little billiard-marker from the club, stood hurling things
violently into the outer glare.Some small but heavy object clattered on the floor.The urchin stooped,
snatched it up, and flung it hurtling clean over the garden to the
river.A boat-coolie, he
explained, had called this house bad names.Rudolph flicked a riding-whip at the
scampering legs, as the small defender of his honor bolted for
the stairs.From the road, below, a gleeful voice piped:--

"Goat-men!In the noon blaze, Peng skipped derisively, jeered at them, performed a
brief but indecorous pantomime, and then, kicking up his heels with joy,
scurried for his life."Chucked his billet," said Heywood, without surprise."Little devil, I
always thought--What's missing?"Rudolph scanned his meagre belongings, rummaged his dressing-table,
opened a wardrobe."A boat-coolie--"

But Heywood had darted to the rack of Mausers, knelt, and sprung up,
raging.Man," he cried, in a voice that made Rudolph jump,--"man,
why didn't you stop him?The side-bolts, all but two.--Young heathen,
he's crippled us: one pair of rifles left."CHAPTER XIV


OFF DUTY

The last of the sunlight streamed level through a gap in the western
ridges.It melted, with sinuous, tender shadows, the dry contour of
field and knoll, and poured over all the parching land a liquid,
undulating grace.Like the shadow of clouds on ripe corn, the red tiles
of the village roofs patched the countryside.From the distant sea had
come a breath of air, cool enough to be felt with gratitude, yet so
faint as neither to disturb the dry pulsation of myriad insect-voices,
nor to blur the square mirrors of distant rice-fields, still tropically
blue or icy with reflected clouds.Miss Drake paused on the knoll, and looked about her."This remains the same, doesn't it, for all our troubles?"she said;
then to herself, slowly, "'It is a beauteous evening, calm and free.'"Heywood made no pretense of following her look."'Dear Nun,'" he blurted; "no, how does it go again?--'dear child, that
walkest with me here--'"

The girl started down the <DW72>, with the impatience of one whose mood
is frustrated.The climate had robbed her cheeks of much color, but not,
it seemed, of all."Your fault," said Heywood, impenitent.She laughed, as though glad of this turn.Go on, please, where we left off.Heywood's smile, half earnest, half mischievous, obediently faded.Why, then, of course, I discharged Rudolph's gatekeeper, put
a trusty of my own in his place, sent out to hire a diver, and turned
all hands to hunting.'Obviously,' as Gilly would say.--We picked up two
side-bolts in the garden, by the wall, one in the mud outside, and three
the diver got in shallow water.Total recovered, six; plus two Peng had
no time for, eight.We can ill spare four guns, though; and the affair
shows they keep a beastly close watch.""Yes," said Miss Drake, absently; then drew a slow breath."Peng was the
most promising pupil we had.""He was," stated her companion, "a little, unmitigated, skipping,
orange-tawny goblin!"As they footed slowly along the winding path,
Flounce, the fox-terrier, who had scouted among strange clumps of
bamboo, now rejoined them briskly, cantering with her fore-legs
delicately stiff and joyful.Miss Drake stooped to pat her, saying:--

"Poor little dog.She rose with a sigh, to add
incongruously, "Oh, the things we dream beforehand, and then the things
that happen!"The jealous terrier scored her dusty paws down his white drill, from
knee to ankle, before he added:--

"You know how the Queen of Heaven won her divinity.""Another," said the girl, "of your heathen stories?""Rather a pretty one," he retorted."It happened in a seaport, a good
many hundred miles up the coast.A poor girl lived there, with her
mother, in a hut.One night a great gale blew, so that everybody was
anxious.Three junks were out somewhere at sea, in that storm.Her sweetheart on board, it would be in a Western
story; but these were only her friends, and kin, and townsmen, that were
at stake.So she lay there in the hut, you see, and couldn't rest.And
then it seemed to her, in the dark, that she was swimming out through
the storm, out and out, and not in the least afraid.She had become
larger, and more powerful, somehow, than the rain, or the dark, or the
whole ocean; for when she came upon the junks tossing there, she took
one in each hand, the third in her mouth, and began to swim for home.But then across the storm she heard her
mother calling in the dark, and had to open her mouth to answer."Well, then her spirit was back in the hut.But next day the two junks
came in; the third one, never.And for that dream, she was made, after
her death, the great and merciful Queen of Heaven."As Heywood ended, they were entering a pastoral village, near the town,
but hidden low under great trees, ancient and widely gnarled."You told that," said Miss Drake, "as though it had really happened.""If you believe, these things have reality; if not, they have none."His
gesture, as he repeated the native maxim, committed him to neither side."Her dream was play, compared to--some.""That," he answered, "is abominably true."The curt, significant tone made her glance at him quickly.In her dark
eyes there was no impatience, but only trouble."We do better," she said, "when we are both busy."He nodded, as though reluctantly agreeing, not so much to the words as
to the silence which followed.The evening peace, which lay on the fields and hills, had flooded even
the village streets.Without pause, without haste, the endless labor of
the day went on as quiet as a summer cloud.Meeting or overtaking,
coolies passed in single file, their bare feet slapping the enormous
flags of antique, sunken granite, their twin baskets bobbing and
creaking to the rhythm of their wincing trot.The yellow muscles rippled
strongly over straining ribs, as with serious faces, and slant eyes
intent on their path, they chanted in pairs the ageless refrain, the
call and answer which make burdens lighter:--


"O heh!--O ha?From hidden places sounded the whir of a jade-cutter's wheel, a
cobbler's rattle, or the clanging music of a forge.Yet everywhere the
slow movements, the faded, tranquil colors,--dull blue garments, dusky
red tiles, deep bronze-green foliage overhanging a vista of subdued
white and gray,--consorted with the spindling shadows and low-streaming
vesper light.Keepers of humble shops lounged in the open air with their
gossips, smoking bright pipes of the Yunnan white copper, nodding and
blinking gravely.Above them, no less courteous and placid, little
doorway shrines besought the Earth-God to lead the Giver of Wealth
within.Sometimes, where a narrow lane gaped opposite a door, small
stone lions sat grinning upon pillars, to scare away the Secret Arrow of
misfortune.But these rarely: the village seemed a happy place, favored
of the Influences.In the grateful coolness men came and went, buying,
joking, offering neighborly advice to chance-met people.A plump woman, who carried two tiny silver fish in an immense flat
basket, grinned at Miss Drake, and pointed roguishly."Her feet are bigger than my
Golden Lilies!"And laughing, she wriggled her own dusty toes, strong,
free, and perfect in modeling.An old, withered barber looked up from shaving a blue forehead, under a
tree."Their women," he growled, "are shameless, and walk everywhere!"But a stern man, bearing a palm-leaf fan and a lark in a cage, frowned
him down."She brought my son safe out of the Three Sicknesses," he declared."Mind your trade, Catcher of Lively Ones!"Then bending over the cage,
with solicitude, he began gently to fan the lark.As Heywood and the
girl paused beside him, he glanced up, and smiled gravely."I give my
pet his airing," he said; and then, quickly but quietly, "When you reach
the town, do not pass through the West Quarter.It is full of
evil-minded persons.A shrill trio of naked boys came racing and squabbling, to offer
grasshoppers for sale."We have seen no placards," replied Heywood."You will to-morrow," said the owner of the lark, calmly; and squatting,
became engrossed in poking a grasshopper between the brown, varnished
splints of the cage."Maker of Music, here is your evening rice."The two companions passed on, with Flounce timidly at heel.Now please, won't
you listen to my advice?No telling when the next ship _will_ call, but
when it does--"

"I can't run away."She spoke as one clinging to a former answer."I
must stand by my dream, such as it used to be--and even such as it is."He eyed her sadly, shook his head, and said no more.For a moment they
halted, where the path broadened on a market-place, part shade, part
luminous with golden dust.A squad of lank boys, kicking miraculously
with flat upturned soles, kept a wicker ball shining in the air, as true
and lively as a plaything on a fountain-jet.Beyond, their tiny juniors,
girls and boys knee-high, and fat tumbling babies in rainbow finery, all
hand-locked and singing, turned their circle inside out and back again,
in the dizzy graces of the "Water Wheel."Other boys, and girls still
trousered and queued like boys, played at hopscotch, in and out among
shoes that lay across the road.All traffic, even the steady trotting
coolies, fetched a lenient compass roundabout.Allow me to pass," begged a coffin-maker's man,
bent under a plank.called another, blocked by the hop-scotch.He was a
brown grass-cutter, who grinned, and fondled a smoky cloth that
buzzed--some tribe of wild bees, captured far afield.He came through safely; for at the same moment the musical "Cling-clank"
of a sweetmeat-seller's bell turned the game into a race.The way was
clear, also, for a tiny, aged collector of paper, flying the gay flag of
an "Exalted Literary Society," and plodding, between two great baskets,
on his pious rounds."Revere and spare," he piped, at intervals,--
"revere and spare the Written Word!"All the bright picture lingered with the two alien wayfarers, long after
they had passed and the sun had withdrawn from their path.In the hoary
peace of twilight,--

"What can _we_ do here?""There--I never meant
to say it.But it runs in my head all the time.I work and work, to keep
it down.Heywood watched her face, set straight before them, and now more clearly
cut in the failing light.Were there only pride in those fine and
resolute lines, it might have been a face from some splendid coin, or
medal of victory."Think, instead, of all the good--"

But at that she seemed to wince.As if there weren't dark streets and crooked children at
home!Oh, the pride and ignorance that sent me here!"She spoke quietly,
with a kind of wonder."Just blind, ignorant feelings, I took them
for--for something too great and mysterious.It's all very strange to
look back on, and try to put into words.I remember painted glass, and
solemn music--and thinking--then!--that I knew this lovely and terrible
world--and its Maker and Master."She looked down the dusky lanes,
where glowworm lanterns began to bob and wink.where you
see the days running into years!""The Dragon's a wise old beast," he ventured.She assented gravely:--

"And in those days I thought it was a dark continent--of lost souls.""There are no dark continents," declared Heywood suddenly, in a broken
voice."The heart of one man--can hold more darkness--You would never
see into it--"

"Don't!"They stood close in the dusk, and a tremor, a wave, passed through them
both."I forgot--I couldn't help"--he stammered; then, as they stumbled
forward, he regained his former tone, keen and ready."Mustn't get to
fussing about our work, must we?--Curious thing: speaking of dreams, you
know.The other night I thought you were somewhere out on board a junk,
and Flounce with you.I swam like anything, miles and miles, but
couldn't get out to you.Worked like steam, and no headway.Flounce knew
I was coming, but you didn't.She laughed, as though they had walked past some danger."And speaking of dragons," she rejoined.The man in
the story, that dipped in dragon's blood, was made invulnerable."German, wasn't he?--Pity
they didn't pop Rudie Hackh in!"Her swift upward glance might have been admiration, if she had not
said:--

"Your mind works very slowly."Again he paused, as though somewhat hurt; then answered
cheerfully: "Dare say.Thought at first you meant the
rattan-juice kind, from Sumatra."From the streets glimmered a few
lanterns, like candles in a long cave.But shunning these unfriendly
corridors, he led her roundabout, now along the walls, now through the
dim ways of an outlying hamlet.A prolonged shriek of growing fright and
anguish came slowly toward them--the cry of a wheelbarrow carrying the
great carcass of a pig, waxy white and waxy red, like an image from a
chamber of horrors.In the blue twilight, fast deepening, the most
familiar things became grotesque.A woman's voice telling stories behind
shadow pictures, and the capricious play of the black puppets on her
lighted screen, had the effect of incantation.Before the booth of a
dentist, the long strings of black teeth swayed in the lantern-glow,
rattling, like horrid necklaces of cannibals.And from a squat
den--where on a translucent placard in the dull window flickered the
words "Foreign Earth," and the guttering door-lantern hinted "As You
Like It"--there came a sweet, insidious, potent smell that seemed more
poisonous than mere opium."Let's go faster," said the girl."Somehow, the dark makes me uneasy
to-night."Skirting the town, they struck at last the open road beyond, and saw
against a fading sky the low black bulk of the nunnery, pierced with
orange squares.Past its landward wall, lanterns moved slowly, clustered
here and there by twos and threes, and dispersed.Cackling argument came
from the ditch, wherever the lantern-bearers halted; and on the face of
the wall, among elbowing shadows, shone dim strips of scarlet.Both
pillars of the gate were plastered with them.Lighting match
from match, he studied the long red scrolls, crowded with neat rows of
symbols.'The Garden of the Three Exquisites.'--Pshaw!that's a theatre notice:
enterprising manager.--Ah, more like it.Long preamble, regular
trimetrical platitudes--here we are:--

"'These Red-Bristled Ghosts teach their dupes to break the ancestral
tablets, and to worship the picture of a naked infant, which points one
finger toward heaven, another toward earth.--To each man entering the
False Religion, a pill is given which confuses and darkens the
mind.--Why they dig out babies' eyes: from one hundred pounds of Chinese
lead can be extracted seven pounds of silver, and the remaining
ninety-three pounds can be sold at the original cost.This silver can be
extracted only by the elixir of black eyes.The green eyes of barbarians
are of no use.'--Really, what follows is too--er--obscure.But here's
the close: 'Tao-tais of the villages, assemble your population.Let us hurl back these wizard-beasts beyond the oceans,
to take their place among the strange things of creation!'""And the big characters," she added, "the big characters you tried to
hide, are 'Kill' and 'Burn'?"Gray eyes and dark eyes met steadily, while the last match, reddening
the blood in his fingers, slowly burned out.CHAPTER XV


KAU FAI

At the top of the nunnery stairs, Rudolph met them with awkward
ceremony, and with that smiling air of encouragement which a nurse might
use in trying cheerfully to deceive a sick man.Heywood laughed, without
mercy, at this pious fraud."Hallo, you Red-Bristled Ghost!""We came early--straight from
our walk.Their host, carried by assault, at once became less mournful."The cook is here," he replied, "by the kitchen-sounds."Good," said his friend; and then whispering, as they followed Miss
Drake to the living-room, "I say, don't act as though you expected the
ghost of Banquo."In the bare, white loft, by candle-light, Sturgeon sat midway in some
long and wheezy tale, to which the padre and his wife listened with true
forbearance.Greetings over, the stodgy annalist continued.The story
was forgotten as soon as ended; talk languished; and even by the quaking
light of the candles, it was plain that the silence was no mere waiting
solemnity before meat, but a period of tension.Up from the road sounded a hubbub of voices, the
tramp of feet, and loud halloos.cried Sturgeon, like a man who fears the worst; and for all
his bulk, he was first at the window.A straggling file of lanterns, borne by some small army, came jogging
and crowding to a halt under the walls.Yellow faces gleamed faintly,
bare heads bobbed, and men set down burdens, grunting.Among the
vanguard an angry voice scolded in a strange tongue."_Burra suar!_" it
raged; then hailed imperiously, "_Ko hai?_"

Where the lanterns clustered brightest, an active little figure in white
waved a helmet, crying,--

"On deck!"I'm up here," called that young man.For reply, the stranger began to skip among his cohorts, jerking out his
white legs like a dancing marionette.Then, with a sudden drop-kick, he
sent the helmet flickering high into the darkness over the wall.The squabbling
retinue surged after him through the gate, and one by one the lanterns
disappeared under the covered way.All stared; for Captain Kneebone, after one historically brief and
outspoken visit, had never in all these years set foot in the port.The
two young men hurried to the stairs.Chinamen and lanterns crowded the courtyard, stuffed the passage, and
still came straggling in at the gate.By the noise and clatter, it might
have been a caravan, or a band of half-naked robbers bringing plunder.Everywhere, on the stone flags, coolies were dumping down bundles,
boxes, jute-bags crammed with heavy objects.Among them, still brawling
in bad Hindustani, the little captain gave his orders.At sight of
Heywood, however, he began once more to caper, with extravagant
grimaces.By his smooth, ruddy face, and tunic of purest white, he
seemed a runaway parson gone farther wrong than ever.he cried; and dancing up, caught Heywood's
hands and whirled him about."I was fair bursting to see ye, my boy!Though his cheeks were flushed, and eyes alarmingly bright, he was
beyond question sober.Over his head, Heywood and Rudolph exchanged an
anxious glance.but this is Hackh's house--the nunnery," said the one; and the
other added, "You're just in time for dinner."He clapped Rudolph on
the arm, and crowed:--

"Nunnery?We'll make it a bloomin' chummery!--Dinner be 'anged!What's more, I've brought the chow"--he swept the huddled boxes
with a prodigal gesture,--"lashin's o' food and drink!That's what it
is: a banquet!"He turned again to his sweating followers, and flung the head coolie a
handful of silver, crying, "_Sub-log kiswasti!_ Divide, and be off with
ye!I'll not spend it all on
_you_!"Then, pouncing on the nearest crate, he burst it open with a
ferocious kick.The choicest to be 'ad in all Saigong!Look
here"--He held up a tin and scanned the label triumphantly: "Chow de
Bruxelles, what?Never saw chow spelt with an 'x' before, did ye?Bad spellers, but good cooks, are the French."Something had happened,--evidently at
Calcutta, for the captain always picked up his vernacular where he
dropped his latest cargo; but at all events these vagaries were not the
effect of heat or loneliness.But now that the coolies had gone, Captain Kneebone's heels were busy,
staving open boxes right and left.A bottle rolled out, and smashed in a
hissing froth of champagne."Plenty more," he cried, rejoicing."That shows ye how much _I_ care!Suddenly he turned from this destruction, and facing Heywood,
began mysteriously to exult over him.'That cock won't fight,' says you.'Let it alone.'--Ho-ho!The eyes of his young friend widened in unbelief."No," he cried, with a start: "you haven't?"The captain seized both hands again, and took on--for his height--a
Roman stateliness.We'll--be-George, we'll announce it, at the banquet!First time in _my_ life: announce!"Heywood suddenly collapsed on a sack, and laughed himself into abject
silence."Awfully glad, old chap," he at last contrived to say, and again
choked.The captain looked down at the shaking body with a singular,
benign, and fatherly smile."I've known this boy a
long time," he explained to Rudolph."This matter's--We'll let you in,
presently.Lend me some coolies here, while we turn your dinner into my
banquet.With a seafaring bellow, he helped Rudolph to hail the servants'
quarters.A pair of cooks, a pair of Number Twos, and all the
"learn-pidgin" youngsters of two households came shuffling into the
court; and arriving guests found all hands broaching cargo, in a loud
confusion of orders and miscomprehension.Throughout the long, white
room, in the slow breeze of the punkah, scores of candles burned soft
and tremulous, as though the old days had returned when the brown
sisters lighted their refectory; but never had their table seen such
profusion of viands, or of talk and laughter.The Saigon stores--after
daily fare--seemed of a strange and Corinthian luxury.And his ruddy little face, beaming at the head of
the table, wore an extravagant, infectious grin.His quick blue eyes
danced with the light of some ineffable joke.He seemed a conjurer,
creating banquets for sheer mischief in the wilderness.Stick a knife
into the tin, and she 'eats 'erself!"Among all the revelers, one face alone showed melancholy.Chantel, at
the foot of the table, sat unregarded by all save Rudolph, who now and
then caught from him a look filled with gloom and suspicion.Forrester laughed and chattered, calling all
eyes toward her, and yet finding private intervals in which to dart a
sidelong shaft at her neighbor.Rudolph's ears shone coral pink; for now
again he was aboard ship, hiding a secret at once dizzy, dangerous, and
entrancing.Across the talk, the wine, the many lights, came the triumph
of seeing that other hostile face, glowering in defeat.Never before had
Chantel, and all the others, dwindled so far into such nonentity, or her
presence vibrated so near.Soon he became aware that Captain Kneebone had risen, with a face
glowing red above the candles.Even Sturgeon forgot the flood of
bounties, and looked expectantly toward their source.The captain
cleared his throat, faltered, then turning sheepish all at once,
hung his head."Be 'anged, I can't make a speech, after all," he grumbled; and
wheeling suddenly on Heywood, with a peevish air of having been
defrauded: "Aboard ship I could sit and think up no end o' flowery talk,
and now it's all gone!"It was Miss Drake who came to his
rescue."How do you manage all these nice
things?"The captain's eyes surveyed the motley collection down the length of the
bright table, then returned to her, gratefully:--

"This ain't anything.Only a little--bloomin'--"

"Impromptu," suggested Heywood.Captain Kneebone eyed them both with uncommon favor.I just 'opped about Saigong like a--jackdaw,
picking up these impromptus.But I came here all the way to break the
news proper, by word o' mouth."He faced the company, and gathering himself for the effort,--

"I'm rich," he declared."I'm da--I'm remarkable rich."Pausing for the effect, he warmed to his oratory.Sailormen as a rule are bad hands to save
money.But I've won first prize in the Derby Sweepstake Lott'ry, and the
money's safe to my credit at the H.K.and S. in Calcutta, and I'm
retired and going Home!More money than the old Kut Sing earned since
her launching--so much I was frightened, first, and lost my sleep!And
me without chick nor child, as the saying is--to go Home and live
luxurious ever after!"cried Nesbit, "lucky beggar!"And a volley of compliments went round the board.The captain
plainly took heart, and flushing still redder at so much praise and good
will, stood now at ease, chuckling."Most men," he began, when there came a lull, "most men makes a will
after they're dead.That's a shore way o' doing things!Now _I_ want to
see the effects, living.So be 'anged, here goes, right and proper.To
Miss Drake, for her hospital and kiddies, two thousand rupees."In the laughter and friendly uproar, the girl sat dazed.she whispered, wavering between amusement and
distress."I can't accept it--"

"Nonsense!"grumbled Heywood, with an angry glance."Don't spoil the
happiest evening of an old man's life.""You're right," she answered quickly; and when the plaudits ended, she
thanked the captain in a very simple, pretty speech, which made him
duck and grin,--a proud little benefactor."That ain't all," he cried gayly; then leveled a threatening finger,
like a pistol, at her neighbor."Who poked fun at me, first and last?Who always came out aboard to tell me what an old ass I was?What did I come so many hundred miles
for?To say what I always said: half-shares."The light-blue eyes, keen
with sea-cunning and the lonely sight of many far horizons, suffered an
indescribable change.There's two rich men
here to-night.It was Heywood's turn to be struck dumb."Oh, I say," he stammered at last, "it's not fair--"

"Don't spoil the happiest evening--" whispered the girl beside him.He eyed her ruefully, groaned, then springing up, went swiftly to the
head of the table and wrung the captain's brown paw, without a word
to say."Can do, can do," said Captain Kneebone, curtly."I was afraid ye might
not want to come."Then followed a whirlwind; and Teppich rose with his moustache
bristling, and the ready Nesbit jerked him down again in the opening
sentence; and everybody laughed at Heywood, who sat there so white,
with such large eyes; and the dinner going by on the wings of night, the
melancholy "boy" circled the table, all too soon, with a new silver
casket full of noble cigars from Paiacombo, Manila, and Dindigul.As the three ladies passed the foot of the table, Rudolph saw Mrs.And presently, like a prisoner going to
his judge, Chantel slipped out of the room.He was not missed; for
already the streaming candle-flames stood wreathed in blue layers, nor
was it long before the captain, mounting his chair, held a full
glass aloft."Here," he cried in triumph, "here's to every nail in the hoof--"

The glass crashed into splinters and froth.A flying stone struck the
boom of the punkah, and thumped on the table.Through the open windows,
from the road, came a wild chorus of yells, caught up and echoed by many
voices in the distance.As they slammed them home, more stones drummed on the boards and
clattered against the wall.Conches brayed somewhere, followed by an
unaccountable, sputtering fusillade as of tiny muskets, and then by a
formidable silence.While the banqueters listened in the smoky room,
there came a sullen, heavy sound, like a single stroke on a large and
very slack bass-drum."_Kau fai!_" shrilled the voices below; and then in a fainter gabble, as
though hurrying off toward the sound,--"_kau fai!_"

"The Black Dog," said Heywood, quietly.Gentlemen, we all know our
posts.Rudie, go call
Chantel.If they ask about that noise, tell
'em anything--Dragon Boat Festival beginning.Anything.--We can easily
hold this place, while the captain gets 'em out to his ship."The captain wheeled, with an injured air."Told ye, plain, I was retired.Came
the last bit in a stinking native boat, and _she's_ cleared by now.Outside, the swollen discord of shouts, thunder of gongs, and hoarse
calling of the conches came slowly nearer, extending through
the darkness.CHAPTER XVI


THE GUNWALE

Rudolph's mission began quietly, with a glimpse which he afterward
recalled as incredibly peaceful.Two of the women, at least, showed no
fear.Earle, her chin cramped on her high
bosom, while she mournfully studied his  picture-book of the
Rhine.Miss Drake, who leaned in one of the river windows, answered him,
saying rather coldly that Chantel and Mrs.Forrester had gone down to
the garden.In the court, however, he ran across Ah Pat, loitering beside a lantern.The compradore grinned, and in a tone of great unconcern called out that
the pair were not in the garden.He pointed down the
passage to the main gate, and hooked his thumb toward the right, to
indicate their course."Makee finish, makee die now," he added calmly;
"too muchee, no can."Rudolph experienced his first shock of terror, like an icy blow on the
scalp.They had gone outside before the alarm; she, Bertha, was swept
away in that tumult which came raging through the darkness.--He stood
transfixed, but only for an instant, rather by the stroke of
helplessness than by fear; and then, blindly, without plan or foresight,
darted down the covered way.The tiny flame of a pith wick, floating in
a saucer of oil, showed Heywood's gatekeeper sitting at his post, like a
gnome in the gallery of a mine.Rudolph tore away the bar, heard the
heavy gate slam shut, and found himself running down the starlit road.Not all starlight, however; a dim red glow began to flicker on the
shapes which rushed behind him in his flight.Wheeling once, he saw two
broad flames leaping high in wild and splendid rivalry,--one from
Heywood's house, one from the club.He caught also a whirling impression
of many heads and arms, far off, tiny, black, and crowded in rushing
disorder; of pale torches in the road; and of a hissing, snarling shout,
a single word, like "_Sha, sha_!"The flame at the club shot up threefold, with a crash; and a glorious
criss-cross multitude of sparks flew hissing through the treetops, like
fiery tadpoles through a net.He turned and ran on, dazzled; fell over some one who lay groaning; rose
on hands and knees, groped in the dust, and suddenly fingered thin,
rough cloth, warm and sopping.In a nausea of relief, he felt that this
was a native,--some unknown dying man, who coughed like a drunkard.Rudolph sprang up and raced again, following by habit the path which he
and she had traversed at noon.Once, with a heavy collision, he stopped
short violently in the midst of crowded men, who shouted, clung to him,
wrestling, and struck out with something sharp that ripped his tunic.He
kicked, shook them off, hammered his fists right and left, and ran free,
with a strange conviction that to-night he was invincible.Stranger
still, as the bamboo leaves now and then brushed his bare forehead, he
missed the sharp music of her cicadas.Here stood her house; she had the
briefest possible start of him, and he had run headlong the whole way;
by all the certainty of instinct, he knew that he had chosen the right
path: why, then, had he not overtaken her?If she met that band which he
had just broken through--He wavered in the darkness, and was turning
wildly to race back, when a sudden light sprang up before him in her
window.He plunged forward, in at the gate, across a plot of turf,
stumbled through the Goddess of Mercy bamboo that hedged the door, and
went falling up the dark stairs, crying aloud,--for the first time in
his life,--"Bertha!Empty rooms rang with the name, but no one answered.At last, however,
reaching the upper level, he saw by lamplight, through the open door,
two figures struggling.Just before he entered, she tore herself free
and went unsteadily across the room.Chantel, white and abject, turned
as in panic.Plainly he had not expected to see another face as white as his
own.Breathless and trembling, he spoke in a strangely little voice; but
his staring eyes lighted with a sudden and desperate resolution."Help
me with her," he begged.The woman's out of
her wits."He caught Rudolph by the arm; and standing for a moment like close
friends, the two panting rivals watched her in stupefaction.She
ransacked a great cedar chest, a table, shelves, boxes, and strewed the
contents on the floor,--silk scarfs, shining Benares brass, Chinese
silver, vivid sarongs from the Preanger regency, Kyoto cloisonne, a wild
heap of plunder from the bazaars of all the nations where Gilly's meagre
earnings had been squandered.A Cingalese box dropped and burst open,
scattering bright stones, false or precious, broadcast.She trampled
them in her blind and furious search."Come," said Chantel, and snatched at her.Every minute--"

She pushed him aside like a thing without weight or meaning, stooped
again among the gay rubbish, caught up a necklace, flung it down for
the sake of a brooch, then dropped everything and turned with blank,
dilated eyes, and the face of a child lost in a crowd."Rudolph," she whimpered, "help me.Without waiting for answer, she bent once more to sort and discard her
pitiful treasures, to pause vaguely, consider, and wring her hands.Rudolph, in his turn, caught her by the arm, but fared no better."We must humor her," whispered Chantel, and, kneeling like a peddler
among the bazaar-stuffs, spread on the floor a Java sarong, blue and
brown, painted with men and buffaloes.On this he began to heap things
pell-mell.The woman surrendered, and all at once flung her arms about Rudolph,
hiding her face, and clinging to him as if with the last of
her strength."Come, he'll bring them," she sobbed."Take me--leave
him, if he won't come--I scolded him--then the noises came, and
we ran--"

"What boat?""I have one ready and stocked," he mumbled, tugging with his teeth at
the knot in the sarong corners.We'll drop down the
river, and try it along the coast.He rose, and started for the door, slinging the bright- bundle
over his shoulder.Against the gay pattern, his
handsome pirate face shone brown and evil in the lamplight."Damn you,
I've waited long enough for your whims.The woman's arms began to drag loosely,
as if she were slipping to the floor; then suddenly, with a cry, she
turned and bolted.Run as he might, Rudolph did not overtake her till
she had caught Chantel at the gate.All three, silent, sped across
fields toward the river, through the startling shadows and dim orange
glow from distant flames.The rough ground sloped, at last, and sent them stumbling down into mud.Behind them the bank ran black and ragged against the glow; before them,
still more black, lay the river, placid, mysterious, and safe.Through
the mud they labored heavily toward a little, smoky light--a lantern
gleaming faintly on a polished gunwale, the shoulders of a man, and the
thin, slant line that was his pole.called Chantel; and the shoulders moved, the line shifted, as
the boatman answered.Chantel pitched the bundle over the lantern, and
leapt on board.Rudolph came slowly, carrying in his arms the woman,
who lay quiet and limp, clasping him in a kind of drowsy oblivion.He
felt the flutter of her lips, while she whispered in his ear strange,
breathless entreaties, a broken murmur of endearments, unheard-of, which
tempted him more than the wide, alluring darkness of the river.He lowered her slowly; and leaning against the gunwale, she still clung
to his hands.snapped their leader, from the dusk behind the
lantern.Obeying by impulse, Rudolph moved nearer the gunwale.The slippery edge,
polished by bare feet through many years, seemed the one bit of reality
in this dream, except the warmth of her hands.he asked, trying dully to rouse from a fascination."No, back to them," he answered stupidly.We can't leave--"

"You fool!"Chantel swore in one tongue, and in another cried to the
boatman--"Shove off, if they won't come!"He seized the woman roughly
and pulled her on board; but she reached out and caught Rudolph's
hand again."Come, hurry," she whispered, tugging at him.She was right, somehow; there was no power to confute her.He must come
with her, or run back, useless, into the ring of swords and flames.She
and life were in the boat; ashore, a friend cut off beyond reach, an
impossible duty, and death.His eyes, dull and fixed in the smoky
lantern-light, rested for an age on the knotted sarong.It meant
nothing; then in a flash, as though for him all light of the eyes had
concentrated in a single vision, it meant everything.The 
cloth--rudely painted in the hut of some forgotten mountaineer--held
all her treasure and her heart, the things of this world.She was beautiful--in all her fear and
disorder, still more beautiful.She went with life, departing into a
dream.This glossy gunwale, polished by bare feet, was after all the
sole reality, a shining line between life and death."Then I must die," he groaned, and wrenched his hands away from that
perilous boundary.He vaguely heard her cry out, vaguely saw Chantel rise above the lantern
and slash down at him with the lowdah's pole.The bamboo struck him,
heavy but glancing, on the head.He staggered, lost his footing, and
fell into the mud, where, as though his choice had already overtaken
him, he lay without thought or emotion, watching the dim light float off
into the darkness.From somewhere in another direction came a sharp,
continual, crackling fusillade, like the snapping of dry bamboo-joints
in a fire.The unstirring night grew heavier with the smell of burnt
gunpowder.But Rudolph, sitting in the mud, felt only that his eyes were
dry and leaden in their sockets, that there was a drumming in his ears,
and that if heat and weariness thus made an end of him, he need no
longer watch the oppressive multitude of stars, or hear the monotony of
flowing water.Without turning, he heard
a man scramble down the bank; without looking up, he felt some one pause
and stoop close.When at last, in profound apathy, he raised his eyes,
he saw against the starlight the hat, head, and shoulders of a coolie.Quite natural, he thought, that the fellow should be muttering in
German.It was only the halting, rusty fashion of the speech that
finally fretted him into listening.Rudolph dismissed him with a vague but angry motion."You cannot sit here all night," he said.Rudolph felt sharp knuckles working at his lips, and before he could
rebel, found his mouth full of sweet fiery liquid.He choked, swallowed,
and presently heard the empty bottle splash in the river.said the rescuer, and chuckled something in dispraise of
women.The rice-brandy was hot and potent; for of a sudden Rudolph found
himself afoot and awake.This man, for some strange reason, was Wutzler, a
coolie and yet a brother from the fatherland.He and his nauseous alien
brandy had restored the future.The forsaken lover was first man up the bank.he
cried, pointing to a new flare in the distance.The whole region was now
aglow like a furnace, and filled with smoke, with prolonged yells, and a
continuity of explosions that ripped the night air like tearing silk.Wutzler shuffled before him, with the trot of a
lean and exhausted laborer."I was with the men you fought, when you
ran.I followed to the house, and then here, to the river.I was glad
you did not jump on board."He glanced back, timidly, for approbation."I am a great coward, Herr Heywood told me so,--but I also stay
and help."He steered craftily among the longest and blackest shadows, now jogging
in a path, now threading the boundary of a rice-field, or waiting behind
trees; and all the time, though devious and artful as a deer-stalker,
crept toward the centre of the noise and the leaping flames.When the
quaking shadows grew thin and spare, and the lighted clearings
dangerously wide, he swerved to the right through a rolling bank of
smoke.Once Rudolph paused, with the heat of the fire on his cheeks."The nunnery is burning," he said hopelessly.His guide halted, peered shrewdly, and listened."No, they are still shooting," he answered, and limped onward, skirting
the uproar.At last, when by pale stars above the smoke and flame and sparks,
Rudolph judged that they were somewhere north of the nunnery, they came
stumbling down into a hollow encumbered with round, swollen obstacles.Like a patch of enormous melons, oil-jars lay scattered."Hide here, and wait," commanded Wutzler.And he
flitted off through the smoke.Smuggled among the oil-jars, Rudolph lay panting.Shapes of men ran
past, another empty jar rolled down beside him, and a stray bullet sang
overhead like a vibrating wire.Soon afterward, Wutzler came crawling
through the huddled pottery.The smell of rancid oil choked them, yet they could breathe without
coughing, and could rest their smarting eyes.In the midst of tumult and
combustion, the hollow lay dark as a pool.Along its rim bristled a
scrubby fringe of weeds, black against a rosy cloud.After a time, something still blacker parted the weeds.In silhouette, a
man's head, his hand grasping a staff or the muzzle of a gun, remained
there as still as though, crawling to the verge, he lay petrified in the
act of spying.CHAPTER XVII


LAMP OF HEAVEN

The white men peered from among the oil-jars, like two of the Forty
Thieves.They could detect no movement, friendly or hostile: the black
head lodged there without stirring.The watcher, whether he had seen
them or not, was in no hurry; for with chin propped among the weeds, he
held a pose at once alert and peaceful, mischievous and leisurely, as
though he were master of that hollow, and might lie all night drowsing
or waking, as the humor prompted.Wutzler pressed his face against the earth, and shivered in the stifling
heat.The uncertainty grew, with Rudolph, into an acute distress.His
legs ached and twitched, the bones of his neck were stretched as if to
break, and a corner of broken clay bored sharply between his ribs.He
felt no fear, however: only a great impatience to have the spy
begin,--rise, beckon, call to his fellows, fire his gun, hit or miss.This longing, or a flash of anger, or the rice-brandy working so nimbly
in his wits, gave him both impulse and plan."Don't move," he whispered; "wait here."And wriggling backward, inch
by inch, feet foremost among the crowded bellies of the jars, he gained
the further darkness.So far as sight would carry, the head stirred no
more than if it had been a cannon-ball planted there on the verge,
against the rosy cloud.From crawling, Rudolph rose to hands and knees,
and silently in the dust began to creep on a long circuit.Once, through
a rift in smoke, he saw a band of yellow musketeers, who crouched behind
some ragged earthwork or broken wall, loading and firing without pause
or care, chattering like outraged monkeys, and all too busy to spare a
glance behind.Their heads bobbed up and down in queer scarlet turbans
or scarfs, like the flannel nightcaps of so many diabolic invalids.Passing them unseen, he crept back toward his hollow.In spite of smoke,
he had gauged and held his circle nicely, for straight ahead lay the
man's legs.Taken thus in the rear, he still lay prone, staring down the
<DW72>, inactive; yet legs, body, and the bent arm that clutched a musket
beside him in the grass, were stiff with some curious excitement.He
seemed ready to spring up and fire.No time to lose, thought Rudolph; and rising, measured his distance with
a painful, giddy exactness.He would have counted to himself before
leaping, but his throat was too dry.He flinched a little, then shot
through the air, and landed heavily, one knee on each side, pinning the
fellow down as he grappled underneath for the throat.Almost in the same
movement he had bounded on foot again, holding both hands above his
head, as high as he could withdraw them.The body among the weeds lay
cold, revoltingly indifferent to stratagem or violence, in the same
tense attitude, which had nothing to do with life.Rudolph dropped his hands, and stood confounded by his own brutal
discourtesy.Wutzler, crawling out from the jars, scrambled joyfully
up the bank."No, no," cried Rudolph, earnestly.By the scarlet headgear, and a white symbol on the back of his jacket,
the man at their feet was one of the musketeers.He had left the
firing-line, crawled away in the dark, and found a quiet spot to die in.Wutzler doffed his coolie hat, slid out of his
jacket, tossed both down among the oil-jars, and stooping over the dead
man, began to untwist the scarlet turban.In the dim light his lean arms
and frail body, coated with black hair, gave him the look of a puny ape
robbing a sleeper.He wriggled into the dead man's jacket, wound the
blood-red cloth about his own temples, and caught up musket, ramrod,
powder-horn, and bag of bullets.--"Now I am all safe," he chuckled."Now
I can go anywhere, to-night."He shouldered arms and stood grinning as though all their troubles were
ended.We try again; come.--Not too close behind me;
and if I speak, run back."In this order they began once more to scout through the smoke.No one
met them, though distant shapes rushed athwart the gloom, yelping to
each other, and near by, legs of runners moved under a rolling cloud of
smoke as if their bodies were embedded and swept along in the
wrack:--all confused, hurried, and meaningless, like the uproar of
gongs, horns, conches, whistling bullets, crackers, and squibs that
sputtering, string upon string, flower upon rising flower of misty red
gold explosion, ripped all other noise to tatters.Where and how he followed, Rudolph never could have told; but once, as
they ran slinking through the heaviest smoke and, as it seemed, the
heart of the turmoil, he recognized the yawning rim of a clay-pit, not a
stone's throw from his own gate.It was amazing to feel that safety lay
so close; still more amazing to catch a glimpse of many coolies digging
in the pit by torchlight, peacefully, as though they had heard of no
disturbance that evening.Hardly had the picture flashed past, than he
wondered whether he had seen or imagined it, whose men they were, and
why, even at any time, they should swarm so busy, thick as ants, merely
to dig clay.He had worry enough, however, to keep in view the white cross-barred
hieroglyphic on his guide's jacket.Suddenly it vanished, and next
instant the muzzle of the gun jolted against his ribs."Run, quick," panted Wutzler, pushing him aside."To the left, into the
go-down.And with the words, he bounded
off to the right, firing his gun to confuse the chase.Rudolph obeyed, and, running at top speed, dimly understood that he had
doubled round a squad of grunting runners, whose bare feet pattered
close by him in the smoke.Before him gaped a black square, through
which he darted, to pitch head first over some fat, padded bulk.As he
rose, the rasping of rough jute against his cheek told him that he had
fallen among bales; and a familiar, musty smell, that the bales were his
own, in his own go-down, across a narrow lane from the nunnery.With
high hopes, he stumbled farther into the darkness.Once, among the
bales, he trod on a man's hand, which was silently pulled away.With no
time to think of that, he crawled and climbed over the disordered heaps,
groping toward the other door.He had nearly reached it, when torchlight
flared behind him, rushing in, and savage cries, both shrill and
guttural, rang through the stuffy warehouse.He had barely time, in the
reeling shadows, to fall on the earthen floor, and crawl under a thin
curtain of reeds to a new refuge.Into this--a cubby-hole where the compradore kept his tally-slips,
umbrella, odds and ends--the torchlight shone faintly through the reeds.Lying flat behind a roll of matting, Rudolph could see, as through the
gauze twilight of a stage scene, the tossing lights and the skipping men
who shouted back and forth, jabbing their spears or pikes down among the
bales, to probe the darkness.Before
it, in swift retreat, some one crawled past the compradore's room,
brushing the splint partition like a snake.This, as Rudolph guessed,
might be the man whose hand he had stepped on.The stitches in the curtain became beads of light.A shadowy arm heaved
up, fell with a dry, ripping sound and a vertical flash.A sword had cut
the reeds from top to bottom.Through the rent a smoking flame plunged after the sword, and after
both, a bony yellow face that gleamed with sweat.Rudolph, half wrapped
in his matting, could see the hard, glassy eyes shine cruelly in their
narrow slits; but before they lowered to meet his own, a jubilant yell
resounded in the go-down, and with a grunt, the yellow face, the
flambeau, and the sword were snatched away.He lay safe, but at the price of another man's peril.They had caught
the crawling fugitive, and now came dragging him back to the lights.Through the tattered curtain Rudolph saw him flung on the ground like an
empty sack, while his captors crowded about in a broken ring, cackling,
and prodding him with their pikes.Some jeered, some snarled, others
called him by name, with laughing epithets that rang more friendly, or
at least more jocular; but all bent toward him eagerly, and flung down
question after question, like a little band of kobolds holding an
inquisition.At some sharper cry than the rest, the fellow rose to his
knees and faced them boldly.A haggard Christian, he was being fairly
given his last chance to recant.they cried, in rage or entreaty.The kneeling captive shook his head, and made some reply, very distinct
and simple.The same sword
that had slashed the curtain now pricked his naked chest.Rudolph,
clenching his fists in a helpless longing to rush out and scatter all
these men-at-arms, had a strange sense of being transported into the
past, to watch with ghostly impotence a mediaeval tragedy.His round, honest,
oily face was anything but heroic, and wore no legendary, transfiguring
light.He seemed rather stupid than calm; yet as he mechanically wound
his queue into place once more above the shaven forehead, his fingers
moved surely and deftly.snarled the pikemen and the torch-bearers, with the
fierce gestures of men who have wasted time and patience.bawled the swordsman, beside himself.To the others, this phrase acted as a spark to powder.And several men began to rummage and overhaul the chaos of the go-down.Rudolph had given orders, that afternoon, to remove all necessary stores
to the nunnery.But from somewhere in the darkness, one rioter brought a
sack of flour, while another flung down a tin case of petroleum.The
sword had no sooner cut the sack across and punctured the tin, than a
fat villain in a loin cloth, squatting on the earthen floor, kneaded
flour and oil into a grimy batch of dough."Will you speak out and live," cried the swordsman, "or will you die?"Then, as though the option were
not in his power,--

"Die," he answered.The fat baker sprang up, and clapped on the obstinate head a shapeless
gray turban of dough.Half a dozen torches jostled for the honor of
lighting it.The Christian, crowned with sooty flames, gave a single
cry, clear above all the others.He was calling--as even Rudolph
knew--on the strange god across the sea, Saviour of the Children of the
West, not to forget his nameless and lonely servant.Rudolph groaned aloud, rose, and had parted the curtain to run out and
fall upon them all, when suddenly, close at hand and sharp in the
general din, there burst a quick volley of rifleshots.Splinters flew
from the attap walls.A torch-bearer and the man with the sword spun
half round, collided, and fell, the one across the other, like drunken
wrestlers.The survivors flung down their torches and ran, leaping and
diving over bales.On the ground, the smouldering Lamp of Heaven showed
that its wearer, rescued by a lucky bullet, lay still in a posture of
humility.Strange humility, it seemed, for one so suddenly given the
complete and profound wisdom that confirms all faith, foreign or
domestic, new or old.With a sense of all this, but no clear sense of action, Rudolph found
the side-door, opened it, closed it, and started across the lane.He
knew only that he should reach the mafoo's little gate by the pony-shed,
and step out of these dark ages into the friendly present; so that when
something from the wall blazed point-blank, and he fell flat on the
ground, he lay in utter defeat, bitterly surprised and offended.His own
friends: they might miss him once, but not twice.Instead, from the darkness above came the most welcome sound he had ever
known,--a keen, high voice, scolding.It was Heywood, somewhere on the
roof of the pony-shed.He put the question sharply, yet sounded cool and
cheerful.You waste another cartridge so, and I'll take
your gun away.Nesbit's voice clipped out some pert objection."Potted the beggar, any'ow--see for yourself--go-down's afire.""Saves us the trouble of burning it."The other voice moved away, with
a parting rebuke."No more of that, sniping and squandering.Rudolph lifted his head from the dust.answered his captain on the wall, blithely."Steady on, we'll
get you."Of all hardships, this brief delay was least bearable.Then a bight of
rope fell across Rudolph's back.He seized it, hauled taut, and planting
his feet against the wall, went up like a fish, to land gasping on a row
of sand-bags.His invisible friend clapped him on the
shoulder.Compradore has a gun for you, in the court.Report to Kneebone at the northeast corner.Danger point there:
we need a good man, so hurry.Rudolph, scrambling down from the pony-shed, ran across the compound
with his head in a whirl.Yet through all the scudding darkness and
confusion, one fact had pierced as bright as a star.On this night of
alarms, he had turned the great corner in his life.Like the pale
stranger with his crown of fire, he could finish the course.He caught his rifle from the compradore's hand, but needed no draught
from any earthly cup.Brushing through the orange trees, he made for the
northeast angle, free of all longing perplexities, purged of all vile
admiration, and fit to join his friends in clean and wholesome danger.CHAPTER XVIII


SIEGE

He never believed that they could hold the northeast corner for a
minute, so loud and unceasing was the uproar.Bullets spattered sharply
along the wall and sang overhead, mixed now and then with an
indescribable whistling and jingling.The angle was like the prow of a
ship cutting forward into a gale.Yet Rudolph climbed, rejoicing, up the
short bamboo ladder, to the platform which his coolies had built in such
haste, so long ago, that afternoon.As he stood up, in the full glow
from the burning go-down, somebody tackled him about the knees and threw
him head first on the sand-bags."How many times must I give me orders?"barked the little sea-captain."Under cover, under cover, and stay under cover, or I'll send ye below,
ye gallivanting--Oh!A
stubby finger pointed in the obscurity.and don't ye fire till
I say so!"Thus made welcome, Rudolph crawled toward a chink among the bags, ran
the muzzle of his gun into place, and lay ready for whatever might come
out of the quaking lights and darknesses beyond.Nothing came, however, except a swollen continuity of sound, a rolling
cloud of noises, thick and sullen as the smell of burnt gunpowder.It
was strange, thought Rudolph, how nothing happened from moment to
moment.No yellow bodies came charging out of the hubbub.He himself lay
there unhurt; his fellows joked, grumbled, shifted their legs on the
platform.At times the heavier, duller sound, which had been the signal
for the whole disorder,--one ponderous beat, as on a huge and very slack
bass-drum,--told that the Black Dog from Rotterdam was not far off.Yet
even then there followed no shock of round-shot battering at masonry,
but only an access of the stormy whistling and jingling."Copper cash," declared the voice of Heywood, in a lull.By the sound,
he was standing on the rungs of the ladder, with his head at the level
of the platform; also by the sound, he was enjoying himself
inordinately."What a jolly good piece of luck!Firing money at us--like you, Captain.Some unruly gang among them wouldn't wait, and forced matters.The beggars have plenty of powder, and little else.Here, in the thick of the fight, was a
light-hearted, busy commander, drawing conclusions and extracting news
from chaos."Look out for arrows," continued the speaker, as he crawled to a
loophole between Rudolph's and the captain's.Killed one convert and wounded two, there by the water gate.They can't get the elevation for you chaps here, though."And again he
added, cheerfully, "So far, at least."The little band behind the loopholes lay watching through the smoke,
listening through the noise.The Black Dog barked again, and sent a
shower of money clinking along the wall."How do you like it, Rudie?""It is terrible," answered Rudolph, honestly.Wait till their
ammunition comes; then you'll see fun."I say, Kneebone, what's your idea?Sniping all night, will it be?--or shall we get a fair chance at 'em?"The captain, a small, white, recumbent spectre, lifted his head and
appeared to sniff the smoke judicially."They get a chance at us, more like!""My opinion, the
blighters have shot and burnt themselves into a state o' mind; bloomin'
delusion o' grandeur, that's what.Wildest of 'em will rush us to-night,
once--maybe twice.We stave 'em off, say: that case, they'll settle down
to starve us, right and proper.""Wish a man
could smoke up here."Heywood laughed, and turned his head:--

"How much do you know about sieges, old chap?"Outside of school--_testudine facia,_ that sort of
thing.However," he went on cheerfully, "we shall before long"--He broke
off with a start."Gone," said Rudolph, and struggling to explain, found his late
adventure shrunk into the compass of a few words, far too small and bare
to suggest the magnitude of his decision."They went," he began, "in
a boat--"

He was saved the trouble; for suddenly Captain Kneebone cried in a voice
of keen satisfaction, "Here they come!Through a patch of firelight, down the gentle <DW72> of the field, swept
a ragged cohort of men, some bare-headed, some in their scarlet
nightcaps, as though they had escaped from bed, and all yelling.One of
the foremost, who met the captain's bullet, was carried stumbling his
own length before he sank underfoot; as the Mausers flashed from between
the sand-bags, another and another man fell to his knees or toppled
sidelong, tripping his fellows into a little knot or windrow of kicking
arms and legs; but the main wave poured on, all the faster.Among and
above them, like wreckage in that surf, tossed the shapes of
scaling-ladders and notched bamboos.Two naked men, swinging between
them a long cylinder or log, flashed through the bonfire space and on
into the dark below the wall."Look out for the pung-dong!"His friends were too busy firing into the crowded gloom below.Rudolph,
fumbling at side-bolt and pulling trigger, felt the end of a ladder bump
his forehead, saw turban and mediaeval halberd heave above him, and
without time to think of firing, dashed the muzzle of his gun at the
climber's face.The shock was solid, the halberd rang on the platform,
but the man vanished like a shade."Very neat," growled Heywood, who in the same instant, with a great
shove, managed to fling down the ladder.While he spoke, however, something hurtled over their heads and thumped
the platform.The queer log, or cylinder, lay there with a red coal
sputtering at one end, a burning fuse.Heywood snatched at it and
missed.Some one else caught up the long bulk, and springing to his
feet, swung it aloft.Firelight showed the bristling moustache of
Kempner, his long, thin arms poising a great bamboo case bound with
rings of leather or metal.He threw it out with his utmost force,
staggered as though to follow it; then, leaping back, straightened his
tall body with a jerk, flung out one arm in a gesture of surprise, no
sooner rigid than drooping; and even while he seemed inflated for
another of his speeches, turned half-round and dove into the garden and
the night.By the ending of it, he had redeemed a somewhat rancid life.Before, the angle was alive with swarming heads.As he fell, it was
empty, and the assault finished; for below, the bamboo tube burst with a
sound that shook the wall; liquid flame, the Greek fire of stink-pot
chemicals, squirted in jets that revealed a crowd torn asunder, saffron
faces contorted in shouting, and men who leapt away with clothes afire
and powder-horns bursting at their sides.Dim figures scampered off, up
the rising ground."That's over," panted Heywood."Thundering good lesson,--Here, count
noses.Sturgeon, Teppich, Padre, Captain?but
look sharp, while I go inspect.""Come down,
won't you, and help me with--you know."At the foot of the ladder, they met a man in white, with a white face in
what might be the dawn, or the pallor of the late-risen moon.He hailed them in a dry voice, and cleared his throat,
"Where is she?It was here, accordingly, while Heywood stooped over a tumbled object on
the ground, that Rudolph told her husband what Bertha Forrester had
chosen.The words came harder than before, but at last he got rid of
them.It was like telling the news of
an absent ghost to another present."This town was never a place," said Gilly, with all his former
steadiness,--"never a place to bring a woman.All three men listened to the conflict of gongs and crackers, and to the
shouting, now muffled and distant behind the knoll.All three, as it
seemed to Rudolph, had consented to ignore something vile."That's all I wanted to know," said the older man, slowly."I must get
back to my post.You didn't say, but--She made no attempt to come here?For some time again they stood as though listening, till Heywood
spoke:--

"Holding your own, are you, by the water gate?""Oh, yes," replied Forrester, rousing slightly.Heywood skipped up the ladder, to return with a rifle."And this belt--Kempner's.Poor chap, he'll never ask you to return
them.--Anything else?""No," answered Gilly, taking the dead man's weapon, and moving off into
the darkness."Except if we come to a pinch,
and need a man for some tight place, then give me first chance.I could do better, now, than--than you younger men.Oh, and Hackh;
your efforts to-night--Well, few men would have dared, and I feel
immensely grateful."He disappeared among the orange trees, leaving Rudolph to think about
such gratitude."Now, then," called Heywood, and stooped to the white bundle at their
feet.Trust old Gilly to take it
like a man.And between them the two friends carried to the nunnery a tiresome
theorist, who had acted once, and now, himself tired and limp, would
offend no more by speaking.When the dawn filled the compound with a deep blue twilight, and this in
turn grew pale, the night-long menace of noise gradually faded also,
like an orgy of evil spirits dispersing before cockcrow.To ears long
deafened, the wide stillness had the effect of another sound, never
heard before.Even when disturbed by the flutter of birds darting from
top to dense green top of the orange trees, the air seemed hushed by
some unholy constraint.Through the cool morning vapors, hot smoke from
smouldering wreckage mounted thin and straight, toward where the pale
disk of the moon dissolved in light.The convex field stood bare, except
for a few overthrown scarecrows in naked yellow or dusty blue, and for a
jagged strip of earthwork torn from the crest, over which the Black Dog
thrust his round muzzle.In a truce of empty silence, the defenders
slept by turns among the sand-bags.The day came, and dragged by without incident.The sun blazed in the
compound, swinging overhead, and slanting down through the afternoon.At
the water gate, Rudolph, Heywood, and the padre, with a few forlorn
Christians,--driven in like sheep, at the last moment,--were building
a rough screen against the arrows that had flown in darkness, and that
now lay scattered along the path.One of these a workman suddenly caught
at, and with a grunt, held up before the padre.About the shaft, wound tightly with silk thread, ran
a thin roll of Chinese paper.Earle nodded, took the arrow, and slitting with a pocket-knife,
freed and flattened out a painted scroll of complex characters.His keen
old eyes ran down the columns.His face, always cloudy now, grew darker
with perplexity.He sat
down on a pile of sacks, and spread the paper on his knee."But the
characters are so elaborate--I can't make head or tail."He beckoned Heywood, and together they scowled at the intricate and
meaningless symbols."No, see here--lower left hand."The last stroke of the brush, down in the corner, formed a loose "O.For all that, the painted lines remained a stubborn puzzle.The padre pulled out a cigar, and smoking
at top speed, spaced off each character with his thumb."They are all
alike, and yet"--He clutched his white hair with big knuckles, and
tugged; replaced his mushroom helmet; held the paper at a new focus.he said doubtfully; and at last, "Yes."For some time he read to
himself, nodding."Take only the left half of that word, and what have you?""Take," the padre ordered, "this one; left half?""The right half--might be
'rice-scoop,' But that's nonsense."Subtract this twisted character 'Lightning' from each, and we've made
the crooked straight.Here's the
sense of his message, I take it."And he read off, slowly:--

"A Hakka boat on opposite shore; a green flag and a rice-scoop hoisted
at her mast; light a fire on the water-gate steps, and she will come
quickly, day or night.--O.W.""That won't help," he said curtly.With the aid of a convert, he unbarred the ponderous gate, and ventured
out on the highest slab of the landing-steps.Across the river, to be
sure, there lay--between a local junk and a stray _papico_ from the
north--the high-nosed Hakka boat, her deck roofed with tawny
basket-work, and at her masthead a wooden rice-measure dangling below a
green rag.Aft, by the great steering-paddle, perched a man, motionless,
yet seeming to watch.Heywood turned, however, and pointed downstream to
where, at the bend of the river, a little spit of mud ran out from the
marsh.On the spit, from among tussocks, a man in a round hat sprang up
like a thin black toadstool.He waved an arm, and gave a shrill cry,
summoning help from further inland.Other hats presently came bobbing
toward him, low down among the marsh.Puffs of white spurted out from
the mud.And as Heywood dodged back through the gate, and Nesbit's rifle
answered from his little fort on the pony-shed, the distant crack of the
muskets joined with a spattering of ooze and a chipping of stone on the
river-stairs."Covered, you see," said Heywood, replacing the bar."Last resort,
perhaps, that way.Still, we may as well keep a bundle of firewood
ready here."The shots from the marsh, though trivial and scattering, were like a
signal; for all about the nunnery, from a ring of hiding-places, the
noise of last night broke out afresh.The sun lowered through a brown,
burnt haze, the night sped up from the ocean, covering the sky with
sudden darkness, in which stars appeared, many and cool, above the
torrid earth and the insensate turmoil.So, without change but from
pause to outbreak, outbreak to pause, nights and days went by in
the siege.One morning, indeed, the fragments of another blunt
arrow came to light, broken underfoot and trampled into the dust.The
paper scroll, in tatters, held only a few marks legible through dirt and
heel-prints: "Listen--work fast--many bags--watch closely."And still
nothing happened to explain the warning.That night Heywood even made a sortie, and stealing from the main gate
with four coolies, removed to the river certain relics that lay close
under the wall, and would soon become intolerable.He had returned
safely, with an ancient musket, a bag of bullets, a petroleum squirt,
and a small bundle of pole-axes, and was making his tour of the
defenses, when he stumbled over Rudolph, who knelt on the ground under
what in old days had been the chapel, and near what now was
Kempner's grave.He was not kneeling in devotion, for he took Heywood by the arm, and
made him stoop."I was coming," he said, "to find you.The first night, I saw coolies
working in the clay-pit."They're keeping such a racket outside," he muttered; and then, half to
himself: "It certainly is.Rudie, it's--it's as if poor Kempner
were--waking up."The two friends sat up, and eyed each other in the starlight.CHAPTER XIX


BROTHER MOLES

This new danger, working below in the solid earth, had thrown Rudolph
into a state of sullen resignation.What was the use now, he thought
indignantly, of all their watching and fighting?The ground, at any
moment, might heave, break, and spring up underfoot.He waited for his
friend to speak out, and put the same thought roundly into words.Instead, to his surprise, he heard something quite contrary."Now we know what
the beasts have up their sleeve.He sat thinking, a white figure in the starlight, cross-legged like a
Buddha."That's why they've all been lying doggo," he continued."And then their
bad marksmanship, with all this sniping--they don't care, you see,
whether they pot us or not.They'd rather make one clean sweep, and
'blow us at the moon.'Cheer up, Rudie: so long as they're digging,
they're not blowing.While he spoke, the din outside the walls wavered and sank, at last
giving place to a shrill, tiny interlude of insect voices.In this
diluted silence came now and then a tinkle of glass from the dark
hospital room where Miss Drake was groping among her vials."If it weren't for that," he said quietly, "I shouldn't much care.Except for the women, this would really be great larks."Then, as a
shadow flitted past the orange grove, he roused himself to hail: "Ah
Pat!Go catchee four piecee coolie-man!"The shadow passed, and after a time returned with four other
shadows.They stood waiting, till Heywood raised his head from the dust."Those noises have stopped, down there," he said to Rudolph; and rising,
gave his orders briefly.The coolies were to dig, strike into the
sappers' tunnel, and report at once: "Chop-chop.--Meantime, Rudie, let's
take a holiday.A solitary candle burned in the far corner of the inclosure, and cast
faint streamers of reflection along the wet flags, which, sluiced with
water from the well, exhaled a slight but grateful coolness.Heywood
stooped above the quivering flame, lighted a cigar, and sinking loosely
into a chair, blew the smoke upward in slow content."Nothing to do, nothing to fret about, till the
compradore reports.For a long time, lying side by side, they might have been asleep.Through the dim light on the white walls dipped and swerved the drunken
shadow of a bat, who now whirled as a flake of blackness across the
stars, now swooped and set the humbler flame reeling.The flutter of his
leathern wings, and the plash of water in the dark, where a coolie still
drenched the flags, marked the sleepy, soothing measures in a nocturne,
broken at strangely regular intervals by a shot, and the crack of a
bullet somewhere above in the deserted chambers."Queer," mused Heywood, drowsily studying his watch."The beggar puts
one shot every five minutes through the same window.--I wonder what he's
thinking about?Lying out there, firing at the Red-Bristled Ghosts.Wonder what they're all"--He put back his cigar, mumbling."Handful of
poor blackguards, all upset in their minds, and sweating round.And all
the rest tranquil as ever, eh?--the whole country jogging on the same
old way, or asleep and dreaming dreams, perhaps, same kind of dreams
they had in Marco Polo's day."The end of his cigar burned red again; and again, except for that, he
might have been asleep.Rudolph made no answer, but lay thinking.This
brief moment of rest in the cool, dim courtyard--merely to lie there
and wait--seemed precious above all other gain or knowledge.Some quiet
influence, a subtle and profound conviction, slowly was at work in him.It was patience, wonder, steady confidence,--all three, and more.He had
felt it but this once, obscurely; might die without knowing it in
clearer fashion; and yet could never lose it, or forget, or come to any
later harm.With it the stars, above the dim vagaries of the bat, were
brightly interwoven.For the present he had only to lie ready, and wait,
a single comrade in a happy army.Through a dark little door came Miss Drake, all in white, and moving
quietly, like a symbolic figure of evening, or the genius of the place.Her hair shone duskily as she bent beside the candle, and with steady
fingers tilted a vial, from which amber drops fell slowly into a glass.With dark eyes watching closely, she had the air of a young, beneficent
Medea, intent on some white magic."Aren't you coming," called Heywood, "to sit with us awhile?""Can't, thanks," she replied, without looking up.She moved away, carrying her medicines, but paused in the door, smiled
back at him as from a crypt, and said:--

"Have _you_ been hurt?""I've no time," she laughed, "for lazy able-bodied persons."And she was
gone in the darkness, to sit by her wounded men.With her went the interval of peace; for past the well-curb came another
figure, scuffing slowly toward the light.The compradore, his robes lost
in their background, appeared as an oily face and a hand beckoning with
downward sweep.The two friends rose, and followed him down the
courtyard.In passing out, they discovered the padre's wife lying
exhausted in a low chair, of which she filled half the length and all
the width.Heywood paused beside her with some friendly question, to
which Rudolph caught the answer.Her voice sounded fretful, her fan stirred weakly.I feel quite ready to suffer for the faith."Earle," said the young man, gently, "there ought to be no
need.Under the orange trees, he laid an unsteady hand on Rudolph's arm, and
halting, shook with quiet merriment.Loose earth underfoot warned them not to stumble over the new-raised
mound beside the pit, which yawned slightly blacker than the night.Kempner's grave had not been quieter.The compradore stood whispering:
they had found the tunnel empty, because, he thought, the sappers were
gone out to eat their chow."We'll see, anyway," said Heywood, stripping off his coat.He climbed
over the mound, grasped the edges, and promptly disappeared.In the long
moment which followed, the earth might have closed on him.Once, as
Rudolph bent listening over the shaft, there seemed to come a faint
momentary gleam; but no sound, and no further sign, until the head and
shoulders burrowed up again."Big enough hole down there," he reported, swinging clear, and sitting
with his feet in the shaft.Three sacks of powder stowed
already, so we're none too soon.--One sack was leaky.I struck a match,
and nearly blew myself to Casabianca.""It
gives us a plan, though.Rudie: are you game for something rather
foolhardy?Be frank, now; for if you wouldn't really enjoy it, I'll give
old Gilly Forrester his chance."said Rudolph, stung as by some perfidy.This is all ours, this part, so!"Give me half a
moment start, so that you won't jump on my head."And he went wriggling
down into the pit.An unwholesome smell of wet earth, a damp, subterranean coolness,
enveloped Rudolph as he slid down a flue of greasy clay, and stooping,
crawled into the horizontal bore of the tunnel.Large enough, perhaps,
for two or three men to pass on all fours, it ran level, roughly cut,
through earth wet with seepage from the river, but packed into a smooth
floor by many hands and bare knees.In
the small chamber of the mine, choked with the smell of stale betel, he
bumped Heywood's elbow."Some Fragrant Ones have been working here, I should say."The speaker
patted the ground with quick palms, groping.This explains old Wutz, and his broken arrow.I say, Rudie, feel
about.I saw a coil of fuse lying somewhere.--At least, I thought it
was."How's the old forearm I gave you?Equal to hauling a
sack out?Sweeping his hand in the darkness, he captured Rudolph's, and guided it
to where a powder-bag lay."Now, then, carry on," he commanded; and crawling into the tunnel,
flung back fragments of explanation as he tugged at his own load."Carry
these out--far as we dare--touch 'em off, you see, and block the
passage.We can use this hole afterward,
for listening in, if they try--"

He cut the sentence short.Their tunnel had begun to <DW72> gently
downward, with niches gouged here and there for the passing of
burden-bearers.Rudolph, toiling after, suddenly found his head
entangled between his leader's boots.An odd little squeak of
surprise followed, a strange gurgling, and a succession of rapid shocks,
as though some one were pummeling the earthen walls."Got the beggar," panted Heywood.Roll clear, Rudie,
and let us pass.Collar his legs, if you can, and shove."Squeezing past Rudolph in his niche, there struggled a convulsive bulk,
like some monstrous worm, too large for the bore, yet writhing.Bare
feet kicked him in violent rebellion, and a muscular knee jarred
squarely under his chin.He caught a pair of naked legs, and hugged
them dearly."Not too hard," called Heywood, with a breathless laugh."Poor
devil--must think he ran foul of a genie."Indeed, their prisoner had already given up the conflict, and lay under
them with limbs dissolved and quaking."Pass him along," chuckled his captor.Prodded into action, the man stirred limply, and crawled past them
toward the mine, while Heywood, at his heels, growled orders in the
vernacular with a voice of dismal ferocity.In this order they gained
the shaft, and wriggled up like ferrets into the night air.Rudolph,
standing as in a well, heard a volley of questions and a few timid
answers, before the returning legs of his comrade warned him to dodge
back into the tunnel.Again the two men crept forward on their expedition; and this time the
leader talked without lowering his voice."That chap," he declared, "was fairly chattering with fright.Coolie, it
seems, who came back to find his betel-box.The rest are all outside
eating their rice.They stumbled on their powder-sacks, caught hold, and dragged them, at
first easily down the incline, then over a short level, then arduously
up a rising grade, till the work grew heavy and hot, and breath came
hard in the stifled burrow."Far enough," said Heywood, puffing.Rudolph, however, was not only drenched with sweat, but fired by a new
spirit, a spirit of daring.He would try, down here in the bowels of the
earth, to emulate his friend."But let us reconnoitre," he objected."It will bring us to the clay-pit
where I saw them digging.Let us go out to the end, and look."By his tone, he was proud of the amendment.I say, I didn't really--I didn't _want_ poor old
Gilly down here, you know."They crawled on, with more speed but no less caution, up the strait
little gallery, which now rose between smooth, soft walls of clay.Suddenly, as the incline once more became a level, they saw a glimmering
square of dusky red, like the fluttering of a weak flame through scarlet
cloth.This, while they shuffled toward it, grew higher and broader,
until they lay prone in the very door of the hill,--a large, square-cut
portal, deeply overhung by the edge of the clay-pit, and flanked with
what seemed a bulkhead of sand-bags piled in orderly tiers.Between
shadowy mounds of loose earth flickered the light of a fire, small and
distant, round which wavered the inky silhouettes of men, and beyond
which dimly shone a yellow face or two, a yellow fist clutched full of
boiled rice like a snowball.Beyond these, in turn, gleamed other little
fires, where other coolies were squatting at their supper.Heywood's voice trembled with joyful excitement."Look,
these bags; not sand-bags at all!Wait a bit--oh, by Jove, wait a bit!"He scurried back into the hill like a great rat, returned as quickly and
swiftly, and with eager hands began to uncoil something on the clay
threshold."Do you know enough to time a fuse?""Neither do I.
Powder's bad, anyhow.Here, quick, lend me a
knife."He slashed open one of the lower sacks in the bulkhead by the
door, stuffed in some kind of twisted cord, and, edging away, sat for an
instant with his knife-blade gleaming in the ruddy twilight."How long,
Rudie, how long?""Too long, or too short, spoils
everything."Now lie across," he ordered, "and shield the tandstickor."With a
sudden fuff, the match blazed up to show his gray eyes bright and
dancing, his face glossy with sweat; below, on the golden clay, the
twisted, lumpy tail of the fuse, like the end of a dusty vine.Darkness
followed, quick and blinding.A rosy, fitful coal sputtered, darting out
short capillary lines and needles of fire.If it blows up, and caves the earth on
us--" Heywood ran on hands and knees, as if that were his natural way of
going.Rudolph scrambled after, now urged by an ecstasy of apprehension,
now clogged as by the weight of all the hill above them.If it should
fall now, he thought, or now; and thus measuring as he crawled, found
the tunnel endless.When at last, however, they gained the bottom of the shaft, and were
hoisted out among their coolies on the shelving mound, the evening
stillness lay above and about them, undisturbed.The fuse could never
have lasted all these minutes."Gone out," said Heywood, gloomily.He climbed the bamboo scaffold, and stood looking over the wall.Rudolph
perched beside him,--by the same anxious, futile instinct of curiosity,
for they could see nothing but the night and the burning stars.Underground again, Rudie, and try our first plan.""The Sword-Pen looks to set off his mine
to-morrow morning."He clutched the wall in time to save himself, as the bamboo frame leapt
underfoot.Outside, the crest of the <DW72> ran black against a single
burst of flame.The detonation came like the blow of a mallet on
the ribs.Heywood jumped to the ground, and in a
pelting shower of clods, exulted:--


"He looked again, and saw it was
The middle of next week!"He ran off, laughing, in the wide hush of astonishment.CHAPTER XX


THE HAKKA BOAT

"Pretty fair," Captain Kneebone said.This grudging praise--in which, moreover, Heywood tamely acquiesced--was
his only comment.On Rudolph it had singular effects: at first filling
him with resentment, and almost making him suspect the little captain of
jealousy; then amusing him, as chance words of no weight; but in the
unreal days that followed, recurring to convince him with all the force
of prompt and subtle fore-knowledge.It helped him to learn the cold,
salutary lesson, that one exploit does not make a victory.The springing of their countermine, he found, was no deliverance.It had
two plain results, and no more: the crest of the high field, without,
had changed its contour next morning as though a monster had bitten it;
and when the day had burnt itself out in sullen darkness, there burst on
all sides an attack of prolonged and furious exasperation.The fusillade
now came not only from the landward sides, but from a long flotilla of
boats in the river; and although these vanished at dawn, the fire never
slackened, either from above the field, or from a distant wall, newly
spotted with loopholes, beyond the ashes of the go-down.On the night
following, the boats crept closer, and suddenly both gates resounded
with the blows of battering-rams.By daylight, the nunnery walls were pitted as with small-pox; yet
the little company remained untouched, except for Teppich, whose shaven
head was trimmed still closer and redder by a bullet, and for Gilbert
Forrester, who showed--with the grave smile of a man when fates are
playful--two shots through his loose jacket.He was the only man to smile; for the others, parched by days and
sweltered by nights of battle, questioned each other with hollow eyes
and sleepy voices.One at a time, in patches of hot shade, they lay
tumbled for a moment of oblivion, their backs studded thickly with
obstinate flies like the driven heads of nails.As thickly, in the dust,
empty Mauser cartridges lay glistening."And I bought food," mourned the captain, chafing the untidy stubble on
his cheeks, and staring gloomily down at the worthless brass."I bought
chow, when all Saigong was full o' cartridges!"The sight of the spent ammunition at their feet gave them more trouble
than the swarming flies, or the heat, or the noises tearing and
splitting the heat.Even Heywood went about with a hang-dog air,
speaking few words, and those more and more surly.Once he laughed, when
at broad noonday a line of queer heads popped up from the earthwork on
the knoll, and stuck there, tilted at odd angles, as though peering
quizzically.Both his laugh, however, and his one stare of scrutiny were
filled with a savage contempt,--contempt not only for the stratagem, but
for himself, the situation, all things."Dummies--lay figures, to draw our fire.he added, wearily "we couldn't waste a shot at 'em now even if they
were real."They knew, without being told,
that they should fire no more until at close quarters in some
final rush."Only a few more rounds apiece," he continued."Our friends outside must
have run nearly as short, according to the coolie we took prisoner in
the tunnel.But they'll get more supplies, he says, in a day or two.What's worse, his Generalissimo Fang expects big reinforcement, any day,
from up country."Perhaps he's lying," said Captain Kneebone, drowsily."Wish he were," snapped Heywood."That case," grumbled the captain, "we'd better signal your Hakka boat,
and clear out."Again their hollow eyes questioned each other in discouragement.It was
plain that he had spoken their general thought; but they were all too
hot and sleepy to debate even a point of safety.Thus, in stupor or
doubt, they watched another afternoon burn low by invisible degrees,
like a great fire dying.Another breathless evening settled over all--at
first with a dusty, copper light, widespread, as though sky and land
were seen through smoked glass; another dusk, of deep, sad blue; and
when this had given place to night, another mysterious lull.Midnight drew on, and no further change had come.Prowlers, made bold by
the long silence in the nunnery, came and went under the very walls of
the compound.In the court, beside a candle, Ah Pat the compradore sat
with a bundle of halberds and a whetstone, sharpening edge after edge,
placidly, against the time when there should be no more cartridges.Heywood and Rudolph stood near the water gate, and argued with Gilbert
Forrester, who would not quit his post for either of them."But I'm not sleepy," he repeated, with perverse, irritating serenity.And that river full of their boats?--Go away."While they reasoned and wrangled, something scraped the edge of the
wall.They could barely detect a small, stealthy movement above them, as
if a man, climbing, had lifted his head over the top.Suddenly, beside
it, flared a surprising torch, rags burning greasily at the end of a
long bamboo.The smoky, dripping flame showed no man there, but only
another long bamboo, impaling what might be another ball of rags.The
two poles swayed, inclined toward each other; for one incredible instant
the ball, beside its glowing fellow, shone pale and took on human
features.Black shadows filled the eye-sockets, and gave to the face an
uncertain, cavernous look, as though it saw and pondered.How long the apparition stayed, the three men could not tell; for even
after it vanished, and the torch fell hissing in the river, they stood
below the wall, dumb and sick, knowing only that they had seen the head
of Wutzler.Heywood was the first to make a sound--a broken, hypnotic sound, without
emphasis or inflection, as though his lips were frozen, or the words
torn from him by ventriloquy."We must get the women--out of here."Afterward, when he was no longer with them, his two friends recalled
that he never spoke again that night, but came and went in a kind of
silent rage, ordering coolies by dumb-show, and carrying armful after
armful of supplies to the water gate.The word passed, or a listless, tacit understanding, that every one must
hold himself ready to go aboard so soon after daylight as the hostile
boats should leave the river."If," said Gilly to Rudolph, while they
stood thinking under the stars, "if his boat is still there, now that
he--after what we saw."At dawn they could see the ragged flotilla of sampans stealing up-river
on the early flood; but of the masts that huddled in vapors by the
farther bank, they had no certainty until sunrise, when the green rag
and the rice-measure appeared still dangling above the Hakka boat.Even then it was not certain--as Captain Kneebone sourly pointed
out--that her sailors would keep their agreement.And when he had piled,
on the river-steps, the dry wood for their signal fire, a new difficulty
rose.One of the wounded converts was up, and hobbling with a stick; but
the other would never be ferried down any stream known to man.He lay
dying, and the padre could not leave him.All the others waited, ready and anxious; but no one grumbled because
death, never punctual, now kept them waiting.The flutter of birds,
among the orange trees, gradually ceased; the sun came slanting over
the eastern wall; the gray floor of the compound turned white and
blurred through the dancing heat.A torrid westerly breeze came
fitfully, rose, died away, rose again, and made Captain Kneebone curse."Next we'll lose the ebb, too, be
'anged."Noon passed, and mid-afternoon, before the padre came out from the
courtyard, covering his white head with his ungainly helmet."We may go now," he said gravely, "in a few minutes."No more were needed, for the loose clods in the old shaft of their
counter-mine were quickly handled, and the necessary words soon uttered.Captain Kneebone had slipped out through the water gate, beforehand, and
lighted the fire on the steps.But not one of the burial party turned
his head, to watch the success or failure of their signal, so long as
the padre's resonant bass continued.When it ceased, however, they returned quickly through the little grove.The captain opened the great gate, and looked out eagerly, craning to
see through the smoke that poured into his face.The Hakka boat had, indeed, vanished from her moorings.On the bronze
current, nothing moved but three fishing-boats drifting down, with the
smoke, toward the marsh and the bend of the river, and a small junk that
toiled up against wind and tide, a cluster of naked sailors tugging and
shoving at her heavy sweep, which chafed its rigging of dry rope, and
gave out a high, complaining note like the cry of a sea-gull."She's gone," repeated Captain Kneebone.But the compradore, dragging his bundle of sharp halberds, poked an
inquisitive head out past the captain's, and peered on all sides through
the smoke, with comical thoroughness.He dodged back, grinning and
ducking amiably."Moh bettah look-see," he chuckled; "dat coolie come-back, he too muchee
waitee, b'long one piecee foolo-man."Whoever handled the Hakka boat was no fool, but by working
upstream on the opposite shore, crossing above, and dropping down with
the ebb, had craftily brought her along the shallow, so close beneath
the river-wall, that not till now did even the little captain spy her.The high prow, the mast, now bare, and her round midships roof, bright
golden-thatched with leaves of the edible bamboo, came moving quiet as
some enchanted boat in a calm.The fugitives by the gate still thought
themselves abandoned, when her beak, six feet in air, stole past them,
and her lean boatmen, prodding the river-bed with their poles, stopped
her as easily as a gondola.The yellow steersman grinned, straining at
the pivot of his gigantic paddle."Remember _you_ in my will, too!"And the grinning lowdah nodded, as though he understood.They had now only to pitch their supplies through the smoke, down on the
loose boards of her deck.Then--Rudolph and the captain kicking the
bonfire off the stairs--the whole company hurried down and safely over
her gunwale: first the two women, then the few huddling converts, the
white men next, the compradore still hugging his pole-axes, and last of
all, Heywood, still in strange apathy, with haggard face and downcast
eyes.He stumbled aboard as though drunk, his rifle askew under one arm,
and in the crook of the other, Flounce, the fox-terrier, dangling,
nervous and wide awake.He looked to neither right nor left, met nobody's eye.The rest of the
company crowded into the house amidships, and flung themselves down
wearily in the grateful dusk, where vivid paintings and mysteries of
rude carving writhed on the fir bulkheads.But Heywood, with his dog and
the captain and Rudolph, sat in the hot sun, staring down at the
ramshackle deck, through the gaps in which rose all the stinks of the
sweating hold.The boatmen climbed the high slant of the bow, planted their stout
bamboos against their shoulders, and came slowly down, head first, like
straining acrobats.As slowly, the boat began to glide past the stairs.Thus far, though the fire lay scattered in the mud, the smoke drifted
still before them and obscured their silent, headlong transaction.Now,
thinning as they dropped below the corner of the wall, it left them
naked to their enemies on the knoll.At the same instant, from the marsh
ahead, the sentinel in the round hat sprang up again, like an
instantaneous mushroom.He shouted, and waved to his fellows inland.They had no time, however, to leave the high ground; for the whole
chance of the adventure took a sudden and amazing turn.Heywood sprang out of his stupor, and stood pointing.The face of his friend, by torchlight above the
wall, had struck him dumb.Now that he spoke, his companions saw,
exposed in the field to the view of the nunnery, a white body lying on a
framework as on a bier.Near the foot stood a rough sort of windlass.Above, on the crest of the field, where a band of men had begun to
scramble at the sentinel's halloo, there sat on a white pony the
bright-robed figure of the tall fanatic, Fang the Sword-Pen.Heywood's hands opened and shut rapidly, like things out of
control."Oh, Wutz, how did they--Saint Somebody--the martyrdom--
Poussin's picture in the Vatican.--I can't stand this, you chaps!"He snatched blindly at his gun, caught instead one of the compradore's
halberds, and without pause or warning, jumped out into the shallow
water.He ran splashing toward the bank, turned, and seemed to waver,
staring with wild eyes at the strange Tudor weapon in his hand.Then
shaking it savagely,--

"This will do!"He wheeled again, staggered to his feet on dry ground, and ran swiftly
along the eastern wall, up the rising field, straight toward his mark.Of the men on the knoll, a few fired and missed, the others, neutrals to
their will, stood fixed in wonder.Four or five, as the runner neared,
sprang out to intercept, but flew apart like ninepins.The watchers in
the boat saw the halberd flash high in the late afternoon sun, the
frightened pony swerve, and his rider go down with the one sweep of that
Homeric blow.The last they saw of Heywood, he went leaping from sight over the
crest, that swarmed with figures racing and stumbling after.The unheeded sentinel in the marsh fled, losing his great hat, as the
boat drifted round the point into midstream.CHAPTER XXI


THE DRAGON'S SHADOW

The lowdah would have set his dirty sails without delay, for the fair
wind was already drooping; but at the first motion he found himself
deposed, and a usurper in command, at the big steering-paddle.Captain
Kneebone, his cheeks white and suddenly old beneath the untidy stubble
of his beard, had taken charge.In momentary danger of being cut off
downstream, or overtaken from above, he kept the boat waiting along the
oozy shore.Puckering his eyes, he watched now the land, and now the
river, silent, furtive, and keenly perplexed, his head on a swivel, as
though he steered by some nightmare chart, or expected some instant and
transforming sight.Not until the sun touched the western hills, and long shadows from the
bank stole out and turned the stream from bright copper to vague
iron-gray, did he give over his watch.He left the tiller, with a
hopeless fling of the arm."Do as ye please," he growled, and cast himself down on deck by the
thatched house."Go on.--I'll never see _him_ again.--The heat, and
all--By the head, he was--Go on.He sat looking straight before him, with dull eyes that never moved;
nor did he stir at the dry rustle and scrape of the matting sail, slowly
hoisted above him.The quaggy banks, now darkening, slid more rapidly
astern; while the steersman and his mates in the high bow invoked the
wind with alternate chant, plaintive, mysterious, and half musical:--


"Ay-ly-chy-ly
Ah-ha-aah!"To the listeners, huddled in silence, the familiar cry became a long,
monotonous accompaniment to sad thoughts.Through the rhythm, presently,
broke a sound of small-arms,--a few shots, quick but softened by
distance, from far inland.The captain stirred, listened, dropped his head, and sat like stone.To
Rudolph, near him, the brief disturbance called up another evening--his
first on this same river, when from the grassy brink, above, he had
first heard of his friend.Now, at the same place, and by the same
light, they had heard the last.It was intolerable: he turned his back
on the captain.Inside, in the gloom of the painted cabin, the padre's
wife began suddenly to cry.After a time, the deep voice of her husband,
speaking very low, and to her alone, became dimly audible:--

"'All this is come upon us; yet have we not--Our heart is not turned
back, neither have our steps declined--Though thou hast sore broken us
in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.'"The little captain groaned, and rolled aside from the doorway."All very fine," he muttered, his head wrapped in his arms."But that's
no good to me.Whether she heard him, or by chance, Miss Drake came quietly from
within, and found a place between him and the gunwale.He did not rouse;
she neither glanced nor spoke, but leaned against the ribs of
smooth-worn fir, as though calmly waiting.When at last he looked up, to see her face and posture, he gave an angry
start."And I thought," he blurted, "be 'anged if sometimes I didn't think you
liked him!"Her dark eyes met the captain's with a great and steadfast clearness."No," she whispered; "it was more than that."The captain sat bolt upright, but no longer in condemnation.For a long
time he watched her, marveling; and when finally he spoke, his sharp,
domineering voice was lowered, almost gentle.I never
meant--Don't ye mind a rough old beggar, that don't know that hasn't one
thing more between him and the grave.And that,
now--I wish't was at the bottom o' this bloomin' river!"They said no more, but rested side by side, like old friends joined
closer by new grief.Flounce, the terrier, snuffing disconsolately about
the deck, and scratching the boards in her zeal to explore the shallow
hold, at last grew weary, and came to snuggle down between the two
silent companions.Not till then did the girl turn aside her face, as
though studying the shore, which now melted in a soft, half-liquid band
as black as coal-tar, above the luminous indigo of the river.Suddenly Rudolph got upon his feet, and craning outboard from gunwale
and thatched eaves, looked steadily forward into the dusk.A chatter of
angry voices came stealing up, in the pauses of the wind.He watched and
listened, then quickly drew in his head.Two or three of the voices hailed together, raucously.The steersman,
leaning on the loom of his paddle, made neither stir nor answer.They
hailed again, this time close aboard, and as it seemed, in rage.Glancing contemptuously to starboard, the lowdah made some negligent
reply, about a cargo of human hair.His indifference appeared so real,
that for a moment Rudolph suspected him: perhaps he had been bought
over, and this meeting arranged.The
voices began to drop astern, and to come in louder confusion with
the breeze.But at this point Flounce, the terrier, spoiled all by whipping up
beside the lowdah, and furiously barking.Hers was no pariah's yelp: she
barked with spirit, in the King's English.For answer, there came a shout, a sharp report, and a bullet that ripped
through the matting sail.The steersman ducked, but clung bravely to his
paddle.Men tumbled out from the cabin, rifles in hand, to join Rudolph
and the captain.Astern, dangerously near, they saw the hostile craft, small, but listed
heavily with crowding ruffians, packed so close that their great wicker
hats hung along the gunwale to save room, and shone dim in the obscurity
like golden shields of vikings.A squat, burly fellow, shouting, jammed
the yulow hard to bring her about."Save your fire," called Captain Kneebone.As he spoke, however, an active form bounced up beside the squat man at
the sweep,--a plump, muscular little barefoot woman in blue.She tore
the fellow's hands away, and took command, keeping the boat's nose
pointed up-river, and squalling ferocious orders to all on board.This small, nimble, capable creature
could be no one but Mrs.Wu, their friend and gossip of that morning,
long ago....

The squat man gave an angry shout, and turned on her to wrest away the
handle.With great violence, yet with a
neat economy of motion, the Pretty Lily took one hand from her tiller,
long enough to topple him overboard with a sounding splash.Her passengers, at so prompt and visual a joke, burst into shrill,
cackling laughter.Yet more shrill, before their mood could alter, the
Pretty Lily scourged them with the tongue of a humorous woman.She held
her course, moreover; the two boats drifted so quickly apart that when
she turned, to fling a comic farewell after the white men, they could no
more than descry her face, alert and comely, and the whiteness of her
teeth.Her laughing cry still rang, the overthrown leader still
floundered in the water, when the picture blurred and vanished.Down the
wind came her words, high, voluble, quelling all further mutiny aboard
that craft of hers.The tall padre eyed Rudolph with sudden interest,
and laid his big hand on the young man's shoulder."No," answered Rudolph, and shook his head, sadly."We owe that to--some
one else."Later, while they drifted down to meet the sea and the night, he told
the story, to which all listened with profound attention, wondering at
the turns of fortune, and at this last service, rendered by a friend
they should see no more.They murmured awhile, by twos and threes huddled in corners; then lay
silent, exhausted in body and spirit.The river melted with the shore
into a common blackness, faintly hovered over by the hot, brown, sullen
evening.Unchallenged, the Hakka boat flitted past the lights of a
war-junk, so close that the curved lantern-ribs flickered thin and sharp
against a smoky gleam, and tawny faces wavered, thick of lip and stolid
of eye, round the supper fire.A greasy, bitter smell of cooking floated
after.Then no change or break in the darkness, except a dim lantern or
two creeping low in a sampan, with a fragment of talk from unseen
passers; until, as the stars multiplied overhead, the night of the land
rolled heavily astern and away from another, wider night, the stink of
the marshes failed, and by a blind sense of greater buoyancy and
sea-room, the voyagers knew that they had gained the roadstead.Ahead,
far off and lustrous, a new field of stars hung scarce higher than
their gunwale, above the rim of the world.The lowdah showed no light; and presently none was needed, for--as the
shallows gave place to deeps--the ocean boiled with the hoary,
green-gold magic of phosphorus, that heaved alongside in soft explosions
of witch-fire, and sent uncertain smoky tremors playing through the
darkness on deck.Rudolph, watching this tropic miracle, could make out
the white figure of the captain, asleep near by, under the faint
semicircle of the deck-house; and across from him, Miss Drake, still
sitting upright, as though waiting, with Flounce at her side.Landward,
against the last sage-green vapor of daylight, ran the dim range of the
hills, in long undulations broken by sharper crests, like the finny back
of leviathan basking.Over there, thought Rudolph, beyond that black shape as beyond its
guarding dragon, lay the whole mysterious and peaceful empire, with
uncounted lives going on, ending, beginning, as though he, and his sore
loss, and his heart vacant of all but grief, belonged to some
unheard-of, alien process, to Nature's most unworthy trifling.This
boatload of men and women--so huge a part of his own experience--was
like the tiniest barnacle chafed from the side of that dark,
serene monster.Rudolph stared long at the hills, and as they faded, hung his head.From that dragon he had learned much; yet now all learning was but loss.Of a sudden the girl spoke, in a clear yet guarded voice, too low to
reach the sleepers.It will be good for
both of us."Rudolph crossed silently, and stood leaning on the gunwale beside her."I thought only," he answered, "how much the hills looked so--as a
dragon."The trembling phosphorus half-revealed her face, pale and
still."I was thinking of that, in a way.It reminded me of what he
said, once--when we were walking together."To their great relief, they found themselves talking of Heywood, sadly,
but freely, and as it were in a sudden calm.Their friendship seemed,
for the moment, a thing as long established as the dragon hills.Years
afterward, Rudolph recalled her words, plainer than the fiery wonder
that spread and burst round their little vessel, or the long play of
heat-lightning which now, from time to time, wavered instantly along the
eastern sea-line."To go on with life, even when we
are alone--You will go on, I know.And again she said: "Yes,
such men as he are--a sort of Happy Warrior."And later, in her slow and
level voice: "You learned something, you say.Isn't that--what I
call--being invulnerable?When a man's greater than anything that
happens to him--"

So they talked, their speech bare and simple, but the pauses and longer
silences filled with deep understanding, solemnized by the time and the
place, as though their two lonely spirits caught wisdom from the night,
scope from the silent ocean, light from the flickering East.The flashes, meanwhile, came faster and prolonged their glory, running
behind a thin, dead screen of scalloped clouds, piercing the tropic sky
with summer blue, and ripping out the lost horizon like a long black
fibre from pulp.The two friends watched in silence, when Rudolph rose,
and moved cautiously aft.So long as the boiling witch-fire
turned their wake to golden vapor, he could not be sure; but whenever
the heat-lightning ran, and through the sere, phantasmal sail, the
lookout in the bow flashed like a sharp silhouette through wire
gauze,--then it seemed to Rudolph that another small black shape leapt
out astern, and vanished.He stood by the lowdah, watching anxiously.Time and again the ocean flickered into view, like the floor of a
measureless cavern; and still he could not tell.But at last the lowdah
also turned his head, and murmured.Their boat creaked monotonously,
drifting to leeward in a riot of golden mist; yet now another creaking
disturbed the night, in a different cadence.Another boat followed them,
rowing fast and gaining.In a brighter flash, her black sail fluttered,
unmistakable.Rudolph reached for his gun, but waited silently.Some chance fisherman, it might be, or any small craft holding the same
course along the coast.Still, he did not like the hurry of the sweeps,
which presently groaned louder and threw up nebulous fire.The
stranger's bow became an arrowhead of running gold.And here was Flounce, ready to misbehave once more.Before he could
catch her, the small white body of the terrier whipped by him, and past
the steersman.This time, however, as though cowed, she began to
whimper, and then maintained a long, trembling whine.Beside Rudolph, the compradore's head bobbed up.And in his native tongue, Ah Pat grumbled
something about ghosts.A harsh voice hailed, from the boat astern; the lowdah answered; and so
rapidly slid the deceptive glimmer of her bow, that before Rudolph knew
whether to wake his friends, or could recover, next, from the shock and
ecstasy of unbelief, a tall white figure jumped or swarmed over
the side.sounded the voice of Heywood, gravely.With fingers
that dripped gold, he tried to pat the bounding terrier.She flew up at
him, and tumbled back, in the liveliest danger of falling overboard.In a daze, Rudolph gripped the wet and shining hands,
and heard the same quiet voice: "Rest all asleep, I suppose?To-morrow will do.--Have you any money on you?Toss that
fisherman--whatever you think I'm worth.He really rowed like steam,
you know."Rudolph flung his purse into the other boat.When he turned, this man
restored from the sea had disappeared.But he had only stolen forward,
dog in arms, to sit beside Miss Drake.So quietly had all happened, that
none of the sleepers, not even the captain, was aware.Rudolph drew near
the two murmuring voices.

"--Couldn't help it, honestly," said Heywood."Can't describe, or
explain.Just something--went black inside my head, you know.""No: don't recall seeing a thing, really, until I pitched away
the--what happened to be in my hands.Losing your
head, I suppose they call it.The girl's question recalled him from his puzzle."I ran, that's all.--Oh,
yes, but I ran faster.--Not half so many as you'd suppose.Most of 'em
were away, burning your hospital.Hence those stuffed hats, Rudie, in the trench.--Only three
of the lot could run.I merely scuttled into the next bamboo, and kept
on scuttling.Oh, yes, arrow in the
shoulder--scratch.Of course, when it came dark, I stopped running, and
made for the nearest fisherman."But," protested Rudolph, wondering, "we heard shots.""Yes, I had my Webley in my belt.I _told_ you: three of
them could run."The speaker patted the terrier in his lap."My dream,
eh, little dog?You _were_ the only one to know.""No," said the girl: "I knew--all the time, that--"

Whatever she meant, Rudolph could only guess; but it was true, he
thought, that she had never once spoken as though the present meeting
were not possible, here or somewhere.Recalling this, he suddenly but
quietly stepped away aft, to sit beside the steersman, and smile in
the darkness.He did not listen, but watched the phosphorus
welling soft and turbulent in the wake, and far off, in glimpses of the
tropic light, the great Dragon weltering on the face of the waters.The
shape glimmered forth, died away, like a prodigy."Ich lieg' und besitze."And yet," thought the young man, "I have one pearl from his hoard."That girl was right: like Siegfried tempered in the grisly flood, the
raw boy was turning into a man, seasoned and invulnerable.Heywood was calling to him:--

"You must go Home with us.I've made a wonderful plan--with
the captain's fortune!A small white heap across the deck began to rise."How often," complained a voice blurred with sleep, "how often must I
tell ye--wake me, unless the ship--chart's all--Good God!"At the captain's cry, those who lay in darkness under the thatched roof
began to mutter, to rise, and grope out into the trembling light, with
sleepy cries of joy.Footnote 282:

  In support of this statement he points out that twice during Christian
  times it had been found necessary to raise the floor of the church.The nave floor, which in 1857 was two steps below that of the aisles,
  was raised in 1881 to the same level; but two feet nine inches below
  the nave floor before it was raised there existed, according to Prof.Eitelberger, another mosaic pavement, which must have been the floor
  of the first basilica erected, and which was pulled down by Bishop
  Euphrasius in 543.This lower pavement extended also under the three
  chapels of the confessio, which suggests that these are part of the
  first basilica.Footnote 284:

  The same polygonal form is found in the apses of St.Apollinare in Classe, St.Apollinare in Nuovo, St.Vitale, all in Ravenna, and St.Footnote 285:

  The apses of two churches, of the 4th and 6th century respectively, in
  the island of Paros, are similarly fitted with marble seats: in the
  6th century church there are eight rows, so that the apse looks like a
  small amphitheatre.Footnote 286:

  That is on the supposition that the word kirk is derived from the
  Latin word “circus,” “circular,” as the French term it, “cirque.” My
  own conviction is that this is certainly the case.The word is only
  used by the Barbarians as applied to a form of buildings they derived
  from the Romans.Why the Germans should employ κυρίου οἶκος, when
  neither the Greeks nor the Latins used that name, is a mystery which
  those who insist on these very improbable names have as yet failed to
  explain.Footnote 287:

  the vaults of the Circus of Maxentius, on the Via Appia.—ED.]Footnote 292:

  In this building they now show a sarcophagus of ancient date, said to

  with stucco and painted; being closer to the eye in Murano, they
  filled the spaces with incised marble slabs: in other words, it seems
  more probable that the slabs were made for the triangular panels than
  the converse, which is suggested by Mr.Footnote 301:

  The typical example of this class is the San Giorgio at Venice, though

  small blind arches below, carried on corbels, and may be regarded as
  the prototype of the most characteristic Lombard towers.—ED.]Footnote 305:

plants, if there are no chinks or crevices in the stony soil through
which their roots can penetrate and seek the life-sustaining fluid
below, wither and die.It is a curious sight that presented by the roots
of the trees, growing on the precipituous[TN-1] brinks of the _senotes_,
in their search for water.They go down and down, even a hundred feet,
until they reach the liquid surface, from where they suck up the fluid
to aliment the body of the tree.They seem like many cables and ropes
stretched all round the sides of the well; and, in fact, serves as such
to some of the most daring of the natives, to ascend or descend to enjoy
a refreshing bath.These _senotes_ are immense circular holes, the diameter of which varies
from 50 to 500 feet, with perpendicular walls from 50 to 150 feet deep.These holes might be supposed to have served as ducts for the
subterranean gases at the time of the upheaval of the country.In some, the current is easily noticeable; many
are completely dry; whilst others contain thermal mineral water,
emitting at times strong sulphurous odor and vapor.Many strange stories are told by the aborigines concerning the
properties possessed by the water in certain senotes, and the strange
phenomena that takes place in others.In one, for example, you are
warned to approach the water walking backward, and to breathe very
softly, otherwise it becomes turbid and unfit for drinking until it has
settled and become clear again.In another you are told not to speak
above a whisper, for if any one raises the voice the tranquil surface of
the water immediately becomes agitated, and soon assumes the appearance
of boiling; even its level raises.These and many other things are told
in connection with the caves and senotes; and we find them mentioned in
the writings of the chroniclers and historians from the time of the
Spanish conquest.No lakes exist on the surface, at least within the territories occupied
by the white men.Some small sheets of water, called aguadas, may be
found here and there, and are fed by the underground current; but they
are very rare.There are three or four near the ruins of the ancient
city of Mayapan: probably its inhabitants found in them an abundant
supply of water.Following all the same direction, they are, as some
suppose, no doubt with reason, the outbreaks of a subterranean stream
that comes also to the surface in the senote of _Mucuyche_.A mile or so
from Uxmal is another aguada; but judging from the great number of
artificial reservoirs, built on the terraces and in the courts of all
the monuments, it would seem as if the people there depended more on the
clouds for their provision of water than on the wells and senotes.Yet I
feel confident that one of these must exist under the building known as
the Governor's house; having discovered in its immediate vicinity the
entrance--now closed--of a cave from which a cool current of air is
continually issuing; at times with great force.I have been assured by Indians from the village of Chemax, who pretend
to know that part of the country well, that, at a distance of about
fifty miles from the city of Valladolid, the actual largest settlement
on the eastern frontier, in the territories occupied by the SANTA CRUZ
Indians, there exists, near the ruins of _Kaba_, two extensive sheets of
water, from where, in years gone by, the inhabitants of Valladolid
procured abundant supply of excellent fishes.These ruins of Kaba, said
to be very interesting, have never been visited by any foreigner; nor
are they likely to be for many years to come, on account of the imminent
danger of falling into the hands of those of Santa Cruz--that, since
1847, wage war to the knife against the Yucatecans.On the coast, the sea penetrating in the lowlands have formed sloughs
and lakes, on the shores of which thickets of mangroves grow, with
tropical luxuriancy.Intermingling their crooked roots, they form such a
barrier as to make landing well nigh impossible.These small lakes,
subject to the ebb and flow of the tides, are the resort of innumerable
sea birds and water fowls of all sizes and descriptions; from the snipe
to the crane, and brightly  flamingos, from the screeching sea
gulls to the serious looking pelican.They are attracted to these lakes
by the solitude of the forests of mangroves that afford them excellent
shelter, where to build their nests, and find protection from the storms
that, at certain season of the year, sweep with untold violence along
the coast: and because with ease they can procure an abundant supply of
food, these waters being inhabited by myriads of fishes, as they come to
bask on the surface which is seldom ruffled even when the tempest rages
outside.Notwithstanding the want of superficial water, the air is always charged
with moisture; the consequence being a most equable temperature all the
year round, and an extreme luxuriance of all vegetation.The climate is
mild and comparatively healthy for a country situated within the
tropics, and bathed by the waters of the Mexican Gulf.This mildness and
healthiness may be attributed to the sea breezes that constantly pass
over the peninsula, carrying the malaria and noxious gases that have not
been absorbed by the forests, which cover the main portion of the land;
and to the great abundance of oxygen exuded by the plants in return.This excessive moisture and the decomposition of dead vegetable matter
is the cause of the intermittent fevers that prevail in all parts of the
peninsula, where the yellow fever, under a mild form generally, is also
endemic.When it appears, as this year, in an epidemic form, the natives
themselves enjoy no immunity from its ravages, and fall victims to it as
well as unacclimated foreigners.These epidemics, those of smallpox and other diseases that at times make
their appearance in Yucatan, generally present themselves after the
rainy season, particularly if the rains have been excessive.The country
being extremely flat, the drainage is necessarily very bad: and in
places like Merida, for example, where a crowding of population exists,
and the cleanliness of the streets is utterly disregarded by the proper
authorities, the decomposition of vegetable and animal matter is very
large; and the miasmas generated, being carried with the vapors arising
from the constant evaporation of stagnant waters, are the origin of
those scourges that decimate the inhabitants.Yucatan, isolated as it
is, its small territory nearly surrounded by water, ought to be, if the
laws of health were properly enforced, one of the most healthy countries
on the earth; where, as in the Island of Cozumel, people should only die
of old age or accident.The thermometer varies but little, averaging
about 80 deg.True, it rises in the months of July and August as
high as 96 deg.in the shade, but it seldom falls below 65 deg.In the dry season, from January to June, the trees
become divested of their leaves, that fall more particularly in March
and April.Then the sun, returning from the south on its way to the
north, passes over the land and darts its scorching perpendicular rays
on it, causing every living creature to thirst for a drop of cool water;
the heat being increased by the burning of those parts of the forests
that have been cut down to prepare fields for cultivation.In the portion of the peninsula, about one-third of it, that still
remains in possession of the white, the Santa Cruz Indians holding,
since 1847, the richest and most fertile, two-thirds, the soil is
entirely stony.The arable loam, a few inches in thickness, is the
result of the detriti of the stones, mixed with the remainder of the
decomposition of vegetable matter.In certain districts, towards the
eastern and southern parts of the State, patches of red clay form
excellent ground for the cultivation of the sugar cane and Yuca root.From this an excellent starch is obtained in large quantities.Withal,
the soil is of astonishing fertility, and trees, even, are met with of
large size, whose roots run on the surface of the bare stone,
penetrating the chinks and crevices only in search of moisture.Often
times I have seen them growing from the center of slabs, the seed having
fallen in a hole that happened to be bored in them.In the month of May
the whole country seems parched and dry.The
branches and boughs are naked, and covered with a thick coating of gray
dust.Nothing to intercept the sight in the thicket but the bare trunks
and branches, with the withes entwining them.With the first days of
June come the first refreshing showers.As if a magic wand had been
waved over the land, the view changes--life springs everywhere.In the
short space of a few days the forests have resumed their holiday attire;
buds appear and the leaves shoot; the flowers bloom sending forth their
fragrance, that wafted by the breeze perfume the air far and near.The
birds sing their best songs of joy; the insects chirp their shrillest
notes; butterflies of gorgeous colors flutter in clouds in every
direction in search of the nectar contained in the cups of the
newly-opened blossom, and dispute it with the brilliant humming-birds.All creation rejoices because a few tears of mother Nature have brought
joy and happiness to all living beings, from the smallest blade of grass
to the majestic palm; from the creeping worm to man, who proudly titles
himself the lord of creation.Yucatan has no rich metallic mines, but its wealth of vegetable
productions is immense.Large forests of mahogany, cedar, zapotillo
trees cover vast extents of land in the eastern and southern portions of
the peninsula; whilst patches of logwood and mora, many miles in length,
grow near the coast.The wood is to-day cut down and exported by the
Indians of Santa Cruz through their agents at Belize.Coffee, vanilla,
tobacco, india-rubber, rosins of various kinds, copal in particular,
all of good quality, abound in the country, but are not cultivated on
account of its unsettled state; the Indians retaining possession of the
most fertile territories where these rich products are found.The whites have been reduced to the culture of the Hennequen plant
(agave sisalensis) in order to subsist.It is the only article of
commerce that grows well on the stony soil to which they are now
confined.The filament obtained from the plant, and the objects
manufactured from it constitute the principal article of export; in fact
the only source of wealth of the Yucatecans.As the filament is now much
in demand for the fabrication of cordage in the United States and
Europe, many of the landowners have ceased to plant maize, although the
staple article of food in all classes, to convert their land into
hennequen fields.The plant thrives well on stony soil, requires no
water and but little care.The natural consequence of planting the whole
country with hennequen has been so great a deficiency in the maize crop,
that this year not enough was grown for the consumption, and people in
the northeastern district were beginning to suffer from the want of it,
when some merchants of Merida imported large quantities from New York.They, of course, sold it at advanced prices, much to the detriment of
the poorer classes.Some sugar is also cultivated in the southern and
eastern districts, but not in sufficient quantities even for the
consumption; and not a little is imported from Habana.The population of the country, about 250,000 souls all told, are mostly
Indians and mixed blood.In fact, very few families can be found of pure
Caucasian race.Notwithstanding the great admixture of different races,
a careful observer can readily distinguish yet four prominent ones, very
noticeable by their features, their stature, the conformation of their
body.The dwarfish race is certainly easily distinguishable from the
descendants of the giants that tradition says once upon a time existed
in the country, whose bones are yet found, and whose portraits are
painted on the walls of Chaacmol's funeral chamber at Chichen-Itza.The
almond-eyed, flat-nosed Siamese race of Copan is not to be mistaken for
the long, big-nosed, flat-headed remnant of the Nahualt from Palenque,
who are said to have invaded the country some time at the beginning of
the Christian era; and whose advent among the Mayas, whose civilization
they appear to have destroyed, has been commemorated by calling the
_west_, the region whence they came, according to Landa, Cogolludo and
other historians, NOHNIAL, a word which means literally _big noses for
our daughters_; whilst the coming of the bearded men from the _east_,
better looking than those of the west, if we are to give credit to the
bas-relief where their portraits are to be seen, was called
CENIAL--_ornaments for our daughters_.If we are to judge by the great number of ruined cities scattered
everywhere through the forests of the peninsula; by the architectural
beauty of the monuments still extant, the specimens of their artistic
attainments in drawing and sculpture which have reached us in the
bas-reliefs, statues and mural paintings of Uxmal and Chichen-Itza; by
their knowledge in mathematical and astronomical sciences, as manifested
in the construction of the gnomon found by me in the ruins of Mayapan;
by the complexity of the grammatical form and syntaxis of their
language, still spoken to-day by the majority of the inhabitants of
Yucatan; by their mode of expressing their thoughts on paper, made from
the bark of certain trees, with alphabetical and phonetical characters,
we must of necessity believe that, at some time or other, the country
was not only densely populated, but that the inhabitants had reached a
high degree of civilization.To-day we can conceive of very few of their
attainments by the scanty remains of their handiwork, as they have come
to us injured by the hand of time, and, more so yet, by that of man,
during the wars, the invasions, the social and religious convulsions
which have taken place among these people, as among all other nations.Only the opening of the buildings which contain the libraries of their
learned men, and the reading of their works, could solve the mystery,
and cause us to know how much they had advanced in the discovery and
explanation of Nature's arcana; how much they knew of mankind's past
history, and of the nations with which they held intercourse.Let us
hope that the day may yet come when the Mexican government will grant to
me the requisite permission, in order that I may bring forth, from the
edifices where they are hidden, the precious volumes, without opposition
from the owners of the property where the monuments exist.Until then we
must content ourselves with the study of the inscriptions carved on the
walls, and becoming acquainted with the history of their builders, and
continue to conjecture what knowledge they possessed in order to be able
to rear such enduring structures, besides the art of designing the plans
and ornaments, and the manner of carving them on stone.Let us place ourselves in the position of the archaeologists of thousands
of years to come, examining the ruins of our great cities, finding still
on foot some of the stronger built palaces and public buildings, with
some rare specimens of the arts, sciences, industry of our days, the
minor edifices having disappeared, gnawed by the steely tooth of time,
together with the many products of our industry, the machines of all
kinds, creation of man's ingenuity, and his powerful helpmates.What
would they know of the attainments and the progress in mechanics of our
days?Would they be able to form a complete idea of our civilization,
and of the knowledge of our scientific men, without the help of the
volumes contained in our public libraries, and maybe of some one able to
interpret them?Well, it seems to me that we stand in exactly the same
position concerning the civilization of those who have preceded us five
or ten thousand years ago on this continent, as these future
archaeologists may stand regarding our civilization five or ten thousand
years hence.It is a fact, recorded by all historians of the Conquest, that when for
the first time in 1517 the Spaniards came in sight of the lands called
by them Yucatan, they were surprised to see on the coast many monuments
well built of stone; and to find the country strewn with large cities
and beautiful monuments that recalled to their memory the best of Spain.They were no less astonished to meet in the inhabitants, not naked
savages, but a civilized people, possessed of polite and pleasant
manners, dressed in white cotton habiliments, navigating large boats
propelled by sails, traveling on well constructed roads and causeways
that, in point of beauty and solidity, could compare advantageously with
similar Roman structures in Spain, Italy, England or France.I will not describe here the majestic monuments raised by the Mayas.Le Plongeon, in her letters to the _New York World_, has given of
those of UXMAL, AKE and MAYAPAN, the only correct description ever
published.My object at present is to relate some of the curious facts
revealed to us by their weather-beaten and crumbling walls, and show how
erroneous is the opinion of some European scientists, who think it not
worth while to give a moment of their precious time to the study of
American archaeology, because say they: _No relations have ever been
found to have existed between the monuments and civilizations of the
inhabitants of this continent and those of the old world_.On what
ground they hazard such an opinion it is difficult to surmise, since to
my knowledge the ancient ruined cities of Yucatan, until lately, have
never been thoroughly, much less scientifically, explored.The same is
true of the other monumental ruins of the whole of Central America.Le Plongeon and myself landed at Progresso, in 1873, we
thought that because we had read the works of Stephens, Waldeck,
Norman, Fredeichstal; carefully examined the few photographic views made
by Mr.Charnay of some of the monuments, we knew all about them.When in presence of the antique shrines and palaces of
the Mayas, we soon saw how mistaken we had been; how little those
writers had seen of the monuments they had pretended to describe: that
the work of studying them systematically was not even begun; and that
many years of close observation and patient labor would be necessary in
order to dispel the mysteries which hang over them, and to discover the
hidden meaning of their ornaments and inscriptions.To this difficult
task we resolved to dedicate our time, and to concentrate our efforts to
find a solution, if possible, to the enigma.We began our work by taking photographs of all the monuments in their
_tout ensemble_, and in all their details, as much as practicable.Next,
we surveyed them carefully; made accurate plans of them in order to be
able to comprehend by the disposition of their different parts, for what
possible use they were erected; taking, as a starting point, that the
human mind and human inclinations and wants are the same in all times,
in all countries, in all races when civilized and cultured.We next
carefully examined what connection the ornaments bore to each other, and
tried to understand the meaning of the designs.At first the maze of
these designs seemed a very difficult riddle to solve.Yet, we believed
that if a human intelligence had devised it, another human intelligence
would certainly be able to unravel it.It was not, however, until we had
nearly completed the tracing and study of the mural paintings, still
extant in the funeral chamber of Chaacmol, or room built on the top of
the eastern wall of the gymnasium at Chichen-Itza, at its southern end,
that Stephens mistook for a shrine dedicated to the god of the players
at ball, that a glimmer of light began to dawn upon us.In tracing the
figure of Chaacmol in battle, I remarked that the shield worn by him
had painted on it round green spots, and was exactly like the ornaments
placed between tiger and tiger on the entablature of the same monument.I naturally concluded that the monument had been raised to the memory of
the warrior bearing the shield; that the tigers represented his totem,
and that _Chaacmol_ or _Balam_ maya[TN-2] words for spotted tiger or
leopard, was his name.I then remembered that at about one hundred yards
in the thicket from the edifice, in an easterly direction, a few days
before, I had noticed the ruins of a remarkable mound of rather small
dimensions.It was ornamented with slabs engraved with the images of
spotted tigers, eating human hearts, forming magnificent bas-reliefs,
conserving yet traces of the colors in which it was formerly painted.The same round
dots, forming the spots of their skins, were present here as on the
shield of the warrior in battle, and that on the entablature of the
building.On examining carefully the ground around the mound, I soon
stumbled upon what seemed to be a half buried statue.On clearing the
_debris_ we found a statue in the round, representing a wounded tiger
reclining on his right side.Three holes in the back indicated the
places where he received his wounds.A few feet
further, I found a human head with the eyes half closed, as those of a
dying person.When placed on the neck of the tiger it fitted exactly.I
propped it with sticks to keep it in place.So arranged, it recalled
vividly the Chaldean and Egyptian deities having heads of human beings
and bodies of animals.The next object that called my attention was
another slab on which was represented in bas-relief a dying warrior,
reclining on his back, the head was thrown entirely backwards.His left
arm was placed across his chest, the left hand resting on the right
shoulder, exactly in the same position which the Egyptians were wont, at
times, to give to the mummies of some of their eminent men.From his
mouth was seen escaping two thin, narrow flames--the spirit of the
dying man abandoning the body with the last warm breath.These and many other sculptures caused me to suspect that this monument
had been the mausoleum raised to the memory of the warrior with the
shield covered with the round dots.Next to the slabs engraved with the
image of tigers was another, representing an _ara militaris_ (a bird of
the parrot specie, very large and of brilliant plumage of various
colors).I took it for the totem of his wife, MOO, _macaw_; and so it
proved to be when later I was able to interpret their ideographic
writings._Kinich-Kakmo_ after her death obtained the honors of the
apotheosis; had temples raised to her memory, and was worshipped at
Izamal up to the time of the Spanish conquest, according to Landa,
Cogolludo and Lizana.Satisfied that I had found the tomb of a great warrior among the Mayas,
I resolved to make an excavation, notwithstanding I had no tools or
implements proper for such work.After two months of hard toil, after
penetrating through three level floors painted with yellow ochre, at
last a large stone urn came in sight.It was opened in presence of
Colonel D. Daniel Traconis.It contained a small heap of grayish dust
over which lay the cover of a terra cotta pot, also painted yellow; a
few small ornaments of macre that crumbled to dust on being touched, and
a large ball of jade, with a hole pierced in the middle.This ball had
at one time been highly polished, but for some cause or other the polish
had disappeared from one side.Near, and lower than the urn, was
discovered the head of the colossal statue, to-day the best, or one of
the best pieces, in the National Museum of Mexico, having been carried
thither on board of the gunboat _Libertad_, without my consent, and
without any renumeration having even been offered by the Mexican
government for my labor, my time and the money spent in the discovery.Close to the chest of the statue was another stone urn much larger than
the first.On being uncovered it was found to contain a large quantity
of reddish substance and some jade ornaments.On closely examining this
substance I pronounced it organic matter that had been subjected to a
very great heat in an open vessel.(A chemical analysis of some of it by
Professor Thompson, of Worcester, Mass., at the request of Mr.Stephen
Salisbury, Jr., confirmed my opinion).From the position of the urn I
made up my mind that its contents were the heart and viscera of the
personage represented by the statue; while the dust found in the first
urn must have been the residue of his brains.Landa tells us that it was the custom, even at the time of the Spanish
conquest, when a person of eminence died to make images of stone, or
terra cotta or wood in the semblance of the deceased, whose ashes were
placed in a hollow made on the back of the head for the purpose.Feeling
sorry for having thus disturbed the remains of _Chaacmol_, so carefully
concealed by his friends and relatives many centuries ago; in order to
save them from further desecration, I burned the greater part reserving
only a small quantity for future analysis.This finding of the heart and
brains of that chieftain, afforded an explanation, if any was needed, of
one of the scenes more artistically portrayed in the mural paintings of
his funeral chamber.In this scene which is painted immediately over the
entrance of the chamber, where is also a life-size representation of his
corpse prepared for cremation, the dead warrior is pictured stretched on
the ground, his back resting on a large stone placed for the purpose of
raising the body and keeping open the cut made across it, under the
ribs, for the extraction of the heart and other parts it was customary
to preserve.These are seen in the hands of his children.At the feet of
the statue were found a number of beautiful arrowheads of flint and
chalcedony; also beads that formed part of his necklace.These, to-day
petrified, seemed to have been originally of bone or ivory.They were
wrought to figure shells of periwinkles.Surrounding the slab on which
the figure rests was a large quantity of dried blood.This fact might
lead us to suppose that slaves were sacrificed at his funeral, as
Herodotus tells us it was customary with the Scythians, and we know it
was with the Romans and other nations of the old world, and the Incas in
Peru.Yet not a bone or any other human remains were found in the
mausoleum.The statue forms a single piece with the slab on which it reclines, as
if about to rise on his elbows, the legs being drawn up so that the feet
rest flat on the slab.I consider this attitude given to the statues of
dead personages that I have discovered in Chichen, where they are still,
to be symbolical of their belief in reincarnation.They, in common with
the Egyptians, the Hindoos, and other nations of antiquity, held that
the spirit of man after being made to suffer for its shortcomings during
its mundane life, would enjoy happiness for a time proportionate to its
good deeds, then return to earth, animate the body and live again a
material existence.The Mayas, however, destroying the body by fire,
made statues in the semblance of the deceased, so that, being
indestructible the spirit might find and animate them on its return to
earth.The present aborigines have the same belief.Even to-day, they
never fail to prepare the _hanal pixan_, the food for the spirits, which
they place in secluded spots in the forests or fields, every year, in
the month of November.These statues also hold an urn between their
hands.This fact again recalls to the mind the Egpptian[TN-3] custom of
placing an urn in the coffins with the mummies, to indicate that the
spirit of the deceased had been judged and found righteous.The ornament hanging on the breast of Chaacmol's effigy, from a ribbon
tied with a peculiar knot behind his neck, is simply a badge of his
rank; the same is seen on the breast of many other personages in the
bas-reliefs and mural paintings.A similar mark of authority is yet in
usage in Burmah.I have tarried so long on the description of my first important
discovery because I desired to explain the method followed by me in the
investigation of these monuments, to show that the result of our labors
are by no means the work of imagination--as some have been so kind a
_short_ time ago as to intimate--but of careful and patient analysis and
comparison; also, in order, from the start, to call your attention to
the similarity of certain customs in the funeral rites that the Mayas
seem to have possessed in common with other nations of the old world:
and lastly, because my friend, Dr.Jesus Sanchez, Professor of
Archaeology in the National Museum of Mexico, ignoring altogether the
circumstances accompanying the discovery of the statue, has published in
the _Anales del Museo Nacional_, a long dissertation--full of erudition,
certainly--to prove that the statue discovered by me at Chichen-Itza,
was a representation of the _God of the natural production of the
earth_, and that the name given by me was altogether arbitrary; and,
also, because an article has appeared in the _North American Review_ for
October, 1880, signed by Mr.Charnay, in which the author, after
re-producing Mr.Sanchez's writing, pronounces _ex cathedra_ and _de
perse_, but without assigning any reason for his opinion, that the
statue is the effigy of the _god of wine_--the Mexican Bacchus--without
telling us which of them, for there were two.Having been obliged to abandon the statue in the forests--well wrapped
in oilcloth, and sheltered under a hut of palm leaves, constructed by
Mrs.Le Plongeon and myself--my men having been disarmed by order of
General Palomino, then commander-in-chief of the federal forces in
Yucatan, in consequence of a revolutionary movement against Dr.Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada and in favor of General Diaz--I went to Uxmal
to continue my researches among its ruined temples and palaces.There I
took many photographs, surveyed the monuments, and, for the first time,
found the remnants of the phallic worship of the Nahualts.Its symbols
are not to be seen in Chichen--the city of the holy and learned men,
Itzaes--but are frequently met with in the northern parts of the
peninsula, and all the regions where the Nahualt influence predominated.There can be no doubt that in very ancient times the same customs and
religious worship existed in Uxmal and Chichen, since these two cities
were founded by the same family, that of CAN (serpent), whose name is
written on all the monuments in both places.CAN and the members of his
family worshipped Deity under the symbol of the mastodon's head.At
Chichen a tableau of said worship forms the ornament of the building,
designated in the work of Stephens, "Travels in Yucatan," as IGLESIA;
being, in fact, the north wing of the palace and museum.This is the
reason why the mastodon's head forms so prominent a feature in all the
ornaments of the edifices built by them.They also worshipped the sun
and fire, which they represented by the same hieroglyph used by the
Egyptians for the sun [sun].In this worship of the fire they resembled
the Chaldeans and Hindoos, but differed from the Egyptians, who had no
veneration for this element.They regarded it merely as an animal that
devoured all things within its reach, and died with all it had
swallowed, when replete and satisfied.From certain inscriptions and pictures--in which the _Cans_ are
represented crawling on all fours like dogs--sculptured on the facade of
their house of worship, it would appear that their religion of the
mastodon was replaced by that of the reciprocal forces of nature,
imported in the country by the big-nosed invaders, the Nahualts coming
from the west.These destroyed Chichen, and established their capital at
_Uxmal_.There they erected in all the courts of the palaces, and on the
platforms of the temples the symbols of their religion, taking care,
however, not to interfere with the worship of the sun and fire, that
seems to have been the most popular.Bancroft in his work, "_The Native Races of the Pacific States_," Vol.IV., page 277, remarks: "That the scarcity of idols among the Maya
antiquities must be regarded as extraordinary.That the people of
Yucatan were idolators there is no possible doubt, and in connection
with the magnificent shrines and temples erected by them, and rivalling
or excelling the grand obelisks of Copan, might naturally be sought for,
but in view of the facts it must be concluded that the Maya idols were
very small, and that such as escaped the fatal iconoclasms of the
Spanish ecclesiastics were buried by the natives as the only means of
preventing their desecration."That the people who inhabited the country at the time of the Spanish
conquest had a multiplicity of gods there can be no doubt.The primitive
form of worship, with time and by the effect of invasions from outside,
had disappeared, and been replaced by that of their great men and women,
who were deified and had temples raised to their memory, as we see, for
example, in the case of _Moo_,[TN-4] wife and sister of Chaacmol, whose
shrine was built on the high mound on the north side of the large square
in the city of Izamal.There pilgrims flocked from all parts of the
country to listen to the oracles delivered by the mouth of her priests;
and see the goddess come down from the clouds every day, at mid-day,
under the form of a resplendent macaw, and light the fire that was to
consume the offerings deposited on her altar; even at the time of the
conquest, according to the chroniclers, Chaacmol himself seems to have
become the god of war, that always appeared in the midst of the battle,
fighting on the side of his followers, surrounded with flames.Kukulcan,
"the culture" hero of the Mayas, the winged serpent, worshipped by the
Mexicans as the god Guetzalcoalt,[TN-5] and by the Quiches as Cucumatz,
if not the father himself of Chaacmol, CAN, at least one of his
ancestors.The friends and followers of that prince may have worshipped him after
his death, and the following generations, seeing the representation of
his totems (serpent) covered with feathers, on the walls of his palaces,
and of the sanctuaries built by him to the deity, called him Kukulcan,
the winged serpent: when, in fact, the artists who carved his emblems on
the walls covered them with the cloaks he and all the men in authority
and the high priests wore on ceremonial occasions--feathered
vestments--as we learned from the study of mural paintings.In the temples and palaces of the ancient Mayas I have never seen
anything that I could in truth take for idols.I have seen many symbols,
such as double-headed tigers, corresponding to the double-headed lions
of the Egyptians, emblems of the sun.I have seen the representation of
people kneeling in a peculiar manner, with their right hand resting on
the left shoulder--sign of respect among the Mayas as among the
inhabitants of Egypt--in the act of worshiping the mastodon head; but I
doubt if this can be said to be idol worship._Can_ and his family were
probably monotheists.The masses of the people, however, may have placed
the different natural phenomena under the direct supervision of special
imaginary beings, prescribing to them the same duties that among the
Catholics are prescribed, or rather attributed, to some of the saints;
and may have tributed to them the sort of worship of _dulia_, tributed
to the saints--even made images that they imagined to represent such or
such deity, as they do to-day; but I have never found any.They
worshiped the divine essence, and called it KU.In course of time this worship may have been replaced by idolatrous
rites, introduced by the barbarous or half civilized tribes which
invaded the country, and implanted among the inhabitants their religious
belief, their idolatrous superstitions and form of worship with their
symbols.The monuments of Uxmal afford ample evidence of that fact.My studies, however, have nothing to do with the history of the country
posterior to the invasion of the Nahualts.These people appear to have
destroyed the high form of civilization existing at the time of their
advent; and tampered with the ornaments of the buildings in order to
introduce the symbols of the reciprocal forces of nature.The language of the ancient Mayas, strange as it may appear, has
survived all the vicissitudes of time, wars, and political and religious
convulsions.It has, of course, somewhat degenerated by the mingling of
so many races in such a limited space as the peninsula of Yucatan is;
but it is yet the vernacular of the people.The Spaniards themselves,
who strived so hard to wipe out all vestiges of the ancient customs of
the aborigines, were unable to destroy it; nay, they were obliged to
learn it; and now many of their descendants have forgotten the mother
tongue of their sires, and speak Maya only.In some localities in Central America it is still spoken in its pristine
purity, as, for example, by the _Chaacmules_, a tribe of bearded men, it
is said, who live in the vicinity of the unexplored ruins of the ancient
city of _Tekal_.It is a well-known fact that many tribes, as that of
the Itzaes, retreating before the Nahualt invaders, after the surrender
and destruction of their cities, sought refuge in the islands of the
lake _Peten_ of to-day, and called it _Petenitza_, the _islands of the
Itzaes_; or in the well nigh inaccessible valleys, defended by ranges of
towering mountains.There they live to-day, preserving the customs,
manners, language of their forefathers unaltered, in the tract of land
known to us as _Tierra de Guerra_.No white man has ever penetrated
their zealously guarded stronghold that lays between Guatemala, Tabasco,
Chiapas and Yucatan, the river _Uzumasinta_ watering part of their
territory.The Maya language seems to be one of the oldest tongues spoken by man,
since it contains words and expressions of all, or nearly all, the known
polished languages on earth.The name _Maya_, with the same
signification everywhere it is met, is to be found scattered over the
different countries of what we term the Old World, as in Central
America.I beg to call your attention to the following facts.They may be mere coincidences, the strange freaks of
hazard, of no possible value in the opinion of some among the learned
men of our days.Just as the finding of English words and English
customs, as now exist among the most remote nations and heterogeneous
people and tribes of all races and colors, who do not even suspect the
existence of one another, may be regarded by the learned philologists
and ethonologists[TN-6] of two or three thousand years hence.These
will, perhaps, also pretend that _these coincidences_ are simply the
curious workings of the human mind--the efforts of men endeavoring to
express their thoughts in language, that being reduced to a certain
number of sounds, must, of necessity produce, if not the same, at least
very similar words to express the same idea--and that this similarity
does not prove that those who invented them had, at any time,
communication, unless, maybe, at the time of the building of the
hypothetical Tower of Babel.Then all the inhabitants of earth are said
to have bid each other a friendly good night, a certain evening, in a
universal tongue, to find next morning that everybody had gone stark mad
during the night: since each one, on meeting sixty-nine of his friends,
was greeted by every one in a different and unknown manner, according to
learned rabbins; and that he could no more understand what they said,
than they what he said[TN-7]

It is very difficult without the help of the books of the learned
priests of _Mayab_ to know positively why they gave that name to the
country known to-day as Yucatan.I can only surmise that they so called
it from the great absorbant[TN-8] quality of its stony soil, which, in
an incredibly short time, absorbs the water at the surface.This
percolating through the pores of the stone is afterward found filtered
clear and cool in the senotes and caves._Mayab_, in the Maya language,
means a tammy, a sieve.From the name of the country, no doubt, the
Mayas took their name, as natural; and that name is found, as that of
the English to-day, all over the ancient civilized world.When, on January 28, 1873, I had the honor of reading a paper before the
New York American Geographical Society--on the coincidences that exist
between the monuments, customs, religious rites, etc.of the prehistoric
inhabitants of America and those of Asia and Egypt--I pointed to the
fact that sun circles, dolmen and tumuli, similar to the megalithic
monuments of America, had been found to exist scattered through the
islands of the Pacific to Hindostan; over the plains of the peninsulas
at the south of Asia, through the deserts of Arabia, to the northern
parts of Africa; and that not only these rough monuments of a primitive
age, but those of a far more advanced civilization were also to be seen
in these same countries.Allow me to repeat now what I then said
regarding these strange facts: If we start from the American continent
and travel towards the setting sun we may be able to trace the route
followed by the mound builders to the plains of Asia and the valley of
the Nile.The mounds scattered through the valley of the Mississippi
seem to be the rude specimens of that kind of architecture.Then come
the more highly finished teocalis of Yucatan and Mexico and Peru; the
pyramidal mounds of _Maui_, one of the Sandwich Islands; those existing
in the Fejee and other islands of the Pacific; which, in China, we find
converted into the high, porcelain, gradated towers; and these again
converted into the more imposing temples of Cochin-China, Hindostan,
Ceylon--so grand, so stupendous in their wealth of ornamentation that
those of Chichen-Itza Uxmal, Palenque, admirable as they are, well nigh
dwindle into insignificance, as far as labor and imagination are
concerned, when compared with them.That they present the same
fundamental conception in their architecture is evident--a platform
rising over another platform, the one above being of lesser size than
the one below; the American monuments serving, as it were, as models for
the more elaborate and perfect, showing the advance of art and
knowledge.The name Maya seems to have existed from the remotest times in the
meridional parts of Hindostan.Valmiki, in his epic poem, the Ramayana,
said to be written 1500 before the Christian era, in which he recounts
the wars and prowesses of RAMA in the recovery of his lost wife, the
beautiful SITA, speaking of the country inhabited by the Mayas,
describes it as abounding in mines of silver and gold, with precious
stones and lapiz lazuri:[TN-9] and bounded by the _Vindhya_ mountains on
one side, the _Prastravana_ range on the other and the sea on the third.The emissaries of RAMA having entered by mistake within the Mayas
territories, learned that all foreigners were forbidden to penetrate
into them; and that those who were so imprudent as to violate this
prohibition, even through ignorance, seldom escaped being put to death.(Strange[TN-10] to say, the same thing happens to-day to those who try
to penetrate into the territories of the _Santa Cruz_ Indians, or in the
valleys occupied by the _Lacandones_, _Itzaes_ and other tribes that
inhabit _La Tierra de Guerra_.The Yucatecans themselves do not like
foreigners to go, and less to settle, in their country--are consequently
opposed to immigration.The emissaries of Rama, says the poet, met in the forest a woman who
told them: That in very remote ages a prince of the Davanas, a learned
magician, possessed of great power, whose name was _Maya_, established
himself in the country, and that he was the architect of the principal
of the Davanas: but having fallen in love with the nymph _Hema_, married
her; whereby he roused the jealousy of the god _Pourandura_, who
attacked and killed him with a thunderbolt.Now, it is worthy of notice,
that the word _Hem_ signifies in the Maya language to _cross with
ropes_; or according to Brasseur, _hidden mysteries_.By a most rare coincidence we have the same identical story recorded in
the mural paintings of Chaacmol's funeral chamber, and in the sculptures
of Chichsen[TN-11] and Uxmal.There we find that Chaacmol, the husband
of Moo[TN-12] is killed by his brother Aac, who stabbed him three times
in the back with his spear for jealousy.Aac was in love with his sister
Moo, but she married his brother Chaacmol from choice, and because the
law of the country prescribed that the younger brother should marry his
sister, making it a crime for the older brothers to marry her.In another part of the _Ramayana_, MAYA is described as a powerful
_Asoura_, always thirsting for battles and full of arrogance and
pride--an enemy to B[=a]li, chief of one of the monkey tribes, by whom
he was finally vanquished.H. T.
Colebrooke, in a memoir on the sacred books of the Hindoos, published in
Vol.VIII of the "Asiatic Researches," says: "The _Souryasiddkantu_ (the
most ancient Indian treatise on astronomy), is not considered as written
by MAYA; but this personage is represented as receiving his science from
a partial incarnation of the sun."MAYA is also, according to the Rig-Veda, the goddess, by whom all things
are created by her union with Brahma.She is the cosmic egg, the golden
uterus, the _Hiramyagarbha_.We see an image of it, represented floating
amidst the water, in the sculptures that adorn the panel over the door
of the east facade of the monument, called by me palace and museum at
Chichen-Itza.Emile Burnouf, in his Sanscrit Dictionary, at the word
Maya, says: Maya, an architect of the _Datyas_; Maya (_mas._), magician,
prestidigitator; (_fem._) illusion, prestige; Maya, the magic virtue of
the gods, their power for producing all things; also the feminine or
producing energy of Brahma.I will complete the list of these remarkable coincidences with a few
others regarding customs exactly similar in both countries.One of these
consists in carrying children astride on the hip in Yucatan as in India.In Yucatan this custom is accompanied by a very interesting ceremony
called _hetzmec_.It is as follows: When a child reaches the age of four
months an invitation is sent to the friends and members of the family of
the parents to assemble at their house.Then in presence of all
assembled the legs of the child are opened, and he is placed astride
the hip of the _nailah_ or _hetzmec_ godmother; she in turn encircling
the little one with her arm, supports him in that position whilst she
walks five times round the house.During the time she is occupied in
that walk five eggs are placed in hot ashes, so that they may burst and
the five senses of the child be opened.By the manner in which they
burst and the time they require for bursting, they pretend to know if he
will be intelligent or not.During the ceremony they place in his tiny
hands the implement pertaining to the industry he is expected to
practice.The _nailah_ is henceforth considered as a second mother to
the child; who, when able to understand, is made to respect her: and she
is expected, in case of the mother's death, to adopt and take care of
the child as if he were her own.Now, I will call your attention to another strange and most remarkable
custom that was common to the inhabitants of _Mayab_, some tribes of the
aborigines of North America, and several of those that dwell in
Hindostan, and practice it even to-day.I refer to the printing of the
human hand, dipped in a red  liquid, on the walls of certain
sacred edifices.Could not this custom, existing amongst nations so far
apart, unknown to each other, and for apparently the same purposes, be
considered as a link in the chain of evidence tending to prove that very
intimate relations and communications have existed anciently between
their ancestors?Might it not help the ethnologists to follow the
migrations of the human race from this western continent to the eastern
and southern shores of Asia, across the wastes of the Pacific Ocean?I
am told by unimpeachable witnesses that they have seen the red or bloody
hand in more than one of the temples of the South Sea islanders; and his
Excellency Fred.P. Barlee, Esq., the actual governor of British
Honduras, has assured me that he has examined this seemingly indelible
imprint of the red hand on some rocks in caves in Australia.There is
scarcely a monument in Yucatan that does not preserve the imprint of
the open upraised hand, dipped in red paint of some sort, perfectly
visible on its walls.I lately took tracings of two of these imprints
that exist in the back saloon of the main hall, in the governor's house
at Uxmal, in order to calculate the height of the personage who thus
attested to those of his race, as I learned from one of my Indian
friends, who passes for a wizard, that the building was _in naa_, my
house.I may well say that the archway of the palace of the priests,
toward the court, was nearly covered with them.Yet I am not aware that
such symbol was ever used by the inhabitants of the countries bordering
on the shores of the Mediterranean or by the Assyrians, or that it ever
was discovered among the ruined temples or palaces of Egypt.The meaning of the red hand used by the aborigines of some parts of
America has been, it is well known, a subject of discussion for learned
men and scientific societies.Its uses as a symbol remained for a long
time a matter of conjecture.Schoolcraft had truly
arrived at the knowledge of its veritable meaning.Effectively, in the
2d column of the 5th page of the _New York Herald_ for April 12, 1879,
in the account of the visit paid by Gen.Grant to Ram Singh, Maharajah
of Jeypoor, we read the description of an excursion to the town of
Amber.Speaking of the journey to the _home of an Indian king_, among
other things the writer says:--"We passed small temples, some of them
ruined, some others with offerings of grains, or fruits, or flowers,
some with priests and people at worship.On the walls of some of the
temples we saw the marks of the human hand as though it had been steeped
in blood and pressed against the white wall.We were told that it was
the custom, when seeking from the gods some benison to note the vow by
putting the hand into a liquid and printing it on the wall.This was to
remind the gods of the vow and prayer.And if it came to pass in the
shape of rain, or food, or health, or children, the joyous devotee
returned to the temple and made other offerings."In Yucatan it seems to
have had the same meaning.That is to say: that the owners of the house
if private, or the priests, in the temples and public buildings, called
upon the edifices at the time of taking possession and using them for
the first time, the blessing of the Deity; and placed the hand's
imprints on the walls to recall the vows and prayer: and also, as the
interpretation communicated to me by the Indians seems to suggest, as a
signet or mark of property--_in naa_, my house.I need not speak of the similarity of many religious rites and beliefs
existing in Hindostan and among the inhabitants of _Mayab_.The worship
of the fire, of the phallus, of Deity under the symbol of the mastodon's
head, recalling that of Ganeza, the god with an elephant's head, hence
that of the elephant in Siam, Birmah[TN-13] and other places of the
Asiatic peninsula even in our day; and various other coincidences so
numerous and remarkable that many would not regard them as simple
coincidences.What to think, effectively, of the types of the personages
whose portraits are carved on the obelisks of Copan?Were they in Siam
instead of Honduras, who would doubt but they are Siameeses.[TN-14] What
to say of the figures of men and women sculptured on the walls of the
stupendous temples hewn, from the live rock, at Elephanta, so American
is their appearance and features?Who would not take them to be pure
aborigines if they were seen in Yucatan instead of Madras, Elephanta and
other places of India.If now we abandon that country and, crossing the Himalaya's range enter
Afghanistan, there again we find ourselves in a country inhabited by
Maya tribes; whose names, as those of many of their cities, are of pure
American-Maya origin.In the fourth column of the sixth page of the
London _Times_, weekly edition, of March 4, 1879, we read: "4,000 or
5,000 assembled on the opposite bank of the river _Kabul_, and it
appears that in that day or evening they attacked the Maya villages
situated on the north side of the river."He, the correspondent of the _Times_, tells us that Maya tribes form
still part of the population of Afghanistan.He also tells us that
_Kabul_ is the name of the river, on the banks of which their villages
are situated.But _Kabul_ is the name of an antique shrine in the city
of Izamal.of his History of
Yucatan, says: "They had another temple on another mound, on the west
side of the square, also dedicated to the same idol.They had there the
symbol of a hand, as souvenir.To that temple they carried their dead
and the sick.They called it _Kabul_, the working hand, and made there
great offerings."Father Lizana says the same: so we have two witnesses
to the fact._Kab_, in Maya means hand; and _Bul_ is to play at hazard.Many of the names of places and towns of Afghanistan have not only a
meaning in the American-Maya language, but are actually the same as
those of places and villages in Yucatan to-day, for example:

The Valley of _Chenar_ would be the valley of the _well of the woman's
children_--_chen_, well, and _al_, the woman's children.The fertile
valley of _Kunar_ would be the valley of the _god of the ears of corn_;
or, more probably, the _nest of the ears of corn_: as KU, pronounced
short, means _God_, and _Kuu_, pronounced long, is nest.NAL, is the
_ears of corn_.The correspondent of the London _Times_, in his letters, mentions the
names of some of the principal tribes, such as the _Kuki-Khel_, the
_Akakhel_, the _Khambhur Khel_, etc.The suffix Khel simply signifies
tribe, or clan.So similar to the Maya vocable _Kaan_, a tie, a rope;
hence a clan: a number of people held together by the tie of parentage.Now, Kuki would be Kukil, or Kukum maya[TN-15] for feather, hence the
KUKI-KHEL would be the tribe of the feather.AKA-KHEL in the same manner would be the tribe of the reservoir, or
pond.AKAL is the Maya name for the artificial reservoirs, or ponds in
which the ancient inhabitants of Mayab collected rain water for the time
of drought.Similarly the KHAMBHUR KHEL is the tribe of the _pleasant_: _Kambul_ in
Maya.It is the name of several villages of Yucatan, as you may satisfy
yourself by examining the map.We have also the ZAKA-KHEL, the tribe of the locust, ZAK.It is useless
to quote more for the present: enough to say that if you read the names
of the cities, valleys[TN-16] clans, roads even of Afghanistan to any of
the aborigines of Yucatan, they will immediately give you their meaning
in their own language.Before leaving the country of the Afghans, by the
KHIBER Pass--that is to say, the _road of the hawk_; HI, _hawk_, and
BEL, road--allow me to inform you that in examining their types, as
published in the London illustrated papers, and in _Harper's Weekly_, I
easily recognized the same cast of features as those of the bearded men,
whose portraits we discovered in the bas-reliefs which adorn the antae
and pillars of the castle, and queen's box in the Tennis Court at
Chichen-Itza.On our way to the coast of Asia Minor, and hence to Egypt, we may, in
following the Mayas' footsteps, notice that a tribe of them, the learned
MAGI, with their Rabmag at their head, established themselves in
Babylon, where they became, indeed, a powerful and influential body.Their chief they called _Rab-mag_--or LAB-MAC--the old person--LAB,
_old_--MAC, person; and their name Magi, meant learned men, magicians,
as that of Maya in India.I will directly speak more at length of
vestiges of the Mayas in Babylon, when explaining by means of the
_American Maya_, the meaning and probable etymology of the names of the
Chaldaic divinities.At present I am trying to follow the footprints of
the Mayas.On the coast of Asia Minor we find a people of a roving and piratical
disposition, whose name was, from the remotest antiquity and for many
centuries, the terror of the populations dwelling on the shores of the
Mediterranean; whose origin was, and is yet unknown; who must have
spoken Maya, or some Maya dialect, since we find words of that
language, and with the same meaning inserted in that of the Greeks, who,
Herodotus tells us, used to laugh at the manner the _Carians_, or
_Caras_, or _Caribs_, spoke their tongue; whose women wore a white linen
dress that required no fastening, just as the Indian and Mestiza women
of Yucatan even to-day[TN-17]

To tell you that the name of the CARAS is found over a vast extension of
country in America, would be to repeat what the late and lamented
Brasseur de Bourbourg has shown in his most learned introduction to the
work of Landa, "Relacion de las cosas de Yucatan;" but this I may say,
that the description of the customs and mode of life of the people of
Yucatan, even at the time of the conquest, as written by Landa, seems to
be a mere verbatim plagiarism of the description of the customs and mode
of life of the Carians of Asia Minor by Herodotus.If identical customs and manners, and the worship of the same divinities
under the same name, besides the traditions of a people pointing towards
a certain point of the globe as being the birth-place of their
ancestors, prove anything, then I must say that in Egypt also we meet
with the tracks of the Mayas, of whose name we again have a reminiscence
in that of the goddess Maia, the daughter of Atlantis, worshiped in
Greece.Here, at this end of the voyage, we seem to find an intimation
as to the place where the Mayas originated.We are told that Maya is
born from Atlantis; in other words, that the Mayas came from beyond the
Atlantic waters.Here, also, we find that Maia is called the mother of
the gods _Kubeles_._Ku_, Maya _God_, _Bel_ the road, the way.Ku-bel,
the road, the origin of the gods as among the Hindostanees.These, we
have seen in the Rig Veda, called Maya, the feminine energy--the
productive virtue of Brahma.I do not pretend to present here anything but facts, resulting from my
study of the ancient monuments of Yucatan, and a comparative study of
the Maya language, in which the ancient inscriptions, I have been able
to decipher, are written.Let us see if those _facts_ are sustained by
others of a different character.I will make a brief parallel between the architectural monuments of the
primitive Chaldeans, their mode of writing, their burial places, and
give you the etymology of the names of their divinities in the American
Maya language.The origin of the primitive Chaldees is yet an unsettled matter among
learned men.All agree,
however, that they were strangers to the lower Mesopotamian valleys,
where they settled in very remote ages, their capital being, in the time
of Abraham, as we learn from Scriptures, _Ur_ or _Hur_.So named either
because its inhabitants were worshipers of the moon, or from the moon
itself--U in the Maya language--or perhaps also because the founders
being strangers and guests, as it were, in the country, it was called
the city of guests, HULA (Maya), _guest just arrived_.Recent researches in the plains of lower Mesopotamia have revealed to us
their mode of building their sacred edifices, which is precisely
identical to that of the Mayas.It consisted of mounds composed of superposed platforms, either square
or oblong, forming cones or pyramids, their angles at times, their faces
at others, facing exactly the cardinal points.Their manner of construction was also the same, with the exception of
the materials employed--each people using those most at hand in their
respective countries--clay and bricks in Chaldea, stones in Yucatan.The
filling in of the buildings being of inferior materials, crude or
sun-dried bricks at Warka and Mugheir; of unhewn stones of all shapes
and sizes, in Uxmal and Chichen, faced with walls of hewn stones, many
feet in thickness throughout.Grand exterior staircases lead to the
summit, where was the shrine of the god, and temple.In Yucatan these mounds are generally composed of seven superposed
platforms, the one above being smaller than that immediately below; the
temple or sanctuary containing invariably two chambers, the inner one,
the Sanctum Sanctorum, being the smallest.In Babylon, the supposed tower of Babel--the _Birs-i-nimrud_--the temple
of the seven lights, was made of seven stages or platforms.The roofs of these buildings in both countries were flat; the walls of
vast thickness; the chambers long and narrow, with outer doors opening
into them directly; the rooms ordinarily let into one another: squared
recesses were common in the rooms.Loftus is of opinion that the
chambers of the Chaldean buildings were usually arched with bricks, in
which opinion Mr.We know that the ceilings of the
chambers in all the monuments of Yucatan, without exception, form
triangular arches.To describe their construction I will quote from the
description by Herodotus, of some ceilings in Egyptian buildings and
Scythian tombs, that resemble that of the brick vaults found at Mugheir."The side walls <DW72> outward as they ascend, the arch is formed by each
successive layer of brick from the point where the arch begins, a little
overlapping the last, till the two sides of the roof are brought so near
together, that the aperture may be closed by a single brick."Some of the sepulchers found in Yucatan are very similar to the jar
tombs common at Mugheir.These consist of two large open-mouthed jars,
united with bitumen after the body has been deposited in them, with the
usual accompaniments of dishes, vases and ornaments, having an air hole
bored at one extremity.Those found at Progreso were stone urns about
three feet square, cemented in pairs, mouth to mouth, and having also an
air hole bored in the bottom.Extensive mounds, made artificially of a
vast number of coffins, arranged side by side, divided by thin walls of
masonry crossing each other at right angles, to separate the coffins,
have been found in the lower plains of Chaldea--such as exist along the
coast of Peru, and in Yucatan.At Izamal many human remains, contained
in urns, have been found in the mounds."The ordinary dress of the common people among the Chaldeans," says
Canon Rawlison, in his work, the Five Great Monarchies, "seems to have
consisted of a single garment, a short tunic tied round the waist, and
reaching thence to the knees.To this may sometimes have been added an
_abba_, or cloak, thrown over the shoulders; the material of the former
we may perhaps presume to have been linen."The mural paintings at
Chichen show that the Mayas sometimes used the same costume; and that
dress is used to-day by the aborigines of Yucatan, and the inhabitants
of the _Tierra de Guerra_.They were also bare-footed, and wore on the
head a band of cloth, highly ornamented with mother-of-pearl instead of
camel's hair, as the Chaldee.This band is to be seen in bas-relief at
Chichen-Itza, inthe[TN-18] mural paintings, and on the head of the statue
of Chaacmol.The higher classes wore a long robe extending from the neck
to the feet, sometimes adorned with a fringe; it appears not to have
been fastened to the waist, but kept in place by passing over one
shoulder, a slit or hole being made for the arm on one side of the dress
only.In some cases the upper part of the dress seems to have been
detached from the lower, and to form a sort of jacket which reached
about to the hips.We again see this identical dress portrayed in the
mural paintings.The same description of ornaments were affected by the
Chaldees and the Mayas--bracelets, earrings, armlets, anklets, made of
the materials they could procure.The Mayas at times, as can be seen from the slab discovered by
Bresseur[TN-19] in Mayapan (an exact fac-simile of which cast, from a
mould made by myself, is now in the rooms of the American Antiquarian
Society at Worcester, Mass.), as the primitive Chaldee, in their
writings, made use of characters composed of straight lines only,
inclosed in square or oblong figures; as we see from the inscriptions in
what has been called hieratic form of writing found at Warka and
Mugheir and the slab from Mayapan and others.The Chaldees are said to have made use of three kinds of characters that
Canon Rawlinson calls _letters proper_, _monograms_ and _determinative_.The Maya also, as we see from the monumental inscriptions, employed
three kinds of characters--_letters proper_, _monograms_ and
_pictorial_.It may be said of the religion of the Mayas, as I have had occasion to
remark, what the learned author of the Five Great Monarchies says of
that of the primitive Chaldees: "The religion of the Chaldeans, from the
very earliest times to which the monuments carry us back, was, in its
outward aspect, a polytheism of a very elaborate character.It is quite
possible that there may have been esoteric explanations, known to the
priests and the more learned; which, resolving the personages of the
Pantheon into the powers of nature, reconcile the apparent multiplicity
of Gods with monotheism."I will now consider the names of the Chaldean
deities in their turn of rotation as given us by the author above
mentioned, and show you that the language of the American Mayas gives us
an etymology of the whole of them, quite in accordance with their
particular attributes.The learned author places '_Ra_' at the head of the Pantheon, stating
that the meaning of the word is simply _God_, or the God emphatically.We know that _Ra_ was the Sun among the Egyptians, and that the
hieroglyph, a circle, representation of that God was the same in Babylon
as in Egypt.It formed an element in the native name of Babylon.Now the Mayas called LA, that which has existed for ever, the truth _par
excellence_.As to the native name of Babylon it would simply be the
_city of the infinite truth_--_cah_, city; LA, eternal truth.Ana, like Ra, is thought to have signified _God_ in the highest sense.His epithets mark priority and
antiquity; _the original chief_, the _father of the gods_, the _lord of
darkness or death_.The Maya gives us A, _thy_; NA, _mother_.At times
he was called DIS, and was the patron god of _Erech_, the great city of
the dead, the necropolis of Lower Babylonia.TIX, Maya is a cavity
formed in the earth.It seems to have given its name to the city of
_Niffer_, called _Calneh_ in the translation of the Septuagint, from
_kal-ana_, which is translated the "fort of Ana;" or according to the
Maya, the _prison of Ana_, KAL being prison, or the prison of thy
mother.ANATA

the supposed wife of Ana, has no peculiar characteristics.Her name is
only, says our author, the feminine form of the masculine, Ana.But the
Maya designates her as the companion of Ana; TA, with; _Anata_ with
_Ana_.BIL OR ENU

seems to mean merely Lord.It is usually followed by a qualificative
adjunct, possessing great interest, NIPRU.To that name, which recalls
that of NEBROTH or _Nimrod_, the author gives a Syriac etymology; napar
(make to flee).His epithets are the _supreme_, _the father of the
gods_, the _procreator_.The Maya gives us BIL, or _Bel_; the way, the road; hence the _origin_,
the father, the procreator.Also ENA, who is before; again the father,
the procreator.As to the qualificative adjunct _nipru_.It would seem to be the Maya
_niblu_; _nib_, to thank; LU, the _Bagre_, a _silurus fish_._Niblu_
would then be the _thanksgiving fish_.Strange to say, the high priest
at Uxmal and Chichen, elder brother of Chaacmol, first son of _Can_, the
founder of those cities, is CAY, the fish, whose effigy is my last
discovery in June, among the ruins of Uxmal.The bust is contained
within the jaws of a serpent, _Can_, and over it, is a beautiful
mastodon head, with the trunk inscribed with Egyptian characters, which
read TZAA, that which is necessary.BELTIS

is the wife of _Bel-nipru_.But she is more than his mere female power.Her common title is the _Great
Goddess_.In Chaldea her name was _Mulita_ or _Enuta_, both words
signifying the lady.Her favorite title was the _mother of the gods_,
the origin of the gods.In Maya BEL is the road, the way; and TE means _here_.BELTE or BELTIS
would be I am the way, the origin._Mulita_ would correspond to MUL-TE, many here, _many in me_.Her other name _Enuta_ seems to be (Maya) _Ena-te_,
signifies ENA, the first, before anybody, and TE here.ENATE, _I am here
before anybody_, I am the mother of the Gods.The God Fish, the mystic animal, half man, half fish, which came up from
the Persian gulf to teach astronomy and letters to the first settlers on
the Euphrates and Tigris.According to Berosus the civilization was brought to Mesopotamia by
_Oannes_ and six other beings, who, like himself, were half man, half
fish, and that they came from the Indian Ocean.We have already seen
that the Mayas of India were not only architects, but also astronomers;
and the symbolic figure of a being half man and half fish seems to
clearly indicate that those who brought civilization to the shores of
the Euphrates and Tigris came in boats.Hoa-Ana, or Oannes, according to the Maya would mean, he who has his
residence or house on the water.HA, being water; _a_, thy; _na_, house;
literally, _water thy house_.Canon Rawlison remarks in that
connection: "There are very strong grounds for connecting HEA or Hoa,
with the serpent of the Scripture, and the paradisaical traditions of
the tree of knowledge and the tree of life."As the title of the god of
knowledge and science, _Oannes_, is the lord of the abyss, or of the
great deep, the intelligent fish, one of his emblems being the serpent,
CAN, which occupies so conspicuous a place among the symbols of the gods
on the black stones recording benefactions.DAV-KINA

Is the wife of _Hoa_, and her name is thought to signify the chief lady.But the Maya again gives us another meaning that seems to me more
appropriate.TAB-KIN would be the _rays of the sun_: the rays of the
light brought with civilization by her husband to benighted inhabitants
of Mesopotamia.SIN OR HURKI

is the name of the moon deity; the etymology of it is quite uncertain.Its titles, as Rawlison remarks, are somewhat vague.Yet it is
particularly designated as "_the bright_, _the shining_" the lord of the
month.Zin in Maya has also many significations._Zinil_ is the extension of the whole of the universe._Hurki_ would be
the Maya HULKIN--sun-stroked; he who receives directly the rays of the
sun.Hurki is also the god presiding over buildings and architecture; in
this connection he is called _Bel-Zuna_.The _lord of building_, the
_supporting architect_, the _strengthener of fortifications_._Bel-Zuna_
would also signify the lord of the strong house._Zuu_, Maya, close,
thick._Na_, house: and the city where he had his great temple was _Ur_;
named after him._U_, in Maya, signifies moon.SAN OR SANSI,

the Sun God, the _lord of fire_, the _ruler of the day_.He _who
illumines the expanse of heaven and earth_._Zamal_ (Maya) is the morning, the dawn of the day, and his symbols are
the same on the temples of Yucatan as on those of Chaldea, India and
Egypt.VUL OR IVA,

the prince of the powers of the air, the lord of the whirlwind and the
tempest, the wielder of the thunderbolt, the lord of the air, he who
makes the tempest to rage.Hiba in Maya is to rub, to scour, to chafe as
does the tempest.As VUL he is represented with a flaming sword in his
hand._Hul_ (Maya) an arrow.He is then the god of the atmosphere, who
gives rain.ISHTAR OR NANA,

the Chaldean Venus, of the etymology of whose name no satisfactory
account can be given, says the learned author, whose list I am following
and description quoting.The Maya language, however, affords a very natural etymology.Her name
seems composed of _ix_, the feminine article, _she_; and of _tac_, or
_tal_, a verb that signifies to have a desire to satisfy a corporal want
or inclination.IXTAL would, therefore, be she who desires to satisfy a
corporal inclination.As to her other name, _Nana_, it simply means the
great mother, the very mother.If from the names of god and goddesses,
we pass to that of places, we will find that the Maya language also
furnishes a perfect etymology for them.In the account of the creation of the world, according to the Chaldeans,
we find that a woman whose name in Chaldee is _Thalatth_, was said to
have ruled over the monstrous animals of strange forms, that were
generated and existed in darkness and water.The Greek called her
_Thalassa_ (the sea).But the Maya vocable _Thallac_, signifies a thing
without steadiness, like the sea.The first king of the Chaldees was a great architect.To him are
ascribed the most archaic monuments of the plains of Lower Mesopotamia.He is said to have conceived the plans of the Babylonian Temple.He
constructed his edifices of mud and bricks, with rectangular bases,
their angles fronting the cardinal points; receding stages, exterior
staircases, with shrines crowning the whole structure.In this
description of the primitive constructions of the Chaldeans, no one can
fail to recognize the Maya mode of building, and we see them not only in
Yucatan, but throughout Central America, Peru, even Hindoostan.The very
name _Urkuh_ seems composed of two Maya words HUK, to make everything,
and LUK, mud; he who makes everything of mud; so significative of his
building propensities and of the materials used by him.The etymology of the name of that country, as well as that of Asshur,
the supreme god of the Assyrians, who never pronounced his name without
adding "Asshur is my lord," is still an undecided matter amongst the
learned philologists of our days.Some contend that the country was
named after the god Asshur; others that the god Asshur received his name
from the place where he was worshiped.None agree, however, as to the
significative meaning of the name Asshur.In Assyrian and Hebrew
languages the name of the country and people is derived from that of the
god.That Asshur was the name of the deity, and that the country was
named after it, I have no doubt, since I find its etymology, so much
sought for by philologists, in the American Maya language.Effectively
the word _asshur_, sometimes written _ashur_, would be AXUL in Maya._A_, in that language, placed before a noun, is the possessive pronoun,
as the second person, thy or thine, and _xul_, means end, termination.It is also the name of the sixth month of the Maya calendar._Axul_
would therefore be _thy end_.Among all the nations which have
recognized the existence of a SUPREME BEING, Deity has been considered
as the beginning and end of all things, to which all aspire to be
united.A strange coincidence that may be without significance, but is not out
of place to mention here, is the fact that the early kings of Chaldea
are represented on the monuments as sovereigns over the _Kiprat-arbat_,
or FOUR RACES.While tradition tells us that the great lord of the
universe, king of the giants, whose capital was _Tiahuanaco_, the
magnificent ruins of which are still to be seen on the shores of the
lake of Titicaca, reigned over _Ttahuatyn-suyu_, the FOUR PROVINCES.In
the _Chou-King_ we read that in very remote times _China_ was called by
its inhabitants _Sse-yo_, THE FOUR PARTS OF THE EMPIRE.The
_Manava-Dharma-Sastra_, the _Ramayana_, and other sacred books of
Hindostan also inform us that the ancient Hindoos designated their
country as the FOUR MOUNTAINS, and from some of the monumental
inscriptions at Uxmal it would seem that, among other names, that place
was called the land of the _canchi_, or FOUR MOUTHS, that recalls
vividly the name of Chaldea _Arba-Lisun_, the FOUR TONGUES.That the language of the Mayas was known in Chaldea in remote ages, but
became lost in the course of time, is evident from the Book of Daniel.It seems that some of the learned men of Judea understood it still at
the beginning of the Christian era, as many to-day understand Greek,
Latin, Sanscrit, &c.; since, we are informed by the writers of the
Gospels of St.Mark, that the last words of Jesus of
Nazareth expiring on the cross were uttered in it.In the fifth chapter of the Book of Daniel, we read that the fingers of
the hand of a man were seen writing on the wall of the hall, where King
Belshazzar was banqueting, the words "Mene, mene, Tekel, upharsin,"
which could not be read by any of the wise men summoned by order of the
king.Daniel, however, being brought in, is said to have given as their
interpretation: _Numbered_, _numbered_, _weighed_, _dividing_, perhaps
with the help of the angel Gabriel, who is said by learned rabbins to be
the only individual of the angelic hosts who can speak Chaldean and
Syriac, and had once before assisted him in interpreting the dream of
King Nebuchadnezzar.Perhaps also, having been taught the learning of
the Chaldeans, he had studied the ancient Chaldee language, and was thus
enabled to read the fatidical words, which have the very same meaning in
the Maya language as he gave them.Effectively, _mene_ or _mane_,
_numbered_, would seem to correspond to the Maya verbs, MAN, to buy, to
purchase, hence to number, things being sold by the quantity--or MANEL,
to pass, to exceed._Tekel_, weighed, would correspond to TEC, light.To-day it is used in the sense of lightness in motion, brevity,
nimbleness: and _Upharsin_, dividing, seem allied to the words PPA, to
divide two things united; or _uppah_, to break, making a sharp sound; or
_paah_, to break edifices; or, again, PAALTAL, to break, to scatter the
inhabitants of a place.As to the last words of Jesus of Nazareth, when expiring on the cross,
as reported by the Evangelists, _Eli, Eli_, according to St.Matthew,
and _Eloi, Eloi_, according to St.Mark, _lama sabachthani_, they are
pure Maya vocables; but have a very different meaning to that attributed
to them, and more in accordance with His character.By placing in the
mouth of the dying martyr these words: _My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me?_ they have done him an injustice, presenting him in his
last moments despairing and cowardly, traits so foreign to his life, to
his teachings, to the resignation shown by him during his trial, and to
the fortitude displayed by him in his last journey to Calvary; more than
all, so unbecoming, not to say absurd, being in glaring contradiction to
his role as God.If God himself, why complain that God has forsaken him?He evidently did not speak Hebrew in dying, since his two mentioned
biographers inform us that the people around him did not understand what
he said, and supposed he was calling Elias to help him: _This man
calleth for Elias._

His bosom friend, who never abandoned him--who stood to the last at the
foot of the cross, with his mother and other friends and relatives, do
not report such unbefitting words as having been uttered by Jesus.He
simply says, that after recommending his mother to his care, he
complained of being thirsty, and that, as the sponge saturated with
vinegar was applied to his mouth, he merely said: IT IS FINISHED!and
_he bowed his head and gave up the ghost_.Well, this is exactly the meaning of the Maya words, HELO, HELO, LAMAH
ZABAC TA NI, literally: HELO, HELO, now, now; LAMAH, sinking; ZABAC,
black ink; TA, over; NI, nose; in our language: _Now, now I am sinking;
darkness covers my face!_ No weakness, no despair--He merely tells his
friends all is over.Before leaving Asia Minor, in order to seek in Egypt the vestiges of the
Mayas, I will mention the fact that the names of some of the natives who
inhabited of old that part of the Asiatic continent, and many of those
of places and cities seem to be of American Maya origin.The Promised
Land, for example--that part of the coast of Phoenicia so famous for
the fertility of its soil, where the Hebrews, after journeying during
forty years in the desert, arrived at last, tired and exhausted from so
many hard-fought battles--was known as _Canaan_.This is a Maya word
that means to be tired, to be fatigued; and, if it is spelled _Kanaan_,
it then signifies abundance; both significations applying well to the
country.TYRE, the great emporium of the Phoenicians, called _Tzur_, probably
on account of being built on a rock, may also derive its name from the
Maya TZUC, a promontory, or a number of villages, _Tzucub_ being a
province.Again, we have the people called _Khati_ by the Egyptians.They formed a
great nation that inhabited the _Caele-Syria_ and the valley of the
Orontes, where they have left very interesting proofs of their passage
on earth, in large and populous cities whose ruins have been lately
discovered.Their origin is unknown, and is yet a problem to be solved.They are celebrated on account of their wars against the Assyrians and
Egyptians, who call them the plague of Khati.Their name is frequently
mentioned in the Scriptures as Hittites.Placed on the road, between the
Assyrians and the Egyptians, by whom they were at last vanquished, they
placed well nigh insuperable _obstacles in the way_ of the conquests of
these two powerful nations, which found in them tenacious and fearful
adversaries.The Khati had not only made considerable improvements in
all military arts, but were also great and famed merchants; their
emporium _Carchemish_ had no less importance than Tyre or Carthage.There, met merchants from all parts of the world; who brought thither
the products and manufactures of their respective countries, and were
wont to worship at the Sacred City, _Katish_ of the Khati.The etymology
of their name is also unknown.Some historians having pretended that
they were a Scythian tribe, derived it from Scythia; but I think that we
may find it very natural, as that of their principal cities, in the Maya
language.All admit that the Khati, until the time when they were vanquished by
Rameses the Great, as recorded on the walls of his palace at Thebes, the
_Memnonium_, always placed obstacles on the way of the Egyptians and
opposed them.According to the Maya, their name is significative of
these facts, since KAT or KATAH is a verb that means to place
impediments on the road, to come forth and obstruct the passage._Carchemish_ was their great emporium, where merchants from afar
congregated; it was consequently a city of merchants.CAH means a city,
and _Chemul_ is navigator._Carchemish_ would then be _cah-chemul_, the
city of navigators, of merchants.KATISH, their sacred city, would be the city where sacrifices are
offered.CAH, city, and TICH, a ceremony practiced by the ancient Mayas,
and still performed by their descendants all through Central America.This sacrifice or ceremony consists in presenting to BALAM, the
_Yumil-Kaax_, the "Lord of the fields," the _primitiae_ of all their
fruits before beginning the harvest.Katish, or _cah-tich_ would then be
the city of the sacrifices--the holy city.EGYPT is the country that in historical times has called, more than any
other, the attention of the students, of all nations and in all ages, on
account of the grandeur and beauty of its monuments; the peculiarity of
its inhabitants; their advanced civilization, their great attainments in
all branches of human knowledge and industry; and its important position
at the head of all other nations of antiquity.Egypt has been said to be
the source from which human knowledge began to flow over the old world:
yet no one knows for a certainty whence came the people that laid the
first foundations of that interesting nation.That they were not
autochthones is certain.Their learned priests pointed towards the
regions of the West as the birth-place of their ancestors, and
designated the country in which they lived, the East, as the _pure
land_, the _land of the sun_, of _light_, in contradistinction of the
country of the dead, of darkness--the Amenti, the West--where Osiris sat
as King, reigning judge, over the souls.If in Hindostan, Afghanistan, Chaldea, Asia Minor, we have met with
vestiges of the Mayas, in Egypt we will find their traces everywhere.Whatever may have been the name given to the valley watered by the Nile
by its primitive inhabitants, no one at present knows.The invaders that
came from the West called it CHEM: not on account of the black color of
the soil, as Plutarch pretends in his work, "_De Iside et Osiride_," but
more likely because either they came to it in boats; or, quite probably,
because when they arrived the country was inundated, and the inhabitants
communicated by means of boats, causing the new comers to call it the
country of boats--CHEM (maya).[TN-20] The hieroglyph representing the
name of Egypt is composed of the character used for land, a cross
circumscribed by a circle, and of another, read K, which represent a
sieve, it is said, but that may likewise be the picture of a small boat.The Assyrians designated Egypt under the names of MISIR or MISUR,
probably because the country is generally destitute of trees.These are
uprooted during the inundations, and then carried by the currents all
over the country; so that the farmers, in order to be able to plow the
soil, are obliged to clear it first from the dead trees.Now we have the
Maya verb MIZ--to _clean_, to _remove rubbish formed by the body of dead
trees_; whilst the verb MUSUR means to _cut the trees by the roots_.It
would seem that the name _Mizraim_ given to Egypt in the Scriptures also
might come from these words.When the Western invaders reached the country it was probably covered by
the waters of the river, to which, we are told, they gave the name of
_Hapimu_.Its etymology seems to be yet undecided by the Egyptologists,
who agree, however, that its meaning is the _abyss of water_.The Maya
tells us that this name is composed of two words--HA, water, and PIMIL,
the thickness of flat things._Hapimu_, or HAPIMIL, would then be the
thickness, the _abyss of water_.We find that the prophets _Jeremiah_ (xlvi., 25,) and _Nahum_ (iii., 8,
10,) call THEBES, the capital of upper Egypt during the XVIII.dynasty:
NO or NA-AMUN, the mansion of Amun._Na_ signifies in Maya, house,
mansion, residence.But _Thebes_ is written in Egyptian hieroglyphs AP,
or APE, the meaning of which is the head, the capital; with the feminine
article T, that is always used as its prefix in hieroglyphic writings,
it becomes TAPE; which, according to Sir Gardner Wilkinson ("Manners and
Customs of the Ancient Egyptians," _tom._ III., page 210, N. Y. Edition,
1878), was pronounced by the Egyptians _Taba_; and in the Menphitic
dialect Thaba, that the Greeks converted into Thebai, whence Thebes.The
Maya verb _Teppal_, signifies to reign, to govern, to order.On each
side of the mastodons' heads, which form so prominent a feature in the
ornaments of the oldest edifices at Uxmal, Chichen-Itza and other parts,
the word _Dapas_; hence TABAS is written in ancient Egyptian characters,
and read, I presume, in old Maya, _head_.To-day the word is pronounced
THAB, and means _baldness_.The identity of the names of deities worshiped by individuals, of their
religious rites and belief; that of the names of the places which they
inhabit; the similarity of their customs, of their dresses and manners;
the sameness of their scientific attainments and of the characters used
by them in expressing their language in writing, lead us naturally to
infer that they have had a common origin, or, at least, that their
forefathers were intimately connected.If we may apply this inference to
nations likewise, regardless of the distance that to-day separates the
countries where they live, I can then affirm that the Mayas and the
Egyptians are either of a common descent, or that very intimate
communication must have existed in remote ages between their ancestors.Without entering here into a full detail of the customs and manners of
these people, I will make a rapid comparison between their religious
belief, their customs, manners, scientific attainments, and the
characters used by them in writing etc., sufficient to satisfy any
reasonable body that the strange coincidences that follow, cannot be
altogether accidental.The SUN, RA, was the supreme god worshiped throughout the land of Egypt;
and its emblem was a disk or circle, at times surmounted by the serpent
Uraeus.Egypt was frequently called the Land of the Sun.RA or LA
signifies in Maya that which exists, emphatically that which is--the
truth.The sun was worshiped by the ancient Mayas; and the Indians to-day
preserve the dance used by their forefathers among the rites of the
adoration of that luminary, and perform it yet in certain epoch[TN-21]
of the year.The coat-of-arms of the city of Uxmal, sculptured on the
west facade of the sanctuary, attached to the masonic temple in that
city, teaches us that the place was called U LUUMIL KIN, _the land of
the sun_.This name forming the center of the escutcheon, is written
with a cross, circumscribed by a circle, that among the Egyptians is
the sign for land, region, surrounded by the rays of the sun.Colors in Egypt, as in Mayab, seem to have had the same symbolical
meaning.The figure of _Amun_ was that of a man whose body was light
blue, like the Indian god Wishnu,[TN-22] and that of the god Nilus; as if
to indicate their peculiar exalted and heavenly nature; this color being
that of the pure, bright skies above.The blue color had exactly the
same significance in Mayab, according to Landa and Cogolludo, who tell
us that, even at the time of the Spanish conquest, the bodies of those
who were to be sacrificed to the gods were painted blue.The mural
paintings in the funeral chamber of Chaacmol, at Chichen, confirm this
assertion.There we see figures of men and women painted blue, some
marching to the sacrifice with their hands tied behind their backs.After being thus painted they were venerated by the people, who regarded
them as sanctified.Blue in Egypt was always the color used at the
funerals.The Egyptians believed in the immortality of the soul; and that rewards
and punishments were adjudged by Osiris, the king of the Amenti, to the
souls according to their deeds during their mundane life.That the souls
after a period of three thousand years were to return to earth and
inhabit again their former earthly tenements.This was the reason why
they took so much pains to embalm the body.The Mayas also believed in the immortality of the soul, as I have
already said.Their belief was that after the spirit had suffered during
a time proportioned to their misdeeds whilst on earth, and after having
enjoyed an amount of bliss corresponding to their good actions, they
were to return to earth and live again a material life.Accordingly, as
the body was corruptible, they made statues of stones, terra-cotta, or
wood, in the semblance of the deceased, whose ashes they deposited in a
hollow made for that purpose in the back of the head.Sometimes also in
stone urns, as in the case of Chaacmol.The spirits, on their return to
earth, were to find these statues, impart life to them, and use them as
body during their new existence.I am not certain but that, as the Egyptians also, they were believers in
transmigration; and that this belief exists yet among the aborigines.I
have noticed that my Indians were unwilling to kill any animal whatever,
even the most noxious and dangerous, that inhabits the ruined monuments.I have often told them to kill some venomous insect or serpent that may
have happened to be in our way.They invariably refused to do so, but
softly and carefully caused them to go.And when asked why they did not
kill them, declined to answer except by a knowing and mysterious smile,
as if afraid to let a stranger into their intimate beliefs inherited
from their ancestors: remembering, perhaps, the fearful treatment
inflicted by fanatical friars on their fathers to oblige them to forego
what they called the superstitions of their race--the idolatrous creed
of their forefathers.I have had opportunity to discover that their faith in reincarnation, as
many other time-honored credences, still exists among them, unshaken,
notwithstanding the persecutions and tortures suffered by them at the
hands of ignorant and barbaric _Christians_ (?)I will give two instances when that belief in reincarnation was plainly
manifested.The day that, after surmounting many difficulties, when my ropes and
cables, made of withes and the bark of the _habin_ tree, were finished
and adjusted to the capstan manufactured of hollow stones and trunks of
trees; and I had placed the ponderous statue of Chaacmol on rollers,
already in position to drag it up the inclined plane made from the
surface of the ground to a few feet above the bottom of the excavation;
my men, actuated by their superstitious fears on the one hand, and
their profound reverence for the memory of their ancestors on the other,
unwilling to see the effigy of one of the great men removed from where
their ancestors had placed it in ages gone by resolved to bury it, by
letting loose the hill of dry stones that formed the body of the
mausoleum, and were kept from falling in the hole by a framework of thin
trunks of trees tied with withes, and in order that it should not be
injured, to capsize it, placing the face downward.They had already
overturned it, when I interfered in time to prevent more mischief, and
even save some of them from certain death; since by cutting loose the
withes that keep the framework together, the sides of the excavation
were bound to fall in, and crush those at the bottom.I honestly think,
knowing their superstitious feelings and propensities, that they had
made up their mind to sacrifice their lives, in order to avoid what they
considered a desecration of the future tenement that the great warrior
and king was yet to inhabit, when time had arrived.In order to overcome
their scruples, and also to prove if my suspicions were correct, that,
as their forefathers and the Egyptians of old, they still believed in
reincarnation, I caused them to accompany me to the summit of the great
pyramid.There is a monument, that served as a castle when the city of
the holy men, the Itzaes, was at the height of its splendor.Every anta,
every pillar and column of this edifice is sculptured with portraits of
warriors and noblemen.Among these many with long beards, whose types
recall vividly to the mind the features of the Afghans.On one of the antae, at the entrance on the north side, is the portrait
of a warrior wearing a long, straight, pointed beard.The face, like
that of all the personages represented in the bas-reliefs, is in
profile.I placed my head against the stone so as to present the same
position of my face as that of UXAN, and called the attention of my
Indians to the similarity of his and my own features.They followed
every lineament of the faces with their fingers to the very point of the
beard, and soon uttered an exclamation of astonishment: "_Thou!_
_here!_" and slowly scanned again the features sculptured on the stone
and my own."_So, so,_" they said, "_thou too art one of our great men, who has been
disenchanted.Thou, too, wert a companion of the great Lord Chaacmol.That is why thou didst know where he was hidden; and thou hast come to
disenchant him also.His time to live again on earth has then arrived._"

From that moment every word of mine was implicitly obeyed.They returned
to the excavation, and worked with such a good will, that they soon
brought up the ponderous statue to the surface.A few days later some strange people made their appearance suddenly and
noiselessly in our midst.They emerged from the thicket one by one.Colonel _Don_ Felipe Diaz, then commander of the troops covering the
eastern frontier, had sent me, a couple of days previous, a written
notice, that I still preserve in my power, that tracks of hostile
Indians had been discovered by his scouts, advising me to keep a sharp
look out, lest they should surprise us.Now, to be on the look out in
the midst of a thick, well-nigh impenetrable forest, is a rather
difficult thing to do, particularly with only a few men, and where there
is no road; yet all being a road for the enemy.Warning my men that
danger was near, and to keep their loaded rifles at hand, we continued
our work as usual, leaving the rest to destiny.On seeing the strangers, my men rushed on their weapons, but noticing
that the visitors had no guns, but only their _machetes_, I gave orders
not to hurt them.At their head was a very old man: his hair was gray,
his eyes blue with age.He would not come near the statue, but stood at
a distance as if awe-struck, hat in hand, looking at it.After a long
time he broke out, speaking to his own people: "This, boys, is one of
the great men we speak to you about."Then the young men came forward,
with great respect kneeled at the feet of the statue, and pressed their
lips against them.Putting aside my own weapons, being consequently unarmed, I went to the
old man, and asked him to accompany me up to the castle, offering my arm
to ascend the 100 steep and crumbling stairs.I again placed my face
near that of my stone _Sosis_, and again the same scene was enacted as
with my own men, with this difference, that the strangers fell on their
knees before me, and, in turn, kissed my hand.The old man after a
while, eyeing me respectfully, but steadily, asked me: "Rememberest thou
what happened to thee whilst thou wert enchanted?"It was quite a
difficult question to answer, and yet retain my superior position, for I
did not know how many people might be hidden in the thicket."Well,
father," I asked him, "dreamest thou sometimes?"He nodded his head in
an affirmative manner."And when thou awakest, dost thou remember
distinctly thy dreams?""Well, father," I
continued, "so it happened with me.I do not remember what took place
during the time I was enchanted."I
again gave him my hand to help him down the precipitous stairs, at the
foot of which we separated, wishing them God-speed, and warning them not
to go too near the villages on their way back to their homes, as people
were aware of their presence in the country.Whence they came, I ignore;
where they went, I don't know.Circumcision was a rite in usage among the Egyptians since very remote
times.The Mayas also practiced it, if we are to credit Fray Luis de
Urreta; yet Cogolludo affirms that in his days the Indians denied
observing such custom.The outward sign of utmost reverence seems to
have been identical amongst both the Mayas and the Egyptians.It
consisted in throwing the left arm across the chest, resting the left
hand on the right shoulder; or the right arm across the chest, the
right hand resting on the left shoulder.Sir Gardner Wilkinson, in his
work above quoted, reproduces various figures in that attitude; and Mr.Champollion Figeac, in his book on Egypt, tells us that in some cases
even the mummies of certain eminent men were placed in their coffins
with the arms in that position.That this same mark of respect was in
use amongst the Mayas there can be no possible doubt.We see it in the
figures represented in the act of worshiping the mastodon's head, on the
west facade of the monument that forms the north wing of the palace and
museum at Chichen-Itza.We see it repeatedly in the mural paintings in
Chaacmol's funeral chamber; on the slabs sculptured with the
representation of a dying warrior, that adorned the mausoleum of that
chieftain.Cogolludo mentions it in his history of Yucatan, as being
common among the aborigines: and my own men have used it to show their
utmost respect to persons or objects they consider worthy of their
veneration.Among my collection of photographs are several plates in
which some of the men have assumed that position of the arms
spontaneously._The sistrum_ was an instrument used by Egyptians and Mayas alike during
the performance of their religious rites and acts of worship.I have
seen it used lately by natives in Yucatan in the dance forming part of
the worship of the sun.The Egyptians enclosed the brains, entrails and
viscera of the deceased in funeral vases, called _canopas_, that were
placed in the tombs with the coffin.When I opened Chaacmol's mausoleum
I found, as I have already said, two stone urns, the one near the head
containing the remains of brains, that near the chest those of the heart
and other viscera.This fact would tend to show again a similar custom
among the Mayas and Egyptians, who, besides, placed with the body an
empty vase--symbol that the deceased had been judged and found
righteous.This vase, held between the hands of the statue of Chaacmol,
is also found held in the same manner by many other statues of
different individuals.It was customary with the Egyptians to deposit in
the tombs the implements of the trade or profession of the deceased.So
also with the Mayas--if a priest, they placed books; if a warrior, his
weapons; if a mechanic, the tools of his art,[TN-23]

The Egyptians adorned the tombs of the rich--which generally consisted
of one or two chambers--with sculptures and paintings reciting the names
and the history of the life of the personage to whom the tomb belonged.The mausoleum of Chaacmol, interiorly, was composed of three different
superposed apartments, with their floors of concrete well leveled,
polished and painted with yellow ochre; and exteriorly was adorned with
magnificent bas-reliefs, representing his totem and that of his
wife--dying warriors--the whole being surrounded by the image of a
feathered serpent--_Can_, his family name, whilst the walls of the two
apartments, or funeral chambers, in the monument raised to his memory,
were decorated with fresco paintings, representing not only Chaacmol's
own life, but the manners, customs, mode of dressing of his
contemporaries; as those of the different nations with which they were
in communication: distinctly recognizable by their type, stature and
other peculiarities.The portraits of the great and eminent men of his
time are sculptured on the jambs and lintels of the doors, represented
life-size.In Egypt it was customary to paint the sculptures, either on stone or
wood, with bright colors--yellow, blue, red, green predominating.In
Mayab the same custom prevailed, and traces of these colors are still
easily discernible on the sculptures; whilst they are still very
brilliant on the beautiful and highly polished stucco of the walls in
the rooms of certain monuments at Chichen-Itza.The Maya artists seem to
have used mostly vegetable colors; yet they also employed ochres as
pigments, and cinnabar--we having found such metallic colors in
Chaacmol's mausoleum.Le Plongeon still preserves some in her
possession.From where they procured it is more than we can tell at
present.The wives and daughters of the Egyptian kings and noblemen considered it
an honor to assist in the temples and religious ceremonies: one of their
principal duties being to play the sistrum.We find that in Yucatan, _Nicte_ (flower) the sister of _Chaacmol_,
assisted her elder brother, _Cay_, the pontiff, in the sanctuary, her
name being always associated with his in the inscriptions which adorn
the western facade of that edifice at Uxmal, as that of her sister,
_Mo_,[TN-24] is with Chaacmol's in some of the monuments at Chichen.Cogolludo, when speaking of the priestesses, _virgins of the sun_,
mentions a tradition that seems to refer to _Nicte_, stating that the
daughter of a king, who remained during all her life in the temple,
obtained after her death the honor of apotheosis, and was worshiped
under the name of _Zuhuy-Kak_ (the fire-virgin), and became the goddess
of the maidens, who were recommended to her care.As in Egypt, the kings and heroes were worshiped in Mayab after their
death; temples and pyramids being raised to their memory.Cogolludo
pretends that the lower classes adored fishes, snakes, tigers and other
abject animals, "even the devil himself, which appeared to them in
horrible forms" ("Historia de Yucatan," book IV., chap.Judging from the sculptures and mural paintings, the higher classes in
_Mayab_ wore, in very remote ages, dresses of quite an elaborate
character.Their under garment consisted of short trowsers, reaching the
middle of the thighs.At times these trowsers were highly ornamented
with embroideries and fringes, as they formed their only article of
clothing when at home; over these they wore a kind of kilt, very similar
to that used by the inhabitants of the Highlands in Scotland.It was
fastened to the waist with wide ribbons, tied behind in a knot forming a
large bow, the ends of which reached to the ankles.Their shoulders
were covered with a tippet falling to the elbows, and fastened on the
chest by means of a brooch.Their feet were protected by sandals, kept
in place by ropes or ribbons, passing between the big toe and the next,
and between the third and fourth, then brought up so as to encircle the
ankles.They were tied in front, forming a bow on the instep.Some wore
leggings, others garters and anklets made of feathers, generally yellow;
sometimes, however, they may have been of gold.Their head gears were of
different kinds, according to their rank and dignity.Warriors seem to
have used wide bands, tied behind the head with two knots, as we see in
the statue of Chaacmol, and in the bas-reliefs that adorn the queen's
chamber at Chichen.The king's coiffure was a peaked cap, that seems to
have served as model for the _pschent_, that symbol of domination over
the lower Egypt; with this difference, however, that in Mayab the point
formed the front, and in Egypt the back.The common people in Mayab, as in Egypt, were indeed little troubled by
their garments.These consisted merely of a simple girdle tied round the
loins, the ends falling before and behind to the middle of the thighs.Sometimes they also used the short trowsers; and, when at work, wrapped
a piece of cloth round their loins, long enough to cover their legs to
the knees.This costume was completed by wearing a square cloth, tied on
one of the shoulders by two of its corners.To-day
the natives of Yucatan wear the same dress, with but slight
modifications.While the aborigines of the _Tierra de Guerra_, who still
preserve the customs of their forefathers, untainted by foreign
admixture, use the same garments, of their own manufacture, that we see
represented in the bas-reliefs of Chichen and Uxmal, and in the mural
paintings of _Mayab_ and Egypt.Divination by the inspection of the entrails of victims, and the study
of omens were considered by the Egyptians as important branches of
learning.The soothsayers formed a respected order of the priesthood.From the mural paintings at Chichen, and from the works of the
chroniclers, we learn that the Mayas also had several manners of
consulting fate.One of the modes was by the inspection of the entrails
of victims; another by the manner of the cracking of the shell of a
turtle or armadillo by the action of fire, as among the Chinese.(In the
_Hong-fan_ or "the great and sublime doctrine," one of the books of the
_Chou-king_, the ceremonies of _Pou_ and _Chi_ are described at length).The Mayas had also their astrologers and prophets.Several prophecies,
purporting to have been made by their priests, concerning the preaching
of the Gospel among the people of Mayab, have reached us, preserved in
the works of Landa, Lizana, and Cogolludo.There we also read that, even
at the time of the Spanish conquest, they came from all parts of the
country, and congregated at the shrine of _Kinich-kakmo_, the deified
daughter of CAN, to listen to the oracles delivered by her through the
mouths of her priests and consult her on future events.By the
examination of the mural paintings, we know that _animal magnetism_ was
understood and practiced by the priests, who, themselves, seem to have
consulted clairvoyants.The learned priests of Egypt are said to have made considerable progress
in astronomical sciences.The _gnomon_, discovered by me in December, last year, in the ruined
city of Mayapan, would tend to prove that the learned men of Mayab were
not only close observers of the march of the celestial bodies and good
mathematicians; but that their attainments in astronomy were not
inferior to those of their brethren of Chaldea.Effectively the
construction of the gnomon shows that they had found the means of
calculating the latitude of places, that they knew the distance of the
solsticeal points from the equator; they had found that the greatest
angle of declination of the sun, 23 deg.27', occurred when that
luminary reached the tropics where, during nearly three days, said angle
of declination does not vary, for which reason they said that the _sun_
had arrived at his resting place.The Egyptians, it is said, in very remote ages, divided the year by
lunations, as the Mayas, who divided their civil year into eighteen
months, of twenty days, that they called U--moon--to which they added
five supplementary days, that they considered unlucky.From an epoch so
ancient that it is referred to the fabulous time of their history, the
Egyptians adopted the solar year, dividing it into twelve months, of
thirty days, to which they added, at the end of the last month, called
_Mesore_, five days, named _Epact_.By a most remarkable coincidence, the Egyptians, as the Mayas,
considered these additive five days _unlucky_.Besides this solar year they had a sideral or sothic year, composed of
365 days and 6 hours, which corresponds exactly to the Mayas[TN-25]
sacred year, that Landa tells us was also composed of 365 days and 6
hours; which they represented in the gnomon of Mayapan by the line that
joins the centers of the stela that forms it.The Egyptians, in their computations, calculated by a system of _fives_
and _tens_; the Mayas by a system of _fives_ and _twenties_, to four
hundred.Their sacred number appears to have been 13 from the remotest
antiquity, but SEVEN seems to have been a _mystic number_ among them as
among the Hindoos, Aryans, Chaldeans, Egyptians, and other nations.The Egyptians made use of a septenary system in the arrangement of the
grand gallery in the center of the great pyramid.Each side of the wall
is made of seven courses of finely polished stones, the one above
overlapping that below, thus forming the triangular ceiling common to
all the edifices in Yucatan.This gallery is said to be seven times the
height of the other passages, and, as all the rooms in Uxmal, Chichen
and other places in Mayab, it is seven-sided.Some authors pretend to
assume that this well marked septenary system has reference to the
_Pleiades_ or _Seven stars_._Alcyone_, the central star of the group,
being, it is said, on the same meridian as the pyramid, when it was
constructed, and _Alpha_ of Draconis, the then pole star, at its lower
culmination.Joseph A. Seiss and others pretend, the scientific
attainments required for the construction of such enduring monument
surpassed those of the learned men of Egypt, we must, of necessity,
believe that the architect who conceived the plan and carried out its
designs must have acquired his knowledge from an older people,
possessing greater learning than the priests of Memphis; unless we try
to persuade ourselves, as the reverend gentleman wishes us to, that the
great pyramid was built under the direct inspiration of the Almighty.Nearly all the monuments of Yucatan bear evidence that the Mayas had a
predilection for number SEVEN.Since we find that their artificial
mounds were composed of seven superposed platforms; that the city of
Uxmal contained seven of these mounds; that the north side of the palace
of King CAN was adorned with seven turrets; that the entwined serpents,
his totem, which adorn the east facade of the west wing of this
building, have seven rattles; that the head-dress of kings and queens
were adorned with seven blue feathers; in a word, that the number SEVEN
prevails in all places and in everything where Maya influence has
predominated.It is a FACT, and one that may not be altogether devoid of significance,
that this number SEVEN seems to have been the mystic number of many of
the nations of antiquity.It has even reached our times as such, being
used as symbol[TN-26] by several of the secret societies existing among
us.If we look back through the vista of ages to the dawn of civilized life
in the countries known as the _old world_, we find this number SEVEN
among the Asiatic nations as well as in Egypt and Mayab.Effectively, in
Babylon, the celebrated temple of _the seven lights_ was made of _seven_
stages or platforms.In the hierarchy of Mazdeism, the _seven marouts_,
or genii of the winds, the _seven amschaspands_; then among the Aryans
and their descendants, the _seven horses_ that drew the chariot of the
sun, the _seven apris_ or shape of the flame, the _seven rays_ of Agni,
the _seven manons_ or criators of the Vedas; among the Hebrews, the
_seven days_ of the creation, the _seven lamps_ of the ark and of
Zacharias's vision, the _seven branches_ of the golden candlestick, the
_seven days_ of the feast of the dedication of the temple of Solomon,
the _seven years_ of plenty, the _seven years_ of famine; in the
Christian dispensation, the _seven_ churches with the _seven_ angels at
their head, the _seven_ golden candlesticks, the _seven seals_ of the
book, the _seven_ trumpets of the angels, the _seven heads_ of the beast
that rose from the sea, the _seven vials_ full of the wrath of God, the
_seven_ last plagues of the Apocalypse; in the Greek mythology, the
_seven_ heads of the hydra, killed by Hercules, etc.The origin of the prevalence of that number SEVEN amongst all the
nations of earth, even the most remote from each other, has never been
satisfactorily explained, each separate people giving it a different
interpretation, according to their belief and to the tenets of their
religious creeds.As far as the Mayas are concerned, I think to have
found that it originated with the _seven_ members of CAN'S family, who
were the founders of the principal cities of _Mayab_, and to each of
whom was dedicated a mound in Uxmal and a turret in their palace.Their
names, according to the inscriptions carved on the monuments raised by
them at Uxmal and Chichen, were--CAN (serpent) and [C]OZ (bat), his
wife, from whom were born CAY (fish), the pontiff; AAK (turtle), who
became the governor of Uxmal; CHAACMOL (leopard), the warrior, who
became the husband of his sister MOO (macaw), the Queen of _Chichen_,
worshiped after her death at Izamal; and NICTE (flower), the priestess
who, under the name of _Zuhuy-Kuk_, became the goddess of the maidens.The Egyptians, in expressing their ideas in writing, used three
different kinds of characters--phonetic, ideographic and
symbolic--placed either in vertical columns or in horizontal lines, to
be read from right to left, from left to right, as indicated by the
position of the figures of men or animals.So, also, the Mayas in their
writings employed phonetic, symbolic and ideographic signs, combining
these often, forming monograms as we do to-day, placing them in such a
manner as best suited the arrangement of the ornamentation of the facade
of the edifices.At present we can only speak with certainty of the
monumental inscriptions, the books that fell in the hands of the
ecclesiastics at the time of the conquest having been destroyed.No
truly genuine written monuments of the Mayas are known to exist, except
those inclosed within the sealed apartments, where the priests and
learned men of MAYAB hid them from the _Nahualt_ or _Toltec_ invaders.As the Egyptians, they wrote in vertical columns and horizontal lines,
to be read generally from right to left.The space of this small essay
does not allow me to enter in more details; they belong naturally to a
work of different nature.Let it therefore suffice, for the present
purpose, to state that the comparative study of the language of the
Mayas led us to suspect that, as it contains words belonging to nearly
all the known languages of antiquity, and with exactly the same meaning,
in their mode of writing might be found letters or characters or signs
used in those tongues.Studying with attention the photographs made by
us of the inscriptions of Uxmal and Chichen, we were not long in
discovering that our surmises were indeed correct.The inscriptions,
written in squares or parallelograms, that might well have served as
models for the ancient hieratic Chaldeans, of the time of King Uruck,
seem to contain ancient Chaldee, Egyptian and Etruscan characters,
together with others that seem to be purely Mayab.Applying these known characters to the decipherment of the inscriptions,
giving them their accepted value, we soon found that the language in
which they are written is, in the main, the vernacular of the aborigines
of Yucatan and other parts of Central America to-day.Of course, the
original mother tongue having suffered some alterations, in consequence
of changes in customs induced by time, invasions, intercourse with other
nations, and the many other natural causes that are known to affect
man's speech.The Mayas and the Egyptians had many signs and characters identical;
possessing the same alphabetical and symbolical value in both nations.Among the symbolical, I may cite a few: _water_, _country or region_,
_king_, _Lord_, _offerings_, _splendor_, the _various emblems of the
sun_ and many others.Among the alphabetical, a very large number of the
so-called Demotic, by Egyptologists, are found even in the inscription
of the _Akab[c]ib_ at Chichen; and not a few of the most ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphs in the mural inscriptions at Uxmal.In these I have
been able to discover the Egyptian characters corresponding to our own.A a, B, C, CH or K, D, T, I, L, M, N, H, P, TZ, PP, U, OO, X, having the
same sound and value as in the Spanish language, with the exception of
the K, TZ, PP and X, which are pronounced in a way peculiar to the
Mayas.The inscriptions also contain these letters, A, I, X and PP
identical to the corresponding in the Etruscan alphabet.The finding of
the value of these characters has enabled me to decipher, among other
things, the names of the founders of the city of UXMAL; as that of the
city itself.This is written apparently in two different ways: whilst,
in fact, the sculptors have simply made use of two homophone signs,
notwithstanding dissimilar, of the letter M. As to the name of the
founders, not only are they written in alphabetical characters, but also
in ideographic, since they are accompanied in many instances by the
totems of the personages: e. g[TN-27] for AAK, which means turtle, is the
image of a turtle; for CAY (fish), the image of a fish; for Chaacmol
(leopard) the image of a leopard; and so on, precluding the possibility
of misinterpretation.Having found that the language of the inscriptions was Maya, of course
I had no difficulty in giving to each letter its proper phonetic value,
since, as I have already said, Maya is still the vernacular of the
people.I consider that the few facts brought together will suffice at present
to show, if nothing else, a strange similarity in the workings of the
mind in these two nations.But if these remarkable coincidences are not
merely freaks of hazard, we will be compelled to admit that one people
must have learned it from the other.Then will naturally arise the
questions, Which the teacher?The answer will not only
solve an ethnological problem, but decide the question of priority.I will now briefly refer to the myth of Osiris, the son of _Seb and
Nut_, the brother of _Aroeris_, the elder _Horus_, of _Typho_, of
_Isis_, and of _Nephthis_, named also NIKE.The authors have given
numerous explanations, result of fancy; of the mythological history of
that god, famous throughout Egypt.They made him a personification of
the inundations of the NILE; ISIS, his wife and sister, that of the
irrigated portion of the land of Egypt; their sister, _Nephthis_, that
of the barren edge of the desert occasionally fertilized by the waters
of the Nile; his brother and murderer _Tipho_, that of the sea which
swallows up the _Nile_.Leaving aside the mythical lores, with which the priests of all times
and all countries cajole the credulity of ignorant and superstitious
people, we find that among the traditions of the past, treasured in the
mysterious recesses of the temples, is a history of the life of Osiris
on Earth.Many wise men of our days have looked upon it as fabulous.I
am not ready to say whether it is or it is not; but this I can assert,
that, in many parts, it tallies marvelously with that of the culture
hero of the Mayas.It will be said, no doubt, that this remarkable similarity is a mere
coincidence.But how are we to dispose of so many coincidences?What
conclusion, if any, are we to draw from this concourse of so many
strange similes?In this case, I cannot do better than to quote, verbatim, from Sir
Gardner Wilkinson's work, chap.xiii:

     "_Osiris_, having become King of Egypt, applied himself towards
     civilizing his countrymen, by turning them from their former
     barbarous course of life, teaching them, moreover, to cultivate and
     improve the fruits of the earth.* * * * * With the same good
     disposition, he afterwards traveled over the rest of the world,
     inducing the people everywhere to submit to his discipline, by the
     mildest persuasion."The rest of the story relates to the manner of his killing by his
brother Typho, the disposal of his remains, the search instituted by his
wife to recover the body, how it was stolen again from her by _Typho_,
who cut him to pieces, scattering them over the earth, of the final
defeat of Typho by Osiris's son, Horus.Reading the description, above quoted, of the endeavors of Osiris to
civilize the world, who would not imagine to be perusing the traditions
of the deeds of the culture heroes _Kukulean_[TN-28] and Quetzalcoatl of
the Mayas and of the Aztecs?Osiris was particularly worshiped at Philo,
where the history of his life is curiously illustrated in the sculptures
of a small retired chamber, lying nearly over the western adytum of the
temple, just as that of Chaacmol in the mural paintings of his funeral
chamber, the bas-reliefs of what once was his mausoleum, in those of the
queen's chamber and of her box in the tennis court at Chichen."The mysteries of Osiris were divided into the greater and less
     mysteries.Before admission into the former, it was necessary that
     the initiated should have passed through all the gradations of the
     latter.But to merit this great honor, much was expected of the
     candidate, and many even of the priesthood were unable to obtain
     it.Besides the proofs of a virtuous life, other recommendations
     were required, and to be admitted to all the grades of the higher
     mysteries was the greatest honor to which any one could aspire.It
     was from these that the mysteries of Eleusis were borrowed."In Mayab there also existed mysteries, as proved by symbols discovered
in the month of June last by myself in the monument generally called the
_Dwarf's House_, at Uxmal.It seemed that the initiated had to pass
through different gradations to reach the highest or third; if we are to
judge by the number of rooms dedicated to their performance, and the
disposition of said rooms.The strangest part, perhaps, of this
discovery is the information it gives us that certain signs and symbols
were used by the affiliated, that are perfectly identical to those used
among the masons in their symbolical lodges.I have lately published in
_Harper's Weekly_, a full description of the building, with plans of the
same, and drawings of the signs and symbols existing in it.These secret
societies exist still among the _Zunis_ and other Pueblo Indians of New
Mexico, according to the relations of Mr.Frank H. Cushing, a gentleman
sent by the Smithsonian Institution to investigate their customs and
history.In order to comply with the mission intrusted to him, Mr.Cushing has caused his adoption in the tribe of the Zunis, whose
language he has learned, whose habits he has adopted.Among the other
remarkable things he has discovered is "the existence of twelve sacred
orders, with their priests and their secret rites as carefully guarded
as the secrets of freemasonry, an institution to which these orders have
a strange resemblance."If from Egypt we pass to Nubia, we find that the peculiar battle ax of
the Mayas was also used by the warriors of that country; whilst many of
the customs of the inhabitants of equatorial Africa, as described by Mr.DuChaillu[TN-29] in the relation of his voyage to the "Land of Ashango,"
so closely resemble those of the aborigines of Yucatan as to suggest
that intimate relations must have existed, in very remote ages, between
their ancestors; if the admixture of African blood, clearly discernible
still, among the natives of certain districts of the peninsula, did not
place that _fact_ without the peradventure of a doubt.We also see
figures in the mural paintings, at Chichen, with strongly marked African
features.We learned by the discovery of the statue of Chaacmol, and that of the
priestess found by me at the foot of the altar in front of the shrine
of _Ix-cuina_, the Maya Venus, situated at the south end of _Isla
Mugeres_, it was customary with persons of high rank to file their teeth
in sharp points like a saw.We read in the chronicles that this fashion
still prevailed after the Spanish conquest; and then by little and
little fell into disuse.Travelers tells us that it is yet in vogue
among many of the tribes in the interior of South America; particularly
those whose names seem to connect with the ancient Caribs or Carians.Du Chaillu asserts that the Ashangos, those of Otamo, the Apossos, the
Fans, and many other tribes of equatorial Africa, consider it a mark of
beauty to file their front teeth in a sharp point.He presents the Fans
as confirmed cannibals.We are told, and the bas-reliefs on Chaacmol's
mausoleum prove it, that the Mayas devoured the hearts of their fallen
enemies.It is said that, on certain grand occasions, after offering the
hearts of their victims to the idols, they abandoned the bodies to the
people, who feasted upon them.But it must be noticed that these
last-mentioned customs seemed to have been introduced in the country by
the Nahualts and Aztecs; since, as yet, we have found nothing in the
mural paintings to cause us to believe that the Mayas indulged in such
barbaric repasts, beyond the eating of their enemies' hearts.The Mayas were, and their descendants are still, confirmed believers in
witchcraft.In December, last year, being at the hacienda of
X-Kanchacan, where are situated the ruins of the ancient city of
Mayapan, a sick man was brought to me.He came most reluctantly, stating
that he knew what was the matter with him: that he was doomed to die
unless the spell was removed.He was emaciated, seemed to suffer from
malarial fever, then prevalent in the place, and from the presence of
tapeworm.I told him I could restore him to health if he would heed my
advice.The fellow stared at me for some time, trying to find out,
probably, if I was a stronger wizard than the _H-Men_ who had bewitched
him.He must have failed to discover on my face the proverbial
distinctive marks great sorcerers are said to possess; for, with an
incredulous grin, stretching his thin lips tighter over his teeth, he
simply replied: "No use--I am bewitched--there is no remedy for me."Du Chaillu, speaking of the superstitions of the inhabitants of
Equatorial Africa, says: "The greatest curse of the whole country is the
belief in sorcery or witchcraft.If the African is once possessed with
the belief that he is bewitched his whole nature seems to change.He
becomes suspicious of his dearest friends.He fancies himself sick, and
really often becomes sick through his fears.At least seventy-five per
cent of the deaths in all the tribes are murders for supposed sorcery."In that they differ from the natives of Yucatan, who respect wizards
because of their supposed supernatural powers.From the most remote antiquity, as we learn from the writings of the
chroniclers, in all sacred ceremonies the Mayas used to make copious
libations with _Balche_.To-day the aborigines still use it in the
celebrations of their ancient rites._Balche_ is a liquor made from the
bark of a tree called Balche, soaked in water, mixed with honey and left
to ferment.The nectar drank by
the God of Greek Mythology.Du Chaillu, speaking of the recovery to health of the King of _Mayo_lo,
a city in which he resided for some time, says: "Next day he was so much
elated with the improvement in his health that he got tipsy on a
fermented beverage which he had prepared two days before he had fallen
ill, and which he made by _mixing honey and water, and adding to it
pieces of bark of a certain tree_."(Journey to Ashango Land, page 183.)I will remark here that, by a strange _coincidence_, we not only find
that the inhabitants of Equatorial Africa have customs identical with
the MAYAS, but that the name of one of their cities MAYO_lo_, seems to
be a corruption of MAYAB.The Africans make offerings upon the graves of their departed friends,
where they deposit furniture, dress and food--and sometimes slay slaves,
men and women, over the graves of kings and chieftains, with the belief
that their spirits join that of him in whose honor they have been
sacrificed.I have already said that it was customary with the Mayas to place in the
tombs part of the riches of the deceased and the implements of his trade
or profession; and that the great quantity of blood found scattered
round the slab on which the statue of Chaacmol is reclining would tend
to suggest that slaves were sacrificed at his funeral.The Mayas of old were wont to abandon the house where a person had died.Many still observe that same custom when they can afford to do so; for
they believe that the spirit of the departed hovers round it.The Africans also abandon their houses, remove even the site of their
villages when death frequently occur;[TN-30] for, say they, the place is
no longer good; and they fear the spirits of those recently deceased.Among the musical instruments used by the Mayas there were two kinds of
drums--the _Tunkul_ and the _Zacatan_.They are still used by the
aborigines in their religious festivals and dances.The _Tunkul_ is a cylinder hollowed from the trunk of a tree, so as to
leave it about one inch in thickness all round.It is generally about
four feet in length.On one side two slits are cut, so as to leave
between them a strip of about four inches in width, to within six inches
from the ends; this strip is divided in the middle, across, so as to
form, as it were, tongues.It is by striking on those tongues with two
balls of india-rubber, attached to the end of sticks, that the
instrument is played.The volume of sound produced is so great that it
can be heard, is[TN-31] is said, at a distance of six miles in calm
weather.The _Zacatan_ is another sort of drum, also hollowed from the
trunk of a tree.On one end a piece of
skin is tightly stretched.It is by beating on the skin with the hand,
the instrument being supported between the legs of the drummer, in a
slanting position, that it is played.Du Chaillu, Stanley and other travelers in Africa tell us that, in case
of danger and to call the clans together, the big war drum is beaten,
and is heard many miles around.Du Chaillu asserts having seen one of
these _Ngoma_, formed of a hollow log, nine feet long, at Apono; and
describes a _Fan_ drum which corresponds to the _Zacatan_ of the Mayas
as follows: "The cylinder was about four feet long and ten inches in
diameter at one end, but only seven at the other.The wood was hollowed
out quite thin, and the skin stretched over tightly.To beat it the
drummer held it slantingly between his legs, and with two sticks
beats[TN-32] furiously upon the upper, which was the larger end of the
cylinder."We have the counterpart of the fetish houses, containing the skulls of
the ancestors and some idol or other, seen by Du Chaillu, in African
towns, in the small huts constructed at the entrance of all the villages
in Yucatan.These huts or shrines contain invariably a crucifix; at
times the image of some saint, often a skull.The last probably to cause
the wayfarer to remember he has to die; and that, as he cannot carry
with him his worldly treasures on the other side of the grave, he had
better deposit some in the alms box firmly fastened at the foot of the
cross.Cogolludo informs us these little shrines were anciently
dedicated to the god of lovers, of histrions, of dancers, and an
infinity of small idols that were placed at the entrance of the
villages, roads and staircases of the temples and other parts.Even the breed of African dogs seems to be the same as that of the
native dogs of Yucatan.Were I to describe these I could not make use of
more appropriate words than the following of Du Chaillu: "The pure bred
native dog is small, has long straight ears, long muzzle and long curly
tail; the hair is short and the color yellowish; the pure breed being
known by the clearness of his color.They are always lean, and are kept
very short of food by their owners.* * * Although they have quick ears;
I don't think highly of their scent.I could continue this list of similes, but methinks those already
mentioned as sufficient for the present purpose.I will therefore close
it by mentioning this strange belief that Du Chaillu asserts exists
among the African warriors: "_The charmed leopard's skin worn about the
warrior's middle is supposed to render that worthy spear-proof._"

Let us now take a brief retrospective glance at the FACTS mentioned in
the foregoing pages.They seem to teach us that, in ages so remote as to
be well nigh lost in the abyss of the past, the _Mayas_ were a great and
powerful nation, whose people had reached a high degree of civilization.That it is impossible for us to form a correct idea of their
attainments, since only the most enduring monuments, built by them, have
reached us, resisting the disintegrating action of time and atmosphere.That, as the English of to-day, they had colonies all over the earth;
for we find their name, their traditions, their customs and their
language scattered in many distant countries, among whose inhabitants
they apparently exercised considerable civilizing influence, since they
gave names to their gods, to their tribes, to their cities.We cannot doubt that the colonists carried with them the old traditions
of the mother country, and the history of the founders of their
nationality; since we find them in the countries where they seem to have
established large settlements soon after leaving the land of their
birth.In course of time these traditions have become disfigured,
wrapped, as it were, in myths, creations of fanciful and untutored
imaginations, as in Hindostan: or devises of crafty priests, striving to
hide the truth from the ignorant mass of the people, fostering their
superstitions, in order to preserve unbounded and undisputed sway over
them, as in Egypt.In Hindostan, for example, we find the Maya custom of carrying the
children astride on the hips of the nurses.That of recording the vow of
the devotees, or of imploring the blessings of deity by the imprint of
the hand, dipped in red liquid, stamped on the walls of the shrines and
palaces.The worship of the mastodon, still extant in India, Siam,
Burmah, as in the worship of _Ganeza_, the god of knowledge, with an
elephant head, degenerated in that of the elephant itself.Still extant we find likewise the innate propensity of the Mayas to
exclude all foreigners from their country; even to put to death those
who enter their territories (as do, even to-day, those of Santa Cruz and
the inhabitants of the Tierra de Guerra) as the emissaries of Rama were
informed by the friend of the owner of the country, the widow of the
_great architect_, MAYA, whose name HEMA means in the Maya language "she
who places ropes across the roads to impede the passage."Even the
history of the death of her husband MAYA, killed with a thunderbolt, by
the god _Pourandara_, whose jealousy was aroused by his love for her and
their marriage, recalls that of _Chaacmol_, the husband of _Moo_, killed
by their brother Aac, by being stabbed by him three times in the back
with a spear, through jealousy--for he also loved _Moo_.Some Maya tribes, after a time, probably left their home at the South of
Hindostan and emigrated to Afghanistan, where their descendants still
live and have villages on the North banks of the river _Kabul_.They
left behind old traditions, that they may have considered as mere
fantasies of their poets, and other customs of their forefathers.Yet we
know so little about the ancient Afghans, or the Maya tribes living
among them, that it is impossible at present to say how much, if any,
they have preserved of the traditions of their race.All we know for a
certainty is that many of the names of their villages and tribes are
pure American-Maya words: that their types are very similar to the
features of the bearded men carved on the pillars of the castle, and on
the walls of other edifices at Chichen-Itza: while their warlike habits
recall those of the Mayas, who fought so bravely and tenaciously the
Spanish invaders.Some of the Maya tribes, traveling towards the west and northwest,
reached probably the shores of Ethiopia; while others, entering the
Persian Gulf, landed near the embouchure of the Euphrates, and founded
their primitive capital at a short distance from it.They called it _Hur
(Hula) city of guests just arrived_--and according to Berosus gave
themselves the name of _Khaldi_; probably because they intrenched their
city: _Kal_ meaning intrenchment in the American-Maya language.We have
seen that the names of all the principal deities of the primitive
Chaldeans had a natural etymology in that tongue.Such strange
coincidences cannot be said to be altogether accidental.Particularly
when we consider that their learned men were designated as MAGI, (Mayas)
and their Chief _Rab-Mag_, meaning, in Maya, the _old man_; and were
great architects, mathematicians and astronomers.As again we know of
them but imperfectly, we cannot tell what traditions they had preserved
of the birthplace of their forefathers.But by the inscriptions on the
tablets or bricks, found at Mugheir and Warka, we know for a certainty
that, in the archaic writings, they formed their characters of straight
lines of uniform thickness; and inclosed their sentences in squares or
parallelograms, as did the founders of the ruined cities of Yucatan.And
from the signet cylinder of King Urukh, that their mode of dressing was
identical with that of many personages represented in the mural
paintings at Chichen-Itza.We have traced the MAYAS again on the shores of Asia Minor, where the
CARIANS at last established themselves, after having spread terror among
the populations bordering on the Mediterranean.Their origin is unknown:
but their customs were so similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan
at the time even of the Spanish conquest--and their names CAR, _Carib_
or _Carians_, so extensively spread over the western continent, that we
might well surmise, that, navigators as they were, they came from those
parts of the world; particularly when we are told by the Greek poets and
historians, that the goddess MAIA was the daughter of _Atlantis_.We
have seen that the names of the khati, those of their cities, that of
Tyre, and finally that of Egypt, have their etymology in the Maya.Considering the numerous coincidences already pointed out, and many more
I could bring forth, between the attainments and customs of the Mayas
and the Egyptians; in view also of the fact that the priests and learned
men of Egypt constantly pointed toward the WEST as the birthplace of
their ancestors, it would seem as if a colony, starting from Mayab, had
emigrated Eastward, and settled on the banks of the Nile; just as the
Chinese to-day, quitting their native land and traveling toward the
rising sun, establish themselves in America.In Egypt again, as in Hindostan, we find the history of the children of
CAN, preserved among the secret traditions treasured up by the priests
in the dark recesses of their temples: the same story, even with all its
details.It is TYPHO who kills his brother OSIRIS, the husband of their
sister ISIS.Some of the names only have been changed when the members
of the royal family of CAN, the founder of the cities of Mayab, reaching
apotheosis, were presented to the people as gods, to be worshiped.That the story of _Isis_ and _Osiris_ is a mythical account of CHAACMOL
and MOO, from all the circumstances connected with it, according to the
relations of the priests of Egypt that tally so closely with what we
learn in Chichen-Itza from the bas-reliefs, it seems impossible to
doubt.Effectively, _Osiris_ and _Isis_ are considered as king and queen of the
Amenti--the region of the West--the mansion of the dead, of the
ancestors.Whatever may be the etymology of the name of Osiris, it is a
_fact_, that in the sculptures he is often represented with a spotted
skin suspended near him, and Diodorus Siculus says: "That the skin is
usually represented without the head; but some instances where this is
introduced show it to be the _leopard's_ or _panther's_."Again, the
name of Osiris as king of the West, of the Amenti, is always written, in
hieroglyphic characters, representing a crouching _leopard_ with an eye
above it.It is also well known that the priests of Osiris wore a
_leopard_ skin as their ceremonial dress.Now, Chaacmol reigned with his sister Moo, at Chichen-Itza, in Mayab, in
the land of the West for Egypt.The name _Chaacmol_ means, in Maya, a
_Spotted_ tiger, a _leopard_; and he is represented as such in all his
totems in the sculptures on the monuments; his shield being made of the
skin of leopard, as seen in the mural paintings.Osiris, in Egypt, is a myth.Chaacmol, in Mayab, a reality.A warrior
whose mausoleum I have opened; whose weapons and ornaments of jade are
in Mrs.Le Plongeon's possession; whose heart I have found, and sent a
piece of it to be analysed by professor Thompson of Worcester, Mass.;
whose effigy, with his name inscribed on the tablets occupying the place
of the ears, forms now one of the most precious relics in the National
Museum of Mexico.As to the etymology of her name
the Maya affords it in I[C]IN--_the younger sister_.As Queen of the
Amenti, of the West, she also is represented in hieroglyphs by the same
characters as her husband--a _leopard, with an eye above_, and the sign
of the feminine gender an oval or egg.But as a goddess she is always
portrayed with wings; the vulture being dedicated to her; and, as it
were, her totem.MOO the wife and sister of _Chaacmol_ was the Queen of Chichen.She is
represented on the Mausoleum of Chaacmol as a _Macaw_ (Moo in the Maya
language); also on the monuments at Uxmal: and the chroniclers tell us
that she was worshiped in Izamal under the name of _Kinich-Kakmo_;
reading from right to left the _fiery macaw with eyes like the sun_.Their protecting spirit is a _Serpent_, the totem of their father CAN.Another Egyptian divinity, _Apap_ or _Apop_, is represented under the
form of a gigantic serpent covered with wounds.Plutarch in his
treatise, _De Iside et Osiride_, tells us that he was enemy to the sun.TYPHO was the brother of Osiris and Isis; for jealousy, and to usurp the
throne, he formed a conspiration and killed his brother.He is said to
represent in the Egyptian mythology, the sea, by some; by others, _the
sun_.AAK (turtle) was also the brother of Chaacmol and _Moo_.For jealousy,
and to usurp the throne, he killed his brother at treason with three
thrusts of his _spear_ in the back.Around the belt of his statue at
Uxmal used to be seen hanging the heads of his brothers CAY and
CHAACMOL, together with that of MOO; whilst his feet rested on their
flayed bodies.In the sculpture he is pictured surrounded by the _Sun_
as his protecting spirit.The escutcheon of Uxmal shows that he called
the place he governed the land of the Sun.In the bas-reliefs of the
Queen's chamber at Chichen his followers are seen to render homage to
the _Sun_; others, the friends of MOO, to the _Serpent_.So, in Mayab as
in Egypt, the _Sun_ and _Serpent_ were inimical.In Egypt again this
enmity was a myth, in Mayab a reality.AROERIS was the brother of Osiris, Isis and Typho.His business seems to
have been that of a peace-maker.CAY was also the brother of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_ and _Aac_.He was the high
pontiff, and sided with Chaacmol and Moo in their troubles, as we learn
from the mural paintings, from his head and flayed body serving as
trophy to Aac as I have just said.In June last, among the ruins of _Uxmal_, I discovered a magnificent
bust of this personage; and I believe I know the place where his remains
are concealed.NEPHTHIS was the sister of Isis, Osiris, Typho, and Aroeris, and the
wife of Typho; but being in love with Osiris she managed to be taken to
his embraces, and she became pregnant.That intrigue having been
discovered by Isis, she adopted the child that Nephthis, fearing the
anger of her husband, had hidden, brought him up as her own under the
name of Anubis.Nephthis was also called NIKE by some.NIC or NICTE was the sister of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_, _Aac_, and _Cay_, with
whose name I find always her name associated in the sculptures on the
monuments.Here the analogy between these personages would seem to
differ, still further study of the inscriptions may yet prove the
Egyptian version to contain some truth._Nic_ or _Nicte_[TN-33] means
flower; a cast of her face, with a flower sculptured on one cheek,
exists among my collections.We are told that three children were born to Isis and Osiris: Horus,
Macedo, and Harpocrates.Well, in the scene painted on the walls of
Chaacmol's funeral chamber, in which the body of this warrior is
represented stretched on the ground, cut open under the ribs for the
extraction of the heart and visceras, he is seen surrounded by his wife,
his sister NIC, his mother _Zo[c]_, and four children.I will close these similes by mentioning that _Thoth_ was reputed the
preceptor of Isis; and said to be the inventor of letters, of the art of
reckoning, geometry, astronomy, and is represented in the hieroglyphs
under the form of a baboon (cynocephalus).He is one of the most ancient
divinities among the Egyptians.He had also the office of scribe in the
lower regions, where he was engaged in noting down the actions of the
dead, and presenting or reading them to Osiris.One of the modes of
writing his name in hieroglyphs, transcribed in our common letters,
reads _Nukta_; a word most appropriate and suggestive of his attributes,
since, according to the Maya language, it would signify to understand,
to perceive, _Nuctah_: while his name Thoth, maya[TN-34] _thot_ means to
scatter flowers; hence knowledge.In the temple of death at Uxmal, at
the foot of the grand staircase that led to the sanctuary, at the top of
which I found a sacrificial altar, there were six cynocephali in a
sitting posture, as Thoth is represented by the Egyptians.They were
placed three in a row each side of the stairs.Between them was a
platform where a skeleton, in a kneeling posture, used to be.To-day the
cynocephali have been removed.They are in one of the yard[TN-35] of the
principal house at the Hacienda of Uxmal.The statue representing the
kneeling skeleton lays, much defaced, where it stood when that ancient
city was in its glory.In the mural paintings at Chichen-Itza, we again find the baboon
(Cynocephalus) warning Moo of impending danger.She is pictured in her
home, which is situated in the midst of a garden, and over which is seen
the royal insignia.A basket, painted blue, full of bright oranges, is
symbolical of her domestic happiness.Before
her is an individual pictured physically deformed, to show the ugliness
of his character and by the flatness of his skull, want of moral
qualities, (the[TN-36] proving that the learned men of Mayab understood
phrenology).He is in an persuasive attitude; for he has come to try to
seduce her in the name of another.She rejects his offer: and, with her
extended hand, protects the armadillo, on whose shell the high priest
read her destiny when yet a child.In a tree, just above the head of the
man, is an ape.His hand is open and outstretched, both in a warning and
threatening position.A serpent (_can_), her protecting spirit, is seen
at a short distance coiled, ready to spring in her defense.Near by is
another serpent, entwined round the trunk of a tree.He has wounded
about the head another animal, that, with its mouth open, its tongue
protruding, looks at its enemy over its shoulder.Blood is seen oozing
from its tongue and face.This picture forcibly recalls to the mind the
myth of the garden of Eden.For here we have the garden, the fruit, the
woman, the tempter.As to the charmed _leopard_ skin worn by the African warriors to render
them invulnerable to spears, it would seem as if the manner in which
Chaacmol met his death, by being stabbed with a spear, had been known
to their ancestors; and that they, in their superstitious fancies, had
imagined that by wearing his totem, it would save them from being
wounded with the same kind of weapon used in killing him.Let us not
laugh at such a singular conceit among uncivilized tribes, for it still
prevails in Europe.On many of the French and German soldiers, killed
during the last German war, were found talismans composed of strips of
paper, parchment or cloth, on which were written supposed cabalistic
words or the name of some saint, that the wearer firmly believed to be
possessed of the power of making him invulnerable.I am acquainted with many people--and not ignorant--who believe that by
wearing on their persons rosaries, made in Jerusalem and blessed by the
Pope, they enjoy immunity from thunderbolts, plagues, epidemics and
other misfortunes to which human flesh is heir.That the Mayas were a race autochthon on this western continent and did
not receive their civilization from Asia or Africa, seems a rational
conclusion, to be deduced from the foregoing FACTS.If we had nothing
but their _name_ to prove it, it should be sufficient, since its
etymology is only to be found in the American Maya language.They cannot be said to have been natives of Hindostan; since we are told
that, in very remote ages, _Maya_, a prince of the Davanas, established
himself there.We do not find the etymology of his name in any book
where mention is made of it.We are merely told that he was a wise
magician, a great architect, a learned astronomer, a powerful Asoura
(demon), thirsting for battles and bloodshed: or, according to the
Sanscrit, a Goddess, the mother of all beings that exist--gods and men.Very little is known of the Mayas of Afghanistan, except that they call
themselves _Mayas_, and that the names of their tribes and cities are
words belonging to the American Maya language.Who can give the etymology of the name _Magi_, the learned men amongst
the Chaldees.We only know that its meaning is the same as _Maya_ in
Hindostan: magician, astronomer, learned man.If we come to Greece,
where we find again the name _Maia_, it is mentioned as that of a
goddess, as in Hindostan, the mother of the gods: only we are told that
she was the daughter of Atlantis--born of Atlantis.But if we come to
the lands beyond the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then we find a
country called MAYAB, on account of the porosity of its soil; that, as a
sieve (_Mayab_), absorbs the water in an incredibly short time.Its
inhabitants took its name from that of the country, and called
themselves _Mayas_.It is a fact worthy of notice, that in their
hieroglyphic writings the sign employed by the Egyptians to signify a
_Lord_, a _Master_, was the image of a sieve.Would not this seem to
indicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants
of the valley of the Nile, and became the lords and masters of the land,
were people from MAYAB; particularly if we consider that the usual
character used to write the name of Egypt was the sieve, together with
the sign of land?We know that the _Mayas_ deified and paid divine honors to their eminent
men and women after their death.This worship of their heroes they
undoubtedly carried, with other customs, to the countries where they
emigrated; and, in due course of time, established it among their
inhabitants, who came to forget that MAYAB was a locality, converted it
in to a personalty: and as some of their gods came from it, Maya was
considered as the _Mother of the Gods_, as we see in Hindostan and
Greece.It would seem probable that the Mayas did not receive their civilization
from the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas, for the religious lores
and customs they have in common are too few to justify this assertion.They would simply tend to prove that relations had existed between them
at some epoch or other; and had interchanged some of their habits and
beliefs as it happens, between the civilized nations of our days.This
appears to be the true side of the question; for in the figures
sculptured on the obelisks of Copan the Asiatic type is plainly
discernible; whilst the features of the statues that adorn the
celebrated temples of Hindostan are, beyond all doubts, American.The FACTS gathered from the monuments do not sustain the theory advanced
by many, that the inhabitants of tropical America received their
civilization from Egypt and Asia Minor.It is true that
I have shown that many of the customs and attainments of the Egyptians
were identical to those of the Mayas; but these had many religious rites
and habits unknown to the Egyptians; who, as we know, always pointed
towards the West as the birthplaces of their ancestors, and worshiped as
gods and goddesses personages who had lived, and whose remains are still
in MAYAB.Besides, the monuments themselves prove the respective
antiquity of the two nations.According to the best authorities the most ancient monuments raised by
the Egyptians do not date further back than about 2,500 years B. C.
Well, in Ake, a city about twenty-five miles from Merida, there exists
still a monument sustaining thirty-six columns of _katuns_.Each of
these columns indicate a lapse of one hundred and sixty years in the
life of the nation.They then would show that 5,760 years has intervened
between the time when the first stone was placed on the east corner of
the uppermost of the three immense superposed platforms that compose the
structure, and the placing of the last capping stone on the top of the
thirty-sixth column.How long did that event occur before the Spanish
conquest it is impossible to surmise.Supposing, however, it did take
place at that time; this would give us a lapse of at least 6,100 years
since, among the rejoicings of the people this sacred monument being
finished, the first stone that was to serve as record of the age of the
nation, was laid by the high priest, where we see it to-day.I will
remark that the name AKE is one of the Egyptians' divinities, the third
person of the triad of Esneh; always represented as a child, holding his
finger to his mouth.To-day the meaning of the
word is lost in Yucatan.Cogolludo, in his history of Yucatan, speaking of the manner in which
they computed time, says:

"They counted their ages and eras, which they inscribed in their books
every twenty years, in lustrums of four years.* * * When five of these
lustrums were completed, they called the lapse of twenty years _katun_,
which means to place a stone down upon another.* * * In certain sacred
buildings and in the houses of the priests every twenty years they place
a hewn stone upon those already there.When seven of these stones have
thus been piled one over the other began the _Ahau katun_.Then after
the first lustrum of four years they placed a small stone on the top of
the big one, commencing at the east corner; then after four years more
they placed another small stone on the west corner; then the next at the
north; and the fourth at the south.At the end of the twenty years they
put a big stone on the top of the small ones: and the column, thus
finished, indicated a lapse of one hundred and sixty years."There are other methods for determining the approximate age of the
monuments of Mayab:

1st.By means of their actual orientation; starting from the _fact_ that
their builders always placed either the faces or angles of the edifices
fronting the cardinal points.By determining the epoch when the mastodon became extinct.For,
since _Can_ or his ancestors adopted the head of that animal as symbol
of deity, it is evident they must have known it; hence, must have been
contemporary with it.By determining when, through some great cataclysm, the lands became
separated, and all communications between the inhabitants of _Mayab_ and
their colonies were consequently interrupted.If we are to credit what
Psenophis and Sonchis, priests of Heliopolis and Sais, said to Solon
"that nine thousand years before, the visit to them of the Athenian
legislator, in consequence of great earthquakes and inundations, the
lands of the West disappeared in one day and a fatal night," then we may
be able to form an idea of the antiquity of the ruined cities of America
and their builders.Reader, I have brought before you, without comments, some of the FACTS,
that after ten years of research, the paintings on the walls of
_Chaacmol's_ funeral chamber, the sculptured inscriptions carved on the
stones of the crumbling monuments of Yucatan, and a comparative study of
the vernacular of the aborigines of that country, have revealed to us.Many years of further patient investigations,
the full interpretation of the monumental inscriptions, and, above all,
the possession of the libraries of the learned men of _Mayab_, are the
_sine qua non_ to form an uncontrovertible one, free from the
speculations which invalidate all books published on the subject
heretofore.If by reading these pages you have learned something new, your time has
not been lost; nor mine in writing them.Transcriber's Note

territory was not favourably received by the Colonial Office in London,
and no sooner was it pronounced visionary than he suggested another more
feasible.Bechuanaland was then ruled by a mighty native chief, Lobengula, whose
vast armies roved over the country and prevented white travellers and
prospectors from crossing the bounds of his territory.In the minds of
the white people of South Africa, Bechuanaland figured as a veritable
Golconda--a land where precious stones and minerals could be secured
without any attendant labour, where the soil was so rich as to yield
four bounteous harvests every year.Rhodes determined to break the barriers which excluded white men
from the native chief's domain, and sent three agents to treat with
Lobengula.The agents made many valuable presents to the old chief, and
in 1888, after much engineering, secured from him an exclusive
concession to search for and extract minerals in Bechuanaland.The
payment for the concession included five hundred dollars a month, a
thousand rifles and ammunition, and a small gunboat on the Zambezi.Rhodes discovered the real value of the concession, he and a
number of his friends formed the British South Africa Company, popularly
known as the Chartered Company, and received a charter from the British
Government, which gave to them the exclusive right of governing,
developing, and trading in Lobengula's country.Several years afterward
the white man's government became irksome to Lobengula and his tribes,
as well as to the Mashonas, who occupied the immense territory adjoining
Bechuanaland on the east, and all rebelled.The result was not unlike
those of native rebellions in other countries.The natives were shot
down by trained English soldiers, their country was taken from them, and
those who escaped death or captivity were compelled to fly for safety to
the new countries of the north.The British South Africa Company in 1895 practically became the sole
owner of Rhodesia, the great territory taken from Lobengula and the
Mashonas; and Mr.Rhodes, having realized part of his dream, began
casting about for other opportunities whereby he might extend the
empire.Rhodes was then in the zenith of his glory.He was many times a
millionaire, the head of one of the greatest capitalistic enterprises in
the world, the director of the affairs of a dominion occupying one tenth
of a continent, and the Premier of Cape Colony.His power was almost
absolute over a territory that stretches from the Cape of Good Hope into
Central Africa, and then eastward to within a few miles of the Indian
Ocean.He had armies under his command, and two governments were at his
beck and call.He looked again at the map of Africa,
already greatly changed since he placed his hand over it in the
Kimberley shop, but the dream was not realized.He saw the Transvaal
and the Orange Free State flags still occupying the positions he had
marked for the British emblem, and he plotted for their acquisition.The strife between the Boers and the Uitlanders in the Transvaal was
then at its height, and Mr.Rhodes recognised the opportunity for the
intervention of England that it afforded.Rhodes did not consider it
of sufficient importance to inquire concerning the justice of the
Uitlanders' claims, nor did he express any sympathy for their cause.In
fact, if anything, he felt that if the Uitlanders were unjustly treated
by the Boers their remedy was simple.Once he blandly told a complaining
Uitlander that no Chinese wall surrounded the Transvaal, and that to
escape from the alleged injustice was comparatively easy.Rhodes the end was sufficient excuse for the means, and, if the
acquisition of the two republics carried with it the loss of his Boer
friends, he was willing to accept the situation.The fall of the
Transvaal Republic carried with it the subsequent fall of the Orange
Free State, and, in order that he might strike at the head, he
determined to commence his campaign of exterminating republics by first
attacking the Transvaal.Whether he had the promise of assistance from the Colonial Office in
London is a subject upon which even the principals differ.Rhodes
felt that his power in the country was great enough to make the attack
upon the Transvaal without assistance from the home Government, and the
plot of the Jameson raid was formed.He retired to Groote Schuur, his home at Cape Town, and awaited the
fruition of the plans he had so carefully made and explained.His
lieutenants might have been overhasty, or perhaps the Uitlanders in
Johannesburg might have feared the Boer guns too much; whatever the
reason, the plans miscarried, and Mr.Rhodes experienced the first and
greatest reverse in his brilliant public career.The dream which appeared so near realization one day was dissolved the
next, and with it the reputation of the dreamer.He was obliged to
resign the premiership of Cape Colony, many of his best and oldest
supporters in England deserted him, and he lost the respect and esteem
of the Dutch inhabitants of South Africa, who had always been among his
stanchest allies.The heroic Rhodes, the idol of Cape Colony, found
himself the object of attack and ridicule of the majority of the voters
of the colony.The parliamentary inquiry acquitted him of all
complicity in the Jameson raid, it is true, but the Dutch people of
South Africa never have and never will.The Jameson raid was a mere incident in Mr.Rhodes's career; he would
probably call it an accident.Having failed to overthrow the Transvaal
Republic by means of an armed revolution, he attempted to accomplish the
same object by means of a commercial revolution.Rhodesia, the new
country which had a short time previously been taken from the Matabeles
and the Mashonas, was proclaimed by Mr.Rhodes to be a paradise for
settlers and an Ophir for prospectors.He personally conducted the
campaign to rob the Transvaal of its inhabitants and its commerce; but
the golden promises, the magnificent farms, the Solomon's mines, the new
railways, and the new telegraph lines all failed to attract the coveted
prizes to the land which, after all, was found to be void of real merit
except as a hunting ground where the so-called British poor-house, the
army, might pot <DW64>s.Rhodes spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in developing the
country which bears his name, and the British South Africa Company added
thousands more, but the hand which was wont to turn into gold all that
it touched had lost its cunning.Rhodes's perplexities,
the natives who had been conquered by Dr.Jameson learned that their
conqueror had been taken prisoner by the Boers, and rose in another
rebellion against English authority.Rhodes and one of his sisters
journeyed alone into the enemy's stronghold and made terms with
Lobengula, whereby the revolution was practically ended.After the Rhodesian country had been pacified, and he had placed the
routine work of the campaign to secure settlers for the country in the
hands of his lieutenants, Mr.Rhodes bent all his energies toward the
completion of the transcontinental railway and telegraph lines which had
been started under his auspices several years before, but had been
allowed to lag on account of the pressure of weightier matters.The
Cape Town to Cairo railroad and telegraph are undertakings of such vast
proportions and importance that Mr.Rhodes's fame might easily have been
secured through them alone had he never been heard of in connection with
other great enterprises.He himself originated the plans by which the Mediterranean and Table Bay
will eventually be united by bands of steel and strands of copper, and
it is through his own personal efforts that the English financiers are
being induced to subscribe the money with which his plans are being
carried out.The marvellous faith which the English people have in Mr.Rhodes has been illustrated on several occasions when he was called to
London to meet storms of protests from shareholders, who feared that the
two great enterprises were gigantic fiascos.He has invariably returned
to South Africa with the renewed confidence of the timid ones and many
millions of additional capital.Rhodes has tasted of the power which is absolute, and he will brook
no earthly interference with his plans.The natives may destroy
hundreds of miles of the telegraph lines, as they have done on several
occasions.He teaches them a lesson by means of the quick-firing gun,
and rebuilds the line.White men may fear the deadly fever of Central
Africa, but princely salaries and life-insurance policies for a host of
relatives will always attract men to take the risk.Shareholders may
rebel at the expenditures, but Mr.Rhodes will indicate to them that
their other properties will be ruined if they withdraw their support
from the railway and telegraph.A strip of territory belonging to another nation may be an impediment to
the line, but an interview with the Emperor of Germany or the King of
Portugal will be all-sufficient for the accomplishment of Mr.Providence may swerve him in his purpose many times, but
nations and individuals rarely.Rhodes is the most remarkable
Englishman that ever figured in the history of the African continent.Some will go further and declare that he has done more for the British
Empire than any one man in history.No two South Africans will agree on
the methods by which Mr.Rhodes attained his position in the affairs of
the country.Some say that he owes his success to his great wealth;
others declare that his personal magnetism is responsible for all that
he ever attained.His enemies intimate that political chicanery is the
foundation of his progress, while his friends resent the intimation and
laud his sterling honesty as the basis of his successful career.No one has ever accused him of being the fortunate victim of
circumstances which carried him to the pre-eminent rank he occupies
among Englishmen, although such an opinion might readily be formed from
a personal study of the man.South Africa is the indolent man's
paradise, and of that garden of physical inactivity Mr.Rhodes, by
virtue of his pre-eminent qualifications, is king."Almost as lazy as
Rhodes" is a South Africanism that has caused lifelong enmities and
rivers of blood.He takes pride in his indolence, and declares that the man who performs
more labour than his physical needs demand is a fool.He says he never
makes a long speech because he is too lazy to expend the energy
necessary for its delivery.He declines to walk more than an eighth of
a mile unless it is impossible to secure a vehicle or native
hammock-bearers to convey him, and then he proceeds so slowly that his
progress is almost imperceptible.His indolence may be the result of
the same line of reasoning as that indulged in by the cautious man who
carries an umbrella when the sun shines, in which case every one who has
travelled in the tropics will agree that Mr.The only exercise he indulges in is an hour's canter on horseback in the
early morning, before the generous rays of the African sun appear.Notwithstanding his antipathy to physical exertion, Mr.Rhodes is a
great traveller, and is constantly moving from one place to another.One week may find him at Groote Schuur, his Cape Town residence, while
the following week he may be planning a new farm in far-away
Mashonaland.The third week may have him in the Portuguese possessions
on the east coast, and at the end of the month he may be back in Cape
Town, prepared for a voyage to England and a fortnight's stay in Paris.He will charter a bullock team or a steamship with like disregard of
expense in order that he may reach his destination at a specified time,
and in like manner he will be watchful of his comfort by causing houses
to be built in unfrequented territory which he may wish to investigate.So wealthy that he could almost double his fortune in the time it would
require to count it, Mr.Rhodes is a firm believer in the doctrine that
money was created for the purpose of being spent, and never hesitates to
put it into practice.He does not assist beggars, nor does he squander
sixpence in a year, but he will pay the expenses of a trip to Europe for
a man whom he wishes to reconcile, and will donate the value of a
thousand-acre farm to a tribe of natives which has pleased him by its
actions.His generosity is best illustrated by a story told by one of his most
intimate friends in Kimberley.Several years before Barney Barnato's
death, that not-too-honest speculator induced almost all of the
employees of the diamond mines to invest their savings in the stock of
the Pleiades gold mine in Johannesburg, which Barnato and his friends
were attempting to manipulate.The attempt was unsuccessful, and the
diamond miners lost all the money they had invested.Rhodes heard
of Barnato's deceit, and asked him to refund the money, but was laughed
at.Rhodes learned the total amount of the losses--about
twenty-five thousand dollars--and paid the money out of his own pocket.Although he has more financial patronage at his command than almost any
banking house in existence, Mr.Rhodes rarely has sufficient money in
his purse to buy lunch.His valet, a half-breed Malay named Tony, is
his banker, and from him he is continually borrowing money.It is
related that on a voyage to England he offered to make a wager of money,
but found that he had nothing less valuable than a handful of loose
rough diamonds in his trousers pocket.Rhodes is an eloquently silent man.He talks little, but his paucity
of words is no criterion of their weight.He can condense a chapter
into a word, and a book into a sentence.The man whose hobby is to run
an empire is almost as silent as the Sphinx in the land toward which
that empire is being elongated."I
want a railroad here," or "We want this mine," or "We must have this
strip of land," are common examples of his style of speech and the
expression of his dominant spirit.He has the faculty of leading people to believe that they want the exact
opposite of what they really want, and he does it in such a polished
manner that they give their consent before they realize what he has
asked them.His personal charm, which in itself is almost irresistible,
is fortified with a straight-forward, breezy heartiness, that carries
with it respect, admiration, confidence, and, finally, conviction.He
has argued and treated with persons ranging in intelligence and station
from a native chief to the most learned diplomats and rulers in the
world, and his experience has taught him that argument will win any
case.Lobengula called him "the brother who eats a whole country for his
dinner."To this title might be added "the debater who swallows up the
opposition in one breath."Rhodes never asks exactly what he wants.He will ask the shareholders of a company for ten million, when he
really needs only five million, but in that manner he is almost certain
of satisfying his needs.In the same way when he pleads with an
opponent he makes the demands so great that he can afford to yield half
and still attain his object.Rhodes demanded the
appointment of Prime Minister of the Colony, but he was satisfied with
the Commissionership of Crown Lands and Works, the real object of his
aim.Rhodes had cast his lines in America instead of South Africa, he
would be called a political boss.He would be the dominant factor of
one of the parties, and he would be able to secure delegates with as
much ease as he does in Cape Colony, where the population is less mixed
than in our country.His political lieutenants act with the same vigour
and on the same general lines as those in our country, and if a close
examination of their work could be made, many political tricks that the
American campaigner never heard of would probably be disclosed.One of the mildest accusations against him is that he paid fifty
thousand dollars for the support that first secured for him a seat in
the Cape Colony Parliament, but he has never considered it worth the
time to deny the report.His political success depends in no little
measure upon his personal acquaintanceship with the small men of his
party, and his method of treating them with as much consideration and
respect as those who have greater influence.He is in constant
communication with the leaders of the rural communities, and misses no
opportunity to show his appreciation of their support.Rhodes may
be kingly when he is among kings, but he is also a farmer among farmers,
and among the Cape Dutch and Boers such a metamorphosis is the necessary
stepping-stone to the hearts and votes of that numerous people.Rhodes among a party of farmers or transport
riders each one of whom has better clothing than the multimillionaire.Rhodes wore a hat which was so
shabby that it became the subject of newspaper importance.When he is in
Rhodesia he dons the oldest suit of clothing in his wardrobe, and
follows the habits of the pioneers who are settling the country.He
sleeps in a native kraal when he is not near a town, and eats of the
same canned beef and crackers that his Chartered Company serves to its
mounted police.When he is in that primeval country he despises
ostentation and displays in his honour, and will travel fifty miles on
horseback in an opposite direction in order to avoid a formal proceeding
of any nature.Two years ago, when the railroad to Buluwayo, the
capital of Rhodesia, was formally opened, Mr.Rhodes telegraphed his
regrets, and intimated that he was ill.As a matter of fact he
travelled night and day in order to escape to a place where telegrams
and messages could not reach him.When his host suggested that he was
missing many entertainments and the society of the most distinguished
men of South Africa, Mr.Rhodes smiled and said: "For that reason I
escaped."Formality bores him, and he would rather live a month coatless and
collarless in a native kraal with an old colony story-teller than spend
half an hour at a state dinner in the governor's mansion.It is related
in this connection that Mr.Rhodes was one of a distinguished party who
attended the opening of a railroad extension near Cape Town.While the
speeches were being made, and the chairman was trying to find him, Mr.Rhodes slipped quietly away, and was discovered discarding his clothing
preparatory to enjoying a bath in a near-by creek.Rhodes is unmarried, and throughout the country has the reputation
of being an avowed hater of women.He believes that a woman is an
impediment to a man's existence until he has attained the object and aim
of his life, and has become deserving of luxuries.He not only believes
in that himself, but takes advantage of every opportunity to impress the
belief upon the minds of those around him.In the summer of 1897 a
captain in the volunteer army, and one of his most faithful lieutenants
in Mashonaland, asked Mr.Rhodes for a three months' leave of absence to
go to Cape Colony.The captain had been through many native campaigns,
and richly deserved a vacation, although that was not the real object of
his request for leave.The man wanted to go to Cape Colony to marry,
and by severe cross-examination Mr.Rhodes learned that such was the
case."I can not let you go to Cape Colony; I want you to start for London
to-morrow.I'll cable instructions when you arrive there," said Mr.Rhodes, and the wedding was postponed.When the captain reached London,
a cablegram from Mr.Rhodes said simply, "Study London for three
months."Nowhere in South Africa is there anything more interesting than Groote
Schuur, the country residence of Mr.Rhodes, at Rondebosch, a suburb of
Cape Town.He has found time amid his momentous public duties to make
his estate the most magnificent on the continent of Africa.Besides a
mansion which is a relic of the first settlers of the peninsula, and now
a palace worthy of a king's occupancy, there is an estate which consists
of hundreds of acres of land overlooking both the Atlantic and Indian
Oceans, and under the walls of Table Mountain, the curio of a country.In addition to this, there are a zooelogical collection, which comprises
almost every specimen of African fauna that will thrive in captivity,
and hundreds of flowering trees and plants brought from great distances
to enrich the beauty of the landscape.The estate, which comprises almost twelve hundred acres, is situated
about five miles to the north of Cape Town, on the narrowest part of the
peninsula, through which the waters of the two oceans seem ever anxious
to rush and clasp hands.It lies along the northwestern base of Table
Mountain, and stretches down toward the waters of Table Bay and
northward toward the death-dealing desert known as the Great Karroo.From one of the shady streets winding toward Cape Town there stretches a
fine avenue of lofty pines and oaks to the mansion of Groote Schuur,
which, as its name indicates, was originally a granary, where two
hundred years ago the Dutch colonizers hoarded their stores of grain and
guarded them against the attacks of thieving natives.Although many changes have been made in the structure since it was
secured by Mr.Rhodes, it still preserves the quaint architectural
characteristics of Holland.The scrolled gables, moulded chimney pots,
and wide verandas, or "stoeps," are none the less indicative of the
tendencies of the old settlers than the Dutch cabinets, bureaus, and
other household furniture that still remains in the mansion from those
early days.The entire estate breathes of the old Dutch era.Everything has the
ancient setting, although not at the expense of modern convenience.While the buildings and grounds are arranged in the picturesque style of
Holland, the furnishings and comforts are the most modern that the
countries of Europe afford.The library contains, besides such classics
as a graduate of Oxford would have, one of the largest collections of
books and manuscripts bearing on Africa in existence.In the same room
is a museum of souvenirs connected with Mr.Rhodes's work of extending
English empire toward the heart of the continent.There are flags
captured in wars with the Portuguese, Union Jacks riddled with shot and
cut by assegai, and hundreds of curiosities gathered in Rhodesia after
the conquest of the natives.In this building have gathered for
conference the men who laid the foundations for all the great
enterprises of South Africa.There the Jameson raid was planned, it is
said, and there, the Boers say, the directors of the British South
Africa Chartered Company were drinking champagne while the forces of Dr.Jameson were engaged in mortal combat with those of Kruger near
Johannesburg.Surrounding the mansion are most beautiful gardens, such as can be found
only in semi-tropical climates.In the foreground of the view from the
back part of the house is a Dutch garden, rising in three terraces from
the marble-paved courtyard to a grassy knoll, fringed with tall pines,
and dotted here and there with graves of former dwellers at Groote
Schuur.Behind the pine fringe, but only at intervals obscured by it, is
the background of the picture--the bush-clad <DW72>s of Table Mountain
and the Devil's Peak, near enough for every detail of their strange
formations and innumerable attractions to be observed.Art and Nature
have joined hands everywhere to make lovely landscapes, in which the
colour effects are produced by hydrangeas, azaleas, and scores of other
flowers, growing in the utmost profusion.Besides the mimosa, palms,
firs, and other tropical trees that add beauty to the grounds, there is
a low tree which is found nowhere else on earth.Its leaves are like
the purest silver, and form a charming contrast to the deep green of the
firs and the vivid brightness of the flowers that are everywhere around.Undoubtedly, however, the most interesting feature of the estate is the
natural zooelogical garden.It is quite unique to have in this immense
park, with drives six miles in length and ornamentations brought
thousands of miles, wild animals of every variety wandering about with
as much freedom as if they were in their native haunts.In this
collection are represented every kind of African deer and antelope.Zebra, kangaroo, giraffe, emu, pheasant, and ostrich seem to be
perfectly contented with their adopted home, and have become so tame
that the presence of human beings has no terrors for them.Rhodes several million dollars to bring
to its present condition, sees but little of the former Premier of Cape
Colony.His vast enterprises in the diamond fields of Kimberley and in
the new country which bears his name require so much of his time that he
but seldom visits it.But his inability to enjoy the product of his
brain and labour does not cause the estate to be unappreciated, for he
has thrown this unique and charming pleasure resort open to the public,
and by them it is regarded as a national possession.CHAPTER VIII

                THE BOER GOVERNMENT--CIVIL AND MILITARY


The Constitution, or Grondwet, of the South African Republic is a
modified counterpart of that of the United States.It differs in some
salient features, but in its entirety it has the same general foundation
and the same objects.The executive head of the Government is the
President, who is elected for a term of five years.He directs the
policy of the Government, suggests the trend of the laws, and oversees
the conduct of the Executive Council, which constitutes the real
Government.The Executive Council consists of three heads of
departments and six unofficial members of the First Raad.These nine
officials are the authors of all laws, treaties, and policies that are
proposed to the Volksraads, which constitute the third part of the
Government.There are two Volksraads, one similar in purpose to our
Senate, and the other, the second Volksraad, not unlike our House of
Representatives, but with far less power.The first Volksraad consists of twenty-seven members elected from and by
the burghers, or voters, who were born in the country.A naturalized
burgher is ineligible to the upper House.The twenty-seven members of
the Second Raad are naturalized burghers, and are voted for only by men
who have received the franchise.The second House has control of the
management of the Government works, telephones, mails, and mines, and
has but little voice in the real government of the country.Its members
are undoubtedly more progressive and have more modern ideas than those
of the First Raad, and introduce many bills which would be of undoubted
benefit to the country, but the upper House invariably vetoes all bills
that reach them from that Raad.The First Raad receives bills and
suggestions from the Executive Council or from the President himself,
but refers them to a commission for investigation before any action is
taken upon them.The evidence in support of proposed measures does not
reach the Raad, which only concerns itself with the report of the
commission.The Raad can, by motion, make a suggestion to the Executive
Council that a certain measure should be formulated, but the Executive
Council and the President have the authority to ignore the suggestion,
leaving the First Raad without a vestige of authority.The upper House
concerns itself chiefly with the questions of finance, changes in the
Constitution, and the care of the natives.As the question of finance
is so closely connected with almost every subject that comes before the
Government, it follows that the First Raad concerns itself with
practically the entire business of the Government.The popular
conception is that the Second Raad, being composed of naturalized
citizens, takes less interest in the affairs of the country, and can
therefore be less safely trusted with their conduct than the old
burghers and Voortrekkers of the upper House, who would rather declare
war against a foreign power than pass a law in the least unfavourable to
their own country's interests.In consequence of the Second Raad's
infinitesimal powers, almost the entire law-making power of the
Government is vested in the Executive Council and the First Raad.The
First Raad of the Transvaal Republic is the direct successor of the
democratic form of government that was established by the Voortrekkers
of 1835 when they were journeying from Cape Colony to the northern
lands.The Second Raad was established in 1890, in order that the
Uitlanders might have representation in the government of the country.It was believed that the newly arrived population would take advantage
of the opportunities thus offered to take part in the legislation of the
republic, and in that way bridge over the gulf which had been formed
between the two races.The Uitlanders cared little for the privilege
offered to them, and so far in the history of the Second Raad less than
half a score of its members have been elected by the new population.The annual sessions of the Volksraads commence on the first Monday in
May, and continue until all the business of the republic has been
transacted.The members of the two Houses receive fifteen dollars a
day, and seventy-five cents an hour for services extending over more
than the five hours a day required by the law.The chairmen, or
voorzitters, of the Raads receive seventeen dollars and fifty cents a
day, and one dollar an hour for extra time.Mary travelled to the kitchen.The sessions of the Raad are held in the new million-dollar Government
House in the central part of the town of Pretoria, and are open to the
public except when executive business is being transacted.The Raad
chambers are exquisitely fitted out with rich furniture and tapestries,
the windows are of costly stained glass, and the walls lavishly
decorated with carved wood and fine paintings of the country's notable
men.On a lofty elevation facing the entrance to the First Raad chamber
is a heavily carved mahogany desk, behind which is seated the chairman.On his right is a seat for the President, while on the right side of
that are the nine chairs for the Executive Council.Directly in front
and beneath the chairman's desk are the desks of the three official
secretaries, and in front of these, in semicircular form, the two rows
of seats and desks of the Raad members.In the rear of the chamber on
either side of the entrance are chairs for visitors, while high in the
left side of the lofty chamber is a small balcony for the newspaper men.All the members of the Raad are obliged by law to wear black clothing
and white neckties.This law was framed to prevent some of the rural
members from appearing in their burgher costumes, and has had the effect
of making of the Boer Raads a most sombre-looking body of lawmakers.Almost all members wear long frock-coats, silk hats, and heavy black
boots, and when, during the recesses, they appear on the piazza of the
Government Building with huge pipes in their mouths, the wisdom of the
black-clothing law is not apparent.There is little formality in the
proceedings of the Raads.Certain rules are necessarily followed, but
the members attack a bill in much the same vehement manner as they would
a lion or a panther.There is little eloquence in the taal, or dialect,
that is spoken in the Raads, and the similes and metaphors bespeak the
open veldt and the transport path rather than the council chamber of a
nation.The black-garbed legislators make no pretensions to dignified procedure,
and when a playful member trips another so that he falls to the floor,
or pelts him with paper balls, the whole Raad joins in laughter.The
gaudily dressed pages--one of them is sixty-five years old and wears a
long beard--are on terms of great familiarity with the members, and have
become mildly famous throughout the country on account of some practical
jokes they have perpetrated upon the members.It is only justice to say
that these light proceedings take place only when the President is not
present.When he arrives in the chamber every one rises and remains
standing until the President has seated himself.He generally takes a
deep interest in the subjects before the House, and not infrequently
speaks at length upon measures for which he desires a certain line of
action.Many of President Kruger's most important speeches have been
delivered to the Raads, and so great is his influence over the members
that his wishes are rarely disregarded.When he meets with opposition
to his views he quickly loses his temper, and upon one occasion called a
certain member who opposed him a traitor, and angrily left the chamber.A short time afterward he returned and apologized to the member and to
the Raad for having in his anger used unseemly language.One of the most disappointing scenes to be observed in Pretoria is the
horde of Uitlander politicians and speculators who are constantly
besieging the Raad members and the Government officials.At probably no
other national capital are the legislators tempted to such a great
extent as are the Boers, who, for the most part, are ignorant of the
ways of the world and unfamiliar with great amounts of money.Every
train from Johannesburg, the Uitlander capital, takes to Pretoria scores
of lobbyists, who use all their powers, both of persuasion and finance,
to influence the minds of the legislators, either in the way of granting
valuable concessions for small considerations or of securing the passage
of bills favourable to the lobbyists.It is no wonder that the
Uitlanders declare that less than one fourth of the Raad members are
unassailably honest and that all the others can be bribed.The Boer
alone is not blameworthy who, having never possessed more than one
hundred dollars at one time, yields to the constant importunities of the
lobbyist and sells his vote for several thousand dollars.Beset by such influences, the Raad members are naturally suspicious of
every bill that is brought before them for consideration.Their
deliberations are marked by a feeling of insecurity akin to that
displayed by the inhabitants of a sheep-pen surrounded by a pack of
hungry wolves.They fear to make a move in any direction lest their
motives be misunderstood, or they play into the hands of the Uitlanders.As a consequence of this external pressure, progress in the improvement
of the methods of governing the country has been slow.One of the
results of the Volksraad's fearfulness is the absence of local
governments throughout the republic.There are no municipalities,
counties, or townships which can formulate and execute local laws.Even
Johannesburg, a city of one hundred thousand population, has no
municipal government, although several attempts have been made to
establish one.The Raads are burdened with the necessity of attending to all the
details which govern the administration of every city, village, hamlet,
and district in the entire country, and the time consumed in doing all
this leaves little for the weightier affairs of state.If a five-dollar
road bridge is required in an out-of-the-way place in the northern part
of the republic, the Raad is obliged to discuss the matter.If an
application for a liquor license comes from a distant point in the
interior, the Raad is compelled to investigate its character before it
can be voted upon.The disadvantages of this system are so evident that
it is hardly conceivable that no remedy has been applied long ago, but
the fear of local mismanagement has prevented the Raad from ridding
itself of this encumbrance upon its time and patience.Every legislature of whatever country has its idiosyncracies, and the
Raad is no exception.Laws are upon the statute books of some of the
American States that are quite as remarkable as some of those made by
the Boer legislators.Bills quite as marvellous have been introduced
and defeated in the legislatures of all countries.The Boer Volksraad
has no monopoly of men with quaint ideas.The examples of Raad
workmanship here given are rare, but true nevertheless:

A man named Dums, whose big farm on the border became British territory
through a treaty, sued the Transvaal Government for damages, whereupon
the Raad passed a law that Dums could never sue the Government for
anything.The High Court sustained the law, and Dums is now a poor
cab-driver in Pretoria.Another man sued the Government for damages for
injuries resulting from a fall in the street.He was successful in his
suit, but the Raad immediately thereafter passed a law making it
impossible for any person to sue the Government for injuries received on
public property.During a severe drought in the Transvaal an American professional
rain-maker asked the Raad for a concession allowing him the exclusive
privilege to precipitate rain by means of explosives in the air.The
Raad had a long and animated discussion on the subject, owing to the
opposition of several of the less enlightened members, who declared that
the project was sacrilegious."It is a sin," they declared, "to poke
your fingers in the Lord's eye to make him weep."The abiding faith
which some of the Raad members have in divine guidance is illustrated by
a discussion that took place in the body shortly after the Jameson raid.One member declared that "the Lord will assist us in this matter if we
will only bide our time," whereupon another member rose and said, "If we
do not soon get down to business and do something without the Lord's
assistance, the Lord will take a holiday and let the Transvaal go to
hell."A law which was in effect for almost two years made it a
misdemeanour for any one to sing "God save the Queen" or "Rule
Britannia" in the country.Mass meetings are prohibited in the
Transvaal, but Germany and other countries with less political foment
have equally stringent regulations on the same subject, so the
Uitlanders' grievance on that account is nullified.Second to that of the Volksraad, the highest power in the Government of
the country is the High Court, which is composed of some of the ablest
jurists in South Africa.From a constitutional standpoint the High
Court has no right or power to review the acts of the Volksraad.The
Constitution of the country gives supreme power to the Volksraad in all
legislative matters, and when a chief justice of the High Court recently
attempted to extend his jurisdiction over the acts of the Volksraad that
body unceremoniously dismissed him.The purpose of that part of the
Constitution which relates to the subjugation of the High Court is to
prevent some influential enemy of the republic from debauching the High
Court and in that way defying the authority of the Volksraad.In a
country which has so many peculiar conditions and circumstances to
contend with, the safety of its institutions depends upon the
centralization of its legislative and administrative branches, and the
wisdom of the early burghers who framed the Constitution so that the
entire governing power lay in the hands of the country's real patriots
has been amply demonstrated upon several occasions.The civil and criminal laws of the country are administered throughout
the different political divisions by local magistrates, called
land-drosts, who also collect the revenues of the district and inform
the Volksraad of the needs of the people under their jurisdiction.The
land-drost is the prototype of the old-time American country squire, in
that he settles disputes, awards damages, and conducts official business
generally.In the majority of cases the land-drosts are aged persons
who have the respect and esteem of the members of the community in which
they dwell and to whom they bear the relation of fatherly advisers in
all things.In Johannesburg and Pretoria the land-drosts are men of
eminent station in the legal profession of South Africa, and are drawn
from all parts of the country, regardless of their political or racial
qualifications.All the court proceedings are conducted in the Dutch
language, and none but Dutch-speaking lawyers are admitted to practise
before the bar.The law of the land is Holland-Roman.The military branch of the Government is undoubtedly the best and most
effective because it is the simplest.It is almost primitive in its
simplicity, yet for effectiveness its superior is not easily found.The
Transvaal glories in its army, and, as every man between the ages of
sixteen and sixty is a nominal member of the army, nothing is left
undone to make it worthy of its glory.The standing army of the
republic numbers less than two hundred men, and these are not always
actively engaged.A detachment of about twenty soldiers is generally on
duty in the vicinity of the Government House at Pretoria, and the others
are stationed at the different forts throughout the republic.The real
army of the Transvaal, however, is composed of the volunteer soldiers,
who can be mobilized with remarkable facility.The head of the army is the commandant-general, who has his headquarters
in Pretoria.He is under the immediate jurisdiction of the Volksraad and
the President, who have the power to declare war and direct its conduct.Second in authority to the commandant-general are the commandants,
permanent officials who have charge of the military affairs of the
seventeen districts of the republic.Under the old South African
burgher law each commandant in any emergency "commandeers" a certain
portion of men from his district.The various districts are subdivided into divisions in charge of
field-cornets and assistant field-cornets.As soon as the
commandant-general issues an order for the mobilization of the volunteer
army the commandants and their assistants, the field-cornets, speedily
go from one house to another in their districts and summon the burghers
from their homes.When the burgher receives the call, he provides his
own gun, horse, and forage, and hastens to the district rendezvous,
where he places himself under the orders of the field-cornet.After all
the burghers of the district have gathered together, the body proceeds
into an adjoining district, where it joins the forces that have been
similarly mobilized there.As a certain number of districts are obliged
to join their forces at a defined locality, the forces of the republic
are consequently divided into different army divisions under the
supervisions of the commandants.In the event that Pretoria were threatened with attack, the order would
be given to move all the forces to that city.The districts on the
border would gather their men and march toward Pretoria, carrying with
them all the forces of the districts through which they were obliged to
pass.So simple and perfect is the system that within forty-eight hours
after the call is issued by the commandant-general four army divisions,
representing the districts in the four quarters of the republic and
consisting of all the able-bodied men in the country, can be mobilized
on the outskirts of Pretoria.It is doubtful whether there is another
nation on earth that can gather its entire fighting strength at its seat
of government in such a brief time.The Transvaal Boer is constantly prepared for the call to arms.He has
his own rifle and ammunition at his home, and when the call comes he
need only bridle his horse--if he is so fortunate as to possess an
animal so rare in the Transvaal--stuff several pounds of biltong, or
dried beef, in his pockets, and commence the march over the veldt to the
district rendezvous.He can depend upon his wife and children to care
for the flocks and herds; but if the impending danger appears to be
great, the cattle are deserted and the women and children are taken to a
rendezvous specially planned for such an emergency.If there is a need,
the Boer woman will stand side by side with her husband or her brother
or her sweetheart, and will allow no one to surpass her in repelling the
attacks of the enemy.Joan of Arcs have been as numerous in the Boer
armies as they have been unheralded.The head of the military branch of the Transvaal Government for many
years has been Commandant-General P. J. Joubert, who, following
President Kruger, is the ablest as well as the most popular Boer in
South Africa.General Joubert is the best type of the Boer fighter in
the country, and as he represents the army, he has always been a
favourite with the class which would rather decide a disputed point by
means of the rifle than by diplomacy, as practised by President Kruger.General Joubert, although the head of the army, is not of a quarrelsome
disposition, and he too believes in the peaceful arbitration of
differences rather than a resort to arms.By the Uitlanders he is
considered to be the most liberal Boer in the republic, and he has upon
numerous occasions shown that he would treat the newcomers in the
country with more leniency than the Kruger Government if he were in
power.In his capacity of Vice-President of the republic he has been as
impotent as the Vice-President is in the United States, but his
influence has always been wielded with a view of harmonizing the
differences of the native and alien populations.Twice the more liberal
and progressive party of the Boers has put him forward as a candidate
for the presidency in opposition to Mr.Kruger, and each time he has
been defeated by only a small majority.The younger Boers who have come
in touch with the more modern civilization have steadfastly supported
General Joubert, while the older Boers, who are ever fearful that any
one but Mr.Kruger would grant too many concessions to the Uitlanders,
have wielded their influence against him.Concerning the franchise for
Uitlanders, General Joubert is more liberal than President Kruger, who
holds that the stability of the Government depends upon the
exclusiveness of the franchise privilege.General Joubert believes that
there are many persons among the Uitlanders who have a real desire to
become citizens of the republic and to take part in the government.He
believes that an intending burgher should take an oath of fidelity, and
afterward be prepared to do what he can for the country, either in peace
or war.If after three or four years the applicant for the franchise
has shown that he worked in the interests of the country and obeyed its
laws, General Joubert believes that the Uitlander should enjoy all the
privileges that a native burgher enjoys--namely, voting for the
candidates for the presidency and the First Volksraad.General Joubert's name has been connected with Transvaal history almost
as long and as prominently as that of President Kruger.The two men are
virtually the fathers of the Boer republic.General Joubert has always
been the man who fought the battles with armies, while Mr.Kruger
conducted the diplomatic battles, and both were equally successful in
their parts.General Joubert, as a youth among the early trekkers from
Natal, was reared amid warfare.During the Transvaal's early battles
with the natives he was a volunteer soldier under the then
Commandant-General Kruger, and later, when the war of independence was
fought, he became General Joubert.He commanded the forces which fought
the battles of Laing's Nek, Bronkhorst Spruit, and Majuba Hill, and he
was one of the triumvirate that conducted the affairs of the Government
during that crucial time.He has been Vice-President of the republic
since the independence of the country has been re-established, and
conducted the affairs of the army during the time when Jameson's
troopers threatened the safety of the country.He has had a notable
career in the service of his country, and as a reward for his services
he is deserving of nothing less than the presidency of the republic
after Mr.Kruger's life-work is ended.General Joubert is no less distinguished as a diplomatist among his
countrymen than President Kruger, and many stories are current in
Pretoria showing that he has been able to accomplish many things wherein
Mr.An incident which occurred immediately after the
Jameson raid, and which is repeated here exactly as related by one of
the participants of the affair, is illustrative of General Joubert and
his methods of dealing with his own people.The story is given in
almost the exact language of the narrator who was the eyewitness:

"Shortly after Jameson and his officers were brought to Pretoria,
President Kruger called about twenty of the Boer commanders to his house
for a consultation.The townspeople were highly excited, and the
presence of the men who had tried to destroy the republic aggravated
their condition so that there were few calm minds in the capital.President Kruger was deeply affected by the seriousness of the events of
the days before, but counselled all those present to be calm.There
were some in the gathering who advised that Jameson and his men should
be shot immediately, while one man jocosely remarked that they should
not be treated so leniently, and suggested that a way to make them
suffer would be to cut off their ears."One of the men who was obliged to leave the meeting gave this account
to the waiting throngs in the street, and a few hours afterward the
cable had carried the news to Europe and America, with the result that
the Boers were called brutal and inhuman.President Kruger used all his
influence and eloquence to save the lives of the prisoners, and for a
long time he was unsuccessful in securing the smallest amount of
sympathy for Jameson and his men.It was dawn when General Joubert was
won to the President's way of thinking, and he continued the argument in
behalf of the prisoners."'My friends, I will ask you to listen patiently to me for several
minutes,' he commenced.'I will tell you the story of the farmer and
the neighbour's dog.Suppose that near your farm lives a man whose
valuable dogs attack your sheep and kill many.Will you shoot the dogs
as soon as you see them, and in that way make yourself liable for
damages greater than the value of the sheep that were destroyed?Or
will you catch the dogs when you are able to do so and, carrying them to
your neighbour, say to him: "I have caught your dogs; now pay me for the
damage they have done me, and they shall be returned to you."'"After a moment's silence General Joubert's face lighted up joyfully,
and he exclaimed:

"'We have the neighbour's dogs in the jail."The parable was effective, and the council of war decided almost
instantly to deliver the prisoners to the British Government."CHAPTER IX

                   CAUSES OF THE PRESENT DISSENSIONS


The politicians and the speculators have been the bane of South Africa.Ill-informed secretaries of the British Colonial Office might augment
the list, but their stupidity in treating with colonial grievances is so
proverbial as to admit them to the rank of natural or providential
causes of dissension.Until the Boer Government came into the
foreground, the politicians and speculators used South Africa as a huge
chessboard, whereon they could manipulate the political and commercial
affairs of hundreds of thousands of persons to suit their own fancies
and convenience.It was a dilettante politician who operated in South Africa and could
not make a cat's-paw of the colonial secretary in Downing Street, and it
was a stupid speculator who was unable to be the power behind the
enthroned politician.Hundreds of
men have gone to South Africa and have become millionaires, but
thousands remain in the country praying for money wherewith to return
home.The former are the politicians and the speculators; the latter
are the miners, the workingmen, and the tradespeople.It is a country where the man with a million becomes a multimillionaire,
and the man with hundreds becomes penniless.It is the wealthy man's
footstool and the poor man's cemetery.Men go there to acquire riches;
few go there to assist in making it tenable for white men.Thousands go
there with the avowed intention of making their fortunes and then to
return.Those who go there as came the immigrants to America--to settle
and develop the new country--can be counted only by the score.Of the
million white people south of the Zambezi, probably one half are mere
fortune-seekers, who would leave the country the very instant they
secured a moderate fortune.These have the welfare of the country at heart only in so far as it
interferes or assists them in attaining their desired goal.They would
ask that Portugal be allowed to rule all of South Africa if they
received the assurance that the much-sought-after fortune could be
secured six months sooner.They have no conscience other than that
which prevents them from stabbing a man to relieve him of his money.They go to the gold and diamond fields to secure wealth, and not to
assist in developing law and order, good government, or good
institutions.The other half of the white population is composed of men and women who
were born in the country--Afrikanders, Dutch, Boers, and other racial
representatives, and others who have emigrated thither from the densely
populated countries of Europe, with the intention of remaining in the
country and taking part in its government and institutions.These
classes comprise the South Africans, who love their country and take a
real interest in its development and progress.They know its needs and
prospects, and are abundantly able to conduct its government so that it
will benefit Boer, Englishman, Dutchman, Natalian, and native.The defects in the Government of Cape Colony and Natal are the natural
results of the handicaps that have been placed on the local legislation
by the Colonial Office in London, who are as ignorant of the real
conditions of their colonies as a Zulu chieftain is of the political
situation in England.The colonial papers teem with letters from
residents who express their indignation at the methods employed by the
Colonial Office in dealing with colonial affairs.Especially is this
the case in Natal, the Eden of South Africa, where the dealings of the
Colonial Office with regard to the Zulus have been stupidly carried on.South African men of affairs who are not bigoted do not hesitate to
express their opinion that Cape Colony and Natal have been retarded a
quarter of a century in their natural growth by the handicap of the
Colonial Office.Their opinion is based upon the fact that every war,
with the exception of several native outbreaks, has been caused by
blundering in the Colonial Office, and that all the wars have retarded
the natural growth and development of the colonies to an aggregate of
twenty-five years.In this estimate is not included the great harm to
industries that has been caused by the score or more of heavy war clouds
with which the country has been darkened during the last half century.These being some of the difficulties with which the two British colonies
in South Africa are beset, it can be readily inferred to what extent the
Boers of the Transvaal have had cause for grievance.In their dealings
with the Boers the British have invariably assumed the role of
aristocrats, and have looked upon and treated the "trekkers" as
_sans-culottes_.[Illustration: Cape Colony Government House, at Cape Town.]This natural antipathy of one race for another has given glorious
opportunities for strife, and neither one nor the other has ever failed
to take quick advantage.The struggle between the Boers and the British
began in Cape Colony almost one hundred years ago, and it has continued,
with varying degrees of bitterness, until the present day.The recent
disturbances in the Transvaal affairs date from the conclusion of the
war of independence in 1881.When the Peace Commissioners met there was
inserted in the treaty one small clause which gave to England her only
right to interfere in the political affairs of the Transvaal.The Boer country at that time was considered of such little worth that
Gladstone declared it was not of sufficient value to be honoured with a
place under the British flag.To the vast majority of the British
people it was a matter of indifference whether the Transvaal was an
independent country or a dependency of their own Government.The clause
which was allowed to enter the treaty unnoticed, and which during recent
years has figured so prominently in the discussions of South African
affairs, reads:

"The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engagement with
any state or nation other than the Orange Free State, nor with any
native tribe to the eastward or the westward of the republic, until the
same has been approved by her Majesty the Queen.Such approval shall be
considered to have been granted if her Majesty's Government shall not,
within six months after receiving a copy of such treaty (which shall be
delivered to them immediately upon its completion), have notified that
the conclusion of the treaty is in conflict with the interests of Great
Britain, or of any of her Majesty's possessions in South Africa."When the contents of the treaty were published to the Boer people, many
of them objected strongly to this clause, and insisted that it gave the
British too great power in the affairs of the republic, and a strenuous
effort was made to have the offending clause eliminated.In the year
1883 a deputation, which included Paul Kruger, was sent to London, with
a view of obtaining the abolition of the suzerainty.This deputation
negotiated a new convention the following year, from which the word
"suzerainty" and the stipulations in regard thereto were removed.In
their report to the Volksraad, made in 1884, the deputation stated that
the new convention put an end to the British suzerainty.February 4, 1884, in a letter to Lord Derby, then in charge of British
affairs, the deputation announced to him that they expected an agreement
to be contained in the treaty relative to the abolition of the
suzerainty.In his reply of a week later, Lord Derby made a statement
upon which the Boers base their strongest claim that the suzerainty was
abolished.He said:

"By the omission of those articles of the convention of Pretoria which
assigned to her Majesty and to the British resident certain specific
powers and functions connected with the internal government and the
foreign relations of the Transvaal state, your Government will be left
free to govern the country without interference, and to conduct its
diplomatic intercourse and shape its foreign policy, subject only to the
requirement embodied in the fourth article of the new draft, that any
treaty with a foreign state shall not have effect without the approval
of the Queen."For a period of almost ten years the suzerainty of England over the
Transvaal was an unknown quantity.With the exception of several
Government officials, there were hardly any Englishmen in the country,
and no one had the slightest interest in the affairs of the Transvaal
Government.When gold was discovered in the Randt in quantities that
equalled those of the early days of the California gold fields, an
unparalleled influx of Englishmen and foreigners followed, and in
several years the city of Johannesburg had sprung up in the veldt.The opening of hundreds of mines, and the consequent increase in
expenditures, made it necessary for the Transvaal Government to increase
its revenues.Mining laws had to be formulated, new offices had to be
created, hundreds of new officials had to be appointed, and all this
required the expenditure of more money in one year than the Government
had spent in a decade before the opening of the mines.The Government
found itself in a quandary, and it solved the problem of finances as
many a stronger and wealthier government has done.Concessions were granted to dynamite, railway, electric light, electric
railway, water, and many other companies, and these furnished to the
Government the nucleus upon which depended its financial existence.Few
of the concessions were obtained by British subjects, and when the
monopolies took advantage of their opportunities, and raised the price
of dynamite and the rates for carrying freight, the Englishmen, who
owned all the mines, naturally objected.The Boer Government, having
bound itself hand and foot when hard pressed for money, was unable to
compel the concessionaries to reduce their rates.At that period of the Randt's existence the speculators appeared, and
soon thereafter the London Stock Exchange became a factor in the affairs
of the Randt.Where the Stock Exchange leads, the politicians follow,
and they too soon became interested in South African affairs.Then the
treaty of 1883 was found in the Colonial Office archives, and next
appears a demand to the Boer Government that all British residents of
the Transvaal be allowed to vote.The Boers refused to give the
franchise to any applicant unless he first renounced his allegiance to
other countries, and, as the British subjects declined to accede to the
request, the politicians became busily engaged in formulating other
plans whereby England might obtain control of the country.At that inopportune time Jameson's troopers entered the Transvaal
territory and attempted to take forcible possession of the country; but
they were unsuccessful, and only succeeded in directing the world's
sympathy to the Boers.The Jameson raid was practically Cecil J.
Rhodes's first important attempt to add the Transvaal to the list of
South African additions he has made to the British Empire.The result
was especially galling to him, as it was the first time his great
political schemes failed of success.But Rhodes is not the man to weep over disasters.Before the excitement
over the raid had subsided, Rhodes had concocted a plan to inflict a
commercial death upon the Transvaal, and in that manner force it to beg
for the protection of the English flag.He opened Rhodesia, an
adjoining country, for settlement, and by glorifying the country, its
mineral and agricultural wealth, and by offering golden inducements to
Transvaal tradespeople, miners, and even Transvaal subjects, he hoped to
cause such an efflux from the Transvaal that the Government would be
embarrassed in less than two years.The country which bears his name
was found to be amazingly free from mountains of gold and rivers of
honey, and the several thousand persons who had faith in his alluring
promises remained in Rhodesia less than a year, and then returned to the
Transvaal.The reports of the Rhodesian country that were brought back by the
disappointed miners and settlers were not flattering to the condition of
the country or the justice of the Government.Of two evils, they chose
the lesser, and again placed themselves under the Kruger Government.When revolution and enticement failed to bring the Transvaal under the
British flag, Rhodes inaugurated a political propaganda.His last
resort was the Colonial Office in London, and in that alone lay the only
course by which he could attain his object.Again the franchise question was resorted to as the ground of the
contention, the dynamite and railway subjects having been so thoroughly
debated as to be as void of ground for further contention as they had
always been foreign to British control or interference.The question of
granting the right of voting to the Uitlanders in the Transvaal is one
which so vitally affects the future life of the Government that the
Boers' concession of that right would be tantamount to presenting the
country to the British Government.of the Uitlanders of the Transvaal are no more
than transient citizens.They were attracted thither by the gold mines
and the attendant industries, and they have no thought of staying in the
Transvaal a minute after they have amassed a fortune or a competency.Under no consideration would they remain in the country for the rest of
their lives, because the climate and nature of the country are not
conducive to a desire for long residence.It has been demonstrated that
less than one per cent.of the Uitlanders had sufficient interest in the
country to pass through the formality of securing naturalization papers
preparatory to becoming eligible for the franchise.The Boer Government has offered that all Uitlanders of nine years'
residence, having certain unimportant qualifications, should be
enfranchised in two years, and that others should be enfranchised in
seven years--two years for naturalization and five more years'
resident--before acquiring the right to vote.There is a provision for a property qualification, which makes it
necessary for the naturalized citizen to own a house of no less value
than two hundred and fifty dollars in renting value, or an income of one
thousand dollars.The residence clause in the Transvaal qualifications
compares favourably with those of London, where an Englishman from any
part of the country and settling in the municipality is obliged to live
two years and have certain property qualifications before acquiring the
right of franchise.In full knowledge of these conditions the Uitlanders insist upon having
an unconditional franchise--one that will require nothing more than a
two-years' residence in the country.The Boers are well aware of the
results that would follow the granting of the concessions demanded, but
not better so than the Uitlanders who make the demands.The latest
Transvaal statistics place the number of Boer burghers in the country at
less than thirty thousand.At the lowest estimate there are in the
Transvaal fifty thousand Uitlanders having the required qualifications,
and all of these would become voters in two years.At the first
election held after the two years had elapsed the Uitlanders would be
victorious, and those whom they elected would control the machinery of
the Government.The Uitlanders' plan is as transparent as air, yet it
has the approval and sanction of the English politicians, press, and
public.The propaganda which Rhodes and other politicians and stock brokers
interested in the Transvaal gold mines inaugurated a short time after
the Jameson raid has been successful in arousing the people in England
to what they have been led to believe is a situation unequalled in the
history of the empire-building.At the
same time the British Parliament was discussing the subject of the
alleged injustice under which the English residents of the Transvaal
were suffering, the colonial secretary was engaged in disposing of
grievances which reached him from the Dutch residents of British Guiana,
in South America, and which recited conditions parallel to those
complained of by the Uitlanders.The grievances were made by foreign
residents of English territory, instead of by English subjects in a
foreign country, and consequently demanded less serious attention, but
their justice was none the less patent.The three thousand native Dutch
voters in British Guiana have no voice in the legislative or
administrative branches of the colonial government, owing to the
peculiar laws which give to the three thousand British-born citizens the
complete control of the franchise.The population of the colony is
three hundred thousand, yet the three thousand British subjects make and
administer the laws for the other two hundred and ninety-seven thousand
inhabitants, who compose the mining and agricultural communities and are
treated with the same British contempt as the Boers.The Dutch
residents have made many appeals for a fuller representation in the
Government, but no reforms have been inaugurated or promised.The few grievances which the Uitlanders had before the Jameson raid have
been multiplied a hundredfold and no epithet is too venomous for them to
apply to the Boers.The letters in the home newspapers have allied the
name of the Boers with every vilifying adjective in the English
dictionary, and returning politicians have never failed to supply the
others that do not appear in the book.Petitions with thousands of names, some real, but many non-existent,
have been forwarded to the Colonial Office and to every other office in
London where they would be received, and these have recited grievances
that even the patient Boer Volksraad had never heard about.It has been
a propaganda of petitions and letters the like of which has no parallel
in the history of politics.It has been successful in arousing
sentiment favourable to the Uitlanders, and at this time there is hardly
a handful of persons in England who are not willing to testify to the
utter degradation of the Boers.Another branch of the propaganda operated through the Stock Exchange,
and its results were probably more practical than those of the literary
branch.It is easier to reach the English masses through the Stock
Exchange than by any other means.Whenever one of the "Kaffir" or
Transvaal companies failed to make both ends meet in a manner which
pleased the stockholders, it was only necessary to blame the Boer
Government for having impeded the digging of gold, and the stockholders
promptly outlined to the Colonial Office the policy it should pursue
toward the Boers.The impressions that are formed in watching the tide of events in the
Transvaal are that the Boer Government is not greatly inferior to the
Government of Lord Salisbury and Secretary Chamberlain.The only
appreciable difference between the two is that the Boers are fighting
the cause of the masses against the classes, while the English are
fighting that of the classes against the masses.In England, where the
rich have the power, the poor pay the taxes, while in the Transvaal the
poor have the power and compel the rich to pay the taxes.If the
Transvaal taxes were of such serious proportions as to be almost
unbearable, there might be a cause for interference by the Uitlander
capitalists who own the mines, but there no injustice is shown to any
one.The only taxes that the Uitlanders are compelled to pay are the
annual poll tax of less than four dollars and a half, mining taxes of a
dollar and a quarter a month for each claim for prospecting licenses,
and five dollars a claim for diggers' licenses.Boer and Uitlander are
compelled to pay these taxes without distinction.The Boers, in this contention, must win or die.In earlier days, before
every inch of African soil was under the flag of one country or another,
they were able to escape from English injustice by loading their few
possessions on wagons and "trekking" into new and unexplored lands.If
they yield their country to the English without a struggle, they will be
forced to live under a future Stock Exchange Government, which has been
described by a member of the British Parliament as likely to be "the
vilest, the most corrupt, and the most pernicious known to man."[#]


[#] The Hon.Henry Labouchere, in London Truth.The Boers have no better argument to advance in support of their claim
than that which is contained in the Transvaal national hymn.It at once
gives a history of their country, its many struggles and
disappointments, and its hopes.It is written in the "taal" of the
country, and when sung by the patriotic, deep-voiced Boers is one of the
most impressive hymns that ever inspired a nation.The four-colours of our dear old land
      Again float o'er Transvaal,
    And woe the God-forgetting hand
      That down our flag would haul!Wave higher now in clearer sky
      Our Transvaal freedom's stay!Our enemies with fright did fly;
      Now dawns a glorious day.Through many a storm ye bravely stood,
      And we stood likewise true;
    Now, that the storm is o'er, we would
      Leave nevermore from you
    Bestormed by Kaffir, Lion, Brit,
      Wave ever o'er their head;
    And then to spite we hoist thee yet
      Up to the topmost stead!Four long years did we beg--aye, pray--
      To keep our lands clear, free,
    We asked you, Brit, we loath the fray:
      "Go hence, and let us be!We've waited, Brit, we love you not,
      To arms we call the Boer;"
        (Lit., Now take we to our guns.)"You've teased us long enough, we troth,
      Now wait we nevermore."And with God's help we cast the yoke
      Of England from our knee;
    Our country safe--behold and look--
      Once more our flag waves free!Though many a hero's blood it cost,
      May all the nations see
        (Lit., Though England ever so much more.)That God the Lord redeemed our hosts;
      The glory his shall be.Wave high now o'er our dear old land,
      Wave four-colours of Transvaal!And woe the God-forgetting hand
      That dares you down to haul!Wave higher now in clearer sky
      Our Transvaal freedom's stay!Our enemies with fright did fly;
      Now dawns a glorious day.CHAPTER X

                        PREPARATIONS FOR DEFENCE


Ever since the Jameson raid both the Boers and the Uitlanders have
realized that a peaceful solution of the differences between the two is
possible but highly improbable.The Uitlanders refused to concede
anything to the Boer, and asked for concessions that implied a virtual
abandonment of their country to the English, whom they have always
detested.The Boers themselves have not been unmindful of the
inevitable war with their powerful antagonist, and, not unlike the tiny
ant of the African desert, which fortifies its abode against the
anticipated attack of wild beasts, have made of their country a
veritable arsenal.Probably no inland country in the world is half so well prepared for war
at any time as that little Government, which can boast of having less
than thirty thousand voters.The military preparation has been so
enormous that Great Britain has been compelled, according to the
colonial secretary's statement to the British Parliament, to expend two
and a half million dollars annually in South Africa in order to keep
pace with the Boers.Four years ago, when the Transvaal Government
learned that the Uitlanders of Johannesburg were planning a revolution,
it commenced the military preparations which have ever since continued
with unabating vigour.German experts were employed to formulate plans
for the defence of the country, and European artillerists were secured
to teach the arts of modern warfare to the men at the head of the Boer
army.Several Americans of military training became the instructors in
the national military school at Pretoria; and even the women and
children became imbued with the necessity of warlike preparation, and
learned the use of arms.Several million pounds were annually spent in
Europe in the purchase of the armament required by the plans formulated
by the experts, and the whole country was placed on a war footing.Every important strategic position was made as impregnable as modern
skill and arms could make it, and every farmer's cottage was supplied
with arms and ammunition, so that the volunteer army might be mobilized
in a day.In order to demonstrate the extent to which the military preparation has
been carried, it is only necessary to give an account of the defences of
Pretoria and Johannesburg, the two principal cities of the country.Pretoria, being the capital, and naturally the chief point of attack by
the enemy, has been prepared to resist the onslaught of any number of
men, and is in a condition to withstand a siege of three years.The
city lies in the centre of a square, at each corner of which is a lofty
hill surmounted by a strong fort, which commands the valleys and the
surrounding country.Each of the four forts has four heavy cannon, four
French guns of fifteen miles range, and thirty heavy Gatling guns.Besides this extraordinary protection, the city has fifty light Gatling
guns which can be drawn by mules to any point on the hills where an
attack may be made.Three large warehouses are filled with ammunition,
and the large armory is packed to the eaves with Mauser, Martini-Henry,
and Wesley-Richards rifles.Two extensive refrigerators, with a
capacity of two thousand oxen each, are ample provision against a siege
of many months.It is difficult to compute the total expenditures for
war material by the Boer Government during the last four years, but the
following official announcement of expenses for one year will serve to
give an idea of the vastness of the preparations that the Government has
been compelled to make in order to guard the safety of the country:

    War-Office salaries .$262,310
    War purposes.4,717,550
    Johannesburg revolt .800,000
    Public works.3,650,000
                                           ----------
                                           $9,429,860


Johannesburg has extensive fortifications around it, but the Boers will
use them for other purposes than those of self-protection.The forts at
the Golden City were erected for the purpose of quelling any revolution
of the Uitlanders, who constitute almost entirely the population of the
city.One of the forts is situated on a small eminence about half a mile north
of the business part, and commands the entire city with its guns.Two
years were consumed in building the fortification and in placing the
armament in position.Its guns can rake not only every street of the
city, but ten of the principal mine works as well, and the damage that
their fire could cause is incalculable.Another fort, almost as strong
as the one in Johannesburg, is situated a mile east of the city, and
overshadows the railway and the principal highway to Johannesburg.The
residents of the city are greatly in fear of underground works, which
they have been led to believe were constructed since the raid.Vast
quantities of earth were taken out of the Johannesburg fort, and for
such a length of time did the work continue that the Uitlanders decided
that the Boers were undermining the city, and protested to the
Government against such a course.As soon as war is declared and the
women and children have been removed from the city, Johannesburg will be
rent with shot and shell.The Boers have announced their intention of
doing this, and the Uitlanders, anticipating it, seek safety in flight
whenever there are rumours of war, as thousands did immediately before
and after the Jameson affair.The approaches to the mountain passes on the border have been fortified
with vast quantities of German and French ordnance, and equipped with
garrisons of men born or trained in Europe.The approaches to Laing's
Nek, near the Natal border, which have several times been the battle
ground of the English and Boer forces, have been prepared to resist an
invading army from Natal.Much attention has been directed to the
preparations in that part of the republic, because the British
commanders will find it easier to transfer forces from the port of
Durban, which is three hundred and six miles from the Transvaal border,
while Cape Town is almost a thousand miles distant.But the Pretorian Government has made many provisions for war other than
those enumerated.It has made alliances and friends that will be of
equal worth in the event of an attack by England.The Orange Free
State, whose existence is as gravely imperilled as that of the
Transvaal, will fight hand-in-hand with its neighbour, just as it was
prepared to do at the time of the Jameson raid, when almost every Free
State burgher lay armed on the south bank of the Vaal River, awaiting
the summons for assistance from the Kruger Government.In the event of
war the two Governments will be as one, and, in anticipation of the
struggle of the Boers against the British, the Free State Government has
been expending vast sums of money every year in strengthening the
country's defences.At the same time that the Free State is being
prepared for war, its Government officials are striving hard to prevent
a conflict, and are attempting to conciliate the two principals in the
strife by suggesting that concessions be made by both.The Free State
is not so populous as the Transvaal, and consequently can not place as
many men in the field, but the ten thousand burghers who will answer the
call to arms will be an acceptable addition to the Boer forces.The element of doubt enters into the question of what the Boers and
their co-religionists of Cape Colony and Natal will do in the event of
war.The Dutch of Cape Colony are the majority of the population, and,
although loyal British subjects under ordinary circumstances, are
opposed to English interference in the Transvaal's affairs.Those of
Natal, while not so great in numbers, are equally friendly with the
Transvaal Boers, and would undoubtedly recall some of their old
grievances against the British Government as sufficient reason to join
the Boers in war.In Cape Colony there is an organization called the Afrikander Bond which
recently has gained control of the politics of the colony, and which
will undoubtedly be supreme for many years to come.The motto of the
organization is "South Africa for South Africans," and its doctrine is
that South Africa shall be served first and Great Britain afterward.Its members, who are chiefly Dutch, believe their first duty is to
assist the development of the resources of their own country by proper
protective tariffs and stringent legislation in native affairs, and they
regard legislation with a view to British interests as of secondary
importance.The Bond has been very amicably inclined toward its
Afrikander kinsmen in the Transvaal, especially since the Jameson raid,
and every sign of impending trouble between England and the Boers widens
the chasm between the English and Afrikanders of South Africa.The
Dutch approve of President Kruger's course in dealing with the franchise
problems, and if hostilities break out it would be not the least
incompatible with their natures to assist their Transvaal and Free State
kinsmen even at the risk of plunging the whole of South Africa into a
civil war.W. P. Schreiner, the Premier of Cape Colony, is the leading
member of the Bond, and with him he has associated the majority of the
leading men in the colony.Under ordinary conditions their loyalty to
Great Britain is undoubted, but whether they could resist the influence
of their friends in the Bond if it should decide to cast its fortunes
with the Boers in case of war is another matter.Of such vast importance is the continued loyalty of the Dutch of the two
colonies that upon it depends practically the future control of the Cape
by the British Government.Being in the majority as three to two, and
almost in supreme control of the local government, the Dutch of Cape
Colony are in an excellent position to secede from the empire, as they
have already threatened to do, in which event England would be obliged
to fight almost the united population of the whites if she desired to
retain control of the country.With this in mind, it is no wonder that
Mr.Chamberlain declared that England had reached a critical turning
point in the history of the empire.The uncertainty of the situation is increased by the doubtful stand
which the native races are taking in the dispute.Neither England nor
the Boers has the positive assurance of support from any of the tribes,
which outnumber the whites as ten to one; but it will not be an
unwarranted opinion to place the majority of the native tribes on the
side of the Boers.The native races are always eager to be the friends
of the paramount power, and England's many defeats in South Africa
during recent years have not assisted in gaining for it that prestige.When England enters upon a war with the Transvaal the natives will
probably follow the example of the Matabele natives, who rebelled
against the English immediately after Jameson and his men were defeated
by the Boers, because they believed a conquered nation could offer no
resistance.The Boers, having won the last battle, are considered by the
natives to be the paramount power, and it is always an easy matter to
induce a subjected people to ally itself with a supposedly powerful one.The Zulus, still stinging under the defeat which they received from the
British less than twenty years ago, might gather their war parties and,
with the thousands of guns they have been allowed to buy, attempt to
secure revenge.The Basutos, east of the Orange Free State, now the
most powerful and the only undefeated nation in the country, would
hardly allow a war to be fought unless they participated in it, even if
only to demonstrate to the white man that they still retain their
old-time courage and ability.The million and a half natives in Cape
Colony, and the equal number in the Transvaal, have complained of so
many alleged grievances at the hands of their respective governments
that they might be presumed to rise against them, though it is never
possible to determine the trend of the African <DW64>'s mind.What the
various tribes would do in such an emergency can be answered only by the
chiefs themselves, and they will not speak until the time for action is
at hand.Perhaps when that time does arrive there may be a realization
of the natives' dream--that a great leader will come from the north who
will organize all the various tribes into one grand army and with it
drive the hated white men into the sea.It is impossible to secure accurate statistics in regard to the military
strength of the various colonies, states, and tribes in the country, but
the following table gives a fair idea of the number of men who are

To him who delights in forming possible coalitions and war situations
this table offers vast opportunities.Probably no other country can
offer such a vast number of possibilities for compacts between nations,
races, and tribes as is presented in South Africa.There all the
natives may unite against the whites, or a part of them against a part
of the whites, while whites and natives may unite against a similar
combination.The possibilities are boundless; the probabilities are
uncertain.The Pretorian Government has had an extensive secret service for several
years, and this has been of inestimable value in securing the support of
the natives as well as the friendship of many whites, both in South
Africa and abroad.The several thousand Irishmen in South Africa have
been organized into a secret compact, and have been and will continue to
be of great value to the Boers.The head of the organization is a man
who is one of President Kruger's best friends, and his lieutenants are
working even as far away as America.The sympathy of the majority of
the Americans in the Transvaal is with the Boer cause, and, although the
American consul-general at Cape Town has cautioned them to remain
neutral, they will not stand idly by and watch the defeat of a cause
which they believe to be as just as that for which their forefathers
fought at Bunker Hill and Lexington.But the Boers do not rely upon external assistance to win their battles
for them.When it becomes necessary to defend their liberty and their
country they reverently place their trust in Providence and their
rifles.Their forefathers' battles were won with such confidence, and
the later generations have been similarly successful under like
conditions.The rifle is the young Boer's primer and the grandfather's
testament.It is the Boers' avenger of wrong and the upholder of right.That their confidence in their rifles has not been misapplied has been
demonstrated at Laing's Nek, Majuba Hill, Doornkop, and in battles with
natives.The natural opportunities provided by Nature which in former years were
responsible for the confidence which the Boers reposed in their rifles
may have disappeared with the approach of advancing civilization, but
the Boer of to-day is as dangerous an adversary with a gun as his father
was in the wars with the Zulus and the Matabeles half a century ago.The
buck, rhinoceros, elephant, and hippopotamus are not as numerous now as
then, but the Boer has devised other means by which he may perfect
himself in marksmanship.Shooting is one of the main diversions of the
Boer, and prizes are offered for the best results in contests.It is
customary to mark out a ring, about two hundred and fifty feet in
diameter, in the centre of which a small stuffed figure resembling a
bird is attached to a pole.The marksmen stand on the outside of the
circle and fire in turn at the target.A more curious target, and one
that taxes the ability of the marksman, is in more general use
throughout the country.A hole sufficiently deep to retain a
turkey-cock is dug in a level plot of ground, and over this is placed a
piece of canvas which contains a small hole through which the bird can
extend and withdraw its head.At a distance of three hundred feet the
bird's head is a target by no means easily hit.Military men are accustomed to sneer at the lack of generalship of the
Boer forces, but in only one of the battles in which they have engaged
the British forces have the trained military men and leaders been able
to cope with them.In the battle of Boomplaats, fought in 1848, the
English officers can claim their only victory over the Boers, who were
armed with flintlocks, while the British forces had heavy artillery.In
almost all the encounters that have taken place the Boer forces were not
as large as those of the enemy, yet the records show that many more
casualties were inflicted than received by them.In the chief
engagements the appended statistics show that the Boers had only a small
percentage of their men in the casualty list, while the British losses
were much greater.Laing's Nek           400        550          190         24
    Ingogo                300        250          142         17

It is hardly fair to assume that the Boers' advantages in these battles
were gained without the assistance of capable generals when it is taken
into consideration that there is a military axiom which places the value
of an army relatively with the ability of its commanders.The Boers may
exaggerate when they assert that one of their soldiers is the equal in
fighting ability of five British soldiers, but the results of the
various battles show that they have some slight foundation for their
theory.The regular British force in South Africa is comparatively small, but it
would require less than a month to transport one hundred thousand
trained soldiers from India and England and place them on the scene of
action.Several regiments of trained soldiers are always stationed in
different parts of the country near the Transvaal border, and at brief
notice they could be placed on Boer territory.Charlestown, Ladysmith,
and Pietermaritzburg, in Natal, have been British military headquarters
for many years, and during the last three years they have been
strengthened by the addition of several regular regiments.The British
Colonial Office has been making preparations for several years for a
conflict.Every point in the country has been strengthened, and all the
foreign powers whose interests in the country might lead them to
interfere in behalf of the Boers have been placated.Germany has been
taken from the British zone of danger by favourable treaties; France is
fearful to try interference alone; and Portugal, the only other nation
interested, is too weak and too deeply in England's debt to raise her
voice against anything that may be done.By leasing the town of Lorenzo Marques from the Portuguese Government,
Great Britain has acquired one of the best strategic points in South
Africa.The lease, the terms of which are unannounced, was the
culmination of much diplomatic dickering, in which the interests of
Germany and the South African Republic were arrayed against those of
England and Portugal.There is no doubt that England made the lease
only in order to gain an advantage over President Kruger, and to prevent
him from further fortifying his country with munitions of war imported
by way of Lorenzo Marques and Delagoa Bay.England gains a commercial
advantage too, but it is hardly likely that she would care to add the
worst fever-hole in Africa to her territory simply to please the few of
her merchants who have business interests in the town.Since the Jameson
raid the Boers have been purchasing vast quantities of guns and
ammunition in Europe for the purpose of preparing themselves for any
similar emergency.Delagoa Bay alone was an open port to the Transvaal,
every other port in South Africa being under English dominion and
consequently closed to the importation of war material.Lorenzo
Marques, the natural port of the Transvaal, is only a short distance
from the eastern border of that country, and is connected with Pretoria
and Johannesburg by a railway.It was over this railway that the Boers
were able to carry the guns and ammunition with which to fortify their
country, and England could not raise a finger to prevent the little
republic from doing as it pleased.Hardly a month has passed since the
raid that the Transvaal authorities did not receive a large consignment
of guns and powder from Germany and France by way of Lorenzo Marques.England could do nothing more than have several detectives at the docks
to take an inventory of the munitions as they passed in transit.The transfer of Lorenzo Marques to the British will put an effectual bar
to any further importation of guns into the Transvaal, and will
practically prevent any foreign assistance from reaching the Boers in
the event of another war.Both Germany and England tried for many years
to induce Portugal to sell Delagoa Bay, but being the debtor of both to
a great extent, the sale could not be made to one without arousing the
enmity of the other.Eighteen or twenty years ago Portugal would have
sold her sovereign right over the port to Mr.Gladstone's Government for
sixty thousand dollars, but that was before Delagoa Bay had any
commercial or political importance.Since then Germany became the
political champion of the Transvaal, and blocked all the schemes of
England to isolate the inland country by cutting off its only neutral
connection with the sea.Recently, however, Germany has been
disappointed by the Transvaal Republic, and one of the results is the
present cordial relations between the Teutons and the Anglo-Saxons in
South African affairs.The English press and people in South Africa have always asserted that
by isolating the Transvaal from the sea the Boers could be starved into
submission in case of a war.As soon as the lease becomes effective, Mr.Kruger's country will be completely surrounded by English territory, at
least in such a way that nothing can be taken into the Transvaal without
first passing through an English port, and no foreign power will be able
to send forces to the aid of the Boers unless they are first landed on
British soil.It is doubtful whether any nation would incur such a
grave responsibility for the sake of securing Boer favour.Both the Transvaal and England are fully prepared for war, and diplomacy
only can postpone its coming.The Uitlanders' present demands may be
conceded, but others that will follow may not fare so well.A coveted
country will always be the object of attacks by a stronger power, and
the aggressor generally succeeds in securing from the weaker victim
whatever he desires.Whether British soldiers will be obliged to fight
the Boers alone in order to gratify the wishes of their Government, or
whether the enemy will be almost the entire white and black population
of South Africa, will not be definitely known until the British troop
ships start for Cape Town and Durban.[Illustration: Cape Town and Table Mountain.]Whichever enemy it will be, the British Government will attack, and will
pursue in no half-hearted or half-prepared manner, as it has done in
previous campaigns in the country.The Boers will be able to resist and
to prolong the campaign to perhaps eight months or a year, but they will
finally be obliterated from among the nations of the earth.It will
cost the British Empire much treasure and many lives, but it will
satisfy those who caused it--the politicians and speculators.CHAPTER XI

                   AMERICAN INTERESTS IN SOUTH AFRICA


An idea of the nature and extent of American enterprise in South Africa
might be deduced from the one example of a Boston book agent, who made a
competency by selling albums of United States scenery to the <DW64>s
along the shores of the Umkomaas River, near Zululand.The book agent
is not an incongruity of the activity of Americans in that part of the
continent, but an example rather of the diversified nature of the
influences which owe their origin to the nation of Yankees ten thousand
miles distant.The United States of America have had a deeper influence
upon South Africa than that which pertains to commerce and trade.The
progress, growth, and prosperity of the American States have instilled
in the minds of the majority of South Africans a desire to be free from
European control, and to be united under a single banner, which is to
bear the insignia of the United States of South Africa.In public, editors and speechmakers in Cape Colony, Natal, and the
Transvaal spend hours in deploring the progress of Americanisms in South
Africa, but in their clubs and libraries they study and discuss the
causes which led to America's progress and pre-eminence, and form plans
by which they may be able to attain the same desirable ends.The
influence and example of the United States are not theoretical; they are
political factors which are felt in the discussion of every public
question and in the results of every election.The practical results of
American influence in South Africa may now be observed only in the
increasing exports to that country, but perhaps in another generation a
greater and better demonstration will be found in a constitution which
unites all the South African states under one independent government.If any corroboration of this sentiment were necessary, a statement made
by the man who is leader of the ruling party in Cape Colony would be
ample."If we want an example of the highest type of freedom," said W. P.
Schreiner, the present Premier of Cape Colony, "we must look to the
United States of America."[#]


[#] Americans' Fourth of July Banquet, Cape Town, 1897.American influences are felt in all phases of South African life, be
they social, commercial, religious, political, or retrogressive.Whether it be the American book agent on the banks of the Umkomaas, or
the American consul-general in the governor's mansion at Cape Town, his
indomitable energy, his breezy indifference to apparently insurmountable
difficulties, and his boundless resources will always secure for him
those material benefits for which men of other nationalities can do no
more than hope.Some of his rivals call it perverseness, callousness,
trickery, treachery, and what not; his admirers might ascribe his
success to energy, pluck, modern methods, or to that quality best
described by that Americanism--"hustling."American commercial interests in South Africa are of such recent growth,
and already of such great proportions, that the other nations who have
been interested in the trade for many years are not only astounded, but
are fearful that the United States will soon be the controlling spirit
in the country's commercial affairs.The enterprise of American
business firms, and their ability to undersell almost all the other
firms represented in the country, have given an enormous impetus to the
export trade with South African countries.Systematic efforts have been
made by American firms to work the South African markets on an extensive
scale, and so successful have the efforts been that the value of exports
to that country has several times been more than doubled in a single
year.Five years ago America's share of the business of South Africa was
practically infinitesimal; to-day the United States hold second place in
the list of nations which have trade relations with that country, having
outranked Germany, France, Belgium, Holland, and Italy.In several
branches of trade America surpasses even England, which has always had
all the trade advantages owing to the supremacy of her flag over the
greater part of the country.That the British merchants are keenly alive
to the situation which threatens to transfer the trade supremacy into
American hands has been amply demonstrated by the efforts which they
have made to check the inroads the Americans are making on their field,
and by the appointment of committees to investigate the causes of the
decline of British commerce.American enterprise shows itself by the scores of representatives of
American business houses who are constantly travelling through the
country, either to secure orders or to investigate the field with a view
of entering into competition with the firms of other nations.Fifteen
American commercial travellers, representing as many different firms,
were registered at the Grand Hotel, Cape Town, at one time a year ago,
and that all had secured exceptionally heavy orders indicated that the
innovation in the method of working trade was successful.The laws of the country are unfavourable in no slight degree to the
foreign commercial travellers, who are obliged to pay heavy licenses
before they are permitted to enter upon any business negotiations.The
tax in the Transvaal and Natal is $48.66, and in the Orange Free State
and Cape Colony it amounts to $121.66.If an American agent wishes to
make a tour of all the states and colonies of the country, he is obliged
to pay almost three hundred and fifty dollars in license fees.The great superiority of certain American manufactured products is such
that other nations are unable to compete in those lines after the
American products have been introduced.Especially is this true of
American machinery, which can not be equalled by that of any other
country.Almost every one of the hundreds of extensive gold mines on
the Randt is fitted out wholly or in part with American machinery, and,
at the present rate of increase in the use of it, it will be less than
ten years when none other than United States machinery will be sent to
that district.In visiting the great mines the uninitiated American is
astonished to find that engines, crushing machinery, and even the
electric lights which illuminate them, bear the name plates of New York,
Philadelphia, and Chicago firms.The Kimberley diamond mines, which are among the most extensive and most
elaborate underground works in the world, use American-made machinery
almost exclusively, not only because it is much less costly, but because
no other country can furnish apparatus that will give as good results.Almost every pound of electrical machinery in use in the country was
made in America and was instituted by American workmen.Instances of successful American electrical enterprises are afforded by
the Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and Pretoria street railways, almost
every rail, wire, and car of which bears the marks of American
manufacture.It is a marvellous revelation to find Philadelphia-made
electric cars in the streets of Cape Town, condensing engines from New
York State in Port Elizabeth, and Pittsburg generators and switchboards
in the capital of the Transvaal, which less than fifty years ago was
under the dominion of savages.Not only did Americans install the
street railways, but they also secured the desirable concessions for
operating the lines for a stated period.American electricians operate
the plants, and in not a few instances have financially embarrassed
Americans received a new financial impetus by acting in the capacities
of motormen and conductors.One street car in Cape Town was for a long time distinguished because of
its many American features.The Philadelphia-made car was propelled
over Pittsburg tracks by means of the power passing through Wilkesbarre
wires, and the human agencies that controlled it were a Boston motorman
and a San Francisco conductor.It might not be pursuing the subject too
far to add that of the twelve passengers in the car on a certain journey
ten were Americans, representing eight different States.One of the first railroads in South Africa--that which leads from
Lorenzo Marques to the Transvaal border--was built by an American, a Mr.Murdock, while American material entered largely into the construction
of the more extensive roads from the coast to the interior.American
rails are more quickly and more cheaply[#] obtainable in South Africa
than those of English make, but the influence which is exerted against
the use of other than British rails prevents their universal adoption.Notwithstanding the efforts of the influential Englishmen to secure
British manufactures wherever and whenever possible, American firms have
recently secured the contracts for forty thousand tons of steel rails
for the Cape Colony Railway system, and the prospects are that more
orders of a similar nature will be forthcoming.[#] "But the other day we gave an order for two hundred and fifty miles
of rails.We had a large number of tenders, and the lowest tender, you
may be sorry to hear, was sent by an American, Mr.Fortunately, however, the tender was not in order, and we were therefore
able to give the work to our own people.It may be said that this
American tender was a question of workmen and strikes."--Cecil J.
Rhodes, at a meeting of the stockholders of the Cape-Cairo Railway,
London, May 2, 1899.It is not in the sale of steel rails alone that the American
manufacturer is forging ahead of his competitors in South Africa.American manufactured wares of all kinds are in demand, and in many
instances they are leaders in the market.Especially true is this of
American agricultural implements, which are so much more adaptable to
the soil and much cheaper than any other make.Small stores in the
farming communities of Natal and Cape Colony sell American ploughshares,
spades, forks, rakes, and hoes almost exclusively, and it amazes the
traveller to find that almost every plough and reaper used by the more
progressive agriculturists bears the imprint "Made in the United
States."It is a strange fact that, although South Africa has vast areas covered
with heavy timber, almost all the lumber used in the mining districts is
transported thither from Puget Sound.The native timber being unsuited
for underground purposes and difficult of access, all the mine owners
are obliged to import every foot of wood used in constructing surface
and underground works of their mines, and at great expense, for to the
original cost of the timber is added the charges arising from the sea
and land transportation, import duties, and handling.The docks at Cape
Town almost all the year round contain one or more lumber vessels from
Puget Sound, and upon several occasions five such vessels were being
unloaded at the same time.American coal, too, has secured a foothold in South Africa, a sample
cargo of three thousand tons having been despatched thither at the
beginning of the year.Coal of good quality is found in several parts
of the Transvaal and Natal, but progress in the development of the mines
has been so slow that almost the total demand is supplied by Wales.Cape Colony has an extensive petroleum field, but it is in the hands of
concessionaires, who, for reasons of their own, refuse to develop it.American and Russian petroleums are used exclusively, but the former is
preferred, and is rapidly crowding the other out of the market.Among the many other articles of export to South Africa are flour, corn,
butter, potatoes, canned meats, and vegetables--all of which might be
produced in the country if South Africans took advantage of the
opportunities offered by soil and Nature.American live stock has been
introduced into the country since the rinderpest disease destroyed
almost all of the native cattle, and with such successful results that
several Western firms have established branches in Cape Town, and are
sending thither large cargoes of mules, horses, cattle, and sheep.Cecil J. Rhodes has recently stocked his immense Rhodesian farm with
American live stock, and, as his example is generally followed
throughout the country, a decided increase in the live-stock export
trade is anticipated.Statistics only can give an adequate idea of American trade with South
Africa; but even these are not reliable, for the reason that a large
percentage of the exports sent to the country are ordered through London
firms, and consequently do not appear in the official figures.As a
criterion of what the trade amounts to, it will only be necessary to
quote a few statistics, which, however, do not represent the true totals
for the reason given.The estimated value of the exports and the
percentage increase of each year's business over that of the preceding
year is given, in order that a true idea of the growth of American trade
with South Africa may be formed:

    YEAR.Per cent
                                         increase.1895                  $5,000,000
    1896                  12,000,000        140
    1897                  16,000,000         33 1/8
    1898 (estimated)      20,000,000         25


A fact that is deplored by Americans who are eager to see their country
in the van in all things pertaining to trade is that almost every
dollar's worth of this vast amount of material is carried to South
Africa in ships sailing under foreign colours.Three lines of
steamships, having weekly sailings, ply between the two countries, and
are always laden to the rails with American goods, but the American flag
is carried by none of them.A fourth line of steamships, to ply between
Philadelphia and Cape Town, is about to be established under American
auspices, and is to carry the American flag.A number of small American
sailing vessels trade between the two countries, but their total
capacity is so small as to be almost insignificant when compared with
the great volume carried in foreign bottoms.The American imports from South Africa are of far less value than the
exports, for the reason that the country produces only a few articles
that are not consumed where they originate.America is the best market
in the world for diamonds, and about one fourth of the annual output of
the Kimberley mines reaches the United States.Hides and tallow
constitute the leading exportations to America, while aloes and ostrich
feathers are chief among the few other products sent here.Owing to this
lack of exports, ships going to South Africa are obliged to proceed to
India or Australia for return cargoes in order to reduce the expenses of
the voyage.However great the commercial interests of the United States in South
Africa, they are small in comparison with the work of individual
Americans, who have been active in the development of that country
during the last quarter of a century.Wherever great enterprises have
been inaugurated, Americans have been prominently identified with their
growth and development, and in not a few instances has the success of
the ventures been wholly due to American leadership.European capital
is the foundation of all the great South African institutions, but it is
to American skill that almost all of them owe the success which they
have attained.British and continental capitalists have recognised the superiority of
American methods by intrusting the management of almost every large mine
and industry to men who were born and received their training in the
United States.It is an expression not infrequently heard when the
success of a South African enterprise is being discussed, "Who is the
Yankee?"The reason of this is involved in the fact that almost all the
Americans who went to South Africa after the discovery of gold had been
well fitted by their experiences in the California and Colorado mining
fields for the work which they were called upon to do on the Randt, and,
owing to their ability, were able to compete successfully with the men
from other countries who were not so skilled.Unfortunately, not all the Americans in South Africa have been a credit
to their native country, and there is a considerable class which has
created for itself an unenviable reputation.The component parts of
this class are men who, by reason of criminal acts, were obliged to
leave America for new fields of endeavour, and non-professional men who
follow gold booms in all parts of the world and trust to circumstances
for a livelihood.In the early days of the Johannesburg gold fields
these men oftentimes resorted to desperate means, with the result that
almost every criminal act of an unusually daring description is now
credited against them by the orderly inhabitants.Highwaymen,
pickpockets, illicit gold buyers, confidence men, and even train-robbers
were active, and for several years served to discredit the entire
American colony.Since the first gold excitement has subsided, this
class of Americans, in which was also included by the residents all the
other criminal characters of whatever nationality, has been compelled to
leave the country, and to-day the American colony in Johannesburg
numbers about three thousand of the most respected citizens of the city.The American who has been most prominent in South African affairs, and
the stanchest supporter of American interests in that country, is
Gardner F. Williams, the general manager and one of the alternate life
governors of the De Beers Consolidated Diamond Mines at Kimberley.Williams gained his mining experience in the
mining districts of California and other Western States, and went to
South Africa in 1887 to take charge of the Kimberley mines, which were
then in an almost chaotic condition.By the application of American
ideas, Mr.Williams succeeded in making of the mines a property which
yields an annual profit of about ten million dollars on a nominal
capital of twice that amount.He has introduced American machinery into
the mines, and has been instrumental in many other ways in advancing the
interests of his native country.Williams receives a salary
twice as great as that of the President of the United States, he is
proud to be the American consular agent at Kimberley--an office which
does not carry with it sufficient revenue to provide the star-spangled
banner which constantly floats from a staff in front of his residence.J. Perrott Prince is another American who has assisted materially in
extending American interests in South Africa, and it is due to his own
unselfish efforts that the commerce of the United States with the port
of Durban has risen from insignificant volume to its present size.Prince was a surgeon in the Union army during the civil war, and
afterward was one of the first Americans to go to the Kimberley diamond
fields.Leander Starr Jameson to
accompany him to Kimberley in the capacity of assistant surgeon--a
service which he performed with great distinction until Mr.Rhodes sent
him into Matabeleland to take charge of the military forces, which later
he led into the Transvaal.Prince's renown as a physician was responsible for a call to
Madagascar, whither he was summoned by Queen Ranavalo.He remained in
Madagascar as the queen's physician until the French took forcible
possession of the island and sent the queen into exile on the Reunion
Islands.Prince has lived in Durban, Natal, for several years, and
during the greater part of that time conducted the office of American
consular agent at a financial loss to himself.Prince was obliged to end his connection with the consular service, and
the United States are now represented in Durban by a foreigner, who on
the last Fourth of July inquired why all the Americans in the city were
making such elaborate displays of bunting and the Stars and Stripes.The consular agent at Johannesburg is John C. Manion, of Herkimer, N.Y.,
who represents a large American machinery company.Manion, in 1896,
carried on the negotiations with the Transvaal Government by which John
Hays Hammond, an American mining engineer, was released from the
Pretoria prison, where he had been confined for complicity in the
uprising at Johannesburg.American machinery valued at several million
dollars has been sent to South Africa as the result of Mr.In the gold industry on the Randt, Americans have been specially active,
and it is due to one of them, J. S. Curtis, that the deep-level mines
were discovered.In South Africa a mining claim extends only a
specified distance below the surface of the earth, and the Governments
do not allow claim-owners to dig beyond that depth.Curtis found
that paying reefs existed below the specified depth, and the result was
that the Government sold the underground or deep-level claims with great
profit to itself and the mining community.The consulting engineers of almost all the mines of any importance in
the country are Americans, and their salaries range from ten thousand to
one hundred thousand dollars a year.John Hays Hammond, who was one of
the first American engineers to reach the gold fields, was official
mining engineer for the Transvaal Government, and received a yearly
salary of twenty-five thousand dollars for formulating the mining laws
of the country.He resigned that office, and is now the consulting
engineer for the British South Africa Company in Rhodesia and several
gold mines on the Randt, at salaries which aggregate almost one hundred
thousand dollars a year.Among the scores of other American engineers on
the Randt are L. I. Seymour, who has control of the thirty-six shafts of
the Randt Mines; Captain Malan, of the Robinson mines; and H. S. Watson,
of the Simmer en Jack mines, in developing which more than ten million
dollars have been spent.Another American introduced the system of treating the abandoned
tailings of the mines by the cyanide process, whereby thousands of
ounces of gold have been abstracted from the offal of the mills, which
had formerly been considered valueless.Others have revolutionized
different parts of the management of the mines, and in many instances
have taken abandoned properties and placed them on a paying basis.It
would not be fair to claim that American ingenuity and skill are
responsible for the entire success of the Randt gold mines, but it is
indisputable that Americans have done more toward it than the combined
representatives of all other nations.Every line of business on the Randt has its American representatives,
and almost without exception the firms who sent them thither chose able
men.W. E. Parks, of Chicago, represents Frazer & Chalmers, whose
machinery is in scores of the mines.His assistant is W. H. Haig, of
New York city.The American Trading and Importing Company, with its headquarters in
Johannesburg, and branches in every city and town in the country, deals
exclusively in American manufactured products, and annually sells
immense quantities of bicycles, stoves, beer, carriages, and other
goods, ranging from pins to pianos.Americans do not confine their endeavours to commercial enterprises, and
they may be found conducting missionary work among the Matabeles and
Mashonas, as well as building dams in Rhodesia.American missionaries
are very active in all parts of South Africa, and because of the
practical methods by which they endeavour to civilize and Christianize
the natives they have the reputation throughout the country of being
more successful than those who go there from any other country.Rhodes has given many contributions of land and
money to the American missionaries, and has on several occasions
complimented them by pronouncing their achievements unparalleled.A practical illustration will demonstrate the causes of the success of
the American missionary.An English missionary spent the first two
years after his arrival in the country in studying the natives' language
and in building a house for himself.In that time he had made no
converts.An American missionary arrived at almost the same time,
rented a hut, and hired interpreters.At the end of two years he had
one hundred and fifty converts, many more natives who were learning
useful occupations and trades, and had sent home a request for more
missionaries with which to extend his field.It is rather remarkable that the scouts who assisted in subduing the
American Indians should later be found on the African continent to
assist in the extermination of the blacks.In the Matabele and Mashona
campaigns of three years ago, Americans who scouted for Custer and Miles
on the Western plains were invaluable adjuncts to the British forces,
and in many instances did heroic work in finding the location of the
enemy and in making way for the American Maxim guns that were used in
the campaigns.The Americans in South Africa, although only about ten thousand in
number, have been of invaluable service to the land.They have taught
the farmers to farm, the miners to dig gold, and the statesmen to
govern.Their work has been a credit to the country which they continue
to revere, and whose flag they raise upon every proper occasion.They
have taken little part in the political disturbances of the Transvaal,
because they believe that the citizens of a republic should be allowed
to conduct its government according to their own idea of right and
justice, independently of the demands of those who are not citizens.CHAPTER XII

                         JOHANNESBURG OF TO-DAY


The palms and bamboos of Durban, the Zulu policemen and 'ricksha boys,
and the hospitable citizens have been left behind, and the little train
of English compartment cars, each with its destination "Johannesburg"
labelled conspicuously on its sides, is winding away through cane fields
and banana groves, past groups of open-eyed natives and solemn,
thin-faced Indian coolies.Pretty little farmers' cottages in settings of palms, mimosas, and
tropical plants are dotted in the green valleys winding around the
innumerable small hills that look for all the world like so many
inverted moss-covered china cups.Lumbering transport wagons behind a
score of sleek oxen, wincing under the fire of the far-reaching rawhide
in the hands of a sparsely clad Zulu driver, are met and passed in a
twinkling.Neatly thatched huts with natives lazily lolling in the sun
become more frequent as the train rolls on toward the interior, and the
greenness of the landscape is changing into the brown of dead verdure,
for it is the dry season--the South African winter.The hills become
more frequent, and the little locomotive goes more slowly, while the
train twists and writhes along its path like a huge python.Now it is on the hilltop from which the distant sea and its coast fringe
of green are visible on the one side, and nothing but treeless brown
mountain tops on the other.A minute later it plunges down the
hillside, along rocky precipices, over deep chasms, and then wearily
plods up the zigzag course of another hillside.For five hours or more
the monotony of miniature mountains continues, relieved by nothing more
interesting than the noise of the train and the hilarious laughter and
weird songs of a car load of Zulus bound for the gold fields.After
this comes an undulating plain and towns with far less interest in their
appearance than in their names.The traveller surfeited with Natal
scenery finds amusement and diversion in the conductor's call of Umbilo,
Umkomaas, Umgeni, Amanzimtoti, Isipingo, Mooi River, Zwartkop, or
Pietermaritzburg, but will not attempt to learn the proper pronunciation
of the names unless he has weeks at his command.[Illustration: Zulu maidens shaking hands.]Farther on in the journey an ostrich, escaped from a farm, stalks over
the plain, and, approaching to within several yards of the train, jogs
along for many miles, and perchance wheedles the engineer into impromptu
races.Hardly has the bird disappeared when on the wide veldt a herd of
buck galloping with their long heads down, or a large number of
wildebeest, plunging and jumping like animated hobby-horses, raise
clouds of dust as they dash away from the monster of iron and steam.Shortly afterward the train passes a waterfall almost thrice as lofty as
Niagara, but located in the middle of the plain, into whose surface the
water has riven a deep and narrow chasm.Since the balmy Indian Ocean has been left behind, the train has been
rising steadily, sometimes an inch in a mile but oftener a hundred feet,
and the air has grown cooler.The thousands of British soldiers at
Ladysmith are wearing heavy clothing; their horses, tethered in the open
air, are shivering, and far to the westward is the cause of it all--the
lofty, snow-covered peaks of the Dragon Mountain.Night comes on and
clothes the craggy mountains and broken valleys with varying shades of
sombreness.The moon outlines the snow far above, and with its rays
marks the lofty line where sky and mountain crest seem to join.Morning
light greets the train as it dashes down the mountain side, through the
passes that connect Natal with the Transvaal and out upon the withered
grass of the flat, uninteresting veldt of the Boer country.The South African veldt in all its winter hideousness lies before you.It stretches out in all directions--to the north and south, to the east
and west--and seems to have no boundaries.Its yellowish brownness eats
into the brain, and the eyes grow weary from the monotony of the scene.Hour after hour the train bears onward in a straight line, but the
landscape remains the same.But for noises and motions of the cars you
would imagine that the train was stationary, so far as change of scenery
is concerned.Occasionally a colony of huge ant-heaps or a few buck or
deer may be passed, but for hours it is veldt, veldt, veldt!An entire
day's journey, unrelieved except toward the end by a few straggling
towns of Boer farmhouses or the sheet-iron cabins of prospectors, bring
it to Heidelberg, once the metropolis as well as the capital of the
republic, but now pining because the former distinguishing mark has been
yielded to its neighbour, Johannesburg.As the shades of another night commence to fall, the veldt suddenly
assumes a new countenance.Lights begin to sparkle, buildings close
together appear, and scores of tall smokestacks tower against the
background of the sky.The presence of the smoke-stacks denote the
arrival at the Randt, and for twenty miles the train rushes along this
well-defined gold-yielding strip of land.Buildings, lights, stacks,
and people become more numerous as the train progresses into the city
limits of Johannesburg, and the traveller soon finds himself in the
middle of a crowd of enthusiastic welcoming and welcomed persons on the
platform of the station of the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche
Spoorweg-Maatschappij, and in the Golden City.The sudden change from the dreary lifelessness of the veldt to the
exciting crush and bustle of the station platform crowd is almost
bewildering, because it is so different from what is expected in
interior Africa.The station, a magnificent structure of stone and
iron, presents more animated scenes whenever trains arrive than the
Grand Central in New York or the Victoria in London, because every
passenger is invariably met at the train by all his friends and as many
of their friends as the station platform will accommodate.The crowd
which surges around this centre of the city's life is of a more
cosmopolitan character than that which can be found in any other city in
the world with the exceptions of Zanzibar and Port Said.Almost every
race is represented in the gathering, which is suggestive of a mass
meeting of the villagers of the Midway Plaisance at the Columbian
Exposition.In the crowd are stolid Anglo-Saxons shaking hands
effusively; enthusiastic Latins embracing each other; <DW64>s rubbing
noses and cheeks; smiling Japanese; cold, stern Chinese; Cingalese,
Russians, Malays, and Egyptians--all in their national costumes, and all
welcoming friends in their native manner and language.Meandering
through the crowd are several keen-eyed Boer policemen, commonly called
"Zarps," politely directing the attention of innocent-looking newcomers
to placards bearing the inscription "Pas op Zakkenrollers," which is the
Boer warning of pickpockets.After the traveller has forced a way through the crowd he is attacked by
a horde of cabmen who can teach tricks of the trade to the London and
New York night-hawks.Their equipages range from dilapidated broughams
to antique 'rickshas, but their charges are the same--"a quid," or five
dollars, either for a mile or a minute's ride.After the insults which
follow a refusal to enter one of their conveyances have subsided, the
agents of the hotels commence a vociferous campaign against the
newcomers, and very clever it is in its way.They are able to
distinguish a foreigner at one glance, and will change the name of the
hotel which they represent a score of times in as many seconds in order
to bag their quarry.For the patriotic American they have the New York
Hotel, the Denver House, the Hotel California, and many other hostelries
named after American cities.they will salute an American,
"Come up to the New York Hotel and patronize American enterprise."If
the traveller will accompany one of these agents he will find that all
the names apply to one hotel, which has an American name but is
conducted and patronized by a low class of foreigners.The victim of
misrepresentation will seek another hotel, and will be fortunate if he
finds comfortable quarters for less than ten dollars a day, or three
times the amount he would be called upon to pay at a far better hotel in
any American city of equal size.The privilege of fasting, or of
awakening in the morning with a layer of dust an eighth of an inch deep
on the counterpane and on the face may be ample return for the
extraordinary charges, but the stranger in the city is not apt to adopt
that view of the situation until he is acclimated.The person who has spent several days in crossing the veldt and enters
Johannesburg by night has a strange revelation before him when he is
awakened the following morning.He has been led to believe that the city
is a motley collection of corrugated-iron hovels, hastily constructed
cabins, and cheap public buildings.Instead he finds a beautiful city,
with well-paved streets, magnificent buildings of stone and brick,
expensive public buildings, and scores of palatial residences.Many
American cities of the same size and many times older can not show as
costly buildings or as fine public works.Hotels of five and six
stories, and occupying, in several instances, almost entire blocks, are
numerous; of office buildings costing a quarter of a million dollars
each there are half a score; banks, shops, and newspapers have three-
and four-story buildings of brick and stone, while there are hundreds of
other buildings that would be creditable to any large city in America or
Europe.The Government Building in the centre of the city is a
five-story granite structure of no mean architectural beauty.In the
suburbs are many magnificent private residences of mine owners and
managers who, although not permanent residents of the city, have
invested large amounts of money, so that the short time they spend in
the country may be amid luxurious and comfortable surroundings.One of the disagreeable features of living in Johannesburg is the dust
which is present everywhere during the dry season.It rises in great,
thick clouds on the surrounding veldt, and, obscuring the sun, wholly
envelops the city in semi-darkness.One minute the air is clear and
there is not a breath of wind; several minutes later a hurricane is
blowing and blankets of dust are falling.The dust clouds generally
rise west of the city, and almost totally eclipse the sun during their
progress over the plain.Sometimes the dust storms continue only a few
minutes, but very frequently the citizens are made uncomfortable by them
for days at a time.Whenever they arrive, the doors and windows of
buildings are tightly closed, business is practically at a standstill,
and every one is miserable.It penetrates
every building, however well protected, and it lodges in the food as
well as in the drink.Pedestrians on the street are unable to see ten
feet ahead, and are compelled to walk with head bowed and with
handkerchief over the mouth and nostrils.Umbrellas and parasols are
but slight protection against it.Only the miners, a thousand feet
below the surface, escape it.When the storm has subsided the entire
city is covered with a blanket of dust ranging in thickness from an inch
on the sidewalks to an eighth of an inch on the store counters,
furniture, and in pantries.It has never been computed how great a
quantity of the dust enters a man's lungs, but the feeling that it
engenders is one of colossal magnitude.Second to the dust, the main characteristic of Johannesburg is the
inhabitants' great struggle for sudden wealth.It is doubtful whether
there is one person in the city whose ambition is less than to become
wealthy in five years at least, and then to return to his native
country.It is not a chase after affluence; it is a stampede in which
every soul in the city endeavours to be in the van.In the city and in
the mines there are hundreds of honourable ways of becoming rich, but
there are thousands of dishonourable ones; and the morals of a mining
city are not always on the highest plane.There are business men of the
strictest probity and honesty, and men whose word is as good as their
bond, but there are many more who will allow their conscience to lie
dormant so long as they remain in the country.With them the passion is
to secure money, and whether they secure it by overcharging a regular
customer, selling illicit gold, or gambling at the stock exchanges is a
matter of small moment.Tradesmen and shopkeepers will charge according
to the apparel of the patron, and will brazenly acknowledge doing so if
reminded by the one who has paid two prices for like articles the same
day.Hotels charge according to the quantity of luggage the traveller
carries, and boarding-houses compute your wealth before presenting their
bills.Street-car fares and postage stamps alone do not fluctuate in
value, but the wise man counts his change.The experiences of an American with one large business house in the city
will serve as an example of the methods of some of those who are eager
to realize their ambitions.The American spent many weeks and much
patience and money in securing photographs throughout the country, and
took the plates to a large firm in Johannesburg for development and
printing.When he returned two weeks later he was informed that the
plates and prints had been delivered a week before, and neither prayers
nor threats secured a different answer.Justice in the courts is slow
and costly, and the American was obliged to leave the country without
his property.Shortly after his departure the firm of photographers
commenced selling a choice collection of new South African photographs
which, curiously, were of the same scenes and persons photographed by
the American.Gambling may be more general in some other cities, but it can not be
more public.The more refined gamblers patronize the two stock
exchanges, and there are but few too poor to indulge in that form of
dissipation.Probably nine tenths of the inhabitants of the city travel
the stock-exchange bypath to wealth or poverty.Women and boys are as
much infected by the fever as mine owners and managers, and it would not
be slandering the citizens to say that one fourth of the conversation
heard on the streets refers to the rise and fall of stocks.The popular gathering place in the city is the street in front of one of
the stock exchanges known as "The Chains."During the session of the
exchange the street is crowded with an excited throng of men, boys, and
even women, all flushed with the excitement of betting on the rise and
fall of mining stocks in the building.Clerks, office boys, and miners
spend the lunch hour at "The Chains," either to invest their wages or to
watch the market if their money is already invested.A fall in the
value of stocks is of far greater moment to them than war, famine, or
pestilence.The passion for gambling is also satisfied by a giant lottery scheme
known as "Sweepstakes," which has the sanction of the Government.Thousands of pounds are offered as prizes at the periodical drawings,
and no true Johannesburger ever fails to secure at least one ticket for
the drawing.When there are no sessions of the stock exchanges, no
sweepstakes, horse races, ball games, or other usual opportunities for
gambling, they will bet on the arrival of the Cape train, the length of
a sermon, or the number of lashes a <DW64> criminal can endure before
fainting.Drinking is a second diversion which occupies much of the time of the
average citizen, because of the great heat and the lack of amusement.The liquor that is drunk in Johannesburg in one year would make a stream
of larger proportions and far more healthier contents than the Vaal
River in the dry season.It is a rare occurrence to see a man drink
water unless it is concealed in brandy, and at night it is even rarer
that one is seen who is not drinking.Cape Smoke, the name given to a
liquor made in Cape Colony, is credited with the ability to kill a man
before he has taken the glass from his lips, but the popular Uitlander
beverage, brandy and soda, is even more fatal in its effects.Pure
liquor is almost unobtainable, and death-dealing counterfeits from
Delagoa Bay are the substitutes.Twenty-five cents for a glass of beer
and fifty cents for brandy and soda are not deterrent prices where
ordinary mine workers receive ten dollars a day and mine managers fifty
thousand dollars a year.Of social life there is little except such as is afforded by the clubs,
of which there are several of high standing.The majority of the men
left their families in their native countries on account of the severe
climate, and that fact, combined with the prevalent idea that the
weather is too torrid to do anything unnecessary, is responsible for
Johannesburg's lack of social amenity.There are occasional dances and
receptions, but they are participated in only by newcomers who have not
yet fallen under the spell of the South African sun.The Sunday night's
musical entertainments at the Wanderer's Club are practically the only
affairs to which the average Uitlander cares to go, because he can
clothe himself for comfort and be as dignified or as undignified as he
pleases.The true Johannesburger is the most independent man in the world.When
he meets a native on the sidewalk he promptly kicks him into the street,
and if the action is resented, bullies a Boer policeman into arresting
the offender.The policeman may demur and call the Johannesburger a
"Verdomde rooinek," but he will make the arrest or receive a drubbing.He may be arrested in turn, but he is ever willing and anxious to pay a
fine for the privilege of beating a "dumb Dutchman," as he calls him.He pays little attention to the laws of the country, because he has not
had the patience to learn what they consist of, and he rests content in
knowing that his home government will rescue him through diplomatic
channels if he should run counter to the laws.He cares nothing
concerning the government of the city except as it interferes with or
assists his own private interests, but he will take advantage of every
opportunity to defy the authority of the administrators of the laws.He
despises the Boers, and continually and maliciously ridicules them on
the slightest pretexts.Specially true is this of those newspapers
which are the representatives of the Uitlander population.Venomous
editorials against the Boer Government and people appear almost daily,
and serve to widen the breach between the two classes of inhabitants.The Boer newspapers for a long time ignored the assaults of the
Uitlander press, but recently they have commenced to retaliate, and the
editorial war is a bitter one.An extract from the Randt Post will show
the nature and depth of bitterness displayed by the two classes of
newspapers:

"Though Dr.Leyds may be right, and the Johannesburg population safe in
case of war, we advise that, at the first act of war on the English
side, the women and children, and well-disposed persons of this town, be
given twenty-four hours to leave, and then the whole place be shot down;
in the event, we repeat--which God forbid!--of war coming."If, indeed, there must be shooting, then it will be on account of
seditious words and deeds of Johannesburg agitators and the
co-shareholders in Cape Town and London, and the struggle will be
promoted for no other object than the possession of the gold.Well,
then, let such action be taken that the perpetrators of these turbulent
proceedings shall, if caught, be thrown into the deep shafts of their
mines, with the debris of the batteries for a costly shroud, and that
the whole of Johannesburg, with the exception of the Afrikander wards,
be converted into a gigantic rubbish heap to serve as a mighty tombstone
for the shot-down authors of a monstrous deed."If it be known that these valuable buildings and the lives of the
wire-pullers are the price of the mines, then people will take good heed
before the torch of war is set alight.Friendly talks and protests are
no use with England.Let force and rough violence be opposed to the
intrigues and plots of Old England, and only then will the Boer remain
master."It is on Saturday nights that the bitterness of the Uitlander population
is most noticeable, since then the workers from the mines along the
Randt gather in the city and discuss their grievances, which then become
magnified with every additional glass of liquor.It is then that the
city streets and places of amusement and entertainment are crowded with
a throng that finds relaxation by abusing the Boers.The theatre
audiences laugh loudest at the coarsest jests made at the expense of the
Boers, and the bar-room crowds talk loudest when the Boers are the
subject of discussion.The abuse continues even when the not-too-sober
Uitlander, wheeled homeward at day-break by his faithful Zulu 'ricksha
boy, casts imprecations upon the Boer policeman who is guarding his
property.Johannesburg is one of the most expensive places of residence in the
world.Situated in the interior of the continent, thousands of miles
distant from the sources of food and supplies, it is natural that
commodities should be high in price.Almost all food stuffs are carried
thither from America, Europe, and Australia, and consequently the
original cost is trebled by the addition of carriage and customs duties.The most common articles of food are twice as costly as in America,
while such commodities as eggs, imported from Madeira, frequently are
scarce at a dollar a dozen.Butter from America is fifty cents a pound,
and fruits and vegetables from Cape Colony and Natal are equally high in
price and frequently unobtainable.Good board can not be obtained
anywhere for less than five dollars a day, while the best hotels and
clubs charge thrice that amount.Rentals are exceptionally high owing
to the extraordinary land values and the cost of erecting buildings.A
small, brick-lined, corrugated-iron cottage of four rooms, such as a
married mine-employee occupies, costs from fifty to seventy-five dollars
a month, while a two-story brick house in a respectable quarter of the
city rents for one hundred dollars a month.Every object in the city is mutely expressive of a vast expenditure of
money.The idea that everything--the buildings, food, horses, clothing,
machinery, and all that is to be seen--has been carried across oceans
and continents unconsciously associates itself with the cost that it has
entailed.Four-story buildings that in New York or London would be
passed without remark cause mental speculation concerning their cost,
merely because it is so patent that every brick, nail, and board in them
has been conveyed thousands of miles from foreign shores.Electric
lights and street cars, so common in American towns, appear abnormal in
the city in the veldt, and instantly suggest an outlay of great amounts
of money even to the minds which are not accustomed to reducing
everything to dollars and pounds.Leaving the densely settled centre of
the city, where land is worth as much as choice plots on Broadway, and
wandering into the suburbs where the great mines are, the idea of cost
is more firmly implanted into the mind.The huge buildings, covering
acres of ground and thousands of tons of the most costly machinery, seem
to be of natural origin rather than of human handiwork.It is almost
beyond belief that men should be daring enough to convey hundreds of
steamer loads of lumber and machinery halfway around the world at
inestimable cost merely for the yellow metal that Nature has hidden so
far distant from the great centres of population.The cosmopolitanism of the city is a feature which impresses itself most
indelibly upon the mind.In a half-day's stroll in the city
representatives of all the peoples of the earth, with the possible
exception of the American Indian, Eskimos, and South Sea islanders, will
be seen variously engaged in the struggle for gold.On the floors of the
stock exchanges are money barons or their agents, as energetic and sharp
as their prototypes of Wall and Throckmorton Streets.These are chiefly
British, French, and German.Outside, between "The Chains," are readily
discernible the distinguishing features of the Americans, Afrikanders,
Portuguese, Russians, Spaniards, and Italians.A few steps distant is
Commissioner Street, the principal thoroughfare, where the surging
throng is composed of so many different racial representatives that an
analysis of it is not an easy undertaking.He is considered an expert
who can name the native country of every man on the street, and if he
can distinguish between an American and a Canadian he is credited with
being a wise man.In the throng is the tall, well-clothed Briton, with silk hat and frock
coat, closely followed by a sparsely clad Matabele, bearing his master's
account books or golf-sticks.Near them a Chinaman, in circular
red-topped hat and flowing silk robes, is having a heated argument in
broken English with an Irish hansom-driver.Crossing the street are two
stately Arabs, in turbans and white robes, jostling easy-going Indian
coolies with their canes.Bare-headed Cingalese, their long, shiny hair
tied in knots and fastened down with circular combs, noiselessly gliding
along, or stopping suddenly to trade Oriental jewelry for Christian's
money; Malays, Turks, Egyptians, Persians, and New-Zealanders, each with
his distinctive costume; Hottentots, Matabeles, Zulus, Mashonas,
Basutos, and the representatives of hundreds of the other native races
south of the Zambezi pass by in picturesque lack of bodily adornment.It is an imposing array, too, for the majority of the throng is composed
of moderately wealthy persons, and even in the centre of Africa wealth
carries with it opportunities for display.John Chinaman will ride in a
'ricksha to his joss-house with as much conscious pride as the European
or American will sit in his brougham or automobile.Money is as easily
spent as made in Johannesburg, and it is a cosmopolitan habit to spend
it in a manner so that everybody will know it is being spent.To make a
display of some sort is necessary to the citizen's happiness.If he is
not of sufficient importance to have his name in the subsidized
newspapers daily he will seek notoriety by wearing a thousand pounds'
worth of diamonds on the street or making astonishing bets at the
race-track.In that little universe on the veldt every man tries to be
superior to his neighbour in some manner that may be patent to all the
city.When it is taken into consideration that almost all the
contestants were among the cleverest and shrewdest men in the countries
whence they came to Johannesburg, and not among the riffraff and
failures, then the intensity of the race for superiority can be
imagined.Johannesburg might be named the City of Surprises.Its youthful
existence has been fraught with astonishing works.It was born in a
day, and one day's revolution almost ended its existence.It grew from
the desert veldt into a garden of gold.Its granite residences, brick
buildings, and iron and steel mills sprang from blades of grass and
sprigs of weeds.It has transformed the beggar into a millionaire, and
it has seen starving men in its streets.It harbours men from every
nation and climate, but it is a home for few.It is far from the centre
of the earth's civilization, but it has often attracted the whole
world's attention.It supports its children, but by them it is cursed.Its god is in the earth upon which it rests, and its hope of future life
in that which it brings forth.And all this because a man upturned the
soil and called it gold.But all this was too good to last long.One morning, on coming down to
breakfast, bright-hearted and beaming as ever, I found on my plate,
instead of fried soles, a long blue official letter, "On her Majesty's
Service."It was my appointment to the `Victory,'--"additional for
service at Haslar Hospital."As soon as I read it the enchantment was
dissolved, the spell was broken; and when I tried that day to find new
pleasures, new sources of amusement, I utterly failed, and found with
disgust that it was but a common work-a-day world after all, and that
London was very like other places in that respect.I lingered but a few
more days in town, and then hastened by train to Portsmouth to take up
my appointment--to join the service in reality.It was a cold raw morning, with a grey and cheerless sky, and a biting
south-wester blowing up channel, and ruffling the water in the Solent.Alongside of the pier the boats and wherries were all in motion,
scratching and otherwise damaging their gunwales against the stones, as
they were lifted up and down at the pleasure of the wavelets.The
boatmen themselves were either drinking beer at adjacent bars, or
stamping up and down the quay with the hopes of enticing a little warmth
to their half-frozen toes, and rubbing the ends of their noses for a
like purpose.Suddenly there arose a great commotion among them, and
they all rushed off to surround a gentleman in brand-new naval uniform,
who was looking, with his mouth open, for a boat, in every place where a
boat was most unlikely to be.Knowing at a glance that he was a
stranger, they very generously, each and all of them, offered their
services, and wanted to row him somewhere--anywhere.After a great deal
of fighting and scrambling among themselves, during which the officer
got tugged here and tugged there a good many times, he was at last
bundled into a very dirty cobble, into which a rough-looking boatman
bounded after him and at once shoved off.The naval officer was myself--the reader's obsequious slave.As for the
boatman, one thing must be said in his favour, he seemed to be a person
of religious character--in one thing at least, for, on the Day of
Judgment, I, for one, will not be able to turn round and say to him "I
was a stranger and ye took me not in," for he did take me in.In fact,
Portsmouth, as a town, is rather particular on this point of
Christianity: they do take strangers in.asked the jolly waterman, leaning a moment on his oars."Be going for to join, I dessay, sir?""You are right," said I; "but have the goodness to pull so that I may
not be wet through on both sides.""I'll pay here," said I, "before we go alongside.""That's all, sir--distance is short you know.""Do you mean to say," said I, "that you really mean to charge--"

"Just three bob," interrupting me; "flag's up--can see for yourself,
sir.""The flag, you see--I mean my good man--don't tell me about a flag, I'm
too far north for you;" and I tried to look as northish as possible."Why, sir," said the man of oars, with a pitying expression of
countenance and voice, "flag means double fare--anybody'll tell you
that, sir."said I; "don't tell me that any one takes the trouble of
hoisting a flag in order to fill your confounded pockets; there is half
a crown, and not a penny more do you get from me.""Well, sir, o' condition you has me again, sir, you know, sir,--and my
name's McDonald;" and he pocketed the money, which I afterwards
discovered was a _leetle_ too much."McDonald," thought I--"my
grandmother's name; the rascal thinks to come round me by calling
himself a Scotchman--the idea of a McDonald being a waterman!""Sir," said I, aloud, "it is my unbiassed opinion and firm conviction
that you are--" I was going to add "a most unmitigated blackguard," but
I noticed that he was a man of six feet two, with breadth in proportion,
so I left the sentence unfinished.We were now within sight of the bristling sides of the old `Victory,' on
the quarter-deck of which fell the great and gallant Nelson in the hour
of battle and triumph; and I was a young officer about to join that
service which can boast of so many brave and noble men, and brave and
noble deeds; and one would naturally expect that I would indulge in a
few dreams of chivalry and romance, picture to myself a bright and
glorious future, pounds' weight of medals and crosses, including the
Victoria, kiss the hilt of my sword, and all that sort of thing.I was too wretchedly cold for one reason, and the only feeling I
had was one of shyness; as for duty, I knew I could and would do that,
as most of my countrymen had done before me; so I left castle-building
to the younger sons of noblemen or gentry, whose parents can afford to
allow them two or three hundred pounds a year to eke out their pay and
smooth the difficulties of the service.Not having been fortunate
enough to be born with even a horn spoon in my mouth, I had to be
content with my education as my fortune, and my navy pay as my only
income."Stabird side, I dessay, sir?""Certainly," said I, having a glimmering idea that it must be the proper
side.A few minutes after--"The Admiral's gig is going there, sir,--better
wait a bit."I looked on shore and _did_ see a gig, and two horses
attached to it."No," said I, "decidedly not, he can't see us here, man.I suppose you
want to go sticking your dirty wet oars in the air, do you?"--(I had
seen pictures of this performance)."Drive on, I mean pull ahead, my
hearty"--a phrase I had heard at the theatre, and considered highly
nautical.The waterman obeyed, and here is what came of it.We were just
approaching the ladder, when I suddenly became sensible of a rushing
noise.I have a dim recollection of seeing a long, many-oared boat,
carrying a large red flag, and with an old grey-haired officer sitting
astern; of hearing a voice--it might have belonged to the old man of the
sea, for anything I could have told to the contrary--float down the
wind,--

"Clear the way with that (something) bumboat!"Then came a crash, my
heels flew up--I had been sitting on the gunwale--and overboard I went
with a splash, just as some one else in the long boat sang out.there was a little too much way for me.When I came
to the surface of the water, I found myself several yards from the
ladder, and at once struck out for it.There was a great deal of noise
and shouting, and a sailor held towards me the sharp end of a boathook;
but I had no intention of being lugged out as if I were a pair of canvas
trowsers, and, calling to the sailor to keep his pole to himself--did he
want to knock my eye out?--I swam to the ladder and ascended.Thus then
I joined the service, and, having entered at the foot of the ladder, I
trust some day to find myself at the top of it.And, talking of joining the service, I here beg to repudiate, as an
utter fabrication, the anecdote--generally received as authentic in the
service--of the Scotch doctor, who, going to report himself for the
first time on board of the `Victory,' knocked at the door, and inquired
(at a marine, I think), "Is this the Royal Nauvy?--'cause I'm come till
jine."The story bears "fib" on the face of it, for there is not a
Scottish schoolboy but knows that one ship does not make a navy, any
more than one swallow does a summer.But, dear intending candidate, if you wish to do the right thing, array
yourself quietly in frock-coat, cap--not cocked hat, remember--and
sword, and go on board your ship in any boat you please, only keep out
of the way of gigs.When you arrive on board, don't be expecting to see
the admiral, because you'll be disappointed; but ask a sailor or marine
to point you out the midshipman of the watch, and request the latter to
show you the commander.Make this request civilly, mind you; do not
pull his ear, because, if big and hirsute, he might beat you, which
would be a bad beginning.When you meet the commander, don't rush up
and shake him by the hand, and begin talking about the weather; walk
respectfully up to him, and lift your cap as you would to a lady; upon
which he will hurriedly point to his nose with his forefinger, by way of
returning the salute, while at the same time you say--

"_Come_ on board, sir--to _join_, sir."It is the custom of the Service to make this remark in a firm, bold,
decided tone, placing the emphasis on the "_come_" to show clearly that
you _did come_, and that no one kicked, or dragged, or otherwise brought
you on board against your will.The proper intonation of the remark may
be learned from any polite waiter at a hotel, when he tells you,
"Dinner's ready, sir, please;" or it may be heard in the "Now then,
gents," of the railway guard of the period.Having reported yourself to the man of three stripes, you must not
expect that he will shake hands, or embrace you, ask you on shore to
tea, and introduce you to his wife.No, if he is good-natured, and has
not had a difference of opinion with the captain lately, he _may_
condescend to show you your cabin and introduce you to your messmates;
but if he is out of temper, he will merely ask your name, and, on your
telling him, remark, "Humph!"then call the most minute midshipman to
conduct you to your cabin, being at the same time almost certain to
mispronounce your name.Say your name is Struthers, he will call you
Stutters."Here, Mr Pigmy, conduct Mr Stutters to his cabin, and show him where
the gunroom--ah!I beg his pardon, the wardroom--lies.""Ay, ay, sir," says the middy, and skips off at a round trot, obliging
you either to adopt the same ungraceful mode of progression, or lose
sight of him altogether, and have to wander about, feeling very much
from home, until some officer passing takes pity on you and leads you to
the wardroom.It is a way they have in the service, or rather it is the custom of the
present Director-General, not to appoint the newly-entered medical
officer at once to a sea-going ship, but instead to one or other of the
naval hospitals for a few weeks or even months, in order that he may be
put up to the ropes, as the saying is, or duly initiated into the
mysteries of service and routine of duty.This is certainly a good
idea, although it is a question whether it would not be better to adopt
the plan they have at Netley, and thus put the navy and army on the same
footing.Haslar Hospital at Portsmouth is a great rambling barrack-looking block
of brick building, with a yard or square surrounded by high walls in
front, and with two wings extending from behind, which, with the chapel
between, form another and smaller square.There are seldom fewer than a thousand patients within, and, independent
of a whole regiment of male and female nurses, sick-bay-men, servants,
cooks, _et id genus omne_, there is a regular staff of officers,
consisting of a captain--of what use I have yet to learn--two medical
inspector-generals, generally three or four surgeons, the same number of
regularly appointed assistant-surgeons, besides from ten to twenty
acting assistant-surgeons [Note 1] waiting for appointments, and doing
duty as supernumeraries.Of this last class I myself was a member.Soon as the clock tolled the hour of eight in the morning, the
staff-surgeon of our side of the hospital stalked into the duty cabin,
where we, the assistants, were waiting to receive him.Immediately
after, we set out on the morning visit, each of us armed with a little
board or palette to be used as a writing-desk, an excise inkstand slung
in a buttonhole, and a quill behind the ear.The large doors were
thrown open, the beds neat and tidy, and the nurses "standing by."Up
each side of the long wards, from bed to bed, we journeyed; notifying
the progress of each case, repeating the treatment here, altering or
suspending it there, and performing small operations in another place;
listening attentively to tales of aches and pains, and hopes and fears,
and just in a sort of general way acting the part of good Samaritans.From one ward to another we went, up and down long staircases, along
lengthy corridors, into wards in the attics, into wards on the basement,
and into wards below ground,--fracture wards, Lazarus wards, erysipelas
wards, men's wards, officers' wards; and thus we spent the time till a
little past nine, by which time the relief of so much suffering had
given us an appetite, and we hurried off to the messroom to breakfast.The medical mess at Haslar is one of the finest in the service.Attached to the room is a nice little apartment, fitted up with a
bagatelle-table, and boxing gloves and foils _ad libitum_.And, sure
enough, you might walk many a weary mile, or sail many a knot, without
meeting twenty such happy faces as every evening surrounded our
dinner-table, without beholding twenty such bumper glasses raised at
once to the toast of Her Majesty the Queen, and without hearing twenty
such good songs, or five times twenty such yarns and original bons-mots,
as you would at Haslar Medical Mess.Yet I must confess we partook in
but a small degree indeed of the solemn quietude of Wordsworth's--

  "--Party in a parlour cramm'd,
  Some sipping punch, some sipping tea,
  But, as you by their faces see,
  All silent--and all damned."I do not deny that we were a little noisy at times, and that on several
occasions, having eaten and drunken till we were filled, we rose up to
dance, and consequently received a _polite_ message from the inspector
whose house was adjoining, requesting us to "stop our _confounded_ row;"
but then the old man was married, and no doubt his wife was at the
bottom of it.Duty was a thing that did not fall to the lot of us supers every day.We took it turn about, and hard enough work it used to be too.As soon
as breakfast was over, the medical officer on duty would hie him away to
the receiving-room, and seat himself at the large desk; and by-and-bye
the cases would begin to pour in.First there would arrive, say three
or four blue-jackets, with their bags under their arms, in charge of an
assistant-surgeon, then a squad of marines, then more blue-jackets, then
more red-coats, and so the game of _rouge-et-noir_ would go on during
the day.The officer on duty has first to judge whether or not the case
is one that can be admitted,--that is, which cannot be conveniently
treated on board; he has then to appoint the patient a bed in a proper
ward, and prescribe for him, almost invariably a bath and a couple of
pills.Besides, he has to enter the previous history of the case,
verbatim, into each patient's case-book, and if the cases are numerous,
and the assistant-surgeon who brings them has written an elaborate
account of each disease, the duty-officer will have had his work cut out
for him till dinner-time at least.Before the hour of the patient's
dinner, this gentleman has also to glance into each ward, to see if
everything is right, and if there are any complaints.Even when ten or
eleven o'clock at night brings sleep and repose to others, his work is
not yet over; he has one other visit to pay any time during the night
through all his wards.Then with dark-lantern and slippers you may meet
him, gliding ghost-like along the corridors or passages, lingering at
ward doors, listening on the staircases, smelling and snuffing, peeping
and keeking, and endeavouring by eye, or ear, or nose, to detect the
slightest irregularity among the patients or nurses, such as burning
lights without orders, gambling by the light of the fire, or smoking.This visit paid, he may return to his virtuous cabin, and sleep as
soundly as he chooses.Very few of the old surgeons interfere with the duties of their
assistants, but there _be_ men who seem to think you have merely come to
the service to learn, not to practise your profession, and therefore
they treat you as mere students, or at the best hobble-de-hoy doctors.Of this class was Dr Gruff, a man whom I would back against the whole
profession for caudle, clyster, castor-oil, or linseed poultice; but
who, I rather suspect, never prescribed a dose of chiretta, santonin, or
lithia-water in his life.He came to me one duty-day, in a great hurry,
and so much excited that I judged he had received some grievous bodily
ailment, or suffered some severe family bereavement."Well, sir," he cried; "I hear, sir, you have put a case of ulcer into
the erysipelas ward."This remark, not partaking of the nature of question, I thought required
no answer."Is it true, sir?--is it true?""It is, sir," was the reply."And what do you mean by it, sir?he
exclaimed, waxing more and more wroth."I thought, sir--" I began."Yes, sir," continued I, my Highland blood getting uppermost, "I _did_
think that, the case being one of ulcer of an _erysipelatous_ nature, I
was--"

"Erysipelatous ulcer!"said he, "that alters the
case.I beg your pardon;" and he
trotted off again."All right," thought I, "old Gruff.But although there are not wanting medical officers in the service who,
on being promoted to staff-surgeon, appear to forget that ever they wore
less than three stripes, and can keep company with no one under the rank
of commander, I am happy to say they are few and far between, and every
year getting more few and farther between.It is a fine thing to be appointed for, say three or four years to a
home hospital; in fact, it is the assistant-surgeon's highest ambition.Next, in point of comfort, would be an appointment at the Naval Hospital
of Malta, Cape of Good Hope, or China.The acting assistant-surgeons are those who have not as yet
served the probationary year, or been confirmed.They are liable to be
dismissed without a court-martial.A STORM IN BISCAY BAY.A WORD ON BASS'S BEER.For the space of six weeks I lived in clover at Haslar, and at the end
of that time my appointment to a sea-going ship came.It was the
pleasure of their Lordships the Commissioners, that I should take my
passage to the Cape of Good Hope in a frigate, which had lately been put
in commission and was soon about to sail.Arrived there, I was to be
handed over to the flag-ship on that station for disposal, like so many
stones of salt pork.On first entering the service every medical
officer is sent for one commission (three to five years) to a foreign
station; and it is certainly very proper too that the youngest and
strongest men, rather than the oldest, should do the rough work of the
service, and go to the most unhealthy stations.The frigate in which I was ordered passage was to sail from Plymouth.To that town I was accordingly sent by train, and found the good ship in
such a state of internal chaos--painters, carpenters, sail-makers, and
sailors; armourers, blacksmiths, gunners, and tailors; every one engaged
at his own trade, with such an utter disregard of order or regularity,
while the decks were in such confusion, littered with tools, nails,
shavings, ropes, and spars, among which I scrambled, and over which I
tumbled, getting into everybody's way, and finding so little rest for
the sole of my foot, that I was fain to beg a week's leave, and glad
when I obtained it.On going on board again at the end of that time, a
very different appearance presented itself; everything was in its proper
place, order and regularity were everywhere.The decks were white and
clean, the binnacles, the brass and mahogany work polished, the gear all
taut, the ropes coiled, and the vessel herself sitting on the water
saucy as the queen of ducks, with her pennant flying and her beautiful
ensign floating gracefully astern.The gallant ship was ready for sea,
had been unmoored, had made her trial trips, and was now anchored in the
Sound.From early morning to busy noon, and from noon till night, boats
glided backwards and forwards between the ship and the shore, filled
with the friends of those on board, or laden with wardroom and gunroom
stores.Among these might have been seen a shore-boat, rowed by two
sturdy watermen, and having on board a large sea-chest, with a naval
officer on top of it, grasping firmly a Cremona in one hand and holding
a hat-box in the other.The boat was filled with any number of smaller
packages, among which were two black portmanteaus, warranted to be the
best of leather, and containing the gentleman's dress and undress
uniforms; these, however, turned out to be mere painted pasteboard, and
in a very few months the cockroaches--careless, merry-hearted
creatures--after eating up every morsel of them, turned their attention
to the contents, on which they dined and supped for many days, till the
officer's dress-coat was like a meal-sieve, and his pantaloons might
have been conveniently need for a landing-net.This, however, was a
matter of small consequence, for, contrary to the reiterated assurance
of his feline friend, no one portion of this officer's uniform held out
for a longer period than six months, the introduction of any part of his
person into the corresponding portion of his raiment having become a
matter of matutinal anxiety and distress, lest a solution of continuity
in the garment might be the unfortunate result.About six o'clock on a beautiful Wednesday evening, early in the month
of May, our gallant and saucy frigate turned her bows seaward and slowly
steamed away from amidst the fleet of little boats that--crowded with
the unhappy wives and sweethearts of the sailors--had hung around us all
the afternoon.Puffing and blowing a great deal, and apparently panting
to be out and away at sea, the good ship nevertheless left her anchorage
but slowly, and withal reluctantly, her tears falling thick and fast on
the quarter-deck as she went.The band was playing a slow and mournful air, by way of keeping up our
spirits._I_ had no friends to say farewell to, there was no tear-bedimmed eye to
gaze after me until I faded in distance; so I stood on the poop, leaning
over the bulwarks, after the fashion of Vanderdecken, captain of the
Flying Dutchman, and equally sad and sorrowful-looking.And what did I
see from my elevated situation?A moving picture, a living panorama; a
bright sky sprinkled with a few fleecy cloudlets, over a blue sea all in
motion before a fresh breeze of wind; a fleet of little boats astern,
filled with picturesquely dressed seamen and women waving handkerchiefs;
the long breakwater lined with a dense crowd of sorrowing friends, each
anxious to gain one last look of the dear face he may never see more.Yonder is the grey-haired father, yonder the widowed mother, the
affectionate brother, the loving sister, the fond wife, the beloved
sweetheart,--all are there; and not a sigh that is sighed, not a tear
that is shed, not a prayer that is breathed, but finds a response in the
bosom of some loved one on board.To the right are green hills,
people-clad likewise, while away in the distance the steeple of many a
church "points the way to happier spheres," and on the flagstaff at the
port-admiral's house is floating the signal "Fare thee well."The band has ceased to play, the sailors have given their last ringing
cheer, even the echoes of which have died away, and faintly down the
wind comes the sound of the evening bells.The men are gathered in
little groups on deck, and there is a tenderness in their landward gaze,
and a pathos in their rough voices, that one would hardly expect to
find."Yonder's my Poll, Jack," says one.the poor lass is
crying; blowed if I think I'll ever see her more.""There," says another, "is _my_ old girl on the breakwater, beside the
old cove in the red nightcap.""That's my father, Bill," answers a third."God bless the dear old
chap?""Good-bye, Jean; good-bye, lass.Blessed if I
don't feel as if I could make a big baby of myself and cry outright."Dick, Dick," exclaims an honest-looking tar; "I see'd my poor wife
tumble down; she had wee Johnnie in her arms, and--and what will I do?""Keep up your heart, to be sure," answers a tall, rough son of a gun."There, she has righted again, only a bit of a swoon ye see.I've got
neither sister, wife, nor mother, so surely it's _me_ that ought to be
making a noodle of myself; but where's the use?"An hour or two later we were steaming across channel, with nothing
visible but the blue sea all before us, and the chalky cliffs of
Cornwall far behind, with the rosy blush of the setting sun lingering on
their summits.Then the light faded from the sky, the gloaming star shone out in the
east, big waves began to tumble in, and the night breeze blew cold and
chill from off the broad Atlantic Ocean.Tired and dull, weary and sad, I went below to the wardroom and seated
myself on a rocking chair.It was now that I began to feel the
discomfort of not having a cabin.Being merely a supernumerary or
passenger, such a luxury was of course out of the question, even had I
been an admiral.I was to have a screen berth, or what a landsman would
call a canvas tent, on the main or fighting deck, but as yet it was not
rigged.Had I never been to sea before, I would have now felt very
wretched indeed; but having roughed it in Greenland and Davis Straits in
small whaling brigs, I had got over the weakness of sea-sickness; yet
notwithstanding I felt all the thorough prostration both of mind and
body, which the first twenty-four hours at sea often produces in the
oldest and best of sailors, so that I was only too happy when I at last
found myself within canvas.By next morning the wind had freshened, and when I turned out I found
that the steam had been turned off, and that we were bowling along
before a ten-knot breeze.All that day the wind blew strongly from the
N.N.E., and increased as night came on to a regular gale of wind.I had
seen some wild weather in the Greenland Ocean, but never anything
before, nor since, to equal the violence of the storm on that dreadful
night, in the Bay of Biscay.We were running dead before the wind at
twelve o'clock, when the gale was at its worst, and when the order to
light fires and get up steam had been given.Just then we were making
fourteen knots, with only a foresail, a fore-topsail, and main-topsail,
the latter two close-reefed.I was awakened by a terrific noise on
deck, and I shall not soon forget that awakening.The ship was leaking
badly both at the ports and scupper-holes; so that the maindeck all
around was flooded with water, which lifted my big chest every time the
roll of the vessel allowed it to flow towards it.To say the ship was
rolling would express but poorly the indescribably disagreeable
wallowing motion of the frigate, while men were staggering with anxious
faces from gun to gun, seeing that the lashings were all secure; so
great was the strain on the cable-like ropes that kept them in their
places.The shot had got loose from the racks, and were having a small
cannonade on their own account, to the no small consternation of the men
whose duty it was to re-secure them.It was literally sea without and
sea within, for the green waves were pouring down the main hatchway,
adding to the amount of water already _below_, where the chairs and
other articles of domestic utility were all afloat and making voyages of
discovery from one officer's cabin to another.On the upper deck all was darkness, confusion, and danger, for both the
fore and main-topsails had been carried away at the same time, reducing
us to one sail--the foresail.The noise and crackling of the riven
canvas, mingling with the continuous roar of the storm, were at times
increased by the rattle of thunder and the rush of rain-drops, while the
lightning played continually around the slippery masts and cordage.About one o'clock, a large ship, apparently unmanageable, was dimly seen
for one moment close aboard of us--had we come into collision the
consequences must have been dreadful;--and thus for two long hours,
_till steam was got up_, did we fly before the gale, after which the
danger was comparatively small.Having spent its fury, having in fact blown itself out of breath, the
wind next day retired to its cave, and the waves got smaller and
beautifully less, till peace and quietness once more reigned around us.Going on deck one morning I found we were anchored under the very shadow
of a steep rock, and not far from a pretty little town at the foot of a
high mountain, which was itself covered to the top with trees and
verdure, with the white walls of many a quaint-looking edifice peeping
through the green--boats, laden with fruit and fish and turtle,
surrounded the ship.The island of Madeira and town, of Funchal.As
there was no pier, we had to land among the stones.The principal
amusement of English residents here seems to be lounging about, cheroot
in mouth, beneath the rows of trees that droop over the pavements,
getting carried about in portable hammocks, and walking or riding (I
rode, and, not being able to get my horse to move at a suitable pace, I
looked behind, and found the boy from whom I had hired him sticking like
a leech to my animal's tail, nor would he be shaken off--nor could the
horse be induced to kick him off; this is the custom of the Funchalites,
and a funny one it is) to the top of the mountain, for the pleasure of
coming down in a sleigh, a distance of two miles, in twice as many
minutes, while the least deviation from the path would result in a
terrible smash against the wall of either side, but I never heard of any
such accident occurring.Three days at Madeira, and up anchor again; our next place of call being
Saint Helena.Every one has heard of the gentleman who wanted to
conquer the world but couldn't, who tried to beat the British but
didn't, who staked his last crown at a game of _loo_, and losing fled,
and fleeing was chased, and being chased was caught and chained by the
leg, like an obstreperous game-cock, to a rock somewhere in the middle
of the sea, on which he stood night and day for years, with his arms
folded across his chest, and his cocked hat wrong on, a warning to the
unco-ambitious.The rock was Saint Helena, and a very beautiful rock it
is too, hill and dell and thriving town, its mountain-sides tilled and
its straths and glens containing many a fertile little farm.It is the
duty of every one who touches the shores of this far-famed island to
make a pilgrimage to Longwood, the burial-place of the "great man."I
have no intention of describing this pilgrimage, for this has been done
by dozens before my time, or, if not, it ought to have been: I shall
merely add a very noticeable fact, which others may not perchance have
observed--_both sides_ of the road all the way to the tomb are strewn
with _Bass's beer-bottles_, empty of course, and at the grave itself
there are hogsheads of them; and the same is the case at every place
which John Bull has visited, or where English foot has ever trodden.The rule holds good all over the world; and in the Indian Ocean,
whenever I found an uninhabited island, or even reef which at some
future day would be an island, if I did not likewise find an empty
beer-bottle, I at once took possession in the name of Queen Victoria,
giving three hips!thrice, and singing "For he's a jolly
good fellow," without any very distinct notion as to who _was_ the jolly
fellow; also adding more decidedly "which nobody can deny"--there being
no one on the island to deny it.England has in this way acquired much additional territory at my hands,
without my having as yet received any very substantial recompense for my
services.THE MODERN RODERICK RANDOM.The duties of the assistant-surgeon--the modern Roderick Random--on
board a line-of-battle ship are seldom very onerous in time of peace,
and often not worth mentioning.Suppose, for example, the reader is
that officer.At five bells--half-past six--in the morning, if you
happen to be a light sleeper, you will be sensible of some one gliding
silently into your cabin, rifling your pockets, and extracting your
watch, your money, and other your trinkets; but do not jump out of bed,
pray, with the intention of collaring him; it is no thief--only your
servant.Formerly this official used to be a marine, with whom on
joining your ship you bargained in the following manner.The marine walked up to you and touched his front hair, saying at the
same time,--

"_I_ don't mind looking arter you, sir," or "I'll do for you, sir."On
which you would reply,--

"All right!and he would answer "Cheeks," or whatever
his name might be.(Cheeks, that is the real Cheeks, being a sort of
visionary soldier--a phantom marine--and very useful at times, answering
in fact to the Nobody of higher quarters, who is to blame for so many
things,--"Nobody is to blame," and "Cheeks is to blame," being
synonymous sentences.)Now-a-days Government kindly allows each commissioned officer one half
of a servant, or one whole one between two officers, which, at times, is
found to be rather an awkward arrangement; as, for instance, you and,
say, the lieutenant of marines, have each the half of the same servant,
and you wish your half to go on shore with a message, and the lieutenant
requires his half to remain on board: the question then comes to be one
which only the wisdom of Solomon could solve, in the same way that
Alexander the Great loosed the Gordian knot.Your servant, then, on entering your cabin in the morning, carefully and
quietly deposits the contents of your pockets on your table, and, taking
all your clothes and your boots in his arms, silently flits from view,
and shortly after re-enters, having in the interval neatly folded and
brushed them.You are just turning round to go to sleep again, when--

"Six bells, sir, please," remarks your man, laying his hand on your
elbow, and giving you a gentle shake to insure your resuscitation, and
which will generally have the effect of causing you to spring at once
from your cot, perhaps in your hurry nearly upsetting the cup of
delicious ship's cocoa which he has kindly saved to you from his own
breakfast--a no small sacrifice either, if you bear in mind that his own
allowance is by no means very large, and that his breakfast consists of
cocoa and biscuits alone--these last too often containing more weevils
than flour.As you hurry into your bath, your servant coolly informs
you--

"Plenty of time, sir."Then," you inquire, "it isn't six bells?""Not a bit on it, sir," he replies; "wants the quarter."At seven o'clock exactly you make your way forward to the sick-bay, on
the lower deck at the ship's bows.Now, this making your way forward
isn't by any means such an easy task as one might imagine; for at that
hour the deck is swarming with the men at their toilet, stripped to the
waist, every man at his tub, lathering, splashing, scrubbing and
rubbing, talking, laughing, joking, singing, sweating, and swearing.Finding your way obstructed, you venture to touch one mildly on the bare
back, as a hint to move aside and let you pass; the man immediately
damns your eyes, then begs pardon, and says he thought it was Bill "at
his lark again."Another who is bending down over his tub you touch
more firmly on the _os innominatum_, and ask him in a free and easy sort
of tone to "slue round there."He "slues round," very quickly too, but
unfortunately in the wrong direction, and ten to one capsizes you in a
tub of dirty soapsuds.Having picked yourself up, you pursue your
journey, and sing out as a general sort of warning--

For the benefit of those happy individuals who never saw, or had to eat,
weevils, I may here state that they are small beetles of the exact size
and shape of the common woodlouse, and that the taste is rather insipid,
with a slight flavour of boiled beans.Never have tasted the woodlouse,
but should think the flavour would be quite similar."Gangway there, lads," which causes at least a dozen of these worthies
to pass such ironical remarks to their companions as--

"Out of the doctor's way there, Tom.""Let the gentleman pass, can't you, Jack?""Port your helm, Mat; the doctor wants you to.""Round with your stern, Bill; the surgeon's _mate_ is a passing.""Kick that donkey Jones out of the doctor's road,"--while at the same
time it is always the speaker himself who is in the way.At last, however, you reach the sick-bay in safety, and retire within
the screen.Here, if a strict service man, you will find the surgeon
already seated; and presently the other assistant enters, and the work
is begun.There is a sick-bay man, or dispenser, and a sick-bay cook,
attached to the medical department.The surgeon generally does the
brain-work, and the assistants the finger-work; and, to their shame be
it spoken, there are some surgeons too proud to consult their younger
brethren, whom they treat as assistant-drudges, not assistant-surgeons.At eight o'clock--before or after,--the work is over, and you are off to
breakfast.At nine o'clock the drum beats, when every one, not otherwise engaged,
is required to muster on the quarter-deck, every officer as he comes up
lifting his cap, not to the captain, but to the Queen.After inspection
the parson reads prayers; you are then free to write, or read, or
anything else in reason you choose; and, if in harbour, you may go on
shore--boats leaving the ship at regular hours for the convenience of
the officers--always premising that one medical man be left on board, in
case of accident.In most foreign ports where a ship may be lying,
there is no want of both pleasure and excitement on shore.Take for
example the little town of Simon's, about twenty miles from Cape Town,
with a population of not less than four thousand of Englishmen, Dutch,
Malays, Caffres, and Hottentots.The bay is large, and almost
landlocked.The little white town is built along the foot of a lofty
mountain.Beautiful walks can be had in every direction, along the hard
sandy sea-beach, over the mountains and on to extensive table-lands, or
away up into dark rocky dingles and heath-clad glens.Nothing can
surpass the beauty of the scenery, or the gorgeous loveliness of the
wild heaths and geraniums everywhere abounding.There is a good hotel
and billiard-room; and you can shoot where, when, and what you please--
monkeys, pigeons, rock rabbits, wild ducks, or cobra-di-capellas.If
you long for more society, or want to see life, get a day or two days'
leave.Rise at five o'clock; the morning will be lovely and clear, with
the mist rising from its flowery bed on the mountain's brow, and the
sun, large and red, entering on a sky to which nor pen nor pencil could
do justice.The cart is waiting for you at the hotel, with an awning
spread above.Jump in: crack goes the long Caffre whip; away with a
plunge and a jerk go the three pairs of Caffre horses, and along the
sea-shore you dash, with the cool sea-breeze in your face, and the
water, green and clear, rippling up over the horses' feet; then, amid
such scenery, with such exhilarating weather, in such a life-giving
climate, if you don't feel a glow of pleasure that will send the blood
tingling through your veins, from the points of your ten toes to the
extreme end of your eyelashes, there must be something radically and
constitutionally wrong with you, and the sooner you go on board and dose
yourself with calomel and jalap the better.Arrived at Cape Town, a few introductions will simply throw the whole
city at your command, and all it contains.I do not intend this as a complete sketch of your trip, or I would have
mentioned some of the many beautiful spots and places of interest you
pass on the road--Rathfeldas for example, a hotel halfway, a house
buried in sweetness; and the country round about, with its dark waving
forests, its fruitful fields and wide-spreading vineyards, where the
grape seems to grow almost without cultivation; its comfortable
farm-houses; and above all its people, kind, generous, and hospitable as
the country is prolific.So you see, dear reader, a navy surgeon's life hath its pleasures.and sorry I am to add, its sufferings too; for a few
pages farther on the picture must change: if we get the lights we must
needs take the shadows also.ENEMY ON THE PORT BOW.We will suppose that the reader still occupies the position of
assistant-surgeon in a crack frigate or saucy line-of-battle ship.If
you go on shore for a walk in the forenoon you may return to lunch at
twelve; or if you have extended your ramble far into the country, or
gone to visit a friend or lady-love--though for the latter the gloaming
hour is to be preferred--you will in all probability have succeeded in
establishing an appetite by half-past five, when the officers'
dinner-boat leaves the pier.Now, I believe there are few people in the world to whom a good dinner
does not prove an attraction, and this is what in a large ship one is
always pretty sure of, more especially on guest-nights, which are
evenings set apart--one every week--for the entertainment of the
officers' friends, one or more of whom any officer may invite, by
previously letting the mess-caterer know of his intention.The
mess-caterer is the officer who has been elected to superintend the
victualling, as the wine-caterer does the liquor department, and a
by-no-means-enviable position it is, and consequently it is for ever
changing hands.Sailors are proverbial growlers, and, indeed, a certain
amount of growling is, and ought to be, permitted in every mess; but it
is scarcely fair for an officer, because his breakfast does not please
him, or if he can't get butter to his cheese after dinner, to launch
forth his indignation at the poor mess-caterer, who most likely is doing
all he can to please.These growlers too never speak right out or
directly to the point.It is all under-the-table stabbing."Such and such a ship that I was in," says growler first, "and such and
such a mess--"

"Oh, by George!"says growler second, "_I_ knew that ship; that was a
mess, and no mistake?""Why, yes," replies number one, "the lunch we got there was better than
the dinner we have in this old clothes-basket."On guest-nights your friend sits beside yourself, of course, and you
attend to his corporeal wants.One of the nicest things about the
service, in my opinion, is the having the band every day at dinner; then
too everything is so orderly; with our president and vice-president, it
is quite like a pleasure party every evening; so that altogether the
dinner, while in harbour, comes to be the great event of the day.And
after the cloth has been removed, and the president, with a preliminary
rap on the table to draw attention, has given the only toast of the
evening, the Queen, and due honour has been paid thereto, and the
bandmaster, who has been keeking in at the door every minute for the
last ten, that he might not make a mistake in the time, has played "God
save the Queen," and returned again to waltzes, quadrilles, or
selections from operas,--then it is very pleasant and delightful to loll
over our walnuts and wine, and half-dream away the half-hour till coffee
is served.Then, to be sure, that little cigar in our canvas
smoking-room outside the wardroom door, though the last, is by no means
the least pleasant part of the _dejeuner_.For my own part, I enjoy the
succeeding hour or so as much as any: when, reclining in an easy chair,
in a quiet corner, I can sip my tea, and enjoy my favourite author to my
heart's content.You must spare half an hour, however, to pay your last
visit to the sick; but this will only tend to make you appreciate your
ease all the more when you have done.So the evening wears away, and by
ten o'clock you will probably just be sufficiently tired to enjoy
thoroughly your little swing-cot and your cool white sheets.At sea, luncheon, or tiffin, is dispensed with, and you dine at
half-past two.Not much difference in the quality of viands after all,
for now-a-days everything worth eating can be procured, in hermetically
sealed tins, capable of remaining fresh for any length of time.There is one little bit of the routine of the service, which at first
one may consider a hardship.You are probably enjoying your deepest, sweetest sleep, rocked in the
cradle of the deep, and gently swaying to and fro in your little cot;
you had turned in with the delicious consciousness of safety, for well
you knew that the ship was far away at sea, far from rock or reef or
deadly shoal, and that the night was clear and collision very
improbable, so you are slumbering like a babe on its mother's breast--as
you are for that matter--for the second night-watch is half spent; when,
mingling confusedly with your dreams, comes the roll of the drum; you
start and listen.There is a moment's pause, when birr-r-r-r it goes
again, and as you spring from your couch you hear it the third time.And now you can distinguish the shouts of officers and petty officers,
high over the din of the trampling of many feet, of the battening down
of hatches, of the unmooring of great guns, and of heavy ropes and bars
falling on the deck: then succeeds a dead silence, soon broken by the
voice of the commander thundering, "Enemy on the port bow;" and then,
and not till then, do you know it is no real engagement, but the monthly
night-quarters.And you can't help feeling sorry there isn't a real
enemy on the port bow, or either bow, as you hurry away to the cockpit,
with the guns rattling all the while overhead, as if a real live
thunderstorm were being taken on board, and was objecting to be stowed
away.So you lay out your instruments, your sponges, your bottles of
wine, and your buckets of water, and, seating yourself in the midst,
begin to read `Midsummer Night's Dream,' ready at a moment's notice to
amputate the leg of any man on board, whether captain, cook, or
cabin-boy.Another nice little amusement the officer of the watch may give himself
on fine clear nights is to set fire to and let go the lifebuoy, at the
same time singing out at the top of his voice, "Man overboard."A boatswain's mate at once repeats the call, and vociferates down the
main hatchway, "Life-boat's crew a-ho-oy!"In our navy a few short but expressive moments of silence ever precede
the battle, that both officers and men may hold communion with their
God.The men belonging to this boat, who have been lying here and there
asleep but dressed, quickly tumble up the ladder pell-mell; there is a
rattling of oars heard, and the creaking of pulleys, then a splash in
the water alongside, the boat darts away from the ship like an arrow
from a bow, and the crew, rowing towards the blazing buoy, save the life
of the unhappy man, Cheeks the marine.And thus do British sailors rule the waves and keep old Neptune in his
own place.CONTAINING--IF NOT THE WHOLE--NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.If the disposing, in the service, of even a ship-load of
assistant-surgeons, is considered a matter of small moment, my disposal,
after reaching the Cape of Good Hope, needs but small comment.I was
very soon appointed to take charge of a gunboat, in lieu of a gentleman
who was sent to the Naval Hospital of Simon's Town, to fill a death
vacancy--for the navy as well as nature abhors a vacuum.I had seen the
bright side of the service, I was now to have my turn of the dark; I had
enjoyed life on board a crack frigate, I was now to rough it in a
gunboat.The east coast of Africa was to be our cruising ground, and our ship a
pigmy steamer, with plenty fore-and-aft about her, but nothing else; in
fact, she was Euclid's definition of a line to a t, length without
breadth, and small enough to have done "excellently well" as a Gravesend
tug-boat.Her teeth were five: namely, one gigantic cannon, a
65-pounder, as front tooth; on each side a brass howitzer; and flanking
these, two canine tusks in shape of a couple of 12-pounder Armstrongs.With this armament we were to lord it with a high hand over the Indian
Ocean; carry fire and sword, or, failing sword, the cutlass, into the
very heart of slavery's dominions; the Arabs should tremble at the roar
of our guns and the thunder of our bursting shells, while the slaves
should clank their chains in joyful anticipation of our coming; and best
of all, we--the officers--should fill our pockets with prize-money to
spend when we again reached the shores of merry England.Unfortunately,
this last premeditation was the only one which sustained disappointment,
for, our little craft being tender to the flag-ship of the station, all
our hard-earned prize-money had to be equally shared with her officers
and crew, which reduced the shares to fewer pence each than they
otherwise would have been pounds, and which was a burning shame.It was the Cape winter when I joined the gunboat.The hills were
covered with purple and green, the air was deliciously cool, and the
far-away mountain-tops were clad in virgin snow.It was twelve o'clock
noon when I took my traps on board, and found my new messmates seated
around the table at tiffin.The gunroom, called the wardroom by
courtesy--for the after cabin was occupied by the lieutenant
commanding--was a little morsel of an apartment, which the table and
five cane-bottomed chairs entirely filled.The officers were five--
namely, a little round-faced, dimple-cheeked, good-natured fellow, who
was our second-master; a tall and rather awkward-looking young
gentleman, our midshipman; a lean, pert, and withal diminutive youth,
brimful of his own importance, our assistant-paymaster; a fair-haired,
bright-eyed, laughing boy from Cornwall, our sub-lieutenant; and a "wee
wee man," dapper, clean, and tidy, our engineer, admitted to this mess
because he was so thorough an exception to his class, which is
celebrated more for the unctuosity of its outer than for the smoothness
of its inner man."Come along, old fellow," said our navigator, addressing me as I entered
the messroom, bobbing and bowing to evade fracture of the cranium by
coming into collision with the transverse beams of the deck above--"come
along and join us, we don't dine till four.""And precious little to dine upon," said the officer on his right."Steward, let us have the rum," [Note 1] cried the first speaker.And thus addressed, the steward shuffled in, bearing in his hand a black
bottle, and apparently in imminent danger of choking himself on a large
mouthful of bread and butter.This functionary's dress was remarkable
rather for its simplicity than its purity, consisting merely of a pair
of dirty canvas pants, a pair of purser's shoes--innocent as yet of
blacking--and a greasy flannel shirt.But, indeed, uniform seemed to be
the exception, and not the rule, of the mess, for, while one wore a blue
serge jacket, another was arrayed in white linen, and the rest had
neither jacket nor vest.The table was guiltless of a cloth, and littered with beer-bottles,
biscuits, onions, sardines, and pats of butter.exclaimed the sub-lieutenant; "that beggar
Dawson is having his own whack o' grog and everybody else's."I'll have _my_ tot to-day, I know," said the
assistant-paymaster, snatching the bottle from Dawson, and helping
himself to a very liberal allowance of the ruby fluid.cried the midshipman, snatching the
glass from the table and bolting the contents at a gulp, adding, with a
gasp of satisfaction as he put down the empty tumbler, "The chap thinks
nobody's got a soul to be saved but himself.""Soul or no soul," replied the youthful man of money as he gazed
disconsolately at the empty glass, "my _spirit's_ gone.""Blessed," said the engineer, shaking the black bottle, "if you devils
have left me a drain!see if I don't look out for A1 to-morrow."And they all said "Where is the doctor's?""See if that beggarly bumboat-man is alongside, and get me another pat
of butter and some soft tack; get the grub first, then tell him I'll pay
to-morrow."These and such like scraps of conversation began to give me a little
insight into the kind of mess I had joined and the character of my
future messmates."Steward," said I, "show me my cabin."He did so;
indeed, he hadn't far to go.It was the aftermost, and consequently the
smallest, although I _ought_ to have had my choice.It was the most
miserable little box I ever reposed in.Had I owned such a place on
shore, I _might_ have been induced to keep rabbits in it, or
guinea-pigs, but certainly not pigeons.Its length was barely six feet,
its width four above my cot and two below, and it was minus sufficient
standing-room for any ordinary-sized sailor; it was, indeed, a cabin for
a commodore--I mean Commodore Nutt--and was ventilated by a scuttle
seven inches in diameter, which could only be removed in harbour, and
below which, when we first went to sea, I was fain to hang a leather
hat-box to catch the water; unfortunately the bottom rotted out, and I
was then at the mercy of the waves.My cabin, or rather--to stick to the plain unvarnished truth--my burrow,
was alive with scorpions, cockroaches, ants, and other "crawlin'
ferlies.""That e'en to name would be unlawfu'."My dispensary was off the steerage, and sister-cabin to the pantry.To
it I gained access by a species of crab-walking, squeezing myself past a
large brass pump, and edging my body in sideways.The sick came one by
one to the dispensary door, and there I saw and treated each case as it
arrived, dressed the wounds and bruises and putrefying sores, and
bandaged the bad legs.There was no sick-berth attendant; to be sure
the lieutenant-in-command, at my request, told off "a little cabin-boy"
for my especial use.I had no cause for delectation on such an
acquisition, by no means; he was not a model cabin-boy like what you see
in theatres, and I believe will never become an admiral.He managed at
times to wash out the dispensary, or gather cockroaches, and make the
poultices--only in doing the first he broke the bottles, and in
performing the last duty he either let the poultice burn or put salt in
it; and, finally, he smashed my pot, and I kicked him forward, and
demanded another._He_ was slightly better, only he was seldom visible;
and when I set him to do anything, he at once went off into a sweet
slumber; so I kicked him forward too, and had in despair to become my
own menial.In both dispensary and burrow it was quite a difficult
business to prevent everything going to speedy destruction.The best
portions of my uniform got eaten by cockroaches or moulded by damp,
while my instruments required cleaning every morning, and even that did
not keep rust at bay.Imagine yourself dear reader, in any of the following interesting
positions:--

Very thirsty, and nothing but boiling hot newly distilled water to
drink; or wishing a cool bath of a morning, and finding the water in
your can only a little short of 212 degrees Fahrenheit.To find, when you awake, a couple of cockroaches, two inches in length,
busy picking your teeth.To find one in a state of decay in the mustard-pot.To have to arrange all the droppings and eggs of these interesting
creatures on the edge of your plate, previous to eating your soup.To have to beat out the dust and weevils from every square inch of
biscuit before putting it in your mouth.To be looking for a book and put your hand on a full-grown scaly
scorpion.Nice sensation--the animal twining round your finger, or
running up your sleeve._Denouement_--cracking him under foot--
full-flavoured bouquet--joy at escaping a sting.You are enjoying your dinner, but have been for some time sensible of a
strange titillating feeling about the region of your ankle; you look down
at last to find a centipede on your sock, with his fifty hind-legs--you
thank God not his fore fifty--abutting on to your shin._Tableau_--
green and red light from the eyes of the many-legged; horror of yourself
as you wait till he thinks proper to "move on."To awake in the morning, and find a large and healthy-looking tarantula
squatting on your pillow within ten inches of your nose, with his
basilisk eyes fixed on yours, and apparently saying, "You're only just
awake, are you?I've been sitting here all the morning watching you."You know if you move he'll bite you, somewhere; and if he _does_ bite
you, you'll go mad and dance _ad libitum_; so you twist your mouth in
the opposite direction and ejaculate--

"Steward!"but the steward does not come--in fact he is forward, seeing
after the breakfast.Meanwhile the gentleman on the pillow is moving
his horizontal mandibles in a most threatening manner, and just as he
makes a rush for your nose you tumble out of bed with a shriek; and, if
a very nervous person, probably run on deck in your shirt.Or, to fall asleep under the following circumstances: The bulkheads, all
around, black with cock-and-hen-roaches, a few of which are engaged
cropping your toe-nails, or running off with little bits of the skin of
your calves; bugs in the crevices of your cot, a flea tickling the sole
of your foot, a troop of ants carrying a dead cockroach over your
pillow, lively mosquitoes attacking you everywhere, hammer-legged flies
occasionally settling on your nose, rats running in and rats running
out, your lamp just going out, and the delicious certainty that an
indefinite number of earwigs and scorpions, besides two centipedes and a
tarantula, are hiding themselves somewhere in your cabin.Officers, as well as men, are allowed one half-gill of rum
daily, with this difference,--the former pay for theirs, while the
latter do not.ROUND THE CAPE AND UP THE 'BIQUE.It was a dark-grey cloudy forenoon when we "up anchor" and sailed from
Simon's Bay.Frequent squalls whitened the water, and there was every
indication of our being about to have dirty weather; and the tokens told
no lies.To our little craft, however, the foul weather that followed
seemed to be a matter of very little moment; for, when the wind or waves
were in any way high, she kept snugly below water, evidently thinking
more of her own convenience than our comfort, for such a procedure on
her part necessitated our leading a sort of amphibious existence, better
suited to the tastes of frogs than human beings.Our beds too, or
matresses, became converted into gigantic poultices, in which we nightly
steamed, like as many porkers newly shaven.Judging from the amount of
salt which got encrusted on our skins, there was little need to fear
danger, we were well preserved--so much so indeed, that, but for the
constant use of the matutinal freshwater bath, we would doubtless have
shared the fate of Lot's wife and been turned into pillars of salt.After being a few days at sea the wind began to moderate, and finally
died away; and instead thereof we had thunderstorms and waves, which, if
not so big as mountains, would certainly have made pretty large hills.Many a night did we linger on deck till well nigh morning, entranced by
the sublime beauty and terrible grandeur of those thunderstorms.The
roar and rattle of heaven's artillery; the incessant _floods_ of
lightning--crimson, blue, or white; our little craft hanging by the bows
to the crest of each huge inky billow, or next moment buried in the
valley of the waves, with a wall of black waters on every side; the wet
deck, the slippery shrouds, and the faces of the men holding on to the
ropes and appearing so strangely pale in the electric light; I see the
whole picture even now as I write--a picture, indeed, that can never,
never fade from my memory.Our cruising "ground" lay between the island and town of Mozambique in
the south, to about Magadoxa, some seven or eight degrees north of the
Equator.Nearly the whole of the slave-trade is carried on by the Arabs, one or
two Spaniards sometimes engaging in it likewise.The slaves are brought
from the far interior of South Africa, where they can be purchased for a
small bag of rice each.They are taken down in chained gangs to the
coast, and there in some secluded bay the dhows lie, waiting to take
them on board and convey them to the slave-mart at Zanzibar, to which
place Arab merchants come from the most distant parts of Arabia and
Persia to buy them.Dhows are vessels with one or two masts, and a
corresponding number of large sails, and of a very peculiar
construction, being shaped somewhat like a short or Blucher boot, the
high part of the boot representing the poop.They have a thatched roof
over the deck, the projecting eaves of which render boarding exceedingly
difficult to an enemy.Sometimes, on rounding the corner of a lagoon island, we would quietly
and unexpectedly steam into the midst of a fleet of thirty to forty of
these queer-looking vessels, very much to our own satisfaction, and
their intense consternation.Imagine a cat popping down among as many
mice, and you will be able to form some idea of the scramble that
followed.However, by dint of steaming here and there, and expending a
great deal of shot and shell, we generally managed to keep them together
as a dog would a flock of sheep, until we examined all their papers with
the aid of our interpreter, and probably picked out a prize.I wish I could say the prizes were anything like numerous; for perhaps
one-half of all the vessels we board are illicit slaveholders, and yet
we cannot lay a finger on them.It has been
said, and it is generally believed in England, that our cruisers are
sweeping the Indian Ocean of slavers, and stamping out the curse.But
the truth is very different, and all that we are doing, or able at
present to do, is but to pull an occasional hair from the hoary locks of
the fiend Slavery.This can be proved from the return-sheets, which
every cruiser sends home, of the number of vessels boarded, generally
averaging one thousand yearly to each man-o'-war, of which the half at
least have slaves or slave-irons on board; but only two, or at most
three, of these will become prizes.The reason of this will easily be
understood, when the reader is informed, that the Sultan of Zanzibar has
liberty to take any number of slaves from any one portion of his
dominions to another: these are called household slaves; and, as his
dominions stretch nearly all along the eastern shores of Africa, it is
only necessary for the slave-dealer to get his sanction and seal to his
papers in order to steer clear of British law.This, in almost every
case, can be accomplished by means of a bribe.So slavery flourishes,
the Sultan draws a good fat revenue from it, and the Portuguese--no
great friends to us at any time--laugh and wink to see John Bull paying
his thousands yearly for next to nothing.Supposing we liberate even
two thousand slaves a year, which I am not sure we do however, there are
on the lowest estimate six hundred slaves bought and sold daily in
Zanzibar mart; two hundred and nineteen thousand in a twelvemonth; and,
of our two thousand that are set free in Zanzibar, most, if not all,
by-and-bye, become bondsmen again.I am not an advocate for slavery, and would like to see a wholesale raid
made against it, but I do not believe in the retail system; selling
freedom in pennyworths, and spending millions in doing it, is very like
burning a penny candle in seeking for a cent.Yet I sincerely believe,
that there is more good done to the spread of civilisation and religion
in one year, by the slave-traffic, than all our missionaries can do in a
hundred.Don't open your eyes and smile incredulously, intelligent
reader; we live in an age when every question is looked at on both
sides, and why should not this?What becomes of the hundreds of
thousands of slaves that are taken from Africa?They are sold to the
Arabs--that wonderful race, who have been second only to Christians in
the good they have done to civilisation; they are taken from a state of
degradation, bestiality, and wretchedness, worse by far than that of the
wild beasts, and from a part of the country too that is almost unfit to
live in, and carried to more favoured lands, spread over the sunny
shores of fertile Persia and Arabia, fed and clothed and cared for;
after a few years of faithful service they are even called sons and feed
at their master's table--taught all the trades and useful arts, besides
the Mahommedan religion, which is certainly better than none--and, above
all, have a better chance given them of one day hearing and learning the
beautiful tenets of Christianity, the religion of love.I have met with few slaves who after a few years did not say, "Praised
be Allah for the good day I was take from me coontry!"and whose only
wish to return was, that they might bring away some aged parent, or
beloved sister, from the dark cheerless home of their infancy.Means and measures much more energetic must be brought into action if
the stronghold of slavedom is to be stormed, and, if not, it were better
to leave it alone."If the work be of God ye cannot overthrow it; lest
haply ye be found to fight even against God."THE DAYS WHEN WE WENT GIPSYING.QUILP THE
PILOT AND LAMOO.It might have been that our vessel was launched on a Friday, or sailed
on a Friday; or whether it was owing to our carrying the devil on board
of us in shape of a big jet-black cat, and for whom the lifebuoy was
thrice let go, and boats lowered in order to save his infernal majesty
from a watery grave; but whatever was the reason, she was certainly a
most unlucky ship from first to last; for during a cruise of eighteen
months, four times did we run aground on dangerous reefs, twice were we
on fire--once having had to scuttle the decks--once we sprung a bad leak
and were nearly foundering, several times we narrowly escaped the same
speedy termination to our cruise by being taken aback, while, compared
to our smaller dangers or lesser perils, Saint Paul's adventures--as a
Yankee would express it--wern't a circumstance.On the other hand, we were amply repaid by the many beautiful spots we
visited; the lovely wooded creeks where the slave-dhows played at hide
and seek with us, and the natural harbours, at times surrounded by
scenery so sweetly beautiful and so charmingly solitary, that, if
fairies still linger on this earth, one must think they would choose
just such places as these for their moonlight revels.Then there were
so many little towns--Portuguese settlements--to be visited, for the
Portuguese have spread themselves, after the manner of wild
strawberries, all round the coast of Africa, from Sierra Leone on the
west to Zanzibar on the east.There was as much sameness about these
settlements as about our visits to them: a few houses--more like tents--
built on the sand (it does seem funny to see sofas, chairs, and the
piano itself standing among the deep soft sand); a fort, the guns of
which, if fired, would bring down the walls; a few white-jacketed
swarthy-looking soldiers; a very polite governor, brimful of hospitality
and broken English; and a good dinner, winding up with punch of
schnapps.Memorable too are the pleasant boating excursions we had on the calm
bosom of the Indian Ocean.Armed boats used to be detached to cruise
for three or four weeks at a time in quest of prizes, at the end of
which time they were picked up at some place of rendezvous.By day we
sailed about the coast and around the small wooded islets, where dhows
might lurk, only landing in sheltered nooks to cook and eat our food.Our provisions were ship's, but at times we drove great bargains with
the naked natives for fowls and eggs and goats; then would we make
delicious soups, rich ragouts, and curries fit for the king of the
Cannibal Islands.Fruit too we had in plenty, and the best of oysters
for the gathering, with iguana most succulent of lizards, occasionally
fried flying-fish, or delicate morsels of shark, skip-jack, or devilled
dolphin, with a glass of prime rum to wash the whole down, and three
grains of quinine to charm away the fever.There was, too, about these
expeditions, an air of gipsying that was quite pleasant.To be sure our
beds were a little hard, but we did not mind that; while clad in our
blanket-suits, and covered with a boat-sail, we could defy the dew.Sleep, or rather the want of sleep, we seldom had to complain of, for
the blue star-lit sky above us, the gentle rising and falling of the
anchored boat, the lip-lipping of the water, and the sighing sound of
the wind through the great forest near us--all tended to woo us to
sweetest slumber.Sometimes we would make long excursions up the rivers of Africa,
combining business with pleasure, enjoying the trip, and at the same
time gleaning some useful information regarding slave or slave-ship.The following sketch concerning one or two of these may tend to show,
that a man does not take leave of all enjoyment, when his ship leaves
the chalky cliffs of old England.Our anchor was dropped outside the bar of Inambane river; the grating
noise of the chain as it rattled through the hawse-hole awoke me, and I
soon after went on deck.It was just six o'clock and a beautiful clear
morning, with the sun rising red and rosy--like a portly gentleman
getting up from his wine--and smiling over the sea in quite a pleasant
sort of way.So, as both Neptune and Sol seemed propitious, the
commander, our second-master, and myself made up our minds to visit the
little town and fort of Inambane, about forty--we thought fifteen--miles
up the river.But breakfast had to be prepared and eaten, the magazine
and arms got into the boat, besides a day's provisions, with rum and
quinine to be stowed away, so that the sun had got a good way up the
sky, and now looked more like a portly gentleman whose dinner had
disagreed, before we had got fairly under way and left the ship's side.Never was forenoon brighter or fairer, only one or two snowy banks of
cloud interrupting the blue of the sky, while the river, miles broad,
stole silently seaward, unruffled by wave or wavelet, so that the hearts
of both men and officers were light as the air they breathed was pure.The men, bending cheerfully on their oars, sang snatches of Dibdin--
Neptune's poet laureate; and we, tired of talking, reclined astern,
gazing with half-shut eyes on the round undulating hills, that, covered
with low mangrove-trees and large exotics, formed the banks of the
river.We passed numerous small wooded islands and elevated sandbanks,
on the edges of which whole regiments of long-legged birds waded about
in search of food, or, starting at our approach, flew over our heads in
Indian file, their bright scarlet-and-white plumage showing prettily
against the blue of the sky.Shoals of turtle floated past, and
hundreds of rainbow- jelly-fishes, while, farther off, many
large black bodies--the backs of hippopotami--moved on the surface of
the water, or anon disappeared with a sullen plash.Saving these sounds
and the dip of our own oars, all was still, the silence of the desert
reigned around us, the quiet of a newly created world.The forenoon wore away, the river got narrower, but, though we could see
a distance of ten miles before us, neither life nor sign of life could
be perceived.At one o'clock we landed among a few cocoa-nut trees to
eat our meagre dinner, a little salt pork, raw, and a bit of biscuit.No sooner had we "shoved off" again than the sky became overcast; we
were caught in, and had to pull against, a blinding white-squall that
would have laid a line-of-battle on her beam ends.The rain poured down
as if from a water-spout, almost filling the boat and drenching us to
the skin, and, not being able to see a yard ahead, our boat ran aground
and stuck fast.It took us a good hour after the squall was over to
drag her into deep water; nor were our misfortunes then at an end, for
squall succeeded squall, and, having a journey of uncertain length still
before us, we began to feel very miserable indeed.It was long after four o'clock when, tired, wet, and hungry, we hailed
with joy a large white house on a wooded promontory; it was the
Governor's castle, and soon after we came in sight of the town itself.Situated so far in the interior of Africa, in a region so wild, few
would have expected to find such a little paradise as we now beheld,--a
colony of industrious Portuguese, a large fort and a company of
soldiers, a governor and consulate, a town of nice little detached
cottages, with rows of cocoa-nut, mango, and orange trees, and in fact
all the necessaries, and luxuries of civilised life.It was, indeed, an
oasis in the desert, and, to us, the most pleasant of pleasant
surprises.Leaving the men for a short time with the boat, we made our way to the
house of the consul, a dapper little gentleman with a pretty wife and
two beautiful daughters--flowers that had hitherto blushed unseen and
wasted their sweetness in the desert air.After making us swallow a glass of brandy
each to keep off fever, he kindly led us to a room, and made us strip
off our wet garments, while a servant brought bundle after bundle of
clothes, and spread them out before us.There were socks and shirts and
slippers galore, with waistcoats, pantaloons, and head-dresses, and
jackets, enough to have dressed an opera troupe.The commander and I
furnished ourselves with a red Turkish fez and dark-grey dressing-gown
each, with cord and tassels to correspond, and, thus, arrayed, we
considered ourselves of no small account.Our kind entertainers were
waiting for us in the next room, where they had, in the mean time, been
preparing for us the most fragrant of brandy punch.By-and-bye two
officers and a tall Parsee dropped in, and for the next hour or so the
conversation was of the most animated and lively description, although a
bystander, had there been one, would not have been much edified, for the
following reason: the younger daughter and myself were flirting in the
ancient Latin language, with an occasional soft word in Spanish; our
commander was talking in bad French to the consul's lady, who was
replying in Portuguese; the second-master was maintaining a smart
discussion in broken Italian with the elder daughter; the Parsee and
officer of the fort chiming in, the former in English, the latter in
Hindostanee; but as no one of the four could have had the slightest idea
of the other's meaning, the amount of information given and received
must have been very small,--in fact, merely nominal.It must not,
however, be supposed that our host or hostesses could speak _no_
English, for the consul himself would frequently, and with a bow that
was inimitable, push the bottle towards the commander, and say, as he
shrugged his shoulders and turned his palms skywards, "Continue you, Sar
Capitan, to wet your whistle;" and, more than once, the fair creature by
my side would raise and did raise the glass to her lips, and say, as her
eyes sought mine, "Good night, Sar Officeer," as if she meant me to be
off to bed without a moment's delay, which I knew she did not.Then,
when I responded to the toast, and complimented her on her knowledge of
the "universal language," she added, with a pretty shake of the head,
"No, Sar Officeer, I no can have speak the mooch Englese."A servant,--
apparently newly out of prison, so closely was his hair cropped,--
interrupted our pleasant confab, and removed the seat of our Babel to
the dining-room, where as nicely-cooked-and-served a dinner as ever
delighted the senses of hungry mortality awaited our attention.No
large clumsy joints, huge misshapen roasts or bulky boils, hampered the
board; but dainty made-dishes, savoury stews, piquant curries, delicate
fricassees whose bouquet tempted even as their taste and flavour
stimulated the appetite, strange little fishes as graceful in shape as
lovely in colour, vegetables that only the rich luxuriance of an African
garden could supply, and numerous other nameless nothings, with
delicious wines and costly liqueurs, neatness, attention, and kindness,
combined to form our repast, and counteract a slight suspicion of
crocodiles' tails and stewed lizard, for where ignorance is bliss a
fellow is surely a fool if he is wise.We spent a most pleasant evening in asking questions, spinning yarns,
singing songs, and making love.The younger daughter--sweet child of
the desert--sang `Amante de alguno;' her sister played a selection from
`La Traviata;' next, the consul's lady favoured us with something
pensive and sad, having reference, I think, to bright eyes, bleeding
hearts, love, and slow death; then, the Parsee chanted a Persian hymn
with an "Allalallala," instead of Fol-di-riddle-ido as a chorus, which
elicited "Fra poco a me" from the Portuguese lieutenant; and this last
caused our commander to seat himself at the piano, turn up the white of
his eyes, and in very lugubrious tones question the probability of
"Gentle Annie's" ever reappearing in any spring-time whatever; then,
amid so much musical sentimentality and woe, it was not likely that I
was to hold my peace, so I lifted up my voice and sang--

  "Cauld kail in Aberdeen,
  An' cas ticks in Strathbogie;
  Ilka chiel maun hae a quean
  Bit leeze me on ma cogie--"

with a pathos that caused the tears to trickle over and adown the nose
of the younger daughter--she was of the gushing temperament--and didn't
leave a dry eye in the room.The song brought down the house--so to
speak--and I was the hero for the rest of the evening.Before parting
for the night we also sang `Auld lang syne,' copies of the words having
been written out and distributed, to prevent mistakes; this was supposed
by our hostess to be the English national anthem.It was with no small amount of regret that we parted from our friends
next day; a fresh breeze carried us down stream, and, except our running
aground once or twice, and being nearly drowned in crossing the bar, we
arrived safely on board our saucy gunboat.------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Afric's sunny fountains" have been engaged for such a length of time in
the poetical employment of "rolling down their golden sands," that a
bank or bar of that same bright material has been formed at the mouth of
every river, which it is very difficult and often dangerous to cross
even in canoes.We had despatched boats before us to take soundings on
the bar of Lamoo, and prepared to follow in the track thus marked out.Now, our little bark, although not warranted, like the Yankee boat, to
float wherever there is a heavy dew, was nevertheless content with a
very modest allowance of the aqueous element; in two and a half fathoms
she was quite at home, and even in two--with the help of a few
breakers--she never failed to bump it over a bar.We approached the bar
of Lamoo, therefore, with a certain degree of confidence till the keel
rasped on the sand; this caused us to turn astern till we rasped again;
then, being neither able to get back nor forward, we stopped ship, put
our fingers in our wise mouths, and tried to consider what next was to
be done.Just then a small canoe was observed coming bobbing over the
big waves that tumbled in on the bar; at one moment it was hidden behind
a breaker, next moment mounting over another, and so, after a little
game at bo-peep, it got alongside, and from it there scrambled on board
a little, little man, answering entirely to Dickens's description of
Quilp.added I, "by all that's small and ugly.""Your sarvant, sar," said Quilp himself.There
certainly was not enough of him to make two.He was rather darker in
skin than the Quilp of Dickens, and his only garment was a coal-sack
without sleeves--no coal-sack _has_ sleeves, however--begirt with a
rope, in which a short knife was stuck; he had, besides, sandals on his
feet, and his temples were begirt with a dirty dishclout by way of
turban, and he repeated, "I am one pilot, sar.""I do it, sar, plenty quick."I do him," cried the little man, as he mounted the
bridge; then cocking his head to one side, and spreading out his arms
like a badly feathered duck, he added, "Suppose I no do him plenty
proper, you catchee me and make shot.""If the vessel strikes, I'll hang you, sir."Quilp grinned--which was his way of smiling."And a half three," sung the man in the chains; then, "And a half four;"
and by-and-bye, "And a half three" again; followed next moment by, "By
the deep three."We were on the dreaded bar; on each
side of us the big waves curled and broke with a sullen boom like
far-off thunder; only, where we were, no waves broke."Mind yourself now," cried the commander to Quilp; to which he in wrath
replied--

"What for you stand there make bobbery?_I_ is de cap'n; suppose you is
fear, go alow, sar."and a large wave broke right aboard of us, almost sweeping us
from the deck, and lifting the ship's head into the sky.Another and
another followed; but amid the wet and the spray, and the roar of the
breakers, firmly stood the little pilot, coolly giving his orders, and
never for an instant taking his eyes from the vessel's jib-boom and the
distant shore, till we were safely through the surf and quietly steaming
up the river.After proceeding some miles, native villages began to appear here and
there on both shores, and the great number of dhows on the river, with
boats and canoes of every description, told us we were nearing a large
town.Two hours afterwards we were anchored under the guns of the
Sultan's palace, which were belching forth fire and smoke in return for
the salute we had fired.We found every creature and thing in Lamoo as
entirely primitive, as absolutely foreign, as if it were a city in some
other planet.The most conspicuous building is the Sultan's lofty fort
and palace, with its spacious steps, its fountains and marble halls.The streets are narrow and confused; the houses built in the Arab
fashion, and in many cases connected by bridges at the top; the
inhabitants about forty thousand, including Arabs, Persians, Hindoos,
Somali Indians, and slaves.The wells, exceedingly deep, are built in
the centre of the street without any protection; and girls, carrying on
their heads calabashes, are continually passing to and from them.Slaves, two and two, bearing their burdens of cowries and ivory on poles
between, and keeping step to an impromptu chant; black girls weaving
mats and grass-cloth; strange-looking tradesmen, with stranger tools, at
every door; rich merchants borne along in gilded palanquins; people
praying on housetops; and the Sultan's ferocious soldiery prowling
about, with swords as tall, and guns nearly twice as tall, as
themselves; a large shark-market; a fine bazaar, with gold-dust, ivory,
and tiger-skins exposed for sale; sprightly horses with gaudy trappings;
solemn-looking camels; dust and stench and a general aroma of savage
life and customs pervading the atmosphere, but law and order
nevertheless.No
spirituous liquor of any sort is sold in the town; the Sultan's soldiers
go about the streets at night, smelling the breath of the suspected, and
the faintest odour of the accursed fire-water dooms the poor mortal to
fifty strokes with a thick bamboo-cane next morning.The sugar-cane
grows wild in the fertile suburbs, amid a perfect forest of fine trees;
farther out in the country the cottager dwells beneath his few cocoa-nut
trees, which supply him with all the necessaries of life.One tree for
each member of his family is enough._He_ builds the house and fences
with its large leaves; his wife prepares meat and drink, cloth and oil,
from the nut; the space between the trees is cultivated for curry, and
the spare nuts are sold to purchase luxuries, and the rent of twelve
trees is only _sixpence_ of our money.no drunkenness,
no debt, no religious strife, but peace and contentment everywhere!Reader, if you are in trouble, or your affairs are going "to pot," or if
you are of opinion that this once favoured land is getting used up, I
sincerely advise you to sell off your goods and be off to Lamoo.Of the "gentlemen of England who live at home at ease," very few can
know how entirely dependent for happiness one is on his neighbours.Man
is out-and-out, or out-and-in, a gregarious animal, else `Robinson
Crusoe' had never been written.Now, I am sure that it is only correct
to state that the majority of combatant [Note 1] officers are, in simple
language, jolly nice fellows, and as a class gentlemen, having, in fact,
that fine sense of honour, that good-heartedness, which loves to do as
it would be done by, which hurteth not the feelings of the humble, which
turneth aside from the worm in its path, and delighteth not in plucking
the wings from the helpless fly.To believe, however, that there are no
exceptions to this rule would be to have faith in the speedy advent of
the millennium, that happy period of lamb-and-lion-ism which we would
all rather see than hear tell of; for human nature is by no means
altered by bathing every morning in salt water, it is the same afloat as
on shore.And there are many officers in the navy, who--"dressed in a
little brief authority," and wearing an additional stripe--love to lord
it over their fellow worms.Nor is this fault altogether absent from
the medical profession itself!It is in small gunboats, commanded perhaps by a lieutenant, and carrying
only an assistant-surgeon, where a young medical officer feels all the
hardships and despotism of the service; for if the lieutenant in command
happens to be at all frog-hearted, he has then a splendid opportunity of
puffing himself up.In a large ship with from twenty to thirty officers in the mess, if you
do not happen to meet with a kindred spirit at one end of the table, you
can shift your chair to the other.But in a gunboat on foreign service,
with merely a clerk, a blatant middy, and a second-master who would fain
be your senior, as your messmates, then, I say, God help you!unless you
have the rare gift of doing anything for a quiet life.It is all
nonsense to say, "Write a letter on service about any grievance;" you
can't write about ten out of a thousand of the petty annoyances which go
to make your life miserable; and if you do, you will be but little
better, if, indeed, your last state be not worse than your first.I have in my mind's eye even now a lieutenant who commanded a gunboat in
which I served as medical officer in charge.This little man was what
is called a sea-lawyer--my naval readers well know what I mean; he knew
all the Admiralty Instructions, was an amateur engineer, only needed the
title of M.D.to make him a doctor, could quibble and quirk, and in fact
could prove by the Queen's Regulations that your soul, to say nothing of
your body, wasn't your own; that _you_ were a slave, and _he_ lord--god
of all he surveyed.he has gone to his account; he
will not require an advocate, he can speak for himself.Not many such
hath the service, I am happy to say.He was continually changing his
poor hard-worked sub-lieutenants, and driving his engineers to drink,
previously to trying them by court-martial.At first he and I got on
very well; apparently he "loved me like a vera brither;" but we did not
continue long "on the same platform," and, from the day we had the first
difference of opinion, he was my foe, and a bitter one too.I assure
you, reader, it gave me a poor idea of the service, for it was my first
year.He was always on the outlook for faults, and his kindest words to
me were "chaffing" me on my accent, or about my country.To be able to
meet him on his own ground I studied the Instructions day and night, and
tried to stick by them.Malingering was common on board; one or two whom I caught I turned to
duty: the men, knowing how matters stood between the commander and me,
refused to work, and so I was had up and bullied on the quarter-deck for
"neglect of duty" in not putting these fellows on the sick-list.After
this I had to put every one that asked on the sick-list."Doctor," he would say to me on reporting the number sick, "this is
_wondrous_ strange--_thirteen_ on the list, out of only ninety men.Why, sir, I've been in line-of-battle ships,--_line-of-battle_ ships,
sir,--where they had not ten sick--_ten sick_, sir."This of course
implied an insult to me, but I was like a sheep before the shearers,
dumb.On Sunday mornings I went with him the round of inspection; the sick who
were able to be out of hammock were drawn up for review: had he been
half as particular with the men under his own charge or with the ship in
general as he was with the few sick, there would have been but little
disease to treat.Instead of questioning _me_ concerning their
treatment, he interrogated the sick themselves, quarrelling with the
medicine given, and pooh-pooh-ing my diagnosis.Those in hammocks, who
most needed gentleness and comfort, he bullied, blamed for being ill,
and rendered generally uneasy.Remonstrance on my part was either taken
no notice of, or instantly checked.If men were reported by me for
being dirty, giving impudence, or disobeying orders, _he_ became their
advocate--an able one too--and _I_ had to retire, sorry I had spoken.But I would not tell the tenth part of what I had to suffer, because
such men as he are the _exception_, and because he is dead.A little
black baboon of a boy who attended on this lieutenant-commanding had one
day incurred his displeasure: "Bo'swain's mate," cried he, "take my boy
forward, hoist him on an ordinary seaman's back, and give him a
rope's-ending; and," turning to me, "Doctor, you'll go and attend my
boy's flogging."With a face like crimson I rushed
below to my cabin, and--how could I help it?--made a baby of myself for
once; all my pent-up feelings found vent in a long fit of crying.True, I might in this case have written a letter to the service about my
treatment; but, as it is not till after twelve months the
assistant-surgeon is confirmed, the commander's word would have been
taken before mine, and I probably dismissed without a court-martial.That probationary year I consider more than a grievance, it is a _cruel
injustice_.There is a regulation--of late more strictly enforced by a
circular--that every medical officer serving on board his own ship shall
have a cabin, and the choice--by rank--of cabin, and he is a fool if he
does not enforce it.But it sometimes happens that a sub-lieutenant
(who has no cabin) is promoted to lieutenant on a foreign station; he
will then rank above the assistant-surgeon, and perhaps, if there is no
spare cabin, the poor doctor will have to give up his, and take to a
sea-chest and hammock, throwing all his curiosities, however valuable,
overboard.It would be the duty of the captain in such a case to build
an additional cabin, and if he did not, or would not, a letter to the
admiral would make him.Does the combatant officer treat the medical officer with respect?Certainly, unless one or other of the two be a snob: in the one case the
respect is not worth having, in the other it can't be expected.In the military branch you shall find many officers belonging to the
best English families: these I need hardly say are for the most part
gentlemen, and gentle men.However, it is allowed in most messes that

  "The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
  A man's man for a' that;"

and I assure the candidate for a commission, that, if he is himself a
gentleman, he will find no want of admirers in the navy.But there are
some young doctors who enter the service, knowing their profession to be
sure, and how to hold a knife and fork--not a carving-fork though--but
knowing little else; yet even these soon settle down, and, if they are
not dismissed by court-martial for knocking some one down at cards, or
on the quarter-deck, turn out good service-officers.Indeed, after all,
I question if it be good to know too much of fine-gentility on entering
the service, for, although the navy officers one meets have much that is
agreeable, honest, and true, there is through it all a vein of what can
only be designated as the coarse.The science of conversation, that
beautiful science that says and lets say, that can listen as well as
speak, is but little studied.Mostly all the talk is "shop," or rather
"ship."There is a want of tone in the discourse, a lack of refinement.The delicious chit-chat on new books, authors, poetry, music, or the
drama, interspersed with anecdote, incident, and adventure, and
enlivened with the laughter-raising pun or happy bon-mot, is, alas!but
too seldom heard: the rough joke, the tales of women, ships, and former
ship-mates, and the old, old, stale "good things,"--these are more
fashionable at our navy mess-board.Those who would object to such
conversation are in the minority, and prefer to let things hang as they
grew.Now, only one thing can ever alter this, and that is a good and
perfect library in every ship, to enable officers, who spend most of
their time out of society, to keep up with the times if possible.But I
fear I am drifting imperceptibly into the subject of navy-reform, which
I prefer leaving to older and wiser heads.Combatant (from combat, a battle), fighting officers,--as if
the medical offices didn't fight likewise.It would be better to take
away the "combat," and leave the "ant"--ant-officers, as they do the
work of the ship.There is one grievance which the medical officers, in common with their
combatant brethren, have to complain of--I refer to _compulsory
shaving_; neither is this by any means so insignificant a matter as it
may seem.It may appear a ridiculous statement, but it is nevertheless
a true one, that this regulation has caused many a young surgeon to
prefer the army to the navy."Mere dandies," the reader may say, "whom
this grievance would affect;" but there is many a good man a dandy, and
no one could surely respect a man who was careless of his personal
appearance, or who would willingly, and without a sigh, disfigure his
face by depriving it of what nature considers both ornate and useful--
ornate, as the ladies and the looking-glass can prove; and useful, as
the blistered chin and upper lip of the shaven sailor, in hot climates,
points out.From the earliest ages the moustache has been worn,--even
the Arabs, who shave the head, leave untouched the upper lip.What
would the pictures of some of the great masters be without it?Didn't
the Roman youths dedicate the first few downy hairs of the coming
moustache to the gods?Does not the moustache give a manly appearance
to the smallest and most effeminate?Does it not even beget a certain
amount of respect for the wearer?What sort of guys would the razor
make of Count Bismark, Dickens, the Sultan of Turkey, or Anthony
Trollope?Were the Emperor Napoleon deprived of his well-waxed
moustache, it might lose him the throne of France.Were Garibaldi to
call on his barber, he might thereafter call in vain for volunteers, and
English ladies would send him no more splints nor sticking-plaster.Shave Tennyson, and you may put him in petticoats as soon as you please.As to the moustache movement in the navy, it is a subject of talk--
admitting of no discussion--in every mess in the service, and thousands
are the advocates in favour of its adoption.Indeed, the arguments in
favour of it are so numerous, that it is a difficult matter to choose
the best, while the reasons against it are few, foolish, and despotic.At the time when the Lords of the Admiralty gave orders that the navy
should keep its upper lip, and three fingers' breadth of its royal chin,
smooth and copper-kettlish, it was neither fashionable nor respectable
to wear the moustache in good society.Those were the days of
cabbage-leaf cheeks, powdered wigs, and long queues; but those times are
past and gone from every corner of England's possessions save the navy.Barberism has been hunted from polite circles, but has taken refuge
under the trident of old Neptune; and, in these days of comparative
peace, more blood in the Royal Navy is drawn by the razor than by the
cutlass.In our little gunboat on the coast of Africa, we, both officers and men,
used, under the rose, to cultivate moustache and whiskers, until we fell
in with the ship of the commodore of the station.Then, when the
commander gave the order, "All hands to shave," never was such a
hurlyburly seen, such racing hither and thither (for not a moment was to
be lost), such sharpening of scissors and furbishing up of rusty razors.On one occasion I remember sending our steward, who was lathering his
face with a blacking-brush, and trying to scrape with a carving-knife,
to borrow the commander's razor; in the mean time the commander had
despatched his soapy-faced servant to beg the loan of mine.Both
stewards met with a clash, nearly running each other through the body
with their shaving gear.I lent the commander a Syme's bistoury, with
which he managed to pluck most of the hairs out by the root, as if he
meant to transplant them again, while I myself shaved with an amputating
knife.The men forward stuck by the scissors; and when the commander,
with bloody chin and watery eyes, asked why they did not shave,--"Why,
sir," replied the bo'swain's mate, "the cockroaches have been and gone
and eaten all our razors, they has, sir."Then, had you seen us reappear on deck after the terrible operation,
with our white shaven lips and shivering chins, and a foolish grin on
every face, you would, but for our uniform, have taken us for tailors on
strike, so unlike were we to the brave-looking, manly dare-devils that
trod the deck only an hour before.And if army officers and men have been graciously permitted to wear the
moustache since the Crimean war, why are not we?But perhaps the navy
took no part in that gallant struggle.But if we _must_ continue to do
penance by shaving, why should it not be the crown of the head, or any
other place, rather than the upper lip, which every one can see?One item of duty there is, which occasionally devolves on the medical
officer, and for the most part goes greatly against the feelings of the
_young_ surgeon; I refer to his compulsory attendance at floggings.It
is only fair to state that the majority of captains and commanders use
the cat as seldom as possible, and that, too, only sparingly.In some
ships, however, flogging is nearly as frequent as prayers of a morning.Again, it is more common on foreign stations than at home, and boys of
the first or second class, marines, and ordinary seamen, are for the
most part the victims.I do not believe I shall ever forget the first exhibition of this sort I
attended on board my own ship; not that the spectacle was in any way
more revolting than scores I have since witnessed, but because the sight
was new to me.I remember it wanted fully twenty minutes of seven in the morning, when
my servant aroused me."A flaying match, you know, sir," said Jones.My heart gave an anxious "thud" against my ribs, as if I myself were to
form the "ram for the sacrifice."I hurried through with my bath, and,
dressing myself as if for a holiday, in cocked hat, sword, and undress
coat, I went on deck.All the
minutiae of the scene I remember as though it were but yesterday,
morning was cool and clear, the hills clad in lilac and green, seabirds
floating high in air, and the waters of the bay reflecting the line of
the sky and the lofty mountain-sides, forming a picture almost dreamlike
in its quietness and serenity.The men were standing about in groups,
dressed in their whitest of pantaloons, bluest of smocks, and neatest of
black silk neckerchiefs.By-and-bye the culprit was led aft by a file
of marines, and I went below with him to make the preliminary
examination, in order to report whether or not he might be fit for the
punishment.He was as good a specimen of the British marine as one could wish to
look upon, hardy, bold, and wiry.His crime had been smuggling spirits
on board."Needn't examine me, Doctor," said he; "I ain't afeard of their four
dozen; they can't hurt me, sir,--leastways my back you know--my breast
though; hum-m!"and he shook his head, rather sadly I thought, as he
bent down his eyes."What," said I, "have you anything the matter with your chest?""Nay, Doctor, nay; its my feelins they'll hurt.I've a little girl at
home that loves me, and--bless you, sir, I won't look her in the face
again no-how."No lack of strength there, no nervousness; the artery
had the firm beat of health, the tendons felt like rods of iron beneath
the finger, and his biceps stood out hard and round as the mainstay of
an old seventy-four.I pitied the brave fellow, and--very wrong of me it was, but I could not
help it--filled out and offered him a large glass of rum.sir," he said, with a wistful eye on the ruby liquid, "don't tempt
me, sir.I can bear the bit o' flaying athout that: I wouldn't have my
messmates smell Dutch courage on my breath, sir; thankee all the same,
Doctor."All hands had already assembled, the men and boys on one side, and the
officers, in cocked hats and swords, on the other.A grating had been
lashed against the bulwark, and another placed on deck beside it.The
culprit's shoulders and back were bared, and a strong belt fastened
around the lower part of the loins for protection; he was then firmly
tied by the hands to the upper, and by the feet to the lower grating; a
little basin of cold water was placed at his feet; and all was now
prepared.The sentence was read, and orders given to proceed with the
punishment.The cat is a terrible instrument of torture; I would not
use it on a bull unless in self-defence: the shaft is about a foot and a
half long, and covered with green or red baize according to taste; the
thongs are nine, about twenty-eight inches in length, of the thickness
of a goose-quill, and with two knots tied on each.Men describe the
first blow as like a shower of molten lead.Combing out the thongs with his five fingers before each blow, firmly
and determinedly was the first dozen delivered by the bo'swain's mate,
and as unflinchingly received.Then, "One dozen, sir, please," he reported, saluting the commander."Continue the punishment," was the calm reply.Another dozen reported; again, the same reply.The flesh, like burning steel, had changed from red to
purple, and blue, and white; and between the third and fourth dozen, the
suffering wretch, pale enough now, and in all probability sick, begged a
comrade to give him a mouthful of water.There was a tear in the eye of
the hardy sailor who obeyed him, whispering as he did so--

"Keep up, Bill; it'll soon be over now.""Five, six," the corporal slowly counted--"seven, eight."It is the
last dozen, and how acute must be the torture!The blood
comes now fast enough, and--yes, gentle reader, I _will_ spare your
feelings.The man was cast loose at last and put on the sick-list; he
had borne his punishment without a groan and without moving a muscle.A
large pet monkey sat crunching nuts in the rigging, and grinning all the
time; I have no doubt _he_ enjoyed the spectacle immensely, _for he was
only an ape_.Tommie G--was a pretty, fair-skinned, blue-eyed boy, some sixteen
summers old.He was one of a class only too common in the service;
having become enamoured of the sea, he had run away from his home and
joined the service; and, poor little man!he found out, when too late,
that the stern realities of a sailor's life did not at all accord with
the golden notions he had formed of it.Being fond of stowing himself
away in corners with a book, instead of keeping his watch, Tommie very
often got into disgrace, spent much of his time at the mast-head, and
had many unpleasant palmar rencounters with the corporal's cane.One
day, his watch being over, he had retired to a corner with his little
"ditty-box."Nobody ever knew one-half of the beloved nicknacks and valued nothings
he kept in that wee box: it was in fact his private cabin, his sanctum
sanctorum, to which he could retreat when anything vexed him; a sort of
portable home, in which he could forget the toils of his weary watch,
the giddy mast-head, or even the corporal's cane.He had extracted, and
was dreamily gazing on, the portrait of a very young lady, when the
corporal came up and rudely seized it, and made a very rough and
inelegant remark concerning the fair virgin."That is my sister," cried Tommie, with tears in his eyes.sneered the corporal; "she is a--" and he added a word
that cannot be named.There was the spirit of young England, however,
in Tommie's breast; and the word had scarcely crossed the corporal's
lips, when those lips, and his nose too, were dyed in the blood the
boy's fist had drawn.For that blow poor Tommie was condemned to
receive four dozen lashes.And the execution of the sentence was
carried out with all the pomp and show usual on such occasions.Arrayed
in cooked-hats, epaulets, and swords, we all assembled to witness that
helpless child in his agony.One would have thought that even the rough
bo'swain's mate would have hesitated to disfigure skin so white and
tender, or that the frightened and imploring glance Tommie cast upward
on the first descending lash would have unnerved his arm.No,
reader; pity there doubtless was among us, but mercy--none.And the poor boy writhed in his agony; his screams and
cries were heartrending; and, God forgive us!we knew not till then he
was an orphan, till we heard him beseech his mother in heaven to look
down on her son, to pity and support him.well, perhaps she did,
for scarcely had the third dozen commenced when Tommie's cries were
hushed, his head drooped on his shoulder like a little dead bird's, and
for a while his sufferings were at an end.I gladly took the
opportunity to report further proceedings as dangerous, and he was
carried away to his hammock.I will not shock the nerves and feelings of the reader by any further
relation of the horrors of flogging, merely adding, that I consider
corporal punishment, as applied to men, _cowardly, cruel_, and debasing
to human nature; and as applied to boys, _brutal_, and sometimes even
_fiendish_.There is only one question I wish to ask of every
true-hearted English lady who may read these lines--Be you sister, wife,
or mother, could you in your heart have respected the commander who,
with folded arms and grim smile, replied to poor Tommie's frantic
appeals for mercy, "Continue the punishment"?The pay of medical officers is by no means high enough to entice young
doctors, who can do anything like well on shore, to enter the service.Ten shillings a day, with an increase of half-a-crown after five years'
service on full pay, is not a great temptation certainly.To be sure
the expenses of living are small, two shillings a day being all that is
paid for messing; this of course not including the wine-bill, the size
of which will depend on the "drouthiness" of the officer who contracts
it.Government provides all mess-traps, except silver forks and spoons.Then there is uniform to keep up, and shore-going clothes to be paid
for, and occasionally a shilling or two for boat-hire.However, with a
moderate wine-bill, the assistant-surgeon may save about four shillings
or more a day.Promotion to the rank of surgeon, unless to some fortunate individuals,
comes but slowly; it may, however, be reckoned on after from eight to
ten years.A few gentlemen out of each "batch" who "pass" into the
service, and who have distinguished themselves at the examination, are
promoted sooner.It seems to be the policy of the present Director-General to deal as
fairly as possible with every assistant-surgeon, after a certain
routine.On first joining he is sent for a short spell--too short,
indeed--to a hospital.He is then appointed to a sea-going ship for a
commission--say three years--on a foreign station.On coming home he is
granted a few months' leave on full pay, and is afterwards appointed to
a harbour-ship for about six months.By the end of this time he is
supposed to have fairly recruited from the fatigues of his commission
abroad; he is accordingly sent out again to some other foreign station
for three or four years.On again returning to his native land, he
might be justified in hoping for a pet appointment, say to a hospital,
the marines, a harbour-ship, or, failing these, to the Channel fleet.On being promoted he is sent off abroad again, and so on; and thus he
spends his useful life, and serves his Queen and country, and earns his
pay, and generally spends that likewise.Pensions are granted to the widows of assistant-surgeons--from forty to
seventy pounds a year, according to circumstances; and if he leaves no
widow, a dependent mother, or even sister, may obtain the pension.But
I fear I must give, to assistant-surgeons about to many, Punch's advice,
and say most emphatically, "Don't;" unless, indeed, the dear creature
has money, and is able to purchase a practice for her darling doctor.With a little increase of pay ungrudgingly given, shorter commissions
abroad, and less of the "bite and buffet" about favours granted, the
navy would be a very good service for the medical officer.However, as it is, to a man who has neither wife nor riches, it is, I
dare say, as good a way of spending life as any other; and I do think
that there are but few old surgeons who, on looking back to the life
they have led in the navy, would not say of that service,--"With all thy
faults I love thee still."As the day begins, the early morning cries drift up from the street.At
six the fishwomen with their push-carts go their rounds, each singing
the beauties of her wares."Voila les beaux maquereaux!"chants the
sturdy vendor, her sabots clacking over the cobbles as she pushes the
cart or stops and weighs a few sous' worth of fish to a passing
purchaser.The goat-boy, piping his oboe-like air, passes, the goats scrambling
ahead alert to steal a carrot or a bite of cabbage from the nearest
cart.And when these have passed, the little orgue de Barbarie plays its
repertoire of quadrilles and waltzes under your window.It is a very
sweet-toned organ, this little orgue de Barbarie, with a plaintive,
apologetic tone, and a flute obbligato that would do credit to many a
small orchestra.I know this small organ well--an old friend on dreary
mornings, putting the laziest riser in a good humor for the day.The
tunes are never changed, but they are all inoffensive and many of them
pretty, and to the shrunken old man who grinds them out daily they are
no doubt by this time all alike.[Illustration: (cat on counter)]

It is growing late and time for one's coffee.The little tobacco-shop
and cafe around the corner I find an excellent place for cafe au lait.The coffee is delicious and made when one chooses to arrive, not stewed
like soup, iridescent in color, and bitter with chicory, as one finds it
in many of the small French hotels.Two crescents, flaky and hot from
the bakery next door, and three generous pats of unsalted butter,
complete this morning repast, and all for the modest sum of twelve sous,
with three sous to the garcon who serves you, with which he is well
pleased.I have forgotten a companionable cat who each morning takes her seat on
the long leather settee beside me and shares my crescents.The cats are
considered important members of nearly every family in the Quarter.Big
yellow and gray Angoras, small, alert tortoise-shell ones, tiger-like
and of plainer breed and more intelligence, bask in the doorways or
sleep on the marble-topped tables of the cafes.[Illustration: (woman carrying shopping box)]

"Qu'est-ce que tu veux, ma pauvre Mimi?"condoles Celeste, as she
approaches the family feline."Mimi" stretches her full length, extending and retracting her claws,
rolls on her back, turns her big yellow eyes to Celeste and mews.The
next moment she is picked up and carried back into the house like a
stray child.At noon the streets seem deserted, except for the sound of occasional
laughter and the rattle of dishes coming from the smaller restaurants as
one passes.At this hour these places are full of workmen in white and
blue blouses, and young girls from the neighboring factories.A big fellow in a blue gingham blouse
attempts to kiss the little milliner opposite him at table; she evades
him, and, screaming with laughter, picks up her skirts and darts out
of the restaurant and down the street, the big fellow close on her
dainty heels.A second later he has overtaken her, and picking her up
bodily in his strong arms carries her back to her seat, where he places
her in her chair, the little milliner by this time quite out of breath
with laughter and quite happy.This little episode affords plenty of
amusement to the rest of the crowd; they wildly applaud the good-humored
captor, who orders another litre of red wine for those present, and
every one is merry.[Illustration: (city house)]

The Parisian takes his hour for dejeuner, no matter what awaits him.It
is the hour when lovers meet, too.Edmond, working in the atelier for
the reproduction of Louis XVI furniture, meets Louise coming from her
work on babies' caps in the rue des Saints-Peres at precisely twelve-ten
on the corner of the rue Vaugirard and the Boulevard Montparnasse.Louise comes without her hat, her hair in an adorable coiffure, as
neatly arranged as a Geisha's, her skirt held tightly to her hips,
disclosing her small feet in low slippers.There is a golden rule, I
believe, in the French catechism which says: "It is better, child, that
thy hair be neatly dressed than that thou shouldst have a whole frock."The two breakfast on a ragout and a bottle of
wine while they talk of going on Sunday to St.Cloud for the day--and so
they must be economical this week.Cloud
and spend all day in the woods.It is the second Sunday in the month,
and the fountains will be playing.They will take their dejeuner with
them.Louise will, of course, see to this, and Edmond will bring
cigarettes enough for two, and the wine.Then, when the stars are out,
they will take one of the "bateaux mouches" back to Paris.Dear Paris--the Paris of youth, of love, and of romance!*     *     *     *     *

The pulse of the Quarter begins really to beat at 6 P.M.At this hour
the streets are alive with throngs of workmen--after their day's work,
seeking their favorite cafes to enjoy their aperitifs with their
comrades--and women hurrying back from their work, many to their homes
and children, buying the dinner en route.Henriette, who sews all day at one of the fashionable dressmakers' in
the rue de la Paix, trips along over the Pont Neuf to her small room in
the Quarter to put on her best dress and white kid slippers, for it is
Bullier night and she is going to the ball with two friends of her
cousin.In the twilight, and from my studio window the swallows, like black
cinders against the yellow sky, dart and swoop above the forest of
chimney-pots and tiled and gabled roofs.It is the hour to dine, and with this thought uppermost in every one's
mind studio doors are slammed and night-keys tucked in pockets.And arm
in arm the poet and the artist swing along to that evening Mecca of good
Bohemians--the Boulevard St.[Illustration: (basket of flowers)]




CHAPTER II

THE BOULEVARD ST.MICHEL


From the Place St.Michel, this ever gay and crowded boulevard ascends a
long incline, up which the tired horses tug at the traces of the
fiacres, and the big double-decked steam trams crawl, until they reach
the Luxembourg Gardens,--and so on a level road as far as the Place de
l'Observatoire.Within this length lies the life of the "Boul' Miche."Nearly every highway has its popular side, and on the "Boul' Miche" it
is the left one, coming up from the Seine.Here are the cafes, and from
5 P.M.until long past midnight, the life of the Quartier pours by
them--students, soldiers, families, poets, artists, sculptors, wives,
and sweethearts; bicycle girls, the modern grisette, the shop girl, and
the model; fakirs, beggars, and vagrants.Yet the word vagrant is a
misnomer in this city, where economy has reached a finesse that is
marvelous.That fellow, in filth and rags, shuffling along, his eyes
scrutinizing, like a hungry rat, every nook and corner under the cafe
tables on the terrace, carries a stick spiked with a pin.The next
instant, he has raked the butt of your discarded cigarette from beneath
your feet with the dexterity of a croupier.The butt he adds to the
collection in his filthy pocket, and shuffles on to the next cafe.It
will go so far at least toward paying for his absinthe.He is hungry,
but it is the absinthe for which he is working.He is a "marchand de
megots"; it is his profession.[Illustration: TERRACE TAVERNE DU PANTHEON]

One finds every type of restaurant, tavern, and cafe along the "Boul'
Miche."There are small restaurants whose plat du jour might be traced
to some faithful steed finding a final oblivion in a brown sauce and
onions--an important item in a course dinner, to be had with wine
included for one franc fifty.There are brasseries too, gloomy by day
and brilliant by night (dispensing good Munich beer in two shades, and
German and French food), whose rich interiors in carved black oak,
imitation gobelin, and stained glass are never half illumined until the
lights are lit.[Illustration: A "TYPE"]

All day, when the sun blazes, and the awnings are down, sheltering those
chatting on the terrace, the interiors of these brasseries appear dark
and cavernous.The clientele is somber too, and in keeping with the place; silent
poets, long haired, pale, and always writing; serious-minded lawyers,
lunching alone, and fat merchants who eat and drink methodically.Then there are bizarre cafes, like the d'Harcourt, crowded at night with
noisy women tawdry in ostrich plumes, cheap feather boas, and much
rouge.The d'Harcourt at midnight is ablaze with light, but the crowd is
common and you move on up the boulevard under the trees, past the shops
full of Quartier fashions--velvet coats, with standing collars buttoning
close under the chin; flamboyant black silk scarfs tied in a huge bow;
queer broad-brimmed, black hats without which no "types" wardrobe is
complete.On the corner facing the square, and opposite the Luxembourg gate, is
the Taverne du Pantheon.This is the most brilliant cafe and restaurant
of the Quarter, forming a V with its long terrace, at the corner of the
boulevard and the rue Soufflot, at the head of which towers the superb
dome of the Pantheon.[Illustration: (view of Pantheon from Luxembourg gate)]

It is 6 P.M.and the terrace, four rows deep with little round tables,
is rapidly filling.The white-aproned garcons are hurrying about or
squeezing past your table, as they take the various orders."Deux pernod nature, deux!"cries another, and presently the "Omnibus"
in his black apron hurries to your table, holding between his knuckles,
by their necks, half a dozen bottles of different aperitifs, for it is
he who fills your glass.[Illustration: ALONG THE "BOUL' MICHE"]

It is the custom to do most of one's correspondence in these cafes.The
garcon brings you a portfolio containing note-paper, a bottle of violet
ink, an impossible pen that spatters, and a sheet of pink blotting-paper
that does not absorb.With these and your aperitif, the place is yours
as long as you choose to remain.No one will ask you to "move on" or pay
the slightest attention to you.Should you happen to be a cannibal chief from the South Seas, and dine
in a green silk high hat and a necklace of your latest captive's teeth,
you would occasion a passing glance perhaps, but you would not be a
sensation.[Illustration: (hotel sign)]

Celeste would say to Henriette:

"Regarde ca, Henriette!est-il drole, ce sauvage?"And Henriette would reply quite assuringly:

"Eh bien quoi!c'est pas si extraordinaire, il est peut-etre de
Madagascar; il y en a beaucoup a Paris maintenant."There is no phase of character, or eccentricity of dress, that Paris has
not seen.Nor will your waiter polish off the marble top of your table, with the
hope that your ordinary sensibility will suggest another drink.It would
be beneath his professional dignity as a good garcon de cafe.The two
sous you have given him as a pourboire, he is well satisfied with, and
expresses his contentment in a "merci, monsieur, merci," the final
syllable ending in a little hiss, prolonged in proportion to his
satisfaction.After this just formality, you will find him ready to see
the point of a joke or discuss the current topics of the day.He is
intelligent, independent, very polite, but never servile.[Illustration: (woman walking near fountain)]

It is difficult now to find a vacant chair on the long terrace.A group
of students are having a "Pernod," after a long day's work at the
atelier.They finish their absinthe and then, arm in arm, start off to
Madame Poivret's for dinner.It is cheap there; besides, the little
"boite," with its dingy room and sawdust floor, is a favorite haunt of
theirs, and the good old lady, with her credit slate, a friendly refuge
in time of need.At your left sits a girl in bicycle bloomers, yellow-tanned shoes, and
short black socks pulled up snug to her sunburned calves.She has just
ridden in from the Bois de Boulogne, and has scorched half the way back
to meet her "officier" in pale blue.Farther on are four older men, accompanied by a pale, sweet-faced woman
of thirty, her blue-black hair brought in a bandeau over her dainty
ears.She is the model of the gray-haired man on the left, a man of
perhaps fifty, with kindly intelligent eyes and strong, nervous,
expressive hands--hands that know how to model a colossal Greek
war-horse, plunging in battle, or create a nymph scarcely a foot high
out of a lump of clay, so charmingly that the French Government has not
only bought the nymph, but given him a little red ribbon for his pains.[Illustration: (omnibus)]

He is telling the others of a spot he knows in Normandy, where one can
paint--full of quaint farm-houses, with thatched roofs; picturesque
roadsides, rich in foliage; bright waving fields, and cool green
woods, and purling streams; quaint gardens, choked with lavender and
roses and hollyhocks--and all this fair land running to the white sand
of the beach, with the blue sea beyond.He will write to old Pere
Jaqueline that they are all coming--it is just the place in which to
pose a model "en plein air,"--and Suzanne, his model, being a Normande
herself, grows enthusiastic at the thought of going down again to the
sea.Long before she became a Parisienne, and when her beautiful hair
was a tangled shock of curls, she used to go out in the big boats,
with the fisherwomen--barefooted, brown, and happy.She tells them of
those good days, and then they all go into the Taverne to dine, filled
with the idea of the new trip, and dreaming of dinners under the
trees, of "Tripes a la mode de Caen," Normandy cider, and a lot of new
sketches besides.[Illustration: (shop front)]

Already the tables within are well filled.The long room, with its newer
annex, is as brilliant as a jewel box--the walls rich in tiled panels
suggesting the life of the Quarter, the woodwork in gold and light oak,
the big panels of the rich gold ceiling exquisitely painted.At one of the tables two very chic young women are dining with a young
Frenchman, his hair and dress in close imitation of the Duc d'Orleans.A strikingly pretty woman, in a scarlet-spangled gown as red as her
lips, is dining with a well-built, soldierly-looking man in black; they
sit side by side as is the custom here.The woman reminds one of a red lizard--a salamander--her "svelte" body
seemingly boneless in its gown of clinging scales.Her hair is
purple-black and freshly onduled; her skin as white as ivory.She has
the habit of throwing back her small, well-posed head, while under their
delicately penciled lids her gray eyes take in the room at a glance.She is not of the Quarter, but the Taverne du Pantheon is a refuge for
her at times, when she grows tired of Paillard's and Maxim's and her
quarreling retinue."Let them howl on the other bank of the Seine," says this empress of
the half-world to herself, "I dine with Raoul where I please."And now one glittering, red arm with its small, heavily-jeweled hand
glides toward Raoul's open cigarette case, and in withdrawing a
cigarette she presses for a moment his big, strong hand as he holds near
her polished nails the flaming match.[Illustration: ALONG THE SEINE]

Her companion watches her as she smokes and talks--now and then he leans
closer to her, squaring his broad shoulders and bending lower his
strong, determined face, as he listens to her,--half-amused, replying to
her questions leisurely, in short, crisp sentences.Suddenly she stamps
one little foot savagely under the table, and, clenching her jeweled
hands, breathes heavily.She is trembling with rage; the man at her side
hunches his great shoulders, flicks the ashes from his cigarette, looks
at her keenly for a moment, and then smiles.In a moment she is herself
again, almost penitent; this little savage, half Roumanian, half
Russian, has never known what it was to be ruled!She has seen men grow
white when she has stamped her little foot, but this big Raoul, whom she
loves--who once held a garrison with a handful of men--he does not
tremble!she loves him for his devil-me-care indifference--and he enjoys
her temper.But the salamander remembers there are some whom she dominated, until
they groveled like slaves at her feet; even the great Russian nobleman
turned pale when she dictated to him archly and with the voice of an
angel the price of his freedom.he shot himself the next day," mused the salamander.Yes, and even the adamant old banker in Paris, crabbed, stern,
unrelenting to his debtors--shivered in his boots and ended in signing
away half his fortune to her, and moved his family into a permanent
chateau in the country, where he keeps himself busy with his shooting
and his books.*     *     *     *     *

As it grows late, the taverne becomes more and more animated.Every one is talking and having a good time.The room is bewildering in
gay color, the hum of conversation is everywhere, and as there is a
corresponding row of tables across the low, narrow room, friendly
greetings and often conversations are kept up from one side to the
other.The dinner, as it progresses, assumes the air of a big family
party of good bohemians.The French do not bring their misery with them
to the table.To dine is to enjoy oneself to the utmost; in fact the
French people cover their disappointment, sadness, annoyances, great or
petty troubles, under a masque of "blague," and have such an innate
dislike of sympathy or ridicule that they avoid it by turning
everything into "blague."This veneer is misleading, for at heart the French are sad.Not to speak
of their inmost feelings does not, on the other hand, prevent them at
times from being most confidential.Often, the merest exchange of
courtesies between those sharing the same compartment in a train, or a
seat on a "bus," seems to be a sufficient introduction for your neighbor
to tell you where he comes from, where he is going, whether he is
married or single, whom his daughter married, and what regiment his son
is in.These little confidences often end in his offering you half his
bottle of wine and extending to you his cigarettes.[Illustration: LES BEAUX MAQUEREAUX]

If you have finished dinner, you go out on the terrace for your coffee.The fakirs are passing up and down in front, selling their wares--little
rabbits, wonderfully lifelike, that can jump along your table and sit on
their hind legs, and wag their ears; toy snakes; small leaden pigs for
good luck; and novelties of every description.Here one sees women with
baskets of ecrivisse boiled scarlet; an acrobat tumbles on the
pavement, and two men and a girl, as a marine, a soldier, and a
vivandiere, in silvered faces and suits, pose in melodramatic attitudes.The vivandiere is rescued alternately from a speedy death by the marine
and the soldier.Presently a little old woman approaches, shriveled and smiling, in her
faded furbelows now in rags.She sings in a piping voice and executes
between the verses a tottering pas seul, her eyes ever smiling, as if
she still saw over the glare of the footlights, in the haze beyond, the
vast audience of by-gone days; smiling as if she still heard the big
orchestra and saw the leader with his vibrant baton, watching her every
movement.She is over seventy now, and was once a premier danseuse at
the opera.But you have not seen all of the Taverne du Pantheon yet.There is an
"American Bar" downstairs; at least, so the sign reads at the top of a
narrow stairway leading to a small, tavern-like room, with a sawdust
floor, heavy deal tables, and wooden stools.In front of the bar are
high stools that one climbs up on and has a lukewarm whisky soda, next
to Yvonne and Marcelle, who are both singing the latest catch of the day
at the top of their lungs, until they are howled at to keep still or are
lifted bodily off their high stools by the big fellow in the "type" hat,
who has just come in.[Illustration: MOTHER AND DAUGHTER]

Before a long table at one end of the room is the crowd of American
students singing in a chorus.The table is full now, for many have come
from dinners at other cafes to join them.At one end, and acting as
interlocutor for this impromptu minstrel show, presides one of the
best fellows in the world.He rises solemnly, his genial round face
wreathed in a subtle smile, and announces that he will sing, by earnest
request, that popular ballad, "'Twas Summer and the Little Birds were
Singing in the Trees."There are some especially fine "barber chords" in this popular ditty,
and the words are so touching that it is repeated over and over again.Then it is sung softly like the farmhand quartettes do in the rural
melodrama outside the old homestead in harvest time.I tell you it's
a truly rural octette.Listen to that exhibition bass voice of Jimmy
Sands and that wandering tenor of Tommy Whiteing, and as the last chord
dies away (over the fields presumably) a shout goes up:

"How's that?""Out of sight," comes the general verdict from the crowd, and bang go a
dozen beer glasses in unison on the heavy table."Oh, que c'est beau!"cries Mimi, leading the successful chorus in a new
vocal number with Edmond's walking-stick; but this time it is a French
song and the whole room is singing it, including our old friend,
Monsieur Frank, the barkeeper, who is mixing one of his famous
concoctions which are never twice quite alike, but are better than if
they were.The harmonic beauties of "'Twas Summer and the Little Birds were Singing
in the Trees" are still inexhausted, but it sadly needs a piano
accompaniment--with this it would be perfect; and so the whole crowd,
including Yvonne, and Celeste, and Marcelle, and the two Frenchmen, and
the girl in the bicycle clothes, start for Jack Thompson's studio in the
rue des Fourneaux, where there is a piano that, even if the candles in
the little Louis XVI brackets do burn low and spill down the keys, and
the punch rusts the strings, it will still retain that beautiful, rich
tone that every French upright, at seven francs a month, possesses.[Illustration: (Bullier)]

CHAPTER III

THE "BAL BULLIER"


There are all types of "bals" in Paris.Over in Montmartre, on the Place
Blanche, is the well-known "Moulin Rouge," a place suggestive, to those
who have never seen it, of the quintessence of Parisian devil-me-care
gaiety.You expect it to be like those clever pen-and-ink drawings of
Grevin's, of the old Jardin Mabille in its palmiest days, brilliant with
lights and beautiful women extravagantly gowned and bejeweled.You
expect to see Frenchmen, too, in pot-hats, crowding in a circle about
Fifine, who is dancing some mad can-can, half hidden in a swirl of point
lace, her small, polished boots alternately poised above her dainty
head.And when she has finished, you expect her to be carried off to
supper at the Maison Doree by the big, fierce-looking Russian who has
been watching her, and whose victoria, with its spanking team--black and
glossy as satin--champing their silver bits outside, awaiting her
pleasure.But in all these anticipations you will be disappointed, for the famous
Jardin Mabille is no more, and the ground where it once stood in the
Champs Elysees is now built up with private residences.Fifine is gone,
too--years ago--and most of the old gentlemen in pot-hats who used to
watch her are buried or about to be.Few Frenchmen ever go to the
"Moulin Rouge," but every American does on his first night in Paris, and
emerges with enough cab fare to return him to his hotel, where he
arrives with the positive conviction that the red mill, with its slowly
revolving sails, lurid in crimson lights, was constructed especially for
him.He remembers, too, his first impressions of Paris that very morning
as his train rolled into the Gare St.His aunt could wait until
to-morrow to see the tomb of Napoleon, but he would see the "Moulin
Rouge" first, and to be in ample time ordered dinner early in his
expensive, morgue-like hotel.I remember once, a few hours after my arrival in Paris, walking up the
long hill to the Place Blanche at 2 P.M., under a blazing July sun, to
see if they did not give a matinee at the "Moulin Rouge."The place was
closed, it is needless to say, and the policeman I found pacing his beat
outside, when I asked him what day they gave a matinee, put his thumbs
in his sword belt, looked at me quizzically for a moment, and then
roared.The "Moulin Rouge" is in full blast every night; in the day-time
it is being aired.Farther up in Montmartre, up a steep, cobbly hill, past quaint little
shops and cafes, the hill becoming so steep that your cab horse
finally refuses to climb further, and you get out and walk up to the
"Moulin de la Galette."You find it a far different type of ball from
the "Moulin Rouge," for it is not made for the stranger, and its
clientele is composed of the rougher element of that quarter.[Illustration: (street scene)]

A few years ago the "Galette" was not the safest of places for a
stranger to go to alone.Since then, however, this ancient granary and
mill, that has served as a ball-room for so many years, has undergone a
radical change in management; but it is still a cliquey place, full of a
lot of habitues who regard a stranger as an intruder.Should you by
accident step on Marcelle's dress or jostle her villainous-looking
escort, you will be apt to get into a row, beginning with a mode of
attack you are possibly ignorant of, for these "maquereaux" fight with
their feet, having developed this "manly art" of self-defense to a point
of dexterity more to be evaded than admired.And while Marcelle's
escort, with a swinging kick, smashes your nose with his heel, his pals
will take the opportunity to kick you in the back.So, if you go to the "Galette," go with a Parisian or some of the
students of the Quarter; but if you must go alone--keep your eyes on the
band.It is a good band, too, and its chef d'orchestre, besides being a
clever musical director, is a popular composer as well.Go out from the ball-room into the tiny garden and up the ladder-like
stairs to the rock above, crowned with the old windmill, and look over
the iron railing.Far below you, swimming in a faint mist under the
summer stars, all Paris lies glittering at your feet.*     *     *     *     *

You will find the "Bal Bullier" of the Latin Quarter far different from
the "bals" of Montmartre.It forms, with its "grand fete" on Thursday
nights, a sort of social event of the week in this Quarter of Bohemians,
just as the Friday afternoon promenade does in the Luxembourg garden.If you dine at the Taverne du Pantheon on a Thursday night you will find
that the taverne is half deserted by 10 o'clock, and that every one is
leaving and walking up the "Boul' Miche" toward the "Bullier."Follow
them, and as you reach the place l'Observatoire, and turn a sharp corner
to the left, you will see the facade of this famous ball, illumined by a
sizzling blue electric light over the entrance.The facade, with its colored bas-reliefs of students and grisettes,
reminds one of the proscenium of a toy theater.Back of this shallow
wall bristle the tops of the trees in the garden adjoining the big
ball-room, both of which are below the level of the street and are
reached by a broad wooden stairway.The "Bal Bullier" was founded in 1847; previous to this there existed
the "Closerie des Lilas" on the Boulevard Montparnasse.You pass along
with the line of waiting poets and artists, buy a green ticket for two
francs at the little cubby-hole of a box-office, are divested of your
stick by one of half a dozen white-capped matrons at the vestiaire, hand
your ticket to an elderly gentleman in a silk hat and funereal clothes,
at the top of the stairway sentineled by a guard of two soldiers, and
the next instant you see the ball in full swing below you.[Illustration: (portrait of man)]

There is nothing disappointing about the "Bal Bullier."It is all you
expected it to be, and more, too.Below you is a veritable whirlpool of
girls and students--a vast sea of heads, and a dazzling display of
colors and lights and animation.Little shrieks and screams fill your
ears, as the orchestra crashes into the last page of a galop, quickening
the pace until Yvonne's little feet slip and her cheeks glow, and her
eyes grow bright, and half her pretty golden hair gets smashed over her
impudent little nose.Then the galop is brought up with a quick finish.comes from every quarter of the big room, and
the conductor, with his traditional good-nature, begins again.He knows
it is wiser to humor them, and off they go again, still faster, until
all are out of breath and rush into the garden for a breath of cool air
and a "citron glace."And what a pretty garden it is!--full of beautiful trees and dotted with
round iron tables, and laid out in white gravel walks, the garden
sloping gently back to a fountain, and a grotto and an artificial
cascade all in one, with a figure of Venus in the center, over which the
water splashes and trickles.There is a green lattice proscenium, too,
surrounding the fountain, illuminated with colored lights and outlined
in tiny flames of gas, and grotto-like alcoves circling the garden, each
with a table and room for two.The ball-room from the garden presents a
brilliant contrast, as one looks down upon it from under the trees.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

But the orchestra has given its signal--a short bugle call announcing a
quadrille; and those in the garden are running down into the ball-room
to hunt up their partners.The "Bullier" orchestra will interest you; they play with a snap and
fire and a tempo that is irresistible.They have played together so long
that they have become known as the best of all the bal orchestras.The leader, too, is interesting--tall and gaunt, with wild, deep-sunken
eyes resembling those of an old eagle.Now and then he turns his head
slowly as he leads, and rests these keen, penetrating orbs on the sea of
dancers below him.Then, with baton raised above his head, he brings his
orchestra into the wild finale of the quadrille--piccolos and clarinets,
cymbals, bass viols, and violins--all in one mad race to the end, but so
well trained that not a note is lost in the scramble--and they finish
under the wire to a man, amid cheers from Mimi and Celeste and "encores"
and "bis's" from every one else who has breath enough left to shout
with.[Illustration: A TYPE OF THE QUARTER
By Helleu.--Estampe Moderne]

Often after an annual dinner of one of the ateliers, the entire body of
students will march into the "Bullier," three hundred strong, and take a
good-natured possession of the place.There have been some serious
demonstrations in the Quarter by the students, who can form a small army
when combined.But as a rule you will find them a good-natured lot of
fellows, who are out for all the humor and fun they can create at the
least expense.But in June, 1893, a serious demonstration by the students occurred, for
these students can fight as well as dance.Senator Beranger, having
read one morning in the "Courrier Francais" an account of the revelry
and nudity of several of the best-known models of the Quarter at the
"Quat'z' Arts" ball, brought a charge against the organizers of the
ball, and several of the models, whose beauty unadorned had made them
conspicuous on this most festive occasion.At the ensuing trial, several
celebrated beauties and idols of the Latin Quarter were convicted and
sentenced to a short term of imprisonment, and fined a hundred francs
each.These sentences were, however, remitted, but the majority of the
students would not have it thus, and wanted further satisfaction.A mass
meeting was held by them in the Place de la Sorbonne.The police were in
force there to stop any disturbance, and up to 10 o'clock at night the
crowd was held in control.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

It was a warm June night, and every student in the Quarter was keyed to
a high state of excitement.Finally a great crowd of students formed in
front of the Cafe d'Harcourt, opposite the Sorbonne; things were at
fever heat; the police became rough; and in the row that ensued,
somebody hurled one of the heavy stone match-safes from a cafe table at
one of the policemen, who in his excitement picked it up and hurled it
back into the crowd.It struck and injured fatally an innocent outsider,
who was taken to the Charity Hospital, in the rue Jacob, and died there.On the following Monday another mass meeting of students was held in the
Place de la Sorbonne, who, after the meeting, formed in a body and
marched to the Chamber of Deputies, crying: "Conspuez Dupuy," who was
then president of the Chamber.A number of deputies came out on the
portico and the terrace, and smilingly reviewed the demonstration, while
the students hurled their anathemas at them, the leaders and men in the
front rank of this howling mob trying to climb over the high railing in
front of the terrace, and shouting that the police were responsible for
the death of one of their comrades.The Government, fearing further trouble and wishing to avoid any
disturbance on the day of the funeral of the victim of the riot in the
Place Sorbonne, deceived the public as to the hour when it would occur.This exasperated the students so that they began one of those
demonstrations for which Paris is famous.the next day the
Quartier Latin was in a state of siege--these poets and painters and
sculptors and musicians tore up the rue Jacob and constructed barricades
near the hospital where their comrade had died.They tore up the rue
Bonaparte, too, at the Place St.Germain des Pres, and built barricades,
composed of overturned omnibuses and tramcars and newspaper booths.They
smashed windows and everything else in sight, to get even with the
Government and the smiling deputies and the murderous police--and then
the troops came, and the affair took a different turn.In three days
thirty thousand troops were in Paris--principally cavalry, many of the
regiments coming from as far away as the center of France.[Illustration: ECOLE DES BEAUX ARTS]

With these and the police and the Garde Republicaine against them, the
students melted away like a handful of snow in the sun; but the
demonstrations continued spasmodically for two or three days longer, and
the little crooked streets, like the rue du Four, were kept clear by the
cavalry trotting abreast--in and out and dodging around corners--their
black horse-tail plumes waving and helmets shining.It is sufficient to
say that the vast army of artists and poets were routed to a man and
driven back into the more peaceful atmosphere of their studios.But the "Bullier" is closing and the crowd is pouring out into the cool
air.I catch a glimpse of Yvonne with six students all in one fiacre,
but Yvonne has been given the most comfortable place.They have put her
in the hood, and the next instant they are rattling away to the Pantheon
for supper.If you walk down with the rest, you will pass dozens of jolly groups
singing and romping and dancing along down the "Boul' Miche" to the
taverne, for a bock and some ecrivisse.With youth, good humor, and a
"louis," all the world seems gay!CHAPTER IV

BAL DES QUAT'Z' ARTS


Of all the balls in Paris, the annual "Bal des Quat'z' Arts" stands
unique.This costume ball is given every year, in the spring, by the
students of the different ateliers, each atelier vying with the others
in creation of the various floats and corteges, and in the artistic
effect and historical correctness of the costumes.The first "Quat'z' Arts" ball was given in 1892.It was a primitive
affair, compared with the later ones, but it was a success, and
immediately the "Quat'z' Arts" Ball was put into the hands of clever
organizers, and became a studied event in all its artistic sense.Months
are spent in the creation of spectacles and in the costuming of students
and models.Prizes are given for the most successful organizations, and
a jury composed of painters and sculptors passes upon your costume as
you enter the ball, and if you do not come up to their artistic
standard you are unceremoniously turned away.Students who have been
successful in getting into the "Quat'z' Arts" for years often fail to
pass into this bewildering display of beauty and brains, owing to their
costume not possessing enough artistic originality or merit to pass the
jury.[Illustration: (coiffeur sign)]

It is, of course, a difficult matter for one who is not an enrolled
member of one of the great ateliers of painting, architecture, or
sculpture to get into the "Quat'z' Arts," and even after one's ticket is
assured, you may fail to pass the jury.Imagine this ball, with its procession of moving tableaux.A huge float
comes along, depicting the stone age and the primitive man, every detail
carefully studied from the museums.Another represents the last day of
Babylon.One sees a nude captive, her golden hair and white flesh in
contrast with the black velvet litter on which she is bound, being
carried by a dozen stalwart blackamoors, followed by camels bearing nude
slaves and the spoils of a captured city.[Illustration: (photograph of woman)]

As the ball continues until daylight, it resembles a bacchanalian fete
in the days of the Romans.But all through it, one is impressed by its
artistic completeness, its studied splendor, and permissible license, so
long as a costume (or the lack of it) produces an artistic result.One
sees the mise en scene of a barbaric court produced by the architects of
an atelier, all the various details constructed from carefully studied
sketches, with maybe a triumphal throne of some barbaric king, with his
slaves, the whole costumed and done in a studied magnificence that
takes one's breath away.Again an atelier of painters may reproduce the
frieze of the Parthenon in color; another a float or a decoration,
suggesting the works of their master.The room becomes a thing of splendor, for it is as gorgeous a spectacle
as the cleverest of the painters, sculptors, and architects can make it,
and is the result of careful study--and all for the love of it!--for the
great "Quat'z' Arts" ball is an event looked forward to for months.Special instructions are issued to the different ateliers while the ball
is in preparation, and the following one is a translation in part from
the notice issued before the great ball of '99.As this is a special and
private notice to the atelier, its contents may be interesting:


                                      BAL DES QUAT'Z' ARTS,
                                    Moulin Rouge, 21 April, 1899.The card of admission is absolutely personal, to be taken by the
     committee before the opening of the ball.[Illustration: (admission card)]

     The committee will be masked, and comrades without their personal
     card will be refused at the door.The cards must carry the name and
     quality of the artist, and bear the stamp of his atelier.The soldier--the dress suit,
     black or in color--the monk--the blouse--the domino--kitchen
     boy--loafer--bicyclist, and other nauseous types, are absolutely
     prohibited.Should the weather be bad, comrades are asked to wait in their
     carriages, as the committee in control cannot, under any pretext,
     neglect guarding the artistic effect of the ball during any
     confusion that might ensue.A great "feed" will take place in the grand hall; the buffet will
     serve as usual individual suppers and baskets for two persons.The committee wish especially to bring the attention of their
     comrades to the question of women, whose cards of admission
     must be delivered as soon as possible, so as to enlarge their
     attendance--always insufficient.Prizes (champagne) will be distributed to the ateliers who may
     distinguish themselves by the artistic merit and beauty of their
     female display.[Illustration: (photograph of woman)]

     All the women who compete for these prizes will be assembled on
     the grand staircase before the orchestra.The nude, as always, is
     PROHIBITED!?!The question of music at the head of the procession is of the
     greatest importance, and those comrades who are musical will please
     give their names to the delegates of the ateliers.Your good-will
     in this line is asked for--any great worthless capacity in this
     line will do, as they always play the same tune, "Les Pompiers!"For days before the "Quat'z' Arts" ball, all is excitement among the
students, who do as little work as possible and rest themselves for the
great event.The favorite wit of the different ateliers is given the
task of painting the banner of the atelier, which is carried at the head
of the several corteges.One of these, in Bouguereau's atelier, depicted
their master caricatured as a cupid.The boys once constructed an elephant with oriental trappings--an
elephant that could wag his ears and lift his trunk and snort--and after
the two fellows who formed respectfully the front and hind legs of this
knowing beast had practised sufficiently to proceed with him safely, at
the head of a cortege of slave girls, nautch dancers, and manacled
captives, the big beast created a success in the procession at the
"Quat'z' Arts" ball.[Illustration: (portrait of man)]

After the ball, in the gray morning light, they marched it back to the
atelier, where it remained for some weeks, finally becoming such a
nuisance, kicking around the atelier and getting in everybody's way,
that the boys agreed to give it to the first junk-man that came around.But as no junk-man came, and as no one could be found to care for its
now sadly battered hulk, its good riddance became a problem.At last the two, who had sweltered in its dusty frame that eventful
night of the "Quat'z' Arts," hit upon an idea.They marched it one day
up the Boulevard St.Germain to the Cafe des deux Magots, followed by a
crowd of people, who, when it reached the cafe, assembled around it,
every one asking what it was for--or rather what it was?--for the beast
had by now lost much of the resemblance of its former self.When half
the street became blocked with the crowd, the two wise gentlemen crawled
out of its fore and aft, and quickly mingled, unnoticed, with the
bystanders.Then they disappeared in the crowd, leaving the elephant
standing in the middle of the street.Those who had been expecting
something to happen--a circus or the rest of the parade to come
along--stood around for a while, and then the police, realizing that
they had an elephant on their hands, carted the thing away, swearing
meanwhile at the atelier and every one connected with it.The cafes near the Odeon, just before the beginning of the ball, are
filled with students in costume; gladiators hobnob at the tables with
savages in scanty attire--Roman soldiers and students, in the garb of
the ancients, strut about or chat in groups, while the uninvited
grisettes and models, who have not received invitations from the
committee, implore them for tickets.Tickets are not transferable, and should one present himself at the
entrance of the ball with another fellow's ticket, he would run small
chance of entering.The student answers, while the jury glance at his makeup.cries the jury, and you pass in to the ball.But if you are unknown they will say simply, "Connais-pas!and you pass down a long covered alley--confident, if you are a
"nouveau," that it leads into the ball-room--until you suddenly find
yourself in the street, where your ticket is torn up and all hope of
entering is gone.It is hopeless to attempt to describe the hours until morning of this
annual artistic orgy.As the morning light comes in through the
windows, it is strange to see the effect of diffused daylight,
electricity, and gas--the bluish light of early morning reflected on the
flesh tones--upon nearly three thousand girls and students in costumes
one might expect to see in a bacchanalian feast, just before the fall of
Rome.Now they form a huge circle, the front row sitting on the floor,
the second row squatting, the third seated in chairs, the fourth
standing, so that all can see the dancing that begins in the morning
hours--the wild impromptu dancing of the moment.A famous beauty, her
black hair bound in a golden fillet with a circle wrought in silver and
studded with Oriental turquoises clasping her superb torso, throws her
sandals to the crowd and begins an Oriental dance--a thing of grace and
beauty--fired with the intensity of the innate nature of this
beautifully modeled daughter of Bohemia.As the dance ends, there is a cry of delight from the great circle of
barbarians."Long live the Quat'z' Arts!"they cry, amid cheers for the
dancer.The ball closes about seven in the morning, when the long procession
forms to return to the Latin Quarter, some marching, other students and
girls in cabs and on top of them, many of the girls riding the horses.Down they come from the "Moulin Rouge," shouting, singing, and yelling.Heads are thrust out of windows, and a volley of badinage passes between
the fantastic procession and those who have heard them coming.Finally the great open court of the Louvre is reached--here a halt is
made and a general romp occurs.A girl and a type climb one of the
tall lamp-posts and prepare to do a mid-air balancing act, when
rescued by the others.At last, at the end of all this horse-play, the
march is resumed over the Pont du Carrousel and so on, cheered now by
those going to work, until the Odeon is reached.Here the odd
procession disbands; some go to their favorite cafes where the
festivities are continued--some to sleep in their costumes or what
remains of them, wherever fortune lands them--others to studios, where
the gaiety is often kept up for days.but life is not all "couleur de rose" in this true Bohemia."One day," says little Marguerite (she who lives in the rue Monge), "one
eats and the next day one doesn't.It is always like that, is it not,
monsieur?--and it costs so much to live, and so you see, monsieur, life
is always a fight."And Marguerite's brown eyes swim a little and her pretty mouth closes
firmly."I do not know, monsieur," she replies quietly; "I have not seen him in
ten days--the atelier is closed--I have been there every day, expecting
to find him--he left no word with his concierge.I have been to his cafe
too, but no one has seen him--you see, monsieur, Paul does not love me!"I recall an incident that I chanced to see in passing the little shop
where Marguerite works, that only confirms the truth of her realization.Paul had taken Marguerite back to the little shop, after their dejeuner
together, and, as I passed, he stopped at the door with her, kissed her
on both cheeks, and left her; but before they had gone a dozen paces,
they ran back to embrace again.This occurred four times, until Paul and
Marguerite finally parted.And, as he watched her little heels disappear
up the wooden stairs to her work-room above, Paul blew a kiss to the
pretty milliner at the window next door, and, taking a long whiff of his
cigarette, sauntered off in the direction of his atelier whistling.[Illustration: A MORNING'S WORK]

It is ideal, this student life with its student loves of four years, but
is it right to many an honest little comrade, who seldom knows an hour
when she is away from her ami?who has suffered and starved and slaved
with him through years of days of good and bad luck--who has encouraged
him in his work, nursed him when ill, and made a thousand golden hours
in this poet's or painter's life so completely happy, that he looks back
on them in later life as never-to-be-forgotten?He remembers the good
dinners at the little restaurant near his studio, where they dined among
the old crowd.There were Lavaud the sculptor and Francine, with the
figure of a goddess; Moreau, who played the cello at the opera; little
Louise Dumont, who posed at Julian's, and old Jacquemart, the very soul
of good fellowship, who would set them roaring with his inimitable
humor.What good dinners they were!--and how long they sat over their coffee
and cigarettes under the trees in front of this little restaurant--often
ten and twelve at a time, until more tables had to be pushed together
for others of their good friends, who in passing would be hailed to join
them.And how Marguerite used to sing all through dinner and how they
would all sing, until it grew so late and so dark that they had to puff
their cigarettes aglow over their plates, and yell to Madame Giraud for
a light!And how the old lady would bustle out with the little oil lamp,
placing it in the center of the long table amid the forest of vin
ordinaires, with a "Voila, mes enfants!"and a cheery word for all these
good boys and girls, whom she regarded quite as her own children.It seemed to them then that there would never be anything else but
dinners at Madame Giraud's for as many years as they pleased, for no one
ever thought of living out one's days, except in this good Bohemia of
Paris.They could not imagine that old Jacquemart would ever die, or
that La Belle Louise would grow old, and go back to Marseilles, to live
with her dried-up old aunt, who sold garlic and bad cheese in a little
box of a shop, up a crooked street!Or that Francine would marry Martin,
the painter, and that the two would bury themselves in an adorable
little spot in Brittany, where they now live in a thatched farm-house,
full of Martin's pictures, and have a vegetable garden of their own--and
a cow--and some children![Illustration: A STUDIO DEJEUNER]

And those memorable dinners in the old studio back of the Gare
Montparnasse!when paints and easels were pushed aside, and the table
spread, and the piano rolled up beside it.There was the buying of the
chicken, and the salad that Francine would smother in a dressing into
which she would put a dozen different things--herbs and spices and tiny
white onions!And what a jolly crowd came to these impromptu feasts!How they danced and sang until the gray
morning light would creep in through the big skylight, when all these
good bohemians would tiptoe down the waxed stairs, and slip past the
different ateliers for fear of waking those painters who might be
asleep--a thought that never occurred to them until broad daylight, and
the door had been opened, after hours of pandemonium and music and
noise!In a little hotel near the Odeon, there lived a family of just such
bohemians--six struggling poets, each with an imagination and a love of
good wine and good dinners and good times that left them continually in
a state of bankruptcy!As they really never had any money--none that
ever lasted for more than two days and two nights at the utmost, their
good landlord seldom saw a sou in return for his hospitable roof, which
had sheltered these six great minds who wrote of the moon, and of fate,
and fortune, and love.For days they would dream and starve and write.Then followed an auction
sale of the total collection of verses, hawked about anywhere and
everywhere among the editeurs, like a crop of patiently grown fruit.Having sold it, literally by the yard, they would all saunter up the
"Boul' Miche," and forget their past misery, in feasting, to their
hearts' content, on the good things of life.On days like these, you
would see them passing, their black-brimmed hats adjusted jauntily over
their poetic locks--their eyes beaming with that exquisite sense of
feeling suddenly rich, that those who live for art's sake know!The
keenest of pleasures lie in sudden contrasts, and to these six poetic,
impractical Bohemians, thus suddenly raised from the slough of despond
to a state where they no longer trod with mortals--their cup of
happiness was full and spilling over.They must not only have a good
time, but so must every one around them.With their great riches, they
would make the world gay as long as it lasted, for when it was over they
knew how sad life would be.For a while--then they would scratch
away--and have another auction![Illustration: DAYLIGHT]

Unlike another good fellow, a painter whom I once knew, who periodically
found himself without a sou, and who would take himself, in despair, to
his lodgings, make his will, leaving most of his immortal works to his
English aunt, go to bed, and calmly await death!In a fortunate space of
time his friends, who had been hunting for him all over the Quarter,
would find him at last and rescue him from his chosen tomb; or his good
aunt, fearing he was ill, would send a draft!Then life would, to this
impractical philosopher, again become worth living.He would dispatch a
"petit bleu" to Marcelle; and the two would meet at the Cafe Cluny, and
dine at La Perruse on filet de sole au vin blanc, and a bottle of Haut
Barsac--the bottle all cobwebs and cradled in its basket--the garcon, as
he poured its golden contents, holding his breath meanwhile lest he
disturb its long slumber.There are wines that stir the soul, and this was one of them--clear as a
topaz and warming as the noonday sun--the same warmth that had given it
birth on its hillside in Bordeaux, as far back as '82.It warmed the
heart of Marcelle, too, and made her cheeks glow and her eyes
sparkle--and added a rosier color to her lips.It made her talk--clearly
and frankly, with a full and a happy heart, so that she confessed her
love for this "bon garcon" of a painter, and her supreme admiration for
his work and the financial success he had made with his art.All of
which this genial son of Bohemia drank in with a feeling of pride, and
he would swell out his chest and curl the ends of his long mustache
upwards, and sigh like a man burdened with money, and secure in his
ability and success, and with a peaceful outlook into the future--and
the fact that Marcelle loved him of all men!They would linger long over
their coffee and cigarettes, and then the two would stroll out under the
stars and along the quai, and watch the little Seine boats crossing and
recrossing, like fireflies, and the lights along the Pont Neuf reflected
deep down like parti-colored ribbons in the black water.[Illustration: (pair of high heeled shoes)]




CHAPTER V

"A DEJEUNER AT LAVENUE'S"


If you should chance to breakfast at "Lavenue's," or, as it is called,
the "Hotel de France et Bretagne," for years famous as a rendezvous of
men celebrated in art and letters, you will be impressed first with the
simplicity of the three little rooms forming the popular side of this
restaurant, and secondly with the distinguished appearance of its
clientele.[Illustration: MADEMOISELLE FANNY AND HER STAFF]

As you enter the front room, you pass good Mademoiselle Fanny at the
desk, a cheery, white-capped, genial old lady, who has sat behind that
desk for forty years, and has seen many a "bon garcon" struggle up the
ladder of fame--from the days when he was a student at the Beaux-Arts,
until his name became known the world over.It has long been a
favorite restaurant with men like Rodin, the sculptor--and Colin, the
painter--and the late Falguiere--and Jean Paul Laurens and Bonnat,
and dozens of others equally celebrated--and with our own men, like
Whistler and Sargent and Harrison, and St.These three plain little rooms are totally different from the "other
side," as it is called, of the Maison Lavenue.Here one finds quite a
gorgeous cafe, with a pretty garden in the rear, and another
room--opening into the garden--done in delicate green lattice and
mirrors.This side is far more expensive to dine in than the side with
the three plain little rooms, and the gentlemen with little red
ribbons in their buttonholes; but as the same good cook dispenses from
the single big kitchen, which serves for the dear and the cheap side
the same good things to eat at just half the price, the reason for the
popularity of the "cheap side" among the crowd who come here daily is
evident.[Illustration: RODIN]

It is a quiet, restful place, this Maison Lavenue, and the best place I
know in which to dine or breakfast from day to day.There is an air of
intime and cosiness about Lavenue's that makes one always wish to
return.[Illustration: (group of men dining)]

You will see a family of rich bourgeois enter, just in from the country,
for the Montparnasse station is opposite.The fat, sunburned mama, and
the equally rotund and genial farmer-papa, and the pretty daughter, and
the newly married son and his demure wife, and the two younger
children--and all talking and laughing over a good dinner with
champagne, and many toasts to the young couple--and to mama and papa,
and little Josephine--with ices, and fruit, and coffee, and liqueur to
follow.All these you will see at Lavenue's on the "cheap side"--and the
beautiful model, too, who poses for Courbel, who is breakfasting with
one of the jeunesse of Paris.dine in the front
room with the rest, and jump up now and then to wait on madame and
monsieur.It is a very democratic little place, this popular side of the house of
M. Lavenue, founded in 1854.And there is a jolly old painter who dines there, who is also an
excellent musician, with an ear for rhythm so sensitive that he could
never go to sleep unless the clock in his studio ticked in regular time,
and at last was obliged to give up his favorite atelier, with its
picturesque garden----

"For two reasons, monsieur," he explained to me excitedly; "a little
girl on the floor below me played a polka--the same polka half the
day--always forgetting to put in the top note; and the fellow over me
whistled it the rest of the day and put in the top note false; and so I
moved to the rue St.Peres, where one only hears, within the cool
court-yard, the distant hum of the busy city.The roar of Paris, so full
of chords and melody!Listen to it sometimes, monsieur, and you will
hear a symphony!"[Illustration: "LA FILLE DE LA BLANCHISSEUSE"
By Bellanger.--Estampe Moderne]

And Mademoiselle Fanny will tell you of the famous men she has known for
years, and how she has found the most celebrated of them simple in their
tastes, and free from ostentation--"in fact it is always so, is it not,
with les hommes celebres?C'est toujours comme ca, monsieur, toujours!"and mentions one who has grown gray in the service of art and can count
his decorations from half a dozen governments.Madame will wax
enthusiastic--her face wreathed in smiles.he is a bon garcon; he
always eats with the rest, for three or four francs, never more!He is
so amiable, and, you know, he is very celebrated and very rich"; and
madame will not only tell you his entire history, but about his
work--the beauty of his wife and how "aimables" his children are.Mademoiselle Fanny knows them all.But the men who come here to lunch are not idlers; they come in, many of
them, fresh from a hard morning's work in the studio.The tall sculptor
opposite you has been at work, since his morning coffee, on a group for
the government; another, bare-armed and in his flannel shirt, has been
building up masses of clay, punching and modeling, and scraping away,
all the morning, until he produces, in the rough, the body of a
giantess, a huge caryatide that is destined, for the rest of her
existence, to hold upon her broad shoulders part of the facade of an
American building.The "giantess" in the flesh is lunching with him--a
Juno-like woman of perhaps twenty-five, with a superb head well poised,
her figure firm and erect.You will find her exceedingly interesting,
quiet, and refined, and with a knowledge of things in general that will
surprise you, until you discover she has, in her life as a model, been
thrown daily in conversation with men of genius, and has acquired a
smattering of the knowledge of many things--of art and literature--of
the theater and its playwrights--plunging now and then into medicine and
law and poetry--all these things she has picked up in the studios, in
the cafes, in the course of her Bohemian life.This "vernis," as the
French call it, one finds constantly among the women here, for their
days are passed among men of intelligence and ability, whose lives and
energy are surrounded and encouraged by an atmosphere of art.In an hour, the sculptor and his Juno-like model will stroll back to the
studio, where work will be resumed as long as the light lasts.[Illustration: A TRUE TYPE]

The painter breakfasting at the next table is hard at work on a
decorative panel for a ceiling.It is already laid out and squared up,
from careful pencil drawings.Two young architects are working for him,
laying out the architectural balustrade, through which one, a month
later, looks up at the allegorical figures painted against the dome of
the blue heavens, as a background.And so the painter swallows his eggs,
mayonnaise, and demi of beer, at a gulp, for he has a model coming at
two, and he must finish this ceiling on time, and ship it, by a fast
liner, to a millionaire, who has built a vault-like structure on the
Hudson, with iron dogs on the lawn.Here this beautiful panel will be
unrolled and installed in the dome of the hard-wood billiard-room, where
its rich, mellow scheme of color will count as naught; and the cupids
and the flesh-tones of the chic little model, who came at two, will
appear jaundiced; and Aunt Maria and Uncle John, and the twins from
Ithaca, will come in after the family Sunday dinner of roast beef and
potatoes and rice pudding and ice-water, and look up into the dome and
agree "it's grand."But the painter does not care, for he has locked up
his studio, and taken his twenty thousand francs and the model--who came
at two--with him to Trouville.At night you will find a typical crowd of Bohemians at the Closerie des
Lilas, where they sit under a little clump of trees on the sloping dirt
terrace in front.Here you will see the true type of the Quarter.It is
the farthest up the Boulevard St.Michel of any of the cafes, and just
opposite the "Bal Bullier," on the Place de l'Observatoire.The terrace
is crowded with its habitues, for it is out of the way of the stream of
people along the "Boul' Miche."The terrace is quite dark, its only
light coming from the cafe, back of a green hedge, and it is cool there,
too, in summer, with the fresh night air coming from the Luxembourg
Gardens.Below it is the cafe and restaurant de la Rotonde, a very
well-built looking place, with its rounding facade on the corner.[Illustration: (studio)]

At the entrance of every studio court and apartment, there lives the
concierge in a box of a room generally, containing a huge feather-bed
and furnished with a variety of things left by departing tenants to this
faithful guardian of the gate.Many of these small rooms resemble the
den of an antiquary with their odds and ends from the studios--old
swords, plaster casts, sketches and discarded furniture--until the place
is quite full.Yet it is kept neat and clean by madame, who sews all day
and talks to her cat and to every one who passes into the court-yard.Here your letters are kept, too, in one of a row of boxes, with the
number of your atelier marked thereon.At night, after ten, your concierge opens the heavy iron gate of your
court by pulling a cord within reach of the family bed.He or she is
waked up at intervals through the night to let into and out of a court
full of studios those to whom the night is ever young.Or perhaps your
concierge will be like old Pere Valois, who has three pretty daughters
who do the housework of the studios, as well as assist in the
guardianship of the gate.They are very busy, these three daughters of
Pere Valois--all the morning you will see these little "femmes de
menage" as busy as bees; the artists and poets must be waked up, and
beds made and studios cleaned.There are many that are never cleaned at
all, but then there are many, too, who are not so fortunate as to be
taken care of by the three daughters of Pere Valois.[Illustration: VOILA LA BELLE ROSE, MADAME!]There is no gossip within the quarter that your "femme de menage" does
not know, and over your morning coffee, which she brings you, she will
regale you with the latest news about most of your best friends,
including your favorite model, and madame from whom you buy your wine,
always concluding with: "That is what I heard, monsieur,--I think it is
quite true, because the little Marie, who is the femme de menage of
Monsieur Valentin, got it from Celeste Dauphine yesterday in the cafe in
the rue du Cherche Midi."In the morning, this demure maid-of-all-work will be in her calico dress
with her sleeves rolled up over her strong white arms, but in the
evening you may see her in a chic little dress, at the "Bal Bullier," or
dining at the Pantheon, with the fellow whose studio is opposite yours.[Illustration: A BUSY MORNING]

Alice Lemaitre, however, was a far different type of femme de menage
than any of the gossiping daughters of old Pere Valois, and her lot was
harder, for one night she left her home in one of the provincial towns,
when barely sixteen, and found herself in Paris with three francs to her
name and not a friend in this big pleasure-loving city to turn to.After
many days of privation, she became bonne to a woman known as Yvette de
Marcie, a lady with a bad temper and many jewels, to whom little Alice,
with her rosy cheeks and bright eyes and willing disposition to work in
order to live, became a person upon whom this fashionable virago of a
demi-mondaine vented the worst that was in her--and there was much of
this--until Alice went out into the world again.She next found
employment at a baker's, where she was obliged to get up at four in the
morning, winter and summer, and deliver the long loaves of bread at the
different houses; but the work was too hard and she left.The baker paid
her a trifle a week for her labor, while the attractive Yvette de Marcie
turned her into the street without her wages.It was while delivering
bread one morning to an atelier in the rue des Dames, that she chanced
to meet a young painter who was looking for a good femme de menage to
relieve his artistic mind from the worries of housekeeping.Little Alice
fairly cried when the good painter told her she might come at twenty
francs a month, which was more money than this very grateful and brave
little Brittany girl had ever known before.[Illustration: (brocanteur shop front)]

"You see, monsieur, one must do one's best whatever one undertakes,"
said Alice to me; "I have tried every profession, and now I am a good
femme de menage, and I am 'bien contente.'No," she continued, "I shall
never marry, for one's independence is worth more than anything else.When one marries," she said earnestly, her little brow in a frown,
"one's life is lost; I am young and strong, and I have courage, and so I
can work hard.One should be content when one is not cold and hungry,
and I have been many times that, monsieur.Once I worked in a fabrique,
where, all day, we painted the combs of china roosters a bright red for
bon-bon boxes--hundreds and hundreds of them until I used to see them in
my dreams; but the fabrique failed, for the patron ran away with the
wife of a Russian.He was a very stupid man to have done that, monsieur,
for he had a very nice wife of his own--a pretty brunette, with a
charming figure; but you see, monsieur, in Paris it is always that way.C'est toujours comme ca."CHAPTER VI

"AT MARCEL LEGAY'S"


Just off the Boulevard St.Michel and up the narrow little rue Cujas,
you will see at night the name "Marcel Legay" illumined in tiny
gas-jets.This is a cabaret of chansonniers known as "Le Grillon," where
a dozen celebrated singing satirists entertain an appreciative audience
in the stuffy little hall serving as an auditorium.Here, nightly, as
the piece de resistance--and late on the programme (there is no printed
one)--you will hear the Bard of Montmartre, Marcel Legay, raconteur,
poet, musician, and singer; the author of many of the most popular songs
of Montmartre, and a veteran singer in the cabarets.[Illustration: MARCEL LEGAY]

From these cabarets of the student quarters come many of the cleverest
and most beautiful songs.Here men sing their own creations, and they
have absolute license to sing or say what they please; there is no
mincing of words, and many times these rare bohemians do not take the
trouble to hide their clever songs and satires under a double entente.No celebrated man or woman, known in art or letters, or connected with
the Government--from the soldier to the good President of the Republique
Francaise--is spared.The eccentricity of each celebrity is caught by
them, and used in song or recitation.Besides these personal caricatures, the latest political questions of
the day--religion and the haut monde--come in for a large share of
good-natured satire.To be cleverly caricatured is an honor, and should
evince no ill-feeling, especially from these clever singing comedians,
who are the best of fellows at heart; whose songs are clever but never
vulgar; who sing because they love to sing; and whose versatility
enables them to create the broadest of satires, and, again, a little
song with words so pure, so human, and so pathetic, that the applause
that follows from the silent room of listeners comes spontaneously from
the heart.It is not to be wondered at that "The Grillon" of Marcel Legay's is a
popular haunt of the habitues of the Quarter, who crowd the dingy little
room nightly.You enter the "Grillon" by way of the bar, and at the
further end of the bar-room is a small anteroom, its walls hung in
clever posters and original drawings.This anteroom serves as a sort of
green-room for the singers and their friends; here they chat at the
little tables between their songs--since there is no stage--and through
this anteroom both audience and singers pass into the little hall.There
is the informality of one of our own "smokers" about the whole affair.Furthermore, no women sing in "Le Grillon"--a cabaret in this respect is
different from a cafe concert, which resembles very much our smaller
variety shows.A small upright piano, and in front of it a low platform,
scarcely its length, complete the necessary stage paraphernalia of the
cabaret, and the admission is generally a franc and a half, which
includes your drink.In the anteroom, four of the singers are smoking and chatting at the
little tables.One of them is a tall, serious-looking fellow, in a black
frock coat.He peers out through his black-rimmed eyeglasses with the
solemnity of an owl--but you should hear his songs!--they treat of the
lighter side of life, I assure you.Another singer has just finished his
turn, and comes out of the smoky hall, wiping the perspiration from his
short, fat neck.The audience is still applauding his last song, and he
rushes back through the faded green velvet portieres to bow his thanks.[Illustration: A POET-SINGER]

A broad-shouldered, jolly-looking fellow, in white duck trousers, is
talking earnestly with the owl-like looking bard in eyeglasses.Suddenly
his turn is called, and you follow him in, where, as soon as he is seen,
he is welcomed by cheers from the students and girls, and an elaborate
fanfare of chords on the piano.When this popular poet-singer has
finished, there follows a round of applause and a pounding of canes,
and then the ruddy-faced, gray-haired manager starts a three-times-three
handclapping in unison to a pounding of chords on the piano.This is the
proper ending to every demand for an encore in "Le Grillon," and it
never fails to bring one.It is nearly eleven when the curtain parts and Marcel Legay rushes
hurriedly up the aisle and greets the audience, slamming his straw hat
upon the lid of the piano.He passes his hand over his bald pate--gives
an extra polish to his eyeglasses--beams with an irresistibly funny
expression upon his audience--coughs--whistles--passes a few remarks,
and then, adjusting his glasses on his stubby red nose, looks
serio-comically over his roll of music.He is dressed in a long, black
frock-coat reaching nearly to his heels.This coat, with its velvet
collar, discloses a frilled white shirt and a white flowing bow scarf;
these, with a pair of black-and-white check trousers, complete this
every-day attire.But the man inside these voluminous clothes is even still more
eccentric.Short, indefinitely past fifty years of age, with a round
face and merry eyes, and a bald head whose lower portion is framed
in a fringe of long hair, reminding one of the coiffure of some
pre-Raphaelite saint--indeed, so striking is this resemblance that the
good bard is often caricatured with a halo surrounding this medieval
fringe.In the meantime, while this famous singer is selecting a song, he is
overwhelmed with demands for his most popular ones.A dozen students and
girls at one end of the little hall, now swimming in a haze of pipe and
cigarette smoke, are hammering with sticks and parasols for "Le matador
avec les pieds du vent"; another crowd is yelling for "La Goularde."Marcel Legay smiles at them all through his eyeglasses, then roars at
them to keep quiet--and finally the clamor in the room gradually
subsides--here and there a word--a giggle--and finally silence."Now, my children, I will sing to you the story of Clarette," says the
bard; "it is a very sad histoire.I have read it," and he smiles and
cocks one eye.His baritone voice still possesses considerable fire, and in his heroic
songs he is dramatic.In "The Miller who grinds for Love," the feeling
and intensity and dramatic quality he puts into its rendition are
stirring.As he finishes his last encore, amidst a round of applause, he
grasps his hat from the piano, jams it over his bald pate with its
celestial fringe, and rushes for the door.Here he stops, and, turning
for a second, cheers back at the crowd, waving the straw hat above his
head.The next moment he is having a cooling drink among his confreres
in the anteroom.Such "poet-singers" as Paul Delmet and Dominique Bonnaud have made the
"Grillon" a success; and others like Numa Bles, Gabriel Montoya,
D'Herval, Fargy, Tourtal, and Edmond Teulet--all of them well-known over
in Montmartre, where they are welcomed with the same popularity that
they meet with at "Le Grillon."Genius, alas, is but poorly paid in this Bohemia!There are so many who
can draw, so many who can sing, so many poets and writers and sculptors.To many of the cleverest, half a loaf is too often better than no
bread.You will find often in these cabarets and in the cafes and along the
boulevard, a man who, for a few sous, will render a portrait or a
caricature on the spot.You learn that this journeyman artist once was a
well-known painter of the Quarter, who had drawn for years in the
academies.The man at present is a wreck, as he sits in a cafe with
portfolio on his knees, his black slouch hat drawn over his scraggly
gray hair.But his hand, thin and drawn from too much stimulant and too
little food, has lost none of its knowledge of form and line; the sketch
is strong, true, and with a chic about it and a simplicity of expression
that delight you.[Illustration: THE SATIRIST]

"Ah!"he replies, "it is a long story, monsieur."So long and so much of
it that he can not remember it all!Perhaps it was the woman with the
velvety black eyes--tall and straight--the best dancer in all Paris.Yes, he remembers some of it--long, miserable years--years of struggles
and jealousy, and finally lies and fights and drunkenness; after it was
all over, he was too gray and old and tired to care!One sees many such derelicts in Paris among these people who have worn
themselves out with amusement, for here the world lives for pleasure,
for "la grande vie!"To the man, every serious effort he is obliged to
make trends toward one idea--that of the bon vivant--to gain success and
fame, but to gain it with the idea of how much personal daily pleasure
it will bring him.Ennui is a word one hears constantly; if it rains
toute le monde est triste.To have one's gaiety interrupted is regarded
as a calamity, and "tout le monde" will sympathize with you.To live a
day without the pleasures of life in proportion to one's purse is
considered a day lost.If you speak of anything that has pleased you one will, with a gay
rising inflection of the voice and a smile, say: "Ah!c'est gai
la-bas--and monsieur was well amused while in that beautiful
country?"they will exclaim, as you
enthusiastically continue to explain.They never dull your enthusiasm
by short phlegmatic or pessimistic replies.And when you are sad
they will condone so genuinely with you that you forget your
disappointments in the charming pleasantry of their sympathy.But all
this continual race for pleasure is destined in the course of time to
end in ennui!The Parisian goes into the latest sport because it affords him a
new sensation.Being blase of all else in life, he plunges into
automobiling, buys a white and red racer--a ponderous flying juggernaut
that growls and snorts and smells of the lower regions whenever it
stands still, trembling in its anger and impatience to be off, while its
owner, with some automobiling Marie, sits chatting on the cafe terrace
over a cooling drink.The two are covered with dust and very thirsty;
Marie wears a long dust-colored ulster, and he a wind-proof coat and
high boots.Meanwhile, the locomotive-like affair at the curbstone is
working itself into a boiling rage, until finally the brave chauffeur
and his chic companion prepare to depart.Marie adjusts her white lace
veil, with its goggles, and the chauffeur puts on his own mask as he
climbs in; a roar--a snort, a cloud of blue gas, and they are gone!There are other enthusiasts--those who go up in balloons!one cries enthusiastically, "to be 'en
ballon'--so poetic--so fin de siecle!It is a fantaisie charmante!"In a balloon one forgets the world--one is no longer a part of it--no
longer mortal.What romance there is in going up above everything with
the woman one loves--comrades in danger--the ropes--the wicker cage--the
ceiling of stars above one and Paris below no bigger than a gridiron!How chic to shoot straight
up among the drifting clouds and forget the sordid little world, even
the memory of one's intrigues!"Enfin seuls," they say to each other, as the big Frenchman and the chic
Parisienne countess peer down over the edge of the basket, sipping a
little chartreuse from the same traveling cup; she, with the black hair
and white skin, and gowned "en ballon" in a costume by Paillard; he in
his peajacket buttoned close under his heavy beard.They seem to brush
through and against the clouds!A gentle breath from heaven makes the
basket decline a little and the ropes creak against the hardwood clinch
blocks.It grows colder, and he wraps her closer in his own coat."Courage, my child," he says; "see, we have gone a great distance;
to-morrow before sundown we shall descend in Belgium."cries the Countess; "I do not like those Belgians."but you shall see, Therese, one shall go where one pleases soon; we
are patient, we aeronauts; we shall bring credit to La Belle France; we
have courage and perseverance; we shall give many dinners and weep over
the failures of our brave comrades, to make the dirigible balloon
'pratique.'our dejeuner in Paris and our
dinner where we will."Therese taps her polished nails against the edge of the wicker cage and
hums a little chansonette."Je t'aime"--she murmurs.*     *     *     *     *

I did not see this myself, and I do not know the fair Therese or the
gentleman who buttons his coat under his whiskers; but you should have
heard one of these ballooning enthusiasts tell it to me in the Taverne
du Pantheon the other night.His only regret seemed to be that he, too,
could not have a dirigible balloon and a countess--on ten francs a
week![Illustration: (woman)]

CHAPTER VII

"POCHARD"


Drunkards are not frequent sights in the Quarter; and yet when these
people do get drunk, they become as irresponsible as maniacs.Excitable
to a degree even when sober, these most wretched among the poor when
drunk often appear in front of a cafe--gaunt, wild-eyed, haggard, and
filthy--singing in boisterous tones or reciting to you with tense voices
a jumble of meaningless thoughts.The man with the matted hair, and toes out of his boots, will fold his
arms melodramatically, and regard you for some moments as you sit in
front of him on the terrace.Then he will vent upon you a torrent
of abuse, ending in some jumble of socialistic ideas of his own
concoction.When he has finished, he will fold his arms again and move
on to the next table.He is crazy with absinthe, and no one pays any
attention to him.On he strides up the "Boul' Miche," past the cafes,
continuing his ravings.As long as he is moderately peaceful and
confines his wandering brain to gesticulations and speech, he is let
alone by the police.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

You will see sometimes a man and a woman--a teamster out of work or with
his wages for the day, and with him a creature--a blear-eyed, slatternly
looking woman, in a filthy calico gown.The man clutches her arm, as
they sing and stagger up past the cafes.The woman holds in her
claw-like hand a half-empty bottle of cheap red wine.Now and then they
stop and share it; the man staggers on; the woman leers and dances and
sings; a crowd forms about them.Some years ago this poor girl sat on
Friday afternoons in the Luxembourg Gardens--her white parasol on her
knees, her dainty, white kid-slippered feet resting on the little stool
which the old lady, who rents the chairs, used to bring her.She was
regarded as a bonne camarade in those days among the students--one of
the idols of the Quarter!But she became impossible, and then an
outcast!That women should become outcasts through the hopelessness of
their position or the breaking down of their brains can be understood,
but that men of ability should sink into the dregs and stay there seems
incredible.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

Near the rue Monge there is a small cafe and restaurant, a place
celebrated for its onion soup and its chicken.From the tables outside,
one can see into the small kitchen, with its polished copper sauce-pans
hanging about the grill.Lachaume, the painter, and I were chatting at one of its little tables,
he over an absinthe and I over a coffee and cognac.I had dined early
this fresh October evening, enjoying to the full the bracing coolness of
the air, pungent with the odor of dry leaves and the faint smell of
burning brush.The world was hurrying by--in twos and threes--hurrying
to warm cafes, to friends, to lovers.The breeze at twilight set the dry
leaves shivering.The yellow glow from the
shop windows--the blue-white sparkle of electricity like pendant
diamonds--made the Quarter seem fuller of life than ever.These fall
days make the little ouvrieres trip along from their work with rosy
cheeks, and put happiness and ambition into one's very soul.[Illustration: A GROUP OF NEW STUDIOS]

Soon the winter will come, with all the boys back from their country
haunts, and Celeste and Mimi from Ostende.How gay it will be--this
Quartier Latin then!How gay it always is in winter--and then the rainy
season.Thus it was that Lachaume
and I sat talking, when suddenly a spectre passed--a spectre of a man,
his face silent, white, and pinched--drawn like a mummy's.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR'S MODEL]

He stopped and supported his shrunken frame wearily on his crutches, and
leaned against a neighboring wall.He made no sound--simply gazed
vacantly, with the timidity of some animal, at the door of the small
kitchen aglow with the light from the grill.He made no effort to
approach the door; only leaned against the gray wall and peered at it
patiently."A beggar," I said to Lachaume; "poor devil!"old Pochard--yes, poor devil, and once one of the handsomest men in
Paris.""What I'm drinking now, mon ami."He looks older than I do, does he not?"continued
Lachaume, lighting a fresh cigarette, "and yet I'm twenty years his
senior.You see, I sip mine--he drank his by the goblet," and my friend
leaned forward and poured the contents of the carafe in a tiny
trickling stream over the sugar lying in its perforated spoon.[Illustration: BOY MODEL]

"Ah!those were great days when Pochard was the life of the Bullier," he
went on; "I remember the night he won ten thousand francs from the
Russian.It didn't last long; Camille Leroux had her share of
it--nothing ever lasted long with Camille.He was once courrier to an
Austrian Baron, I remember.The old fellow used to frequent the Quarter
in summer, years ago--it was his hobby.Pochard was a great favorite in
those days, and the Baron liked to go about in the Quarter with him, and
of course Pochard was in his glory.He would persuade the old nobleman
to prolong his vacation here.Once the Baron stayed through the winter
and fell ill, and a little couturiere in the rue de Rennes, whom the old
fellow fell in love with, nursed him.He died the summer following, at
Vienna, and left her quite a little property near Amiens.He was a good
old Baron, a charitable old fellow among the needy, and a good bohemian
besides; and he did much for Pochard, but he could not keep him sober!"[Illustration: BOUGUEREAU AT WORK]

"After the old man's death," my friend continued, "Pochard drifted from
bad to worse, and finally out of the Quarter, somewhere into misery on
the other side of the Seine.No one heard of him for a few years, until
he was again recognized as being the same Pochard returned again to the
Quarter.He was hobbling about on crutches just as you see him there.And now, do you know what he does?Get up from where you are sitting,"
said Lachaume, "and look into the back kitchen.Is he not standing there
by the door--they are handing him a small bundle?""Yes," said I, "something wrapped in newspaper.""Do you know what is in it?--the carcass of the chicken you have just
finished, and which the garcon carried away.Pochard saw you eating it
half an hour ago as he passed."No, to sell," Lachaume replied, "together with the other bones he is
able to collect--for soup in some poorest resort down by the river,
where the boatmen and the gamins go.The few sous he gets will buy
Pochard a big glass, a lump of sugar, and a spoon; into the goblet, in
some equally dirty 'boite,' they will pour him out his green treasure of
absinthe.Then Pochard will forget the day--perhaps he will dream of the
Austrian Baron--and try and forget Camille Leroux.[Illustration: GEROME]

Marguerite Girardet, the model, also told me between poses in the studio
the other day of just such a "pauvre homme" she once knew."When he was
young," she said, "he won a second prize at the Conservatoire, and
afterward played first violin at the Comique.Now he plays in front of
the cafes, like the rest, and sometimes poses for the head of an old
man![Illustration: A. MICHELENA]

"Many grow old so young," she continued; "I knew a little model once
with a beautiful figure, absolutely comme un bijou--pretty, too, and
had she been a sensible girl, as I often told her, she could still have
earned her ten francs a day posing; but she wanted to dine all the time
with this and that one, and pose too, and in three months all her fine
'svelte' lines that made her a valuable model among the sculptors were
gone.You see, I have posed all my life in the studios, and I am over
thirty now, and you know I work hard, but I have kept my fine
lines--because I go to bed early and eat and drink little.Then I have
much to do at home; my husband and I for years have had a comfortable
home; we take a great deal of pride in it, and it keeps me very busy to
keep everything in order, for I pose very early some mornings and then
go back and get dejeuner, and then back to pose again.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR'S STUDIO]

"In the summer," she went on, "we take a little place outside of Paris
for a month, down the Seine, where my husband brings his work with him;
he is a repairer of fans and objets d'art.You should come in and see us
some time; it is quite near where you painted last summer.Ah yes," she
exclaimed, as she drew her pink toes under her, "I love the country!Last year I posed nearly two months for Monsieur Z., the painter--en
plein air; my skin was not as white as it is now, I can tell you--I was
absolutely like an Indian![Illustration: FREMIET]

"Once"--and Marguerite smiled at the memory of it--"I went to England to
pose for a painter well known there.It was an important tableau, and I
stayed there six months.It was a horrible place to me--I was always
cold--the fog was so thick one could hardly see in winter mornings going
to the studio.Besides, I could get nothing good to eat!He was a
celebrated painter, a 'Sir,' and lived with his family in a big stone
house with a garden.We had tea and cakes at five in the studio--always
tea, tea, tea!--I can tell you I used to long for a good bottle of
Madame Giraud's vin ordinaire, and a poulet.So I left and came back to
Paris.J'etais toujours, toujours
triste la!In Paris I make a good living; ten francs a day--that's not
bad, is it?and my time is taken often a year ahead.I like to pose for
the painters--the studios are cleaner than those of the sculptor's.Some
of the sculptors' studios are so dirty--clay and dust over everything!Did you see Fabien's studio the other day when I posed for him?Tiens!--you should have seen it last year when he was
working on the big group for the Exposition!It is clean now compared
with what it was.You see, I go to my work in the plainest of clothes--a
cheap print dress and everything of the simplest I can make, for in half
an hour, left in those studios, they would be fit only for the
blanchisseuse--the wax and dust are in and over everything!There is
no time to change when one has not the time to go home at mid-day."[Illustration: JEAN PAUL LAURENS]

And so I learned much of the good sense and many of the economies in the
life of this most celebrated model.You can see her superb figure
wrought in marble and bronze by some of the most famous of modern French
sculptors all over Paris.There is another type of model you will see, too--one who rang my bell
one sunny morning in response to a note written by my good friend, the
sculptor, for whom this little Parisienne posed.She came without her hat--this "vrai type"--about seventeen years of
age--with exquisite features, her blue eyes shining under a wealth of
delicate blonde hair arranged in the prettiest of fashions--a little
white bow tied jauntily at her throat, and her exquisitely delicate,
strong young figure clothed in a simple black dress.She had about her
such a frank, childlike air!Yes, she posed for so and so, and so and
so, but not many; she liked it better than being in a shop; and it
was far more independent, for one could go about and see one's
friends--and there were many of her girl friends living on the same
street where this chic demoiselle lived.As she sat buttoning her boots, she
looked up at me innocently, slipped her five francs for the morning's
work in her reticule, and said:

"I live with mama, and mama never gives me any money to spend on myself.This is Sunday and a holiday, so I shall go with Henriette and her
brother to Vincennes.[Illustration: OLD MAN MODEL]

It would have been quite impossible for me to have gone with them--I was
not even invited; but this very serious and good little Parisienne, who
posed for the figure with quite the same unconsciousness as she would
have handed you your change over the counter of some stuffy little shop,
went to Vincennes with Henriette and her brother, where they had a
beautiful day--scrambling up the paths and listening to the band--all at
the enormous expense of the artist; and this was how this good little
Parisienne managed to save five francs in a single day!There are old-men models who knock at your studio too, and who are
celebrated for their tangled gray locks, which they immediately
uncover as you open your door.These unkempt-looking Father Times and
Methuselahs prowl about the staircases of the different ateliers daily.So do little children--mostly Italians and all filthily dirty; swarthy,
black-eyed, gypsy-looking girls and boys of from twelve to fifteen years
of age, and Italian mothers holding small children--itinerant madonnas.These are the poorer class of models--the riff-raff of the Quarter--who
get anywhere from a few sous to a few francs for a seance.And there are four-footed models, too, for I know a kindly old horse who
has served in many a studio and who has carried a score of the famous
generals of the world and Jeanne d'Arcs to battle--in many a modern
public square.CHAPTER VIII

THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS


In this busy Quarter, where so many people are confined throughout the
day in work-shops and studios, a breathing-space becomes a necessity.The
gardens of the Luxembourg, brilliant in flowers and laid out in the
Renaissance, with shady groves and long avenues of chestnut-trees
stretching up to the Place de l'Observatoire, afford the great
breathing-ground for the Latin Quarter.If one had but an hour to spend in the Quartier Latin, one could not
find a more interesting and representative sight of student life than
between the hours of four and five on Friday afternoon, when the
military band plays in the Luxembourg Gardens.This is the afternoon
when Bohemia is on parade.Then every one flocks here to see one's
friends--and a sort of weekly reception for the Quarter is held.The
walks about the band-stand are thronged with students and girls,
and hundreds of chairs are filled with an audience of the older
people--shopkeepers and their families, old women in white lace caps,
and gray-haired old men, many in straight-brimmed high hats of a mode of
twenty years past.Here they sit and listen to the music under the cool
shadow of the trees, whose rich foliage forms an arbor overhead--a roof
of green leaves, through which the sunbeams stream and in which the fat,
gray pigeons find a paradise.[Illustration: THE CHILDREN'S SHOP--LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]

There is a booth near-by where waffles, cooked on a small oven in the
rear, are sold.In front are a dozen or more tables for ices and
drinkables.Every table and chair is taken within hearing distance of
the band.When these musicians of the army of France arrive, marching in
twos from their barracks to the stand, it is always the signal for that
genuine enthusiasm among the waiting crowd which one sees between the
French and their soldiers.If you chance to sit among the groups at the little tables, and watch
the passing throng in front of you, you will see some queer "types,"
many of them seldom en evidence except on these Friday afternoons in the
Luxembourg.Buried, no doubt, in some garret hermitage or studio, they
emerge thus weekly to greet silently the passing world.A tall poet stalks slowly by, reading intently, as he walks, a well-worn
volume of verses--his faded straw hat shading the tip of his long nose.Following him, a boy of twenty, delicately featured, with that purity of
expression one sees in the faces of the good--the result of a life,
perhaps, given to his ideal in art.He wears his hair long and curling
over his ears, with a long stray wisp over one eye, the whole cropped
evenly at the back as it reaches his black velvet collar.He wears, too,
a dove-gray vest of fine corduroy, buttoned behind like those of the
clergy, and a velvet tam-o'-shanter-like cap, and carries between his
teeth a small pipe with a long goose-quill stem.You can readily see
that to this young man with high ideals there is only one corner of the
world worth living in, and that lies between the Place de l'Observatoire
and the Seine.Three students pass, in wide broadcloth trousers, gathered in tight at
the ankles, and wearing wide-brimmed black hats.Hanging on the arm of
one of the trio is a short snub-nosed girl, whose Cleo-Merodic hair,
flattened in a bandeau over her ears, not only completely conceals them,
but all the rest of her face, except her two merry black eyes and her
saucy and neatly rouged lips.She is in black bicycle bloomers and a
white, short duck jacket--a straw hat with a wide blue ribbon band, and
a fluffy piece of white tulle tied at the side of her neck.It is impossible, in such a close
crowd, to be in a hurry; besides, one never is here.Near-by sit two old ladies, evidently concierges from some atelier
court.One holds the printed program of the music, cut carefully from
her weekly newspaper; it is cheaper than buying one for two sous, and
these old concierges are economical.In this Friday gathering you will recognize dozens of faces which you
have seen at the "Bal Bullier" and the cafes.The girl in the blue tailor-made dress, with the little dog, who you
remember dined the night before at the Pantheon, is walking now arm in
arm with a tall man in black, a mourning band about his hat.Sandra moved to the kitchen.The girl is
dressed in black, too--a mark of respect to her ami by her side.The
dog, who is so small that he slides along the walk every time his chain
is pulled, is now tucked under her arm.One of the tables near the waffle stand is taken by a group of six
students and four girls.All of them have arrived at the table in the
last fifteen minutes--some alone, some in twos.The girl in the scarlet
gown and white kid slippers, who came with the queer-looking "type"
with the pointed beard, is Yvonne Gallois--a bonne camarade.She keeps
the rest in the best of spirits, for she is witty, this Yvonne, and a
great favorite with the crowd she is with.She is pretty, too, and has a
whole-souled good-humor about her that makes her ever welcome.The
fellow she came with is Delmet the architect--a great wag--lazy, but
full of fun--and genius.The little girl sitting opposite Yvonne is Claire Dumont.She is
explaining a very sad "histoire" to the "type" next to her, intense in
the recital of her woes.Her alert, nervous little face is a study; when
words and expression fail, she shrugs her delicate shoulders, accenting
every sentence with her hands, until it seems as if her small, nervous
frame could express no more--and all about her little dog "Loisette!"[Illustration: AT THE HEAD OF THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]

"Yes, the villain of a concierge at Edmond's studio swore at him twice,
and Sunday, when Edmond and I were breakfasting late, the old beast saw
'Loisette' on the stairs and threw water over her; she is a sale bete,
that grosse femme!She shall see what it will cost her, the old miser;
and you know I have always been most amiable with her.She is jealous
of me--that is it--oh!Poor
'Loisette'--she shivered all night with fright and from being wet.Edmond and I are going to find another place.Yes, she shall see what it
will be there without us--with no one to depend upon for her snuff and
her wine.If she were concierge at Edmond's old atelier she would be
treated like that horrid old Madame Fouquet."The boys in the atelier over her window hated this old Madame Fouquet, I
remember.She was always prying about and complaining, so they fished up
her pet gold-fish out of the aquarium on her window-sill, and fried them
on the atelier stove, and put them back in the window on a little plate
all garnished with carrots.She swore vengeance and called in the
police, but to no avail.One day they fished up the parrot in its cage,
and the green bird that screamed and squawked continually met a speedy
and painless death and went off to the taxidermist.Then the cage was
lowered in its place with the door left ajar, and the old woman felt
sure that her pet had escaped and would some day find his way back to
her--a thing this garrulous bird would never have thought of doing had
he had any say in the matter.So the old lady left the door of the cage open for days in the event of
his return, and strange to tell, one morning Madame Fouquet got up to
quarrel with her next-door neighbor, and, to her amazement, there was
her green pet on his perch in his cage.She called to him, but he did
not answer; he simply stood on his wired legs and fixed his glassy eyes
on her, and said not a word--while the gang of Indians in the windows
above yelled themselves hoarse.It was just such a crowd as this that initiated a "nouveau" once in one
of the ateliers.They stripped the new-comer, and, as is often the
custom on similar festive occasions, painted him all over with
sketches, done in the powdered water-colors that come in glass jars.They are cheap and cover a lot of surface, so that the gentleman in
question looked like a human picture-gallery.After the ceremony, he was
put in a hamper and deposited, in the morning, in the middle of the Pont
des Arts, where he was subsequently found by the police, who carted him
off in a cab.[Illustration: THE FONTAINE DE MEDICIS]

But you must see more of this vast garden of the Luxembourg to
appreciate truly its beauty and its charm.Filled with beautiful
sculpture in bronze and marble, with its musee of famous modern pictures
bought by the Government, with flower-beds brilliant in geraniums and
fragrant in roses, with the big basin spouting a jet of water in its
center, where the children sail their boats, and with that superb
"Fontaine de Medicis" at the end of a long, rectangular basin of
water--dark as some pool in a forest brook, the green vines trailing
about its sides, shaded by the rich foliage of the trees overhead.On the other side of the Luxembourg you will find a garden of roses,
with a rich bronze group of Greek runners in the center, and near it,
back of the long marble balustrade, a croquet ground--a favorite spot
for several veteran enthusiasts who play here regularly, surrounded for
hours by an interested crowd who applaud and cheer the participants in
this passe sport.This is another way of spending an afternoon at the sole cost of one's
leisure.Often at the Punch and Judy show near-by, you will see two old
gentlemen,--who may have watched this same Punch and Judy show when they
were youngsters,--and who have been sitting for half an hour, waiting
for the curtain of the miniature theater to rise.It is popular--this
small "Theatre Guignol," and the benches in front are filled with the
children of rich and poor, who scream with delight and kick their
little, fat bare legs at the first shrill squeak of Mr.The three
who compose the staff of this tiny attraction have been long in its
service--the old harpist, and the good wife of the showman who knows
every child in the neighborhood, and her husband who is Mr.Punch, the
hangman, and the gendarme, and half a dozen other equally historical
personages.A thin, sad-looking man, this husband, gray-haired, with a
careworn look in his deep-sunken eyes, who works harder hourly, daily,
yearly, to amuse the heart of a child than almost any one I know.The little box of a theater is stifling hot in summer, and yet he must
laugh and scream and sing within it, while his good wife collects the
sous, talking all the while to this and to that child whom she has known
since its babyhood; chatting with the nurses decked out in their
gay-colored, Alsatian bows, the ribbons reaching nearly to the ground.A French nurse is a gorgeous spectacle of neatness and cleanliness, and
many of the younger ones, fresh from country homes in Normandy and
Brittany, with their rosy cheeks, are pictures of health.Wherever you
see a nurse, you will see a "piou-piou" not far away, which is a very
belittling word for the red-trousered infantryman of the Republique
Francaise.Surrounding the Palais du Luxembourg, these "piou-pious," less fortunate
for the hour, stand guard in the small striped sentry-boxes, musket at
side, or pace stolidly up and down the flagged walk.Marie, at the
moment, is no doubt with the children of the rich Count, in a shady spot
near the music.How cruel is the fate of many a gallant "piou-piou"!Farther down the gravel-walk strolls a young Frenchman and his
fiancee--the mother of his betrothed inevitably at her side!It is under
this system of rigid chaperonage that the young girl of France is given
in marriage.It is not to be wondered at that many of them marry to be
free, and that many of the happier marriages have begun with an
elopement![Illustration: THE PALACE OF THE LUXEMBOURG]

The music is over, and the band is filing out, followed by the crowd.A
few linger about the walks around the band-stand to chat.The old lady
who rents the chairs is stacking them up about the tree-trunks, and long
shadows across the walks tell of the approaching twilight.Overhead,
among the leaves, the pigeons coo.For a few moments the sun bathes
the great garden in a pinkish glow, then drops slowly, a blood-red disk,
behind the trees.The air grows chilly; it is again the hour to
dine--the hour when Paris wakes.In the smaller restaurants of the Quarter one often sees some strange
contrasts among these true bohemians, for the Latin Quarter draws its
habitues from every part of the globe.They are not all French--these
happy-go-lucky fellows, who live for the day and let the morrow slide.You will see many Japanese--some of them painters--many of them taking
courses in political economy, or in law; many of them titled men of high
rank in their own country, studying in the schools, and learning, too,
with that thoroughness and rapidity which are ever characteristic of
their race.You will find, too, Brazilians; gentlemen from Haiti of
darker hue; Russians, Poles, and Spaniards--men and women from every
clime and every station in life.They adapt themselves to the Quarter
and become a part of this big family of Bohemia easily and naturally.In this daily atmosphere only the girl-student from our own shores seems
out of place.She will hunt for some small restaurant, sacred in its
exclusiveness and known only to a dozen bon camarades of the Quarter.Perhaps this girl-student, it may be, from the West and her cousin from
the East will discover some such cosy little boite on their way back
from their atelier.To two other equally adventurous female minds they
will impart this newest find; after that you will see the four dining
there nightly together, as safe, I assure you, within these walls of
Bohemia as they would be at home rocking on their Aunt Mary's porch.There is, of course, considerable awkwardness between these bon
camarades, to whom the place really belongs, and these very innocent
new-comers, who seek a table by themselves in a corner under the few
trees in front of the small restaurant.And yet every one is exceedingly
polite to them.Madame the patronne hustles about to see that the dinner
is warm and nicely served; and Henriette, who is waiting on them, none
the less attentive, although she is late for her own dinner, which she
will sit down to presently with madame the patronne, the good cook, and
the other girls who serve the small tables.[Illustration: WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE THEATERS]

This later feast will be augmented perhaps by half the good boys and
girls who have been dining at the long table.Perhaps they will all come
in and help shell the peas for to-morrow's dinner.And yet this is a
public place, where the painters come, and where one pays only for what
one orders.It is all very interesting to the four American girls, who
are dining at the small table.But what must Mimi think of these silent and exclusive strangers, and
what, too, must the tall girl in the bicycle bloomers think, and the
little girl who has been ill and who at the moment is dining with
Renould, the artist, and whom every one--even to the cook, is so glad to
welcome back after her long illness?There is an unsurmountable barrier
between the Americans at the little table in the corner and that jolly
crowd of good and kindly people at the long one, for Mimi and Henriette
and the little girl who has been so ill, and the French painters and
sculptors with them, cannot understand either the language of these
strangers or their views of life.exclaims one of the strangers in a whisper, "do look at that
queer little 'type' at the long table--the tall girl in black actually
kissed him!"Why, my dear, I saw it plainly!"There is no law against kissing in the open air in Paris,
and besides, the tall girl in black has known the little "type" for a
Parisienne age--thirty days or less.The four innocents, who have coughed through their soup and whispered
through the rest of the dinner, have now finished and are leaving, but
if those at the long table notice their departure, they do not show it.In the Quarter it is considered the height of rudeness to stare.You
will find these Suzannes and Marcelles exceedingly well-bred in the
little refinements of life, and you will note a certain innate dignity
and kindliness in their bearing toward others, which often makes one
wish to uncover his head in their presence.CHAPTER IX

"THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE QUARTER"


There are many streets of the Quarter as quiet as those of a country
village.Some of them, like the rue Vaugirard, lead out past gloomy
slaughter-houses and stables, through desolate sections of vacant
lots, littered with the ruins of factory and foundry whose tall,
smoke-begrimed chimneys in the dark stand like giant sentries, as if
pointing a warning finger to the approaching pedestrian, for these
ragged edges of the Quarter often afford at night a lurking-ground for
footpads.In just such desolation there lived a dozen students, in a small nest of
studios that I need not say were rented to them at a price within their
ever-scanty means.It was marveled at among the boys in the Quarter that
any of these exiles lived to see the light of another day, after
wandering back at all hours of the night to their stronghold.Possibly their sole possessions consisted of the clothes they had on, a
few bad pictures, and their several immortal geniuses.That the
gentlemen with the sand-bags knew of this I am convinced, for the
students were never molested.Verily, Providence lends a strong and
ready arm to the drunken man and the fool!The farther out one goes on the rue Vaugirard, the more desolate
and forbidding becomes this long highway, until it terminates at
the fortifications, near which is a huge, open field, kept clear
of such permanent buildings as might shelter an enemy in time of
war.Scattered over this space are the hovels of squatters and
gipsies--fortune-telling, horse-trading vagabonds, whose living-vans
at certain times of the year form part of the smaller fairs within
the Quarter.[Illustration: (factory chimneys along empty street)]

And very small and unattractive little fairs they are, consisting of
half a dozen or more wagons, serving as a yearly abode for these
shiftless people; illumined at night by the glare of smoking oil
torches.There is, moreover, a dingy tent with a half-drawn red curtain
that hides the fortune-telling beauty; and a traveling shooting-gallery,
so short that the muzzle of one's rifle nearly rests upon the painted
lady with the sheet-iron breastbone, centered by a pinhead of a
bull's-eye which never rings.There is often a small carousel, too,
which is not only patronized by the children, but often by a crowd of
students--boys and girls, who literally turn the merry-go-round into a
circus, and who for the time are cheered to feats of bareback riding by
the enthusiastic bystanders.These little Quarter fetes are far different from the great fete de
Neuilly across the Seine, which begins at the Porte Maillot, and
continues in a long, glittering avenue of side-shows, with mammoth
carousels, bizarre in looking-glass panels and golden figures.Within
the circle of all this throne-like gorgeousness, a horse-power organ
shakes the very ground with its clarion blasts, while pink and white
wooden pigs, their tails tied up in bows of colored ribbons, heave and
swoop round and round, their backs loaded with screaming girls and
shouting men.It was near this very same Port Maillot, in a colossal theater, built
originally for the representation of one of the Kiralfy ballets, that a
fellow student and myself went over from the Quarter one night to "supe"
in a spectacular and melodramatic pantomime, entitled "Afrique a Paris."We were invited by the sole proprietor and manager of the show--an
old circus-man, and one of the shrewdest, most companionable, and
intelligent of men, who had traveled the world over.He spoke no
language but his own unadulterated American.This, with his dominant
personality, served him wherever fortune carried him!So, accepting his invitation to play alternately the dying soldier and
the pursuing cannibal under the scorching rays of a tropical limelight,
and with an old pair of trousers and a flannel shirt wrapped in a
newspaper, we presented ourselves at the appointed hour, at the edge of
the hostile country.[Illustration: (street scene)]

Here we found ourselves surrounded by a horde of savages who needed no
greasepaint to stain their ebony bodies, and many of whose grinning
countenances I had often recognized along our own Tenderloin.Besides,
there were cowboys and "greasers" and diving elks, and a company of
French Zouaves; the latter, in fact, seemed to be the only thing foreign
about the show.Our friend, the manager, informed us that he had thrown
the entire spectacle together in about ten days, and that he had
gathered with ease, in two, a hundred of those dusky warriors, who had
left their coat-room and barber-shop jobs in New York to find themselves
stranded in Paris.He was a hustler, this circus-man, and preceding the spectacle of the
African war, he had entertained the audience with a short variety-show,
to brace the spectacle.He insisted on bringing us around in front and
giving us a box, so we could see for ourselves how good it really was.During this forepart, and after some clever high trapeze work,
the sensation of the evening was announced--a Signore, with an
unpronounceable name, would train a den of ten forest-bred lions!When the orchestra had finished playing "The Awakening of the Lion," the
curtain rose, disclosing the nerveless Signore in purple tights and
high-topped boots.A long, portable cage had been put together on the
stage during the intermission, and within it the ten pacing beasts.There is something terrifying about the roar of a lion as it begins with
its high-keyed moan, and descends in scale to a hoarse roar that seems
to penetrate one's whole nervous system.But the Signore did not seem to mind it; he placed one foot on the sill
of the safety-door, tucked his short riding-whip under his arm, pulled
the latch with one hand, forced one knee in the slightly opened door,
and sprang into the cage.went the iron door as it found its
lock.went the Signore's revolver, as he drove the snarling,
roaring lot into the corner of the cage.The smoke from his revolver
drifted out through the bars; the house was silent.The trainer walked
slowly up to the fiercest lion, who reared against the bars as he
approached him, striking at the trainer with his heavy paws, while the
others slunk into the opposite corner.The man's head was but half a
foot now from the lion's; he menaced the beast with the little
riding-whip; he almost, but did not quite strike him on the tip of his
black nose that worked convulsively in rage.Then the lion dropped
awkwardly, with a short growl, to his forelegs, and slunk, with the
rest, into the corner.It was the little
riding-whip they feared, for they had never gauged its sting.Not the
heavy iron bar within reach of his hand, whose force they knew."An ugly lot," I said, turning to our friend the manager, who had taken
his seat beside me."Yes," he mused, peering at the stage with his keen gray eyes; "green
stock, but a swell act, eh?I've got a
girl here who comes on and does art poses among the lions; she's a
dream--French, too!"A girl of perhaps twenty, enveloped in a bath gown, now appeared at the
wings.The next instant the huge theater became dark, and she stood in
full fleshings, in the center of the cage, brilliant in the rays of a
powerful limelight, while the lions circled about her at the command of
the trainer."Yes," said I, "she is.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

"No, she never worked with the cats before," he said; "she's new to the
show business; she said her folks live in Nantes.She worked here in a
chocolate factory until she saw my 'ad' last week and joined my show.We
gave her a rehearsal Monday and we put her on the bill next night.She's
a good looker with plenty of grit, and is a winner with the bunch in
front.""How did you get her to take the job?""Well," he replied, "she balked at the act at first, but I showed her
two violet notes from a couple of swell fairies who wanted the job, and
after that she signed for six weeks."he exclaimed dryly, and he bit the corner of his stubby
mustache and smiled."This is the last act in the olio, so you will have
to excuse me.*     *     *     *     *

There are streets and boulevards in the Quarter, sections of which are
alive with the passing throng and the traffic of carts and omnibuses.Then one will come to a long stretch of massive buildings, public
institutions, silent as convents--their interminable walls flanking
garden or court.Germain is just such a highway until it crosses the
Boulevard St.Michel--the liveliest roadway of the Quarter.Then it
seems to become suddenly inoculated with its bustle and life, and from
there on is crowded with bourgeoise and animated with the commerce of
market and shop.An Englishman once was so fired with a desire to see the gay life of the
Latin Quarter that he rented a suite of rooms on this same Boulevard St.Germain at about the middle of this long, quiet stretch.Here he stayed
a fortnight, expecting daily to see from his "chambers" the gaiety of a
Bohemia of which he had so often heard.At the end of his disappointing
sojourn, he returned to London, firmly convinced that the gay life of
the Latin Quarter was a myth.[Illustration: (crowded street market)]

But the man from Denver, the "Steel King," and the two thinner
gentlemen with the louis-lined waistcoats who accompanied him and whom
Fortune had awakened in the far West one morning and had led them to
"The Great Red Star copper mine"--a find which had ever since been a
source of endless amusement to them--discovered the Quarter before they
had been in Paris a day, and found it, too, "the best ever," as they
expressed it.They did not remain long in Paris, this rare crowd of seasoned genials,
for it was their first trip abroad and they had to see Switzerland and
Vienna, and the Rhine; but while they stayed they had a good time Every
Minute.The man from Denver and the Steel King sat at one of the small tables,
leaning over the railing at the "Bal Bullier," gazing at the sea of
dancers."Billy," said the man from Denver to the Steel King, "if they had this
in Chicago they'd tear out the posts inside of fifteen minutes"--he
wiped the perspiration from his broad forehead and pushed his
twenty-dollar Panama on the back of his head.he mused, clinching the butt of his perfecto between
his teeth.it beats all I ever see," and he chuckled to
himself, his round, genial face, with its double chin, wreathed in
smiles.he called to one of the 'copper twins,' "did you get on
to that little one in black that just went by--well!Already the pile of saucers on their table reached a foot high--a record
of refreshments for every Yvonne and Marcelle that had stopped in
passing."Certainly, sit right down," cried the Steel King."Here, Jack,"--this
to the aged garcon, "smoke up!and ask the ladies what they'll
have"--all of which was unintelligible to the two little Parisiennes and
the garcon, but quite clear in meaning to all three.interrupted the taller of the two girls, "un cafe
glace pour moi.""Et moi," answered her companion gayly, "Je prends une limonade!"thundered good-humoredly the man from Denver; "git 'em
a good drink.yes, that's it--whiskey--I see you're on,
and two.he explains, holding up two fat fingers, "all straight,
friend--two whiskeys with seltzer on the side--see?Now go roll your
hoop and git back with 'em.""Oh, non, monsieur!"cried the two Parisiennes in one breath; "whiskey!ca pique et c'est trop fort."At this juncture the flower woman arrived with a basketful of red roses."Voulez-vous des fleurs, messieurs et mesdames?""Certainly," cried the Steel King; "here, Maud and Mamie, take the lot,"
and he handed the two girls the entire contents of the basket.The
taller buried her face for a moment in the red Jaqueminots and drank in
their fragrance.When she looked up, two big tears trickled down to the
corners of her pretty mouth.The
smaller girl gave a little cry of delight and shook her roses above her
head as three other girls passed.Ten minutes later the two possessed
but a single rose apiece--they had generously given all the rest away.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

The "copper twins" had been oblivious of all this.They had been hanging
over the low balustrade, engaged in a heart-to-heart talk with two
pretty Quartier brunettes.It seemed to be really a case of love at
first sight, carried on somewhat under difficulties, for the "copper
twins" could not speak a word of French, and the English of the two chic
brunettes was limited to "Oh, yes!""Good morning," "Good
evening," and "I love you."The four held hands over the low railing,
until the "copper twins" fairly steamed in talk; warmed by the sun of
gaiety and wet by several rounds of Highland dew, they grew sad and
earnest, and got up and stepped all over the Steel King and the man from
Denver, and the two Parisiennes' daintily slippered feet, in squeezing
out past the group of round tables back of the balustrade, and down on
to the polished floor--where they are speedily lost to view in the maze
of dancers, gliding into the whirl with the two brunettes.When the
waltz is over they stroll out with them into the garden, and order wine,
and talk of changing their steamer date.The good American, with his spotless collar and his well-cut clothes,
with his frankness and whole-souled generosity, is a study to the modern
grisette.He seems strangely attractive to her, in contrast with a
certain type of Frenchman, that is selfish, unfaithful, and mean--that
jealousy makes uncompanionable and sometimes cruel.She will tell you
that these pale, black-eyed, and black-bearded boulevardiers are all
alike--lazy and selfish; so unlike many of the sterling, good fellows of
the Quarter--Frenchmen of a different stamp, and there are many of
these--rare, good Bohemians, with hearts and natures as big as all
out-doors--"bons garcons," which is only another way of saying
"gentlemen."As you tramp along back to your quarters some rainy night you find many
of the streets leading from the boulevards silent and badly lighted,
except for some flickering lantern on the corner of a long block which
sends the shadows scurrying across your path.You pass a student perhaps
and a girl, hurrying home--a fiacre for a short distance is a luxury in
the Quarter.Now you hear the click-clock of an approaching cab, the
cocher half asleep on his box.The hood of the fiacre is up, sheltering
the two inside from the rain.As the voiture rumbles by near a
street-light, you catch a glimpse of a pink silk petticoat within and a
pair of dainty, white kid shoes--and the glint of an officer's sword.Farther on, you pass a silent gendarme muffled in his night cloak; a few
doors farther on in a small cafe, a bourgeois couple, who have arrived
on a late train no doubt to spend a month with relatives in Paris, are
having a warming tipple before proceeding farther in the drizzling rain.They have, of course, invited the cocher to drink with them.They have
brought all their pets and nearly all their household goods--two dogs,
three bird-cages, their tiny occupants protected from the damp air by
several folds of newspaper; a cat in a stout paper box with air holes,
and two trunks, well tied with rope.[Illustration: (street market)]

"Ah, yes, it has been a long journey!"Her husband
corroborates her, as they explain to the patronne of the cafe and to the
cocher that they left their village at midday.Anything over two hours
on the chemin-de-fer is considered a journey by these good French
people!As you continue on to your studio, you catch a glimpse of the lights of
the Boulevard Montparnasse.Next a cab with a green light rattles by;
then a ponderous two-wheeled cart lumbers along, piled high with red
carrots as neatly arranged as cigars in a box--the driver asleep on his
seat near his swinging lantern--and the big Normandy horses taking the
way.It is late, for these carts are on their route to the early morning
market--one of the great Halles.The tired waiters are putting up the
shutters of the smaller cafes and stacking up the chairs.Now a cock
crows lustily in some neighboring yard; the majority at least of the
Latin Quarter has turned in for the night.A moment later you reach your
gate, feel instinctively for your matches.In the darkness of the court
a friendly cat rubs her head contentedly against your leg.It is the
yellow one that sleeps in the furniture factory, and you pick her up and
carry her to your studio, where, a moment later, she is crunching
gratefully the remnant of the beau maquereau left from your
dejeuner--for charity begins at home.CHAPTER X

EXILED


Scores of men, celebrated in art and in literature, have, for a longer
or shorter period of their lives, been bohemians of the Latin Quarter.And yet these years spent in cafes and in studios have not turned them
out into the world a devil-me-care lot of dreamers.They have all
marched and sung along the "Boul' Miche"; danced at the "Bullier";
starved, struggled, and lived in the romance of its life.It has all
been a part of their education, and a very important part too, in the
development of their several geniuses, a development which in later life
has placed them at the head of their professions.These years of
camaraderie--of a life free from all conventionalities, in daily touch
with everything about them, and untrammeled by public censure or the
petty views of prudish or narrow minds, have left them free to cut a
straight swath merrily toward the goal of their ideals, surrounded all
the while by an atmosphere of art and good-fellowship that permeates the
very air they breathe.If a man can work at all, he can work here, for between the
working-hours he finds a life so charming, that once having lived
it he returns to it again and again, as to an old love.How many are the romances of this student Quarter!How many hearts have
been broken or made glad!How many brave spirits have suffered and
worked on and suffered again, and at last won fame!We who come with a fresh eye know nothing of all that has passed
within these quaint streets--only those who have lived in and through it
know its full story.[Illustration: THE MUSEE CLUNY]

Pochard has seen it; so has the little old woman who once danced at the
opera; so have old Bibi La Puree, and Alphonse, the gray-haired garcon,
and Mere Gaillard, the flower-woman.They have seen the gay boulevards
and the cafes and generations of grisettes, from the true grisette of
years gone by, in her dainty white cap and simple dress turned low at
the throat, to the tailor-made grisette of to-day.Yet the eyes of the little old woman still dance; they have not grown
tired of this ever-changing kaleidoscope of human nature, this paradise
of the free, where many would rather struggle on half starved than live
a life of luxury elsewhere.I knew one once who lived in an
air-castle of his own building--a tall, serious fellow, a sculptor, who
always went tramping about in a robe resembling a monk's cowl, with his
bare feet incased in coarse sandals; only his art redeemed these
eccentricities, for he produced in steel and ivory the most exquisite
statuettes.One at the Salon was the sensation of the day--a knight in
full armor, scarcely half a foot in height, holding in his arms a nymph
in flesh-tinted ivory, whose gentle face, upturned, gazed sweetly into
the stern features behind the uplifted vizor; and all so exquisitely
carved, so alive, so human, that one could almost feel the tender heart
of this fair lady beating against the cold steel breastplate.Another "bon garcon"--a painter whose enthusiasm for his art knew no
bounds--craved to produce a masterpiece.This dreamer could be seen
daily ferreting around the Quarter for a studio always bigger than the
one he had.At last he found one that exactly fitted the requirements of
his vivid imagination--a studio with a ceiling thirty feet high, with
windows like the scenic ones next to the stage entrances of the
theaters.Here at last he could give full play to his brush--no subject
seemed too big for him to tackle; he would move in a canvas as big as a
back flat to a third act, and commence on a "Fall of Babylon" or a
"Carnage of Rome" with a nerve that was sublime!The choking dust of the
arena--the insatiable fury of the tigers--the cowering of hundreds of
unfortunate captives--and the cruel multitude above, seated in the vast
circle of the hippodrome--all these did not daunt his zeal.Once he persuaded a venerable old abbe to pose for his portrait.The
old gentleman came patiently to his studio and posed for ten days, at
the end of which time the abbe gazed at the result and said things which
I dare not repeat--for our enthusiast had so far only painted his
clothes; the face was still in its primary drawing."The face I shall do in time," the enthusiast assured the reverend man
excitedly; "it is the effect of the rich color of your robe I wished to
get.And may I ask your holiness to be patient a day longer while I put
in your boots?""Does monsieur think I am not a
very busy man?"Then softening a little, he said, with a smile:

"I won't come any more, my friend.I'll send my boots around to-morrow
by my boy."But the longest red-letter day has its ending, and time and tide beckon
one with the brutality of an impatient jailer.On my studio table is a well-stuffed envelope containing the documents
relative to my impending exile--a stamped card of my identification,
bearing the number of my cell, a plan of the slave-ship, and six red
tags for my baggage.The three pretty daughters of old Pere Valois know of my approaching
departure, and say cheering things to me as I pass the concierge's
window.Pere Valois stands at the gate and stops me with: "Is it true, monsieur,
you are going Saturday?""Yes," I answer; "unfortunately, it is quite true."The old man sighs and replies: "I once had to leave Paris myself";
looking at me as if he were speaking to an old resident."My regiment
was ordered to the colonies.It was hard, monsieur, but I did my duty."The patron of the tobacco-shop,
and madame his good wife, and the wine merchant, and the baker along the
little street with its cobblestone-bed, have all wished me "bon voyage,"
accompanied with many handshakings.It is getting late and Pere Valois
has gone to hunt for a cab--a "galerie," as it is called, with a place
for trunks on top.Twenty minutes go by, but no "galerie" is in sight.The three daughters of Pere Valois run in different directions to find
one, while I throw the remaining odds and ends in the studio into my
valise.At last there is a sound of grating wheels below on the gravel
court.The "galerie" has arrived--with the smallest of the three
daughters inside, all out of breath from her run and terribly excited.There are the trunks and the valises and the bicycle in its crate to get
down.Two soldiers, who have been calling on two of the daughters, come
up to the studio and kindly offer their assistance.There is no time to
lose, and in single file the procession starts down the atelier stairs,
headed by Pere Valois, who has just returned from his fruitless search
considerably winded, and the three girls, the two red-trousered soldiers
and myself tugging away at the rest of the baggage.It is not often one departs with the assistance of three pretty femmes
de menage, a jolly old concierge, and a portion of the army of the
French Republic.With many suggestions from my good friends and an
assuring wave of the hand from the aged cocher, my luggage is roped and
chained to the top of the rickety, little old cab, which sways and
squeaks with the sudden weight, while the poor, small horse, upon whom
has been devolved the task of making the 11.35 train, Gare St.Lazare,
changes his position wearily from one leg to the other.He is evidently
thinking out the distance, and has decided upon his gait.cry the three girls and Pere Valois and the two soldiers,
as the last trunk is chained on.The dingy vehicle groans its way slowly out of the court.Just as it
reaches the last gate it stops.I ask, poking my head out of the window."Monsieur," says the aged cocher, "it is an impossibility!I regret very
much to say that your bicycle will not pass through the gate."A dozen heads in the windows above offer suggestions.I climb out and
take a look; there are at least four inches to spare on either side in
passing through the iron posts.cries my cocher enthusiastically, "monsieur is right, happily for
us!"He cracks his whip, the little horse gathers itself together--a moment
of careful driving and we are through and into the street and rumbling
away, amid cheers from the windows above.As I glance over my traps, I
see a small bunch of roses tucked in the corner of my roll of rugs with
an engraved card attached."From Mademoiselle Ernestine Valois," it
reads, and on the other side is written, in a small, fine hand, "Bon
voyage."I look back to bow my acknowledgment, but it is too late; we have turned
the corner and the rue Vaugirard is but a memory!*     *     *     *     *

But why go on telling you of what the little shops contain--how narrow
and picturesque are the small streets--how gay the boulevards--what they
do at the "Bullier"--or where they dine?It is Love that moves Paris--it
is the motive power of this big, beautiful, polished city--the love of
adventure, the love of intrigue, the love of being a bohemian if you
will--but it is Love all the same!"I work for love," hums the little couturiere."I work for love," cries the miller of Marcel Legay."I live for love," sings the poet."For the love of art I am a painter," sighs Edmond, in his atelier--"and
for her!""For the love of it I mold and model and create," chants the
sculptor--"and for her!"It is the Woman who dominates Paris--"Les petites femmes!"who have
inspired its art through the skill of these artisans.cries a poor old
woman outside of your train compartment, as you are leaving Havre for
Paris.screams a girl, running near the open window with a little
fishergirl doll uplifted.I see," cries the
pretty vendor; "but it is a boy doll--he will be sad if he goes to
Paris without a companion!"Take all the little fishergirls away from Paris--from the Quartier
Latin--and you would find chaos and a morgue!that is it--L'amour!--L'amour!--L'amour![Illustration: (burning candle)]

                      THE JOHANNESBURG GOLD FIELDS


South Africa has many stories concerning the early history of the
Witwatersrandt gold district, so that it is well-nigh impossible to
discriminate between the fiction and the truth.One of the most probable
stories has it that the former owner of the Randt region died recently
in an almshouse in Surrey, England.He had a marvellous war record,
having fought with the British army in the Crimea, at Sebastopol, in the
Indian Mutiny, Zululand, and at Majuba Hill.With his savings of four
thousand dollars he is said to have purchased fifteen thousand acres of
land in the southern part of the Transvaal.He was obliged to forfeit
his property to the Boer Government in 1882, because he had taken up
arms against the Boers when they were fighting for their independence.The actual discovery of gold in the Transvaal territory is credited to a
German named Mauch, who travelled through that part of the country early
in the century.He returned to Berlin with wonderful reports of the
gold he had found, and attempted to enlist capital to work the mines.Whether his reports were not credited, or whether the Germans feared the
natives, is not recorded, but Mauch is not heard of again in connection
with the later history of the country.In 1854 a Dutchman named Jan
Marais, who had a short time before returned from the Australian gold
fields, prospected in the Transvaal, and found many evidences of gold.The Boers, fearing that their land would be overrun with gold-seekers,
paid five hundred pounds to Marais, and sent him home after extracting a
promise that he would not reveal his secret to any one.It was not until 1884 that England heard of the presence of gold in
South Africa.A man named Fred Stuben, who had spent several years in
the country, spread such marvellous reports of the underground wealth of
the Transvaal that only a short time elapsed before hundreds of
prospectors and miners left England for South Africa.When the first
prospectors discovered auriferous veins of wonderful quality on a farm
called Sterkfontein, the gold boom had its birth.It required the lapse
of only a short time for the news to reach Europe, America, and
Australia, and immediately thereafter that vast and widely scattered
army of men and women which constantly awaits the announcement of new
discoveries of gold was set in motion toward the Randt.The Indian, Russian, American, and Australian gold fields were deserted,
and the steamships and sailing vessels to South Africa were overladen
with men and women of all degrees and nationalities.The journey to the
Randt was expensive, dangerous, and comfortless, but before a year had
passed almost twenty thousand persons had crossed the deserts and the
plains and had settled on claims purchased from the Boers.In December,
1885, the first stamp mill was erected for the purpose of crushing the
gneiss rock in which the gold lay hidden.This enterprise marks the real
beginning of the gold fields of the Randt, which now yield one third of
the world's total product of the precious metal.The advent of
thousands of foreigners was a boon to the Boers, who owned the large
farms on which the auriferous veins were located.Options on farms that
were of little value a short time before were sold at incredible
figures, and the prices paid for small claims would have purchased farms
of thousands of acres two years before.In July, 1886, the Government opened nine farms to the miners, and all
have since become the best properties on the Randt.The names by which
the farms were known were retained by the mines which were located upon
them afterward, and, as they give an idea of the nomenclature of the
country, are worth repetition: Langlaagte, Dreifontein, Rantjeslaagte,
Doornfontein, Vogelstruitsfontein, Paardeplaats, Turffontein,
Elandsfontein, and Roodepoort.The railroad from Cape Town extended only as far north as the diamond
mines at Kimberley, and the remainder of the distance, about five
hundred miles, had to be traversed with ox-teams or on foot; but the
gold-seekers yielded to no impediments, and marched in bodies of
hundreds to the new fields.The machinery necessary to operate the
mines and extract the gold from the rocks, as well as every ounce of
food and every inch of lumber, was dragged overland by ox-teams, and the
vast plains that had seen naught but the herds of Boer farmers and the
wandering tribes of natives were quickly transformed into scenes of
unparalleled activity.On the Randt the California scenes of '49 were being re-enacted.Tents
and houses of sheet iron were erected with picturesque lack of beauty
and uniformity, and during the latter part of 1886 the community had
reached such proportions that the Government marked off a township and
called it Johannesburg.The Government, which owned the greater part of
the land, held three sales of building lots, or "stands," as they are
called in the Transvaal, and realized more than three hundred thousand
dollars from the sales.The prices of stands measuring fifty by one
hundred feet ranged from one dollar to one thousand dollars.Millions
were secured in England and Europe for the development of the mines, and
the individual miner sold his claims to companies with unlimited
capital.The incredibly large dividends that were realized by some of
the investors led to too heavy investments in the Stock Exchange in
1889, and a panic resulted.Investors lost thousands of pounds, and for
several months the future of the gold fields appeared to be most gloomy.The opening of the railway to Johannesburg and the re-establishment of
stock values caused a renewal of confidence, and the growth and
development of the Randt was imbued with renewed vigour.Owing to the Boers' lack of training and consequent inability to share
in the development of the gold fields, the new industry remained almost
entirely in the hands of the newcomers, the Uitlanders, and two totally
different communities were created in the republic.The Uitlanders, who,
in 1890, numbered about one hundred thousand, lived almost exclusively
in Johannesburg and the suburbs along the Randt.The Boers, having
disposed of their farms and lands on the Randt, were obliged to occupy
the other parts of the republic, where they could follow their pastoral
and agricultural pursuits.The natural contempt which the Englishmen, who composed the majority of
the Uitlander population, always have for persons and races not their
intellectual or social equals, soon created a gulf between the Boers and
the newcomers.This line of cleavage was extended when the newcomers
attempted to obtain a foothold in the politics of the country.The
Boers, who had been suddenly outnumbered three to one, naturally
resented the interference, especially as it came from persons who had no
desire to become permanent residents of the country, and who wanted a
voice in the conduct of the national affairs only as a means to attain
their own ends, without caring about the welfare of the entire republic.The Uitlanders had many good and honest men among them, but the majority
consisted of speculators, cutthroats, "I.D.B.,"[#] and such others as
were exiled from their native lands by reason of crimes they had
committed.and honour and justice were cast to the
winds.The Boer Government was blamed for famine, drought, and the
locusts, and everything was done to embarrass those who were trying to
administer justice to Boer and Uitlander alike.Every diamond mined in the country must be
registered with the Government, and may not be sold except by a licensed
broker.Transgression of this law is called illicit diamond buying or
selling, and is punishable with long imprisonment on the Breakwater at
Cape Town.One example is sufficient to show the conduct of the Uitlanders toward
the Boers, but thousands could be given.President Kruger journeyed to
Johannesburg in order to learn from the newcomers what his government
might do to improve the industry.Kruger, and, after
rude remarks on his personal appearance, sang "God save the Queen."Later the Transvaal flag was torn down from a staff in front of the
house in which the President was conferring with leading residents of
the city.on the other hand, sought by all
means in its power to secure the good-will of the newcomers, and
frequent conferences between leading men of the Randt and the officials
of the Government were held with that object in view.The Second
Volksraad was created, so that the Uitlanders might have a voice in the
Government, and many reforms, which at the time were warmly approved by
the Johannesburg Chamber of Mines, representing the mining population,
were instituted, and would have been completed, satisfactory to all, had
the Uitlanders waited, instead of plotting for the overthrow of the
Government.When the disturbing element of the Uitlander population found that their
efforts to govern the Randt according to their own desires were
fruitless, Cecil J. Rhodes, then Premier of Cape Colony and at the
height of his influence, began his campaign for the control of the Boer
territory.He brought to bear all the power at his command to harass
the Pretorian Government, and tried in a score of ways to induce the
colonial secretary to interfere in behalf of the Uitlanders, even going
to the extent of offering to Secretary for the Colonies Chamberlain the
payment of an equal share in the cost of a war with the Transvaal.Rhodes's real object in attempting to secure possession of
the Transvaal was that he and other capitalists might consolidate the
mines and limit the output, as he had done at Kimberley, or whether his
earth-hunger impelled him, is known only to himself.Whatever the
reason, he planned like a professional South American revolutionist, and
by his boldness caused the amateur revolutionists of the Randt to gasp.The opening prelude of the Jameson raid was a mass meeting held in
November, 1895, by the Johannesburg Chamber of Mines, which had always
shown marked friendliness to the Pretorian Government.The president of
the organization, Lionel Phillips, created a sensation by reading a mass
of alleged grievances against the Government, as formulated by an
organization called the "Transvaal National Union," and threatening
that, unless the Government gave immediate remedy, revolutionary methods
would be adopted in order to obtain redress.The plot had begun its
evolution, and its success was to be attained in a certain well-defined
way.Phillips was to serve as Johannesburg's ultimatum to
the Boers.If the Government gave no heed, the revolutionary party was
to seize Johannesburg by force of arms, declare a provisional government
of the country, and march against Pretoria.Once in possession of the
seat of government, it was planned to lay their grievances before the
world, and ask that the future government of the country be placed in
the hands of the majority of the white population.It was believed that
if the plans were thoroughly perfected the plot could be carried to a
successful conclusion without the firing of a single shot.In order to
be amply prepared in case the Boers should make an unexpected resistance
to the revolutionists, it had been arranged with Dr.Leander Starr
Jameson, who was then in charge of the troops of Mr.Rhodes's British
South Africa Company, to ride across the border to Johannesburg, a
journey of several days, and assist in the engagement.The revolution
was perfectly planned, and it would have required only half an effort on
the part of a Haytien revolutionist to carry it out successfully; but
Mr.Rhodes, the brains of the movement, was in Cape Town, and unable to
do anything more practical than imagine that his plans were being
followed.By common agreement among the revolutionists, Dr.Rhodes, it was decided to have the uprising in Johannesburg about
the 28th of December, and everything had been planned accordingly.Rhodes's De Beers Company had sent two thousand
rifles--the Boers say twenty thousand--one hundred and twenty-five cases
of ammunition, and three Maxims in oil casks across the border into
Johannesburg, where the Uitlanders were secretly organizing and drilling
military companies.Jameson and his six
hundred troopers were polishing their rifles and Maxims, and waiting for
the day when they should march toward Johannesburg.Under pretence that they were to be used in connection with a new stage
line to be opened, "canteens," or feeding places, had been established
several miles apart on the road over which the troopers were supposed to
enter Johannesburg, and all had been bountifully stocked with provisions
for soldier and horse.The Government at Pretoria had been led to
believe that Johannesburg was armed to the teeth, and that nothing could
prevent the dissolution of the republic.When the 28th day of December arrived, the well-advertised revolution
had not materialized, and nothing more martial was to be seen than
several regiments of civilians drilling in the streets.Thousands of
men, women, and children, fearing that the Boers might attack the city
at any moment, besieged the railway station, and fought like so many
uncivilized beings to board the trains leaving for Natal and Cape
Colony.Among those who displayed the greatest eagerness to escape from
the city were many wealthy Englishmen, who several days before had been
the most rabid sympathizers of the revolutionary movement.The city was
in the hands of the Uitlanders, because the handful of Transvaal police,
commonly called "Zarps," had been withdrawn by the Boer authorities, who
depended on the power of the guns in the fort on the outskirts of the
town to quell any disturbance that might be made.There was no actual
revolution, because the Uitlanders were divided among themselves as to
the course to be pursued.The Englishmen, as soon as the success of the
movement seemed so close at hand, aroused the enmity of the other
Uitlanders by asking them to consent to the raising of the British flag
as soon as the Boer Republic had been obliterated.This campaign placed
the revolution in an entirely different light to those of the Uitlanders
who had no particular liking for England, and the result was that the
revolutionary party was divided into two camps.On the side of the
Englishmen were the Uitlanders from British colonies--Scotchmen,
Irishmen, Welshmen, Canadians, Australians, and all the Americans who
were employed by British mines.In the other camp were the Germans,
Frenchmen, Scandinavians, Swedes, Norwegians, Danes, and Finlanders.The majority of the Americans felt that a revolution was unjustifiable,
although some of the grievances complained of were undoubtedly just, and
ranged themselves on the anti-English side.Another reason for the
Americans' attitude at that time was President Cleveland's warlike
message to England on the Venezuelan boundary dispute.The real
American patriot is found ten thousand miles from home, and those in
America who were excited when they heard of England's attempt to grasp a
swamp in far-away Venezuela can readily imagine the spirit of the
Americans in the Transvaal who saw England attempting to steal a
valuable country without the shadow of an excuse.The following day, the 29th of December, Dr.Jameson and his troopers,
believing that the revolutionists at Johannesburg had seized the city,
as it had been planned they should do, crossed the border into the
Transvaal.Rhodes and others of the
leaders, stating the time of the departure from British territory and
the time set for their arrival in Johannesburg.Several troopers were
sent ahead to cut the telegraph wires, so that no news of the expedition
should reach the outside world; but the anticipated joy of reaching
Johannesburg and assisting in raising the "Union Jack" intoxicated the
men, and they succeeded in cutting only the wire which led to Cape Town.The wire to Pretoria remained untouched, and before the troopers had
proceeded fifty miles into Transvaal territory the Pretorian Government
was aware of their approach, and made preparations to meet them.The Uitlanders in Johannesburg had been led to believe by their
_dilettante_ leaders that Dr.Jameson's incursion had been postponed,
and they were ignorant of his whereabouts until the following day, when
a member of the Pretorian Government kind-heartedly gave the information
to several of the Uitlander leaders, who had journeyed to Pretoria with
rifles in one hand and demands in the other.When the news of the
invasion reached Johannesburg the excitement became intensified.A
reform committee of about one hundred persons was quickly formed, and
into their hands was given the conduct of the revolution.Speeches were
made from the balcony of the Stock Exchange, until some practical
speaker suggested that it would be proper to unpack the rifles and
ammunition from the oil casks if the revolution was to be undertaken.The suggestion was acted upon, and late that night five hundred of the
rifles to be used in the overthrow of a republic were being carried to
and fro in the streets of Johannesburg on the shoulders of men who were
willing to do the work for ten dollars a night.Jameson and his troopers were marching over the veldt toward
Johannesburg, the leaders of the movement made more speeches to the
crowd at the Stock Exchange, and waited for news from Pretoria instead
of making news for Pretoria.The first part of the plot--the capture of Johannesburg--had been
successful without the discharge of a rifle, because the Boers had
withdrawn their police, and there remained no one at which the
_opera-bouffe_ revolutionists might fire.The next step was the capture of Pretoria, and for this purpose a small
expedition started for the capital city; but returned hastily and
without their rifles and ammunition when they saw a thousand Boers, each
with the usual accompaniment of a rifle, attending the annual
"Nachtmaal," or communion, in the city.The last day of the year saw the Uitlanders undecided as to what action
to take.Jameson coming to their relief, while
on the other was the Pretorian Government preparing to quell an
insurrection which had not even started.The Reform Committee, whose
members a few weeks before had made arrangements for Dr.Jameson's
coming, denied that they had any connection with the invasion.Jameson having been repudiated, the committee debated for many hours on
the subject of which flag should be hoisted in the event that the
revolution was successful, and finally sent John Hays Hammond, an
American member of the committee, to secure the four-colour of the
Transvaal.Then and there the most ludicrous incident of the Uitlander rising took
place.With uplifted hands the members of the committee, who were the
leaders of the revolution, swore allegiance to the red, white, green,
and blue flag of the Transvaal, which for days and months before they
had reviled and insulted.After having vowed loyalty to the Transvaal
flag, the committee continued the preparations for the defence of the
city and the drilling of the volunteers who were enrolled at a score of
different shops in the city.Jameson had been
attacked by the Boer forces, but had repulsed them, gave additional zest
to the military preparations, and the advisability of sending some of
the mounted troops to meet him was discussed but not acted upon.Jameson's troopers, coupled with a request from
the Pretorian Government for a conference to discuss methods of ending
the troubles, caused the Reform Committee to repent their hasty action
in swearing allegiance to the Transvaal flag, and they were on the point
of breaking their obligation, and sending aid to the invading troopers,
when, during the last hour of the year, they learned that the secretary
for the colonies, Mr.Chamberlain, had repudiated and recalled Dr.The first day of the new year the spirit of the Uitlanders was dampened
by the information that the Boers were massing troops on the outskirts
of the town; and, fearing that the town might be attacked at any moment,
the Reform Committee, which had been spending much energy in informing
the Pretorian Government of the city's great military preparation,
telegraphed pathetic appeals for assistance to the British High
Commissioner at Cape Town.Couriers arrived from the outskirts of the
city and reported that Dr.Jameson and his troopers were within fifteen
miles of Johannesburg, and plans were made to receive him.One small
regiment left the city to meet the troopers and escort them into the
city, while the remainder of the revolutionary forces held jubilation
festivities in honour of Dr.While Johannesburg, which had promised to do the fighting, was in the
midst of its festival joys, Dr.Jameson and those of his six hundred
troopers who were not dead on the fields of battle were waving a
Hottentot woman's white apron in token of their surrender to the Boer
forces at Doornkop, eighteen miles away.The Johannesburg revolt,
initiated by magnificent promises, ended with an inglorious display of
that quality which the British have been wont to attribute to
Boers--"funk."The British have their Balaclava and Sebastopol, but
they also have their Majuba Hill and the Johannesburg revolt.The final scenes of the Jameson raid, which might more fittingly be
called "the Johannesburg funk," were enacted in Pretoria, where Dr.Jameson and the other prisoners were taken, and in London, where the
officers of the expedition were tried and virtually acquitted.The
revolutionists in Johannesburg yielded all their arms and ammunition to
the Boer Government, which in turn made every possible effort to effect
an amicable settlement of the grievances of the Uitlanders.But the
raid left a deeper impress upon Johannesburg and its interests than any
of its organizers or supporters had ever dreamed of.Almost one fifth
of the inhabitants of the city left the country for more peaceable
localities in the three months following the disturbance, and business
became stagnant.Capitalists declined to invest more money in the gold
mines while the unsettled condition of the political affairs continued,
and scores of mines were compelled to abandon operations.Stocks fell
in value, and thousands of pounds were lost by innocent shareholders in
Europe, who were ignorant of the political affairs of the country.For
two years the depression continued, and so acute were its results that
hundreds of respectable miners and business men, who had been accustomed
to live in luxury, became bankrupt, and were obliged to beg for their
food.Those who were able to do so sold their interests in the city and
left the country, while hundreds of others would have been happy to
leave had they been able to secure passage to their native countries.During the last year the effects of the raid have been disappearing and
the commercial interests of the Randt have been improving, but the
political atmosphere has been kept vibrating at a continuous loss to the
industries that are represented in the country.All South Africa was
similarly affected by the depression, which naturally cut off the
revenue from the gold fields and that derived from passengers and
freight coming into the country from foreign shores.To add to the
general dismay, the entire country was scourged with the rinderpest, a
disease which killed more than a million and a half cattle; clouds of
locusts, that destroyed all vegetation and made life miserable; and a
long drought.After the scourges had passed, and the political atmosphere had become
somewhat clarified, the industries of Johannesburg and the Randt
returned to their normal condition, and the development of the natural
resources of the territory was resumed.Many of those persons who
deserted the city during its period of depression returned with renewed
energy, and those who had successfully combated the storm joined with
the newcomers in welcoming the return of prosperous times.Confidence
was restored among the European capitalists, and money was again freely
invested and trade relations firmly re-established.Johannesburg after the Jameson raid was a distressing scene; the
Johannesburg of to-day is a wondrous testimonial to the energy and
progress of mankind.If there were no other remarkable features to mark the last decade of
the twentieth century, the marvellous city which has been built near the
heart of the Dark Continent would alone be a fitting monument to the
enterprise and achievements of the white race during that period of
time.CHAPTER IV

                           THE BOER OF TO-DAY


The wholesale slander and misrepresentation with which the Boers of
South Africa have been pursued can not be outlived by them in a hundred
years.It originated when the British forces took possession of the
Cape of Good Hope, and it has continued with unabated vigour ever since.Recently the chief writers of fiction have been prominent Englishmen,
who, on hunting expeditions or rapid tours through the country, saw the
object of their venom from car windows or in the less favourable
environments of a trackless veldt.In earlier days the outside world gleaned its knowledge of the Boers
from certain British statesmen, who, by grace of Downing Street,
controlled the country's colonial policy, and consequently felt obliged
to conjure up weird descriptions of their far-distant subjects in order
to make the application of certain harsh policies appear more applicable
and necessary.Missionaries to South Africa, traders, and, not least of
all, speculators, all found it convenient to traduce the Boers to the
people in England, and the object in almost every case was the
attainment of some personal end.Had there been any variety in the
complaints, there might have been reason to suppose they were
justifiable, but the similarity of the reports led to the conclusion
that the British in South Africa were conducting the campaign of
misrepresentation for the single purpose of arousing the enmity of the
home people against the Boers.The unbiased reports were generally of
such a nature that they were drowned by the roar of the malicious ones,
and, instead of creating a better popular opinion of the race, only
assisted in stirring the opposition to greater flights of fancy.American interests in South Africa having been so infinitesimal until
the last decade, our own knowledge of the country and its people
naturally was of the same proportions.When Americans learned anything
concerning South Africa or the Boers it came by way of London, which had
vaster interests in the country, and should have been able to give exact
information.But, like other colonial information, it was discoloured
with London additions, and the result was that American views of the
Boers tallied with those of the Englishman.Among the more prominent Englishmen who have recently studied the Boers
from a car window, and have given the world the benefit of their
opinions, is a man who has declared that the Boer blocked the way in
South Africa, and must go.Among other declarations with which this
usually well-informed writer has taken up the cudgel in behalf of his
friend Mr.Rhodes, he has called the Boers "utterly detestable," "guilty
of indecencies and family immorality," and even so "benighted and
uncivilized" as to preclude the possibility of writing about them.All
this he is reported to have said about a race that has been lauded
beyond measure by the editors of every country in the world except those
under the English flag.The real cause of it all is found in the Boers'
disposition to carry their own burdens, and their disinclination to
allow England to be their keeper.Their opinions of justice and right
were formed years ago in Cape Colony, and so long as their fighting
ability has not been proved in a negative manner, so long will the Boers
be reviled by the covetous Englishmen of South Africa and their friends.The Boer of to-day is a man who loves solitude above all things.He and
his ancestors have enjoyed that chief product of South Africa for so
many generations that it is his greatest delight to be alone.The
nomadic spirit of the early settler courses in his veins, and will not
be eradicated though cities be built up all around him and railroads hem
him in on all sides.He loves to be out on the veldt, where nothing but the tall grass
obstructs his view of the horizon, and his happiness is complete when,
gun in hand, he can stalk the buck or raise the covey on soil never
upturned by the share of a plough.The real Boer is a real son of the
soil.It is his natural environment, and he chafes when he is compelled
to go where there are more than a dozen dwellings in the same square
mile of area.The pastoral life he and his ancestors have been leading has endowed him
with a happy-go-lucky disposition.Some call him lazy and sluggish
because he has plenty of time at his disposal and "counts ten" before
acting.Others might call that disposition a realization of his
necessities, and his chosen method of providing for them.The watching of herds of cattle and flocks of sheep has since biblical
times been considered an easier business than the digging of minerals or
the manufacture of iron, and the Boer has realized that many years ago.He has also realized the utter uselessness of digging for minerals and
the manufacture of iron when the products of either were valueless at a
distance of a thousand miles from the nearest market.Taking these
facts in consideration, the Boer has done what other less nomadic people
have done.He has improved the opportunities which lay before him, and
has allowed the others to pass untouched.The Boers are not an agricultural people, because the nature of the
country affords no encouragement for the following of that pursuit.The
great heat of the summer removes rivers in a week and leaves rivulets
hardly big enough to quench the thirst of the cattle.Irrigation is out
of the question, as the great rivers are too far distant and the country
too level to warrant the building of artificial waterways.Taking all
things into consideration, there is nothing for a Boer to do but raise
cattle and sheep, and he may regard himself particularly fortunate at
the end of each year if drought and disease have not carried away one
half of this wealth.The Boer's habits and mode of life are similar to those of the American
ranchman, and in reality there is not much difference between the two
except that the latter is not so far removed from civilization.The
Boer likes to be out of the sight of the smoke of his neighbour's house,
and to live fifteen or twenty miles from another dwelling is a matter of
satisfaction rather than regret to him.The patriarchal custom of the
people provides against the lack of companionship which naturally would
follow this custom.When a Boer's children marry they settle within a short distance of the
original family homestead; generally several hundred yards distant.In
this way, in a few years, a small village is formed on the family
estates, which may consist of from five hundred to ten thousand acres of
uninclosed grazing ground.Every son when he marries is entitled to a
share of the estate, which he is supposed to use for the support of
himself and his family, and in that way the various estates grow smaller
each generation.When an estate grows too small to support the owner,
he "treks" to another part of the country, and receives from the state
such an amount of territory as he may require.Boer houses, as a rule, are situated a long distance away from the
tracks of the transport wagons, in order that passing infected animals
may not introduce disease into the flocks and herds of the farmer.Strangers are seldom seen as a result of this isolation, and news from
the outer world does not reach the Boers unless they travel to the towns
to make the annual purchases of necessaries.Their chief recreation is the shooting of game, which abounds in almost
all parts of the country.Besides being their recreation, it is also
their duty, for it is much cheaper to kill a buck and use it to supply
the family larder than to kill an ox or a sheep for the same purpose.It is seldom that a Boer misses his aim, be the target a deer or an
Englishman, and he has ample time to become proficient in the use of the
rifle.His gun is his constant companion on the veldt and at his home,
and the long alliance has resulted in earning for him the distinction of
being the best marksman and the best irregular soldier in the world.The
Boer is not a sportsman in the American sense of the word.He is a
hunter, pure and simple, and finds no delight in following the
Englishman's example of spending many weeks in the Zambezi forests or
the dangerous Kalahari Desert, and returning with a giraffe tail and a
few horns and feathers as trophies of the chase.He hunts because he
needs meat for his family and leather for sjam-bok whips with which to
drive his cattle, and not because it gives him personal gratification to
be able to demonstrate his supreme skill in the tracking of game.The dress of the Boer is of the roughest description and material, and
suited to his occupation.Corduroy and flannel for the body, a
wide-brimmed felt hat for the head, and soft leather-soled boots fitted
for walking on the grass, complete the regulation Boer costume, which is
picturesque as well as serviceable.The clothing, which is generally
made by the Boer's vrouw, or wife, makes no pretension of fit or style,
and is quite satisfactory to the wearer if it clings to the body.In
most instances it is built on plans made and approved by the
Voortrekkers of 1835, and quite satisfactory to the present Boers, their
sons, and grandsons.Physically, the Boers are the equals, if not the superiors, of their
old-time enemy, the Zulus.It would be difficult to find anywhere an
entire race of such physical giants as the Boers of the Transvaal and
the Orange Free State.The roving existence, the life in the open air,
and the freedom from disturbing cares have combined to make of the Boers
a race that is almost physically perfect.If an average height of all
the full-grown males in the country were taken, it would be found to be
not less than six feet two inches, and probably more.Their physique,
notwithstanding their comparatively idle mode of living, is
magnificently developed.The action of the almost abnormally developed muscles of the legs and
arms, discernible through their closely fitting garments, gives an idea
of the remarkable powers of endurance which the Boers have displayed on
many occasions when engaged in native and other campaigns.They can
withstand almost any amount of physical pain and discomfort, and can
live for a remarkably long time on the smallest quantity of food.It is
a matter of common knowledge that a Boer can subsist on a five-pound
slice of "biltong"--beef that has been dried in the sun until it is
almost as hard as stone--for from ten to fifteen days without suffering
any pangs of hunger.In times of war, "biltong" is the principal item
in the army rations, and in peace, when he is following his flocks, it
also is the Boer shepherd's chief article of diet.The religion of the Boers is one of their greatest characteristics, and
one that can hardly be understood when it is taken into consideration
that they have been separated for almost two hundred years from the
refining influences of a higher civilization.The simple faith in a
Supreme Being, which the original emigrants from Europe carried to South
Africa, has been handed down from one generation to another, and in two
centuries of fighting, trekking, and ranching has lost none of its
pristine depth and fervour.With the Boer his religion is his first and uppermost thought.The Old
Testament is the pattern which he strives to follow.The father of the
family reads from its pages every day, and from it he formulates his
ideas of right and wrong as they are to be applied to the work of the
day.Whether he wishes to exchange cattle with his neighbour or give
his daughter in marriage to a neighbour's son, he consults the
Testament, and finds therein the advice that is applicable to the
situation.He reads nothing but the Bible, and consequently his belief
in its teachings is indestructible and supreme.[Illustration: Kirk Street, Pretoria, with the State Church in the
distance.]His religious temperament is portrayed in almost every sentence he
utters, and his repetition of biblical parables and sayings is a custom
which so impresses itself upon the mind of the stranger that it is but
natural that those who are unacquainted with the Boer should declare it
a sure sign of his hypocrisy.He does not quote Scripture merely to
impress upon the mind of his hearer the fact that he is a devout
Christian, but does it for the same reasons that a sailor speaks the
language of the sea-farer.The Boer is a low churchman among low churchmen.He abhors anything
that has the slightest tendency toward show or outward signs of display
in religious worship.He is simple in his other habits, and in his
religious observances he is almost primitively simple.To him the
wearing of gorgeous raiment, special attitudes, musical accompaniment to
hymns, and special demonstrations are the rankest sacrilege.Of the
nine legal holidays in the Transvaal, five--Good Friday, Easter Monday,
Ascension Day, Whit Monday, and Christmas--are Church festival days, and
are strictly observed by every Boer in the country.The Dutch Reformed Church has been the state Church since 1835, when the
Boers commenced emigrating from Cape Colony.The "trekkers" had no
regularly ordained ministers, but depended upon the elders for their
religious training, as well as for leadership in all temporal affairs.One of the first clergymen to preach to the Boers was an American, the
Rev.Daniel Lindley, who was one of the earliest missionaries ever sent
to South Africa.The state controls the Church, and, conversely, the
Church controls the state, for it is necessary for a man to become a
factor in religious affairs before he can become of any political
importance.As a result of this custom, the politicians are necessarily
the most active church members.The Hervormde Dopper branch of the Dutch Reformed Church is the result
of a disagreement in 1883 with the Gereformeerde branch over the singing
of hymns during a religious service.The Doppers, led by Paul Kruger,
peaceably withdrew, and started a congregation of their own when the
more progressive faction insisted on singing hymns, which the Doppers
declared was extremely worldly.Since then the two chief political parties are practically based on the
differences in religion.The Progressive party is composed of those who
sing hymns, and the members of the Conservative party are those who are
more Calvinistic in their tendencies.As the Conservatives have been in
power for the last decade, it follows that the majority of the Boers are
opposed to the singing of hymns in church.The greatest festival in the
Boer calendar is that of Nachtmaal, or Communion, which is generally
held in Pretoria the latter part of the year.The majority of the Boers living in remote parts of the country, where
established congregations or churches are an impossibility, it behooves
every Boer to journey to the capital once a year to partake of
communion.Pretoria then becomes the Mecca of all Boers, and the pretty
little town is filled to overflowing with pilgrims and their "trekking"
wagons and cattle.Those who live in remote parts of the country are
obliged to start several weeks before the Nachtmaal in order to be there
at the appointed time, and the whole journey to and fro in many
instances requires six weeks' time.When they reach Pretoria they
bivouac in the open square surrounding the old brick church in the
centre of the town, and spend almost all their time in the church.It
is one of the grandest scenes in South Africa to observe the pilgrims
camping in the open square under the shade of the patriarchal church,
which to them is the most sacred edifice in the world.The home life of the Boers is as distinctive a feature of these rough,
simple peoples as is their deep religious enthusiasm.If there is
anything that his falsifiers have attacked, it is the Boer's home life,
and those who have had the opportunity to study it will vouch that none
more admirable exists anywhere.The Boer heart is filled with an
intense feeling of family affection.He loves his wife and children
above all things, and he is never too busy to eulogize them.He will
allow his flocks to wander a mile away while he relates a trifling
incident of family life, and he would rather miss an hour's sleep than
not take advantage of an opportunity to talk on domestic topics.He does not gossip, because he sees his neighbours too rarely for that,
but he will lay before you the detailed history and distinctive features
of every one of his ancestors, relations, and descendants.He is
hospitable to a degree that is astonishing, and he will give to a
stranger the best room in the house, the use of his best horse, and his
finest food.Naturally he will not give an effusive welcome to an
Englishman, because he is the natural enemy of the Boer, but to
strangers of other nationalities he opens his heart and house.The programme of the Boer's day is hardly ever marred by any changes.He rises with the sun, and works among the sheep and cattle until
breakfast.There at the table he meets his family and conducts the
family worship.If the parents of the married couple are present, they
receive the best seats at the table, and are treated with great
reverence.After breakfast he makes his plans for the day's work, which may consist
of a forward "trek" or a hunting trip.He attends to the little plot of
cultivated ground, which provides all the vegetables and grain for the
table, and spends the remainder of the day in attending to the cattle
and sheep.Toward night he gathers his family around him, and reads to
them selected chapters from the Bible.From the same book he teaches
his children to read until twilight is ended, whereupon the Boer's day
is ended, and he seeks his bed.During the dry season the programme varies only as far as his place of
abode is concerned.With the arrival of that season the Boer closes his
house and becomes a wanderer in pursuit of water.The sheep and cattle
are driven to the rivers, and the family follows in big transport
wagons, not unlike the American prairie-schooner, propelled by eight
spans of oxen.The family moves from place to place as the necessity
for new pasturage arises.With the approach of the wet season the
nomads prepare for the return to the deserted homestead, and, as soon as
the first rain has fallen and the grass has changed the colour of the
landscape, the Boer and his vast herds are homeward bound.The Boer homestead is as unpretentious as its owner.Generally it is a
low, one-story stone structure, with a steep tile roof and a small annex
in the rear, which is used as a kitchen.The door is on a level with
the ground, and four windows afford all the light that is required in
the four square rooms in the interior.A dining room and three bedrooms
suffice for a family, however large.The floors are of hardened clay,
liberally coated with manure, which is designed to ward off the
pestiferous insects that swarm over the plains.The house is usually situated in a valley and close to a stream, and, in
rare instances, is sheltered by a few trees that have been brought from
the coast country.Native trees are such a rarity that the traveller
may go five hundred miles without seeing a single specimen.The Boer
vrouw feels no need of firewood, however, for her ancestors taught her
to cook her meals over a fire of the dry product of the cattle-decked
plains.Personal uncleanliness is one of the great failings that has been
attributed to the Boer, but when it is taken into consideration that
water is a priceless possession on the plains of South Africa, no
further explanation is needed.The canard that the Boers go to bed
without undressing is as absurd as the one of like origin that an entire
family sleeps in one bed.Yet these fictions constantly appear, and
frequently over the names of persons who have penetrated into South
Africa no farther than Cape Town.The Boer here depicted is the representative Boer--the one who shoulders
his rifle and fights for his country; the one who watches his cattle on
the plains and pays his taxes; the one who tries to improve his
condition, and takes advantage of every opportunity for advancement that
is offered.There is a worthless Boer, as there is a worthless
Englishman, a worthless German, and a worthless American, but he is so
far in the minority that he need not be analyzed.There is, however, a Boer who lives in the towns and cities, and he
compares favourably with other men of South African birth.He has had
the advantage of better schools, and can speak one or more languages
besides his own.He is not so nomadic in his tendencies as his rural
countryman, and he has absorbed more of the modernisms.He can conduct
a philosophic argument, and his wife and daughters can play the piano.If he is wealthy, his son is a student at a European university and his
daughter flirting on the beach at Durban or attending a ladies' seminary
at Bloemfontein or Grahamstown.He is as progressive as any white man cares to be under that generous
South African sun, and when it comes to driving a bargain he is a match
for any of the money sharks of Johannesburg.For the youthful Boer who
reaches the city directly from the country, without any trade or
profession, the prospects are gloomy.He is at a great disadvantage when
put into competition with almost any class of residents.The occupations
to which he can turn are few, and these have been still further
restricted in late years by the destruction of cattle by the rinderpest
and the substitution of railways for road transport.His lack of
education unfits him for most of the openings provided in such a city as
Johannesburg, even when business is at its highest tide, and a small
increase in the tension of business brings him to absolute want.The Boer of to-day is a creature of circumstance.He is outstripped
because he has had no opportunities for development.Driven from Cape
Colony, where he was rapidly developing a national character, he was
compelled to wander into lands that offered no opportunities of any
description.He has been cut off for almost a hundred years from an
older and more energetic civilization, and even from his neighbours; it
is no wonder that he is a century behind the van.No other civilized
race on earth has been handicapped in such a manner, and if there had
been one it is a matter for conjecture whether it would have held its
own, as the Boer has done, or whether it would have fallen to the level
of the savage.Had the Boer Voortrekkers been fortunate enough to settle in a fertile
country bordering on the sea, where they might have had communication
with the outer world, their descendants would undoubtedly to-day be
growing cane and wheat instead of herding cattle and driving transport
wagons.Their love of freedom could not have been greater under those
circumstances, but they might have averted the conditions which now
threaten to erase their nation from the face of the earth.CHAPTER V

                            PRESIDENT KRUGER


Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger, or Uncle Paul, the Lion of Rustenberg,
is a man of most remarkable characteristics.A man of absolutely no
education, as we understand the word, he has, during the long years of a
notable career, so applied his inherent abilities, his natural
astuteness, the cunning acquired by constant battling with the wiles of
native enemies, as to be able to acquit himself of his high office in a
manner to be envied by many who have enjoyed a hundred times as many
advantages.Although he is almost seventy-five years old, the
President's mind has not become dimmed, but, if anything, has grown
keener of perception and wider in its scope during the last ten years.Kruger has been a leader among his countrymen.When
a boy he had pronounced ability as a deer-stalker, and it is related of
him that before he had reached manhood he had killed more lions than any
other man in the colony.He was absolutely fearless, and could endure
any amount of bodily pain and discomfort.As an example of this, I
repeat his explanation of the accident that caused him to lose his left
thumb:

"We were shooting rhinoceros one day," said he, "when an old gun
exploded in my hands.It cut my thumb so badly that I saw it could not
be saved.I borrowed a dull knife and cut the thumb off, because it
prevented me from holding the gun properly."He impresses one as
being a king in the garb of a farmer, a genius in a dunce's cap.At
first sight he would be mistaken for an awkward countryman, with "store
clothes" and a silk hat intended for some one else.His frock coat is
far too small to reach around his corpulent body, and his trousers seem
to have a natural antipathy for his shoes.He wears no cuffs, and the presence of a collar and tie may be
determined only by drawing aside the natural curtain formed by his
whiskers.He is uncouth in his manner, but he has great natural
attractiveness gained by a long life among hunters in the wilds.He is
suspicious of everything and every one, but that quality is easily
accounted for by his early dealings with <DW64> chiefs, whose treacherous
habits caused him to become wary in all his transactions with them.In
later days this has stood him in good stead.He is slow to make
friends, but once he trusts a person voluminous proof is necessary
before he alters his opinion of the man.He never forgets a good deed,
and never pardons the man who does a bad one.President Kruger is short in stature, measuring less than five feet
seven inches.His head and body are large and fat, but his legs are
thin and short.His head is just a trifle longer than broad, and almost
fits the English definition of "square head."The small eyes are
surmounted by bushy, white eyebrows, which extend half an inch beyond
his forehead.When he is not sitting for a photograph his hair is not so neatly
arranged as it appears in the well-known pictures, but hangs loosely
down over his wide forehead, except when, with a hasty swish of the
hand, he brushes it aside.The hair is nearly white, and hangs over the
sides of his head in long tresses, which cover both his ears.When he smiles the big fat circles above his cheeks are pushed upward,
and shut his small gray eyes from view.But when pleased the President
generally laughs hilariously, and then his eyes remain closed for the
greater part of a minute.Kruger's nose and mouth are the chief
features of his face.Both are more extensive than his large face
demands, but they are such marvels in their own peculiar way as to be
distinguishing marks.The bridge of the nose grows wide as it goes
outward from the point between the eyes, and before it reaches the tip
it has a gentle upheaval.Then it spreads out on either side, and
covers fully two inches of area above his upper lip.It is not
attractive, but in that it follows the general condition of his facial
landscape.The constant use of a heavy pipe has
caused a deep depression on the left side of his lower lip, and this
gives the whole mouth the appearance of being unbalanced.His chin is
large and prominent, and his ears correspond relatively in size and
symmetry with his face.When in repose his features are not pleasant to
look upon, but when lighted up by a smile they become rather attractive,
and generally cause his laughter to become contagious among his hearers.The thin line of beard which runs from ear to ear combines with the hair
on his head in forming what is not unlike a white halo around the
President's face.The lines in the man's face are deep, irregular, and
very numerous.They indicate more than anything the ceaseless worry and
troubles to which the President has been subjected while directing the
affairs of his countrymen of the Transvaal.The physical description of the Kruger of to-day is one that suggests
sluggishness and idleness rather than alertness and ceaseless activity.The appearance of the man certainly does not conform with his record of
marvellous performances, unflagging endeavour, and superior mental
attainments.The well-preserved Kruger at seventy-five years bears no
deep marks of the busy and eventful life he has led, nor are there any
visible indications that the end of his usefulness to his people is
close at hand.Kruger's life, as related by himself,
gives an insight into his remarkably varied experiences.He modestly
refrains from allowing any one, even those who know him best, to obtain
from him enough of his own history to incorporate in a biography, and it
is likely, unless in his later years he changes his mind, that no
detailed narrative can ever be written.Although the majority of his countrymen are of Dutch or Huguenot
ancestry, Mr.Jacob Kruger, his paternal
ancestor, emigrated to South Africa, in 1713, from the Potsdam district
of Germany, and married a young woman who was born in Cape Colony.He
was born October 10, 1825, in Colesburg, Cape Colony, whither his
parents had "trekked" from Cape Town a quarter of a century before.The
first Krugers whose names appear in the Dutch East India Company's
records arrived in the settlement at the Cape in 1712, and thereafter
became leaders in enterprise among the settlers.Kruger was
yet in his infancy the Boers' troubles with the Colonial Government
began, and when he was ten years old he migrated with the "Voortrekkers"
to the unknown regions in the interior.The life in the open and the tropical temperature served to develop him
early, and at the age of fifteen we find him shooting his first lion, as
well as serving in the capacity of "field cornet," a minor official
position.As such he took part in the wars with the Zulu Dingaan and
the Matabele Moselekatse, and served with distinction.In 1842 he was
confirmed by the Rev.Daniel Lindley, the American missionary, and had
implanted more firmly in his heart the religious feeling which in later
years has proved to be his greatest solace in his troubles.Next we hear of him standing by the side of his father while he fires
the first shot at the English soldiers in the battle of Boomplaats, in
1848.After doing valiant service in that battle, he became one of the
leaders of the "trekkers" who settled in the Transvaal country.In 1856 young Kruger, then barely thirty-one years old, is elected
sub-commandant of the Transvaal army, a most responsible position in a
country where natives are as treacherous as they are innumerable.Five
years later he becomes commandant of the army, and leads a force of one
hundred and fifty men against Chief Sechele.He retains that office
until 1877, when England annexes the country to her domain.During the
war for independence which then ensues, Mr.Kruger is Vice-President of
the Triumvirate, which executes the government of the country, and after
peace is declared in 1883 he is elected to the presidency.He is thrice
re-elected, and is now serving his fourth term as head of the South
African Republic.Into this skeleton of his life's story might be fitted innumerable
incidents and anecdotes that are related by his countrymen, who treasure
them greatly and repeat them at every opportunity.Many of these are
probably imaginary, while others have undoubtedly been retold so
frequently that they have lost all resemblance of the original form.Kruger's prowess in dealing
with lions, tigers, and elephants, and many of these are probably true.Several of those that he himself verifies are given merely to illustrate
the experiences that the Boers encountered in the early days of the
"trekkers."When fifteen years old Kruger and one of his sisters, being left alone
on the veldt by their parents, were approached by a South African
panther, small but of ample enough proportions to frighten the two
children.Kruger, with only a knife for a weapon, boldly attacked the
panther, and after a severe struggle, during which he was sorely
injured, slew the beast.Another story, illustrative of his physical
strength, is that he contested with a native in a foot-race of twelve
hours' duration, and won by such a large margin that he was enabled to
stalk a buck on the veldt and carry it to his father's house before his
competitor reached the goal.During the "trekking" trip from Cape Colony to the final settlement in
the Transvaal the Boer settlers shot no less than six thousand lions,
and of that number Kruger is credited with shooting more than two
hundred and fifty.His personal bravery was never shown to better advantage than in 1857,
when he was sub-commandant of the Transvaal army.He had ordered
several of his burghers to go into the Orange Free State, with which
country there was a serious misunderstanding, and there they were
arrested.Kruger heard of the men's arrest he hastened
into the camp of the Free State forces and asked for the release of the
prisoners on the ground that they were innocent, and that if any one
were guilty he was that man, because he had ordered them to enter the
country.The commandant of the Free State forces was so greatly amazed
by Mr.Kruger's bravery that he allowed all the Boers to return to their
own camp.Kruger's remarkable vitality and capacity for hard mental labour are
the results of the great care which he bestows upon himself and the
regular habits which he has followed for almost twenty years.He rises
at half past five o'clock every morning, and follows a daily programme,
from which he never deviates unless he is absent from home.After he
leaves his bedroom he proceeds to his library and drinks several cups of
intensely black coffee, and smokes several pipefuls of strong Boer
tobacco.Then he spends the greater part of an hour in family devotions
and the perusal of the Bible.After breakfast, at half past seven
o'clock, he receives the members of the Volksraad, and then transacts
the heaviest business of the day.After all the Volksraad members have
departed, he steps out on the piazza of his little whitewashed cottage
and joins the burghers, or citizens, who every morning congregate there
and discuss state affairs while they sip the coffee and smoke the
tobacco which the President furnishes to all visitors.At ten o'clock the state carriage and its escort of eight gaudily
apparelled troopers await him at the gate, and he is conveyed to the
Government House, several blocks distant.As soon as he arrives there
he is to be found either in one legislative chamber or the other,
directing the affairs of the two bodies, making addresses or quietly
watching the progress of legislative matters.At noon he returns to his
home for luncheon, but is back at his duties in the Government House at
two o'clock, and remains there three hours in the afternoon.Thereafter
he receives burghers at his home until seven o'clock, and retires every
evening at precisely eight o'clock.Kruger has over the majority of his countrymen is
due in no small measure to his fondness for conversing with them and his
treatment of them when they visit his cottage.As soon as the sun has
risen, a small stream of Boers wends its way toward the President's
cottage and awaits his appearance on the piazza.Kruger comes
among them he loses his identity as President, and merges his
personality into that of an ordinary burgher.This custom has endeared
him in the affections of his people, and, as a result, whenever he makes
a stand on any question it may be taken for granted that he has
thoroughly discussed the subject beforehand with his burghers, and that
he can depend upon the majority of them for their support.Kruger is a speech-maker of no mean ability.His addresses in the
Volksraad are filled with good reasoning, homely similes, biblical
quotations, and convincing argument.He speaks without preparation,
indulges in no flights of oratory, but uses the simple, plain language
that is easily understood by the burgher as well as the statesman.All
his speeches are delivered in the Boer "taal," a dialect which bears the
same relation to the Dutch language as "low" German does to "high"
German.Generally the dialect is used by the Boers in speaking only,
the pure Dutch being used in correspondence and official state papers.The President may be able to speak the English language, but if such is
the case he succeeds admirably in allowing no one except his most
trusted friends to hear him.Much investigation has failed to reveal
any one in Pretoria who has ever heard him speak the English language,
although reports have it that he speaks it fluently.He understands the
language well, and any one who has ever held a conversation with him
through an interpreter will recall that he occasionally forgets his
assumed inability to understand English, and replies to a question
before the interpreter has commenced to translate it.His first wife, a Miss Du Plessis,
was the daughter of one of the early voortrekkers, and with the other
women took part in many of the Boer wars against the natives.She died
shortly after the founding of the republic, and left one son, who lived
only a short time.Kruger several years afterward married his first
wife's niece, who is now the first lady of the land.Like almost all
Boer women, she has a retiring disposition, and very rarely appears in
public except at religious gatherings.The President rarely introduces
her to his visitors, probably in obedience to her own desires, but she
constantly entertains the wives and daughters of burghers who call on
her husband.President and Madame Kruger have had sixteen children, seven of whom
still live.One of his sons is the President's private secretary, and a
youth of decidedly modern ideas and tendencies.Another son is a
private in the Pretoria police, a state military organization in which
he takes great pride.A third occupies his father's farm near
Rustenberg.The other children are daughters, who are married to Boer
farmers and business men.One of Kruger's sons-in-law is Captain F. C.
Eloff, who was taken prisoner by the Uitlanders during the raid, and who
has since aroused the enmity of the English residents by freely
expressing his opinion of them in public speeches.Captain Eloff is
several times a millionaire, and lives in a
two-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar mansion.Popular report in Pretoria has it that the President's wealth amounts to
a million dollars, but his mode of living certainly does not betray it.His salary as President is thirty-five thousand dollars, in addition to
which he is annually allowed fifteen hundred dollars for house-rent, or
"huishuur."He has long since purchased the house in which he lives,
but, as the allowance of fifteen hundred dollars is annually paid to
him, the English residents aver that the amount is intended as a slight
reimbursement to him for the money he spends for the coffee and tobacco
used by the burgher callers at his cottage.During the later years of
his life Barney Barnato, the wizard of South African finance, supplied
to the President all the tobacco he used, and consequently Mr.Kruger
was able to save the Government tobacco allowance.Kruger two handsome marble statues of lions which now
adorn the lawn of the presidential residence.A photograph which is
greatly admired by the patriotic Boers represents Mr.Kruger
appropriately resting his hand on the head of one of the recumbent lions
in a manner which to them suggests the physical superiority of the Boers
over the British.Kruger has always been a man of deep and earnest religious
convictions.In his youth he was taught the virtues of a Christian
life, and it is not recorded that he ever did anything which was
inconsistent with his training.An old Zulu headman who lives near the
Vaal River, in the Orange Free State, relates that Mr.Kruger yoked him
beside an ox in a transport wagon when the trekkers departed from Natal
in the early '40s, and compelled him to do the work of a beast; but he
has no good reason for declaring that his bondsman was Mr.Kruger rather
than any one of the other Boers in the party.Kruger was about thirty-five years old his religious enthusiasm
led him into an experience which almost resulted in his death.He had
met with some reverses, which caused him to doubt the genuineness of
religious assistance.He endeavoured to find comfort and consolation in
his Bible, but failed, and he became sorely troubled.One night, after
bidding farewell to his wife, he disappeared into the wilderness of the
Magalies Hills, a short distance west of Pretoria.After he had been
absent from his home for several days, a number of men went to the hills
to search for him, and found him on his knees engaged in singing and
praying.He had been so many days without food and water that he was
too weak to rise from the ground, and it was necessary for the men to
carry him to his home.Since that experience he has believed himself to
be a special instrument of a divine power, and by his deeds has given
the impression that he is a leader chosen to defend the liberties and
homes of his people.He never speaks of his experience in the hills, but those who have been
his friends for many years say that it marked an epoch in his life.The
Boers, who have none of the modern cynicism and scepticism, regard him
as the wielder of divine power, while those who admire nothing which he
is capable of doing scoff and jeer at him as a religious fanatic, and
even call him a hypocrite.Kruger in his
daily habits, or has heard him in the pulpit of the church opposite the
cottage where he lives, will bear witness to the intensity and
earnestness of his genuine religious feeling.The lessons of life which
he draws from his own personal experiences, and expounds to his
congregation with no little degree of earnestness, are of such a
character as to remove all doubts which the mind may have concerning his
purity of purpose.Kruger's style of writing is unique, but thoroughly characteristic
of himself.The many references to the Deity, the oftentimes pompous
style, the words which breathe of the intense interest in and loyalty to
his countrymen, all combine to make his state communications and
proclamations most interesting reading.The following proclamation, made
to the citizens of Johannesburg several days after the Jameson raid, is
typical:


                "_To all the Residents of Johannesburg_."I, S. J. P. Kruger, State President of the South African Republic, with
the advice and consent of the Executive Council, by virtue of Article VI
of the Minutes of the Council, dated January 10, 1896, do hereby make
known to all the residents of Johannesburg and neighbourhood that I am
inexpressibly thankful to God that the despicable and treacherous
incursion into my country has been prevented, and the independence of
the republic saved, through the courage and bravery of my burghers."The persons who have been guilty of this crime must naturally be
punished according to law--that is to say, they must stand their trial
before the high court and a jury--but there are thousands who have been
misled and deceived, and it has clearly appeared to me that even among
the so-called leaders of the movement there are many who have been
deceived."A small number of intriguers in and outside of the country ingeniously
incited a number of the residents of Johannesburg and surroundings to
struggle, under the guise of standing up for political rights, and day
by day, as it were, urged them on; and when in their stupidity they
thought that the moment had arrived, they (the intriguers) caused one
Dr.Jameson to cross the boundary of the republic."Did they ever ask themselves to what they were exposing you?"I shudder when I think what bloodshed could have resulted had a
merciful Providence not saved you and my burghers."I will not refer to the financial damage.Work together with the
Government of this republic, and strengthen their hands to make this
country a land wherein people of all nationalities may reside in common
brotherhood."For months and months I have planned what changes and reforms could
have been considered desirable in the Government and the state, but the
loathsome agitation, especially of the press, has restrained me."The same men who have publicly come forward as leaders have demanded
reforms from me, and in a tone and a manner which they would not have
ventured to have done in their own country, owing to fear for the
criminal law.For that cause it was made impossible for me and my
burghers, the founders of this republic, to take their preposterous
proposals in consideration."It is my intention to submit a draft law at the first ordinary session
of the Raad, whereby a municipality, with a mayor at the head, would be
granted to Johannesburg, to whom the control of the city will be
intrusted.According to all constitutional principles, the Municipal
Board will be elected by the people of the town."I earnestly request you, laying your hands on your hearts, to answer me
this question: After what has happened, can and may I submit this to the
representatives of the people?My reply is, I know there are thousands
in Johannesburg and the suburbs to whom I can intrust such elective
powers.Inhabitants of Johannesburg, render it possible for the
Government to go before the Volksraad with the motto, 'Forgotten and
Forgiven.'"Kruger's political platform is based on one of the paragraphs of a
manifesto which he, as Vice-President of the Triumvirate, sent to Sir
Owen Lanyon, the British Resident Commissioner, on Dingaan's Day, 1880,
when the Boers were engaged in their second struggle for independence.The paragraph, which was apparently written by Mr.Kruger, reads:


"We declare before God, who knows the heart, and before the world: Any
one speaking of us as rebels is a slanderer!The people of the South
African Republic have never been subjects of Her Majesty, and never will
be."The President's hatred of the English was bred in the bone, and it will
never be eradicated.To see his country free from every English tie is
the aim of his existence, and every act of his political career has been
born with that thought.His own political aggrandizement has always
been a secondary thought.He himself has declared that there is no one
in the republic who is able or willing to complete the independence of
the republic with such little friction as he, and that, such being the
case, he would be a traitor to desert the cause in the hours of its
gravest peril.He considers personal victories at the polls of his own
country as mere stepping-stones toward that greater victory which he
hopes to secure over the English colonial secretary, and the day that
England renounces all claim to suzerainty over the Transvaal Mr.Kruger
will consider his duty done, and will go into the retirement which his
great work and the fulness of his years owe him.For a man whose education has been of the scantiest, and whose people
were practically unheard of until he brought them into prominence, Paul
Kruger has received from foreign sources many remarkable tributes to the
wisdom with which he has conducted the affairs of the country under
circumstances of more than ordinary difficulty.That which he received from Emperor William, of Germany, several days
after the repulse of the Jameson raiders, was perhaps the finest tribute
that Mr.Kruger has ever received, and one that created a greater
sensation throughout the world than any peaceful message that ever
passed between the heads of two governments.The cablegram, of which
the text follows, is one of the most priceless treasures in Mr.Kruger's
collection:


"_Received January 3d, 1896_."_From Wilhelm I. R., Berlin_."_To_ PRESIDENT KRUGER, _Pretoria_."I tender you my sincere congratulations that, without appealing to the
help of friendly powers, you and your people have been successful in
opposing with your own forces the armed bands that have broken into your
country to disturb the peace, in restoring order, and in maintaining the
independence of your country against attacks from without.Prince Bismarck declared that Kruger was the greatest natural-born
statesman of the time.William E. Gladstone, who had many opportunities
to gauge Kruger's skill in diplomacy, referred to him as the shrewdest
politician on the continent of Africa, and not a mean competitor of
those of Europe.Among the titles which have been bestowed upon him by
European rulers are Knight of the First Class of the Red Eagle of
Prussia, Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, Grand Knight of the
Leopold Order of Belgium, Grand Knight of the Netherland Lion, and Grand
Knight of the Portuguese Order of Distinguished Foreigners.Kruger's life could be obtained from his
own lips, it would compare favourably with those of the notable
characters of modern times.The victories he has gained in the field of
diplomacy may not have affected as many people as those of Bismarck; the
defeats administered in battle may not have been as crushing as those of
Napoleon, but to his weakling country they were equally as decisive and
valuable.The great pyramid in the valley of the Nile is seen to best advantage as
far away as Cairo.Observed close at hand, it serves only to disturb the
spectator's mind with an indefinable sense of vastness, crudity, and
weight; from a distance the relative proportions of all things are
clearly discerned.Historic
perspective is necessary to determine the value of the man to the
country.Fifty or a hundred years hence, when the Transvaal has safely
emerged from its period of danger, there will be a true sense of
proportion, so that his labours in behalf of his country may be judged
aright.At this time the critical faculty is lacking because his life work is
not ended, and its entire success is not assured.He has earned for
himself, however, the distinction of being the greatest diplomatist that
South Africa has ever produced.Whether the fruits of his diplomacy
will avail to keep his country intact is a question that will find its
answer in the results of future years.He has succeeded in doing that
which no man has ever done.As the head of the earth's weakest nation
he has for more than a decade defied its strongest power to take his
country from him.CHAPTER VI

                    INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT KRUGER


As is the rule with them everywhere, Englishmen in South Africa speak of
Mr.Unprejudiced Americans and other
foreigners in South Africa admire him for his patriotism, his courage in
opposing the dictatorial policy of England's Colonial Office, and his
efforts to establish a republic as nearly like that of the United States
of America as possible.Kruger was almost
obliterated a week after my arrival in the country by the words of
condemnation which were heaped upon him by Englishmen whenever his name
was mentioned.In nearly every Englishman's mind the name of "Oom Paul"
was a synonym for all that was corrupt and vile; few gave him a word of
commendation.When I came into the pretty little town of Pretoria, the capital of the
Transvaal, where the President lives and where he mingles daily with the
populace with as much freedom and informality as a country squire, there
was a rapid transformation in my opinion of the man.The Boers worship
their leader; to them he is a second George Washington, and even a few
Englishmen there speak with admiration of him.The day before my arrival in the town John McCann, of Johannesburg, who
is a former New-Yorker and a friend of the President, informed Mr.Kruger of my intention to visit Pretoria.The President had refused
interviews to three representatives of influential London newspapers who
had been in the town three months waiting for the opportunity, but he
expressed a desire to see an American."The Americans won't lie about me," he said to Mr."I want
America to learn our side of the story from me.They have had only the
English point of view."I had scarcely reached my hotel when an
emissary from the President called and made an appointment for me to
meet him in the afternoon.The emissary conducted me to the Government
Building, where the Volksraad was in session, and it required only a
short time for it to become known that a representative from the great
sister republic across the Atlantic desired to learn the truth about the
Boers.Cabinet members, Raad members, the
Commissioner of War, the Postmaster General, the most honoured and
influential men of the republic--men who had more than once risked their
lives in fighting for their country's preservation--gathered around me
and were so eager to have me tell America of the wrongs they had
suffered at the hands of the British that the scene was highly pathetic.One after another spoke of the severe trials through which their young
republic had passed, the efforts that had been made to disrupt it, and
the constant harassment to which they had been subjected by enemies
working under the cloak of friendship.The majority spoke English, but
such as knew only the Boer taal were given an opportunity by their more
fortunate friends to add to the testimony, and spoke through an
interpreter.Such earnest, such honest conversation it had never been
my lot to hear before.It was a memorable hour that I spent listening
to the plaints of those plain, good-hearted Boers in the heart of South
Africa.It was the voice of the downtrodden, the weak crying out
against the strong.When the hour of my appointment with the President arrived there was a
unanimous desire among the Boers gathered around to accompany me.It
was finally decided by them that six would be a sufficient number, and
among those chosen were Postmaster-General Van Alpen, who was a
representative at the Postal Congress in Washington several years ago;
Commissioner of Mines P. Kroebler, Commissioner of War J. J. Smidt,
Justice of the Peace Dillingham, and former Commandant-General Stephanne
Schoeman.When our party reached the little white-washed cottage in which the
President lives a score or more of tall and soil-stained farmers were
standing in a circular group on the low piazza.They were laughing
hilariously at something that had been said by a shorter, fat man who
was nearly hidden from view by the surrounding circle of patriarchs.A
breach in the circle disclosed the President of the republic with his
left arm on the shoulder of a long-whiskered Boer, and his right hand
swinging lightly in the hand of another of his countrymen.It was
democracy in its highest exemplification.Catching a glimpse of us as we were entering on the lawn, the President
hastily withdrew into the cottage.The Boers he deserted seated
themselves on benches and chairs on the piazza, relighted their pipes,
and puffed contentedly, without paying more attention to us than to nod
to several of my companions as we passed them.The front door of the cottage, or "White House," as they call it, was
wide open.There was no flunkey in livery to take our cards, no
white-aproned servant girls to tra-la-la our names.The executive
mansion of the President was as free and open to visitors as the
farmhouse of the humblest burgher of the republic.In their efforts to
display their qualities of politeness my companions urged me into the
President's private reception room, while they lingered for a short time
at the threshold.The President rose from his chair in the opposite
end, met me in the centre of the room, and had grasped my hand before my
companions had an opportunity of going through the process of an
introduction.There was less formality and red tape in meeting "Oom Paul" than would
be required to have a word with Queen Victoria's butcher or President
McKinley's office-boy.Kruger's small fat hand was holding mine in its grasp and
shaking it vehemently, he spoke something in Boer, to which I replied,
"Heel goed, danke," meaning "Very well, I thank you."Some one had told
me that he would first ask concerning my health, and also gave me the
formula for an answer.The President laughed heartily at my reply, and
made a remark in Boer "taal."The interpreter came up in the meantime
and straightened out the tangle by telling me that the President's first
question had been "Have you any English blood in your veins?"The President, still laughing at my reply, seated himself in a big
armchair at the head of a table on which was a heavy pipe and a large
tobacco box.He filled the pipe, lighted the tobacco, and blew great
clouds of smoke toward the ceiling.My companions took turns in filling
their pipes from the President's tobacco box, and in a few minutes the
smoke was so dense as nearly to obscure my view of the persons in front
of me.The President crossed his short, thin legs and blew quick, spirited
puffs of smoke while an interpreter translated to him my expression of
the admiration which the American people had for him, and how well known
the title "Oom Paul" was in America.This delighted the old man
immeasurably.His big, fat body seemed to resolve itself into waves
which started in his shoes and gradually worked upward until the fat
rings under his eyes hid the little black orbits from view.Then he
slapped his knees with his hands, opened his large mouth, and roared
with laughter.It was almost a minute before he regained his composure sufficiently to
take another puff at the pipe which is his constant companion.During
the old man's fit of laughter one of my companions nudged me and advised
me: "Now ask him anything you wish.He is in better humour than I have
ever seen him before."The President checked a second outburst of
laughter rather suddenly and asked, "Are you a friend of Cecil Rhodes?"If there is any one whom "Oom Paul" detests it is the great colonizer.The President invariably asks this question of strangers, and if the
answer is an affirmative one he refuses to continue the conversation.Being assured that such was not the case, Mr.Kruger's mind appeared to
be greatly relieved--as he is very suspicious of all strangers--and he
asked another question which is indicative of the religious side of his
nature: "To what Church do you belong?"A speaking acquaintanceship was
claimed with the Dutch Reformed Church, of which the President is a most
devout member, and this served to dissipate all suspicions he might have
had concerning me.The interpreter was repeating a question to him when the President
suddenly interrupted, as is frequently his custom during a conversation,
and asked: "Do the American people know the history of our people?I
will tell you truthfully and briefly.You have heard the English
version always; now I will give you ours."The President proceeded slowly and, between puffs at his great pipe,
spoke determinedly: "When I was a child we were so maltreated by the
English in Cape Colony that we could no longer bear the abuses to which
we were subjected.In 1835 we migrated northward with our cattle and
possessions and settled in Natal, just south of Zululand, where by
unavoidable fighting we acquired territory from the Zulus.We had
hardly settled that country and established ourselves and a local form
of government when our old enemies followed, and by various high-handed
methods made life so unendurable that we were again compelled to move
our families and possessions.This time we travelled five hundred miles
inland over the trackless veldt and across the Vaal River, and after
many hardships and trials settled in the Transvaal.The country was so
poor, so uninviting, that the English colonists did not think it worth
their while to settle in the land which we had chosen for our
abiding-place."Our people increased in number, and, as the years passed, established a
form of government such as yours in America.The British thought they
were better able to govern us than we were ourselves, and once took our
country from us.Their defeats at Laing's Nek and Majuba Hill taught
them that we were fighters, and they gave us our independence and
allowed us to live peaceably for a number of years.They did not think
the country valuable enough to warrant the repetition of the fighting
for it.When it became known all over the world twelve years ago that
the most extensive gold fields on the globe had been discovered in our
apparently worthless country, England became envious and laid plans to
annex such a valuable prize.Thousands of people were attracted hither
by our wonderful gold mines at Johannesburg, and the English statesmen
renewed their attacks on us.They made all sorts of pretexts to rob us
of our country, and when they could not do it in a way that was honest
and would be commended by other nations, they planned the Jameson raid,
which was merely a bold attempt to steal our country."At this point Kruger paused for a moment and then added, "You Americans
know how well they succeeded."This sally amused him and my companions
hugely, and they all joined in hearty laughter.The President declared that England's attitude toward them had changed
completely since the discovery of the gold fields."Up to that time we
had been living in harmony with every one.We always tried to be
peaceable and to prevent strife between our neighbours, but we have been
continually harassed since the natural wealth of our land has been
uncovered."Here he relighted his pipe, which had grown cold while he was detailing
the history of the Transvaal Boers, and then drew a parable, which is
one of his distinguishing traits: "The gold fields may be compared to a
pretty girl who is young and wealthy.You all admire her and want her
to be yours, but when she rejects you your anger rises and you want to
destroy her."By implication England is the rejected suitor, and the
Transvaal the rich young girl.Comparing the Boers' conduct in South Africa with that of the English,
the President said: "Ever since we left Cape Colony in 1835 we have not
taken any territory from the natives by conquest except that of one
chief whose murderous maraudings compelled us to drive him away from his
country.We bartered and bought every inch of land we now have, England
has taken all the land she has in South Africa at the muzzles of
repeating rifles and machine guns.That is the civilized method of
extending the bounds of the empire they talk about so much."The Englishmen's plaint is that the republic will tax them, but allow
them no representation in the affairs of government.The President
explained his side in this manner: "Every man, be he Englishman,
Chinaman, or Eskimo, can become a naturalized citizen of our country and
have all the privileges of a burgher in nine years.If we should have a
war, a foreigner can become a citizen in a minute if he will fight with
our army.The difficulty with the Englishmen here is that they want to
be burghers and at the same time retain their English citizenship."A man can not serve two masters; either he will hate the one and love
the other, or hold to the one and despise the other.We have a law for
bigamy in our country, and it is necessary to dispose of an old love
before it is possible to marry a new.""Oom Paul" is very bitter in his feeling against the English, whom he
calls his natural enemies, but it is seldom that he says anything
against them except in private to his most intimate friends.The
present great distress in the Johannesburg gold fields is attributed by
the English residents to the high protective duties imposed by the
Government and the high freight charges for the transmission of
machinery and coal.Kruger explained that those taxes were less
than in the other colonies in the country."We are high protectionists because ours is a young country.These new
mines have cost the Government great amounts of money, and it is
necessary for us to raise as much as we expend.They want us to give
them everything gratuitously, so that we may become bankrupt and they
can take our country for the debt.If they don't like our laws, why
don't they stay away?"Nowhere in the world is the American Republic admired as much outside of
its own territory as in South Africa.Both the Transvaal and the Orange
Free State Constitutions are patterned after that of the United States,
and there is a desire lurking in the breasts of thousands of South
Africans to convert the whole of the country south of the Zambezi into
one grand United States of South Africa.Sir Alfred Milner, the Queen's Commissioner to South Africa, said to me
several days before I saw Mr.Kruger that such a thing might come to
pass within the next twenty years.The President hesitated when I asked
him if he favoured such a proposition to unite all the colonies and
republics in the country."If I should say 'Yes,' the English would
declare war on us to-morrow."He appeared to be very cautious on this
subject for a few minutes, but after a consultation with my companions
he spoke more freely."We admire your Government very much," he said, "and think there is none
better in the world.At the present time there are so many conflicting
affairs in this country as to make the discussion of an amalgamation
inadvisable.A republic formed on the principle of the United States
would be most advantageous to all concerned, but South Africa is not yet
ripe for such a government.According to those around him, the President had not been in such a
talkative mood for a long time, and, acting upon that information, I
asked him to tell me concerning the Boers' ability to defend themselves
in case of war with England.Many successes against British arms have
caused the Boers to regard their prowess very highly, and they generally
speak of themselves as well able to protect their country.The two
countries have been on the very verge of war several times during the
last three years, and it was only through the greatest diplomacy that
the thousands of English soldiers were not sent over the border of the
Transvaal, near which they have been stationed ever since the memorable
raid of Jameson's troopers.The President's reply was guarded: "The English say they can starve us
out of our country by placing barriers of soldiers along the borders.Starve us they can, if it is the will of God that such should be our
fate.If God is on our side they can build a big wall around us and we
can still live and flourish.My wish is to live in
peace with everybody."It was evident that the subject was not pleasant to him, and he
requested me to ask Commissioner of War Smidt, a war-scarred hero of
Majuba Hill, to speak to me on the ability of the Boers to take care of
themselves in case of a conflict.Commissioner Smidt became very enthusiastic as he progressed with the
expression of his opinion, and the President frequently nodded assent to
what the head of the War Department said."It is contrary to our national feeling to engage in war," said Mr.Smidt, "and we will do all in our power to avert strife.If, however,
we are forced into fighting, we must defend ourselves as best we are
able.There is not one Boer in the Transvaal who will not fight until
death for his country.We have demonstrated our ability several times,
and we shall try to retain our reputation.The English must fight us in
our own country, where we know every rock, every valley, and every hill.They fight at a disadvantage in a country which they do not know and in
a climate to which they are strangers."The Boers are born sharpshooters, and from infancy are taught to put a
bullet in a buzzard's skull at a hundred yards.One Boer is equal in a
war in our own country to five Englishmen, and that has been proved a
number of times.We have rugged constitutions, are accustomed to an
outdoor life, and can live on a piece of biltong for days, while the
Queen's soldiers have none of these advantages.They can not starve us
out in fifty years, for we have sources of provender of which they can
not deprive us.We have fortifications around Pretoria that make it an
impossibility for any army of less than fifty thousand men to take, and
the ammunition we have on hand is sufficient for a three years' war.We
are not afraid of the English in Africa, and not until every Boer in the
Transvaal is killed will we stop fighting if they ever begin.Should war
come, and I pray that it will not, the Boers will march through English
territory to the Cape of Good Hope, or be erased from the face of the
earth."Never was a man more sincere in his statements than the commissioner,
and his companions supported his every sentence by look and gesture.Even the President gave silent approval to the sentiments expressed."Have you ever had any intention of securing Delagoa Bay from the
Portuguese, in order that you might have a seacoast, as has been
rumoured many times?"Delagoa Bay, the finest
harbour in Africa, is within a few miles of the Transvaal, and might be
of great service to it in the event of war."'Cursed be he who removes the landmarks of his neighbour,'" quoted he."I never want to do anything that would bring the vengeance of God on
me.We want our country, nothing more, nothing less."Asked to give an explanation of the causes of the troubles between
England and the Transvaal, he said:

"Mr.Rhodes is the cause of all the troubles between our country and
England.He desires to form all the country south of the Zambezi River
into a United States of South Africa, and before he can do this he must
have possession of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.His aim in
life is to be President of the United States of South Africa.He
initiated the Jameson raid, and he has stirred up the spirit of
discontent which is being shown by the Englishmen in the Transvaal.Our
Government endeavours to treat every one with like favour, but these
Englishmen are never satisfied with anything we do.They want the
English flag to wave over the Transvaal territory, and nothing less.Rhodes spent millions of pounds in efforts to steal our country, and
will probably spend millions more.But we will never leave this land,
which we found, settled, and protected."Then, rising from his chair and raising his voice, he continued slowly
and deliberately:

"We will fight until not one Boer remains to defend our flag and
country; our women and children will fight for their liberties; and even
I, an old man, will take the gun which I have used against them twice
before and use it again to defend the country I love.But I hope there
will be no war.I want none and the Boers want none.If war comes, we
shall not be to blame.I have done all in my power for peace, and have
taken many insults from Englishmen merely that my people might not be
plunged into war.I hope that I may spend the rest of
my days in peace."The President's carriage had arrived in front of the cottage to convey
him to the Government Building, and the time had arrived for him to
appear before one of the Volksraads.He displayed no eagerness to end
the interview, and continued it by asking me to describe the personality
and ability of President McKinley.He expressed his admiration of
former President Cleveland, with whose Department of State he had some
dealings while John Hays Hammond was confined in the Pretoria prison for
complicity in the Jameson raid.His opinion of the Americans in South Africa was characteristic of the
man.They are a magnificent people,
because they favour justice.When those in our country are untainted
with English ideas I trust them implicitly, but there were a number of
them here in Jameson's time who were Americans in name only."He hesitated to send any message to the sister republic in America, lest
his English enemies might construe it to mean that he curried America's
favour.His friends finally persuaded him to make a statement, and he
dictated this expression of good fellowship and respect:

"So long as the different sections of the United States live in peace
and harmony, so long will they be happy and prosperous.My wish is that
the great republic in America may become the greatest nation on earth,
and that she may continue to act as the great peace nation.I wish that
prosperity may be hers and her people's, and in my daily prayers I ask
that God may protect her and bless her bounteously."It being far past the time for his appearance at the Government
Building, the President ended the interview abruptly.He refilled his
pipe, bade farewell to us, and bustled from the room with all the vigour
of a young man.On the piazza, he met his little, silver-haired wife,
who, with a half-knit stocking pendant from her fingers, was conversing
with the countrymen sitting on the benches.The President bent down and
kissed her affectionately, then jumped into the carriage and was rapidly
conveyed to the Government Building.When the dust obscured the
carriage and the cavalrymen attending it, one of my companions turned to
me and remarked:

"Ah!CHAPTER VII

                           CECIL JOHN RHODES


Sixteen years ago Cecil J. Rhodes, then a man of small means and no
political record, stood in a small Kimberley shop and looked for a long
time at a map of Africa which hung on the wall.An acquaintance who had
watched him for several minutes stepped up to Rhodes and asked whether
he was attempting to find the location of Kimberley.Rhodes made no
reply for several seconds, then placed his right hand over the map, and
covered a large part of South and Central Africa from the Atlantic to
the Indian Ocean.Cecil J. Rhodes on the piazza of his
residence, Groote Schuur, at Rondebosch, near Cape Town.]"I will give you ten years to realize it," replied the friend."Give me ten more," said Rhodes, "and then we'll have a new map."Three fourths of the required time has elapsed, and the full realization
of Rhodes's dream must take place within the next four years.There
remain only two small spaces on that part of the map which was covered
by Rhodes's hand that are not British, and those are the Orange Free
State and the South African Republic.Rhodes's success will come
hand-in-hand with the death of the two republics.The life of the
republics hinges on his failure, and good fortune has rarely deserted
him.Twenty-seven years ago Cecil Rhodes, then a tall, thin college lad, was
directed by his physician to go to South Africa if he wished to live
more than three years.He and his brother Herbert, the sons of the poor
rector of Bishop Stortford, sailed for Durban, Natal, and reached that
port while the diamond fever was at its height at Kimberley.The two
boys, each less than nineteen years old, joined a party of adventurers
and prospectors, and, after many vicissitudes, reached the Kimberley
fields safely, but with little or no money.The boys were energetic,
and found opportunities for making money where others could see none.The camp was composed of the roughest characters in South Africa, all of
whom had flocked thither when the discovery of diamonds was first
announced.Illicit diamond buying was the easiest path to wealth, and
was travelled by almost every millionaire whose name has been connected
with recent South African affairs.Rhodes is one of the few
exceptions, and even his enemies corroborate the statement."You don't steal diamonds," said Barney Barnato to Mr.Rhodes fifteen
years ago, "but you must prove it when accused.I steal them, but my
enemies must prove it.The youthful Rhodes engaged in many legitimate schemes for making money,
and saved almost all that he secured.For a short time he pumped water
out of mines, using an abandoned engine for the purpose, and then
embarked in commercial enterprises.After spending two or three years
in the fields, he returned to England and resumed his course at Oxford.In connection with this visit to England, Mr.Rhodes relates the story
of the meeting with the physician who several years before had placed
the limit of his existence at three years.asked the discomfited doctor when he saw the
healthy young man."According to my books, you have been in your grave
some time.Here is the entry: 'Tuberculosis; recovery impossible.'You
can't be the same Rhodes, sir.At the end of each term at Oxford Mr.Rhodes returned to Kimberley, and,
by judiciously investing his savings in mining claims, soon became a
power in the affairs of the diamond fields.When the diamond fever was
followed by the usual reaction, and evil days fell upon the industry,
Mr.Rhodes secured all the shares, claims, and lands that his thousands
would buy.Then he conceived the idea of making a monopoly of the
diamond industry by consolidating all the mines and limiting the output.Lacking the money wherewith to buy the valuable properties necessary for
his plans, he went to the Rothschilds and asked for financial
assistance.The scheme was extraordinary, and required such a large
amount of money that the request, coming from such a young man as Mr.Rhodes was then, staggered the Rothschilds, and they asked him to call
several days later for an answer."I will
come again in an hour for your answer.If you have not decided by that
time, I shall seek assistance elsewhere."Rhodes back to Africa with the necessary amount
of money to purchase the other claims and property in the Kimberley
district, and, after he had formed the great De Beers Company, appointed
him managing director for life at a salary of one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars a year.Rhodes's management the De Beers
consolidated mines have been earning annual dividends of almost fifty
per cent., and more than four hundred million dollars' worth of diamonds
have been placed on the market.With the exception of the Suez Canal,
the mines are the best paying property in the world, and much of their
success is due to the personal efforts of Mr.It was while he was engineering the consolidation of the diamond mines
that Mr.He realized that his
political success was founded on personal popularity, and more firmly so
in a new country, where the political elements were of such a
diversified character as are usually present in a mining community.In
the early days of the Kimberley fields the extent of a man's popularity
depended upon the amount of money he spent in wining those around him.Rhodes was astute enough to appreciate the secret of popularity,
and, having gained it, allowed himself to be named as candidate for the
Cape Colony Parliament from the Kimberley district.By carefully currying the favour of the Dutch inhabitants, who were not
on the friendliest political terms with the English colonists, he was
elected.Rhodes's political star was in the ascendant,
and he was elected successively to the highest office in the colony's
government.At the age of twenty-eight he was Treasurer-General of Cape Colony, and
it was while he filled that office that Chinese Gordon appeared at the
Cape and appealed to Mr.Rhodes to join the expedition to Khartoum.Rhodes was undecided whether to resign the treasurer-generalship and
accompany Gordon or to remain in South Africa, but finally determined to
stay in the colony.Gordon, who had taken a great fancy to the young
and energetic colonist, was sorely disappointed, and went to Khartoum,
where he was killed.During the years he held minor Government offices Mr.Rhodes formed the
alliances which were the foundation of his later political success.He
was a friend at the same time of the Englishman, the Afrikander, the
Dutchman, and the Boer, and he was always in a position where he could
reciprocate the favours of one class without incurring the enmity of
another.He worked with the Dutchmen when protection was the political
cry, and with the Englishmen when subjects dear to them were in the
foreground.He never abused his opponents in political arguments, as
the majority of Cape politicians do, but he pleaded with them on the
veldt and at their firesides.When he was unable to swerve a man's opinions by words, he has
frequently been charged with having applied the more seductive method of
using money.Rhodes is said to be a firm believer in money as a
force superior to all others, and he does not hesitate to acknowledge
his belief that every man's opinions can be shaped by the application of
a necessary amount of money.This belief he formed in the early days of
the diamond fields, and it has remained with him ever since."Find the man's price" was Mr.Rhodes's formula for success before he
reached the age of thirty, and his political enemies declare it has
given him the power he desired.In a country which had such a large
roving and reckless population as South Africa it was not difficult for
a politician with a motto similar to that of Mr.Rhodes's to become
influential at election periods, nor did it require many years to
establish a party that would support him on whatever grounds he chose to
take.Rhodes commenced his higher
political career in Cape Colony.When, in 1884, he became Commissioner
of Bechuanaland, the vast and then undeveloped country adjoining the
colony on the north, and made his first plans for the annexation of that
territory to the British Empire, he received the support of the majority
of the voters of the colony.His first plan of securing control of the
territory was not favourably received by the Colonial Office in London,
and no sooner was it pronounced visionary than he suggested another more
feasible.Bechuanaland was then ruled by a mighty native chief, Lobengula, whose
vast armies roved over the country and prevented white travellers and
prospectors from crossing the bounds of his territory.In the minds of
the white people of South Africa, Bechuanaland figured as a veritable
Golconda--a land where precious stones and minerals could be secured
without any attendant labour, where the soil was so rich as to yield
four bounteous harvests every year.Rhodes determined to break the barriers which excluded white men
from the native chief's domain, and sent three agents to treat with
Lobengula.The agents made many valuable presents to the old chief, and
in 1888, after much engineering, secured from him an exclusive
concession to search for and extract minerals in Bechuanaland.The
payment for the concession included five hundred dollars a month, a
thousand rifles and ammunition, and a small gunboat on the Zambezi.Rhodes discovered the real value of the concession, he and a
number of his friends formed the British South Africa Company, popularly
known as the Chartered Company, and received a charter from the British
Government, which gave to them the exclusive right of governing,
developing, and trading in Lobengula's country.Several years afterward
the white man's government became irksome to Lobengula and his tribes,
as well as to the Mashonas, who occupied the immense territory adjoining
Bechuanaland on the east, and all rebelled.The result was not unlike
those of native rebellions in other countries.The natives were shot
down by trained English soldiers, their country was taken from them, and
those who escaped death or captivity were compelled to fly for safety to
the new countries of the north.The British South Africa Company in 1895 practically became the sole
owner of Rhodesia, the great territory taken from Lobengula and the
Mashonas; and Mr.Rhodes, having realized part of his dream, began
casting about for other opportunities whereby he might extend the
empire.Rhodes was then in the zenith of his glory.He was many times a
millionaire, the head of one of the greatest capitalistic enterprises in
the world, the director of the affairs of a dominion occupying one tenth
of a continent, and the Premier of Cape Colony.His power was almost
absolute over a territory that stretches from the Cape of Good Hope into
Central Africa, and then eastward to within a few miles of the Indian
Ocean.He had armies under his command, and two governments were at his
beck and call.He looked again at the map of Africa,
already greatly changed since he placed his hand over it in the
Kimberley shop, but the dream was not realized.He saw the Transvaal
and the Orange Free State flags still occupying the positions he had
marked for the British emblem, and he plotted for their acquisition.The strife between the Boers and the Uitlanders in the Transvaal was
then at its height, and Mr.Rhodes recognised the opportunity for the
intervention of England that it afforded.Rhodes did not consider it
of sufficient importance to inquire concerning the justice of the
Uitlanders' claims, nor did he express any sympathy for their cause.In
fact, if anything, he felt that if the Uitlanders were unjustly treated
by the Boers their remedy was simple.Once he blandly told a complaining
Uitlander that no Chinese wall surrounded the Transvaal, and that to
escape from the alleged injustice was comparatively easy.Rhodes the end was sufficient excuse for the means, and, if the
acquisition of the two republics carried with it the loss of his Boer
friends, he was willing to accept the situation.The fall of the
Transvaal Republic carried with it the subsequent fall of the Orange
Free State, and, in order that he might strike at the head, he
determined to commence his campaign of exterminating republics by first
attacking the Transvaal.Whether he had the promise of assistance from the Colonial Office in
London is a subject upon which even the principals differ.Rhodes
felt that his power in the country was great enough to make the attack
upon the Transvaal without assistance from the home Government, and the
plot of the Jameson raid was formed.He retired to Groote Schuur, his home at Cape Town, and awaited the
fruition of the plans he had so carefully made and explained.His
lieutenants might have been overhasty, or perhaps the Uitlanders in
Johannesburg might have feared the Boer guns too much; whatever the
reason, the plans miscarried, and Mr.Rhodes experienced the first and
greatest reverse in his brilliant public career.The dream which appeared so near realization one day was dissolved the
next, and with it the reputation of the dreamer.He was obliged to
resign the premiership of Cape Colony, many of his best and oldest
supporters in England deserted him, and he lost the respect and esteem
of the Dutch inhabitants of South Africa, who had always been among his
stanchest allies.The heroic Rhodes, the idol of Cape Colony, found
himself the object of attack and ridicule of the majority of the voters
of the colony.The parliamentary inquiry acquitted him of all
complicity in the Jameson raid, it is true, but the Dutch people of
South Africa never have and never will.The Jameson raid was a mere incident in Mr.Rhodes's career; he would
probably call it an accident.Having failed to overthrow the Transvaal
Republic by means of an armed revolution, he attempted to accomplish the
same object by means of a commercial revolution.Rhodesia, the new
country which had a short time previously been taken from the Matabeles
and the Mashonas, was proclaimed by Mr.Rhodes to be a paradise for
settlers and an Ophir for prospectors.He personally conducted the
campaign to rob the Transvaal of its inhabitants and its commerce; but
the golden promises, the magnificent farms, the Solomon's mines, the new
railways, and the new telegraph lines all failed to attract the coveted
prizes to the land which, after all, was found to be void of real merit
except as a hunting ground where the so-called British poor-house, the
army, might pot <DW64>s.Rhodes spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in developing the
country which bears his name, and the British South Africa Company added
thousands more, but the hand which was wont to turn into gold all that
it touched had lost its cunning.Rhodes's perplexities,
the natives who had been conquered by Dr.Jameson learned that their
conqueror had been taken prisoner by the Boers, and rose in another
rebellion against English authority.Rhodes and one of his sisters
journeyed alone into the enemy's stronghold and made terms with
Lobengula, whereby the revolution was practically ended.After the Rhodesian country had been pacified, and he had placed the
routine work of the campaign to secure settlers for the country in the
hands of his lieutenants, Mr.Rhodes bent all his energies toward the
completion of the transcontinental railway and telegraph lines which had
been started under his auspices several years before, but had been
allowed to lag on account of the pressure of weightier matters.The
Cape Town to Cairo railroad and telegraph are undertakings of such vast
proportions and importance that Mr.Rhodes's fame might easily have been
secured through them alone had he never been heard of in connection with
other great enterprises.He himself originated the plans by which the Mediterranean and Table Bay
will eventually be united by bands of steel and strands of copper, and
it is through his own personal efforts that the English financiers are
being induced to subscribe the money with which his plans are being
carried out.The marvellous faith which the English people have in Mr.Rhodes has been illustrated on several occasions when he was called to
London to meet storms of protests from shareholders, who feared that the
two great enterprises were gigantic fiascos.He has invariably returned
to South Africa with the renewed confidence of the timid ones and many
millions of additional capital.Rhodes has tasted of the power which is absolute, and he will brook
no earthly interference with his plans.The natives may destroy
hundreds of miles of the telegraph lines, as they have done on several
occasions.He teaches them a lesson by means of the quick-firing gun,
and rebuilds the line.White men may fear the deadly fever of Central
Africa, but princely salaries and life-insurance policies for a host of
relatives will always attract men to take the risk.Shareholders may
rebel at the expenditures, but Mr.Rhodes will indicate to them that
their other properties will be ruined if they withdraw their support
from the railway and telegraph.A strip of territory belonging to another nation may be an impediment to
the line, but an interview with the Emperor of Germany or the King of
Portugal will be all-sufficient for the accomplishment of Mr.Providence may swerve him in his purpose many times, but
nations and individuals rarely.Rhodes is the most remarkable
Englishman that ever figured in the history of the African continent.Some will go further and declare that he has done more for the British
Empire than any one man in history.No two South Africans will agree on
the methods by which Mr.Rhodes attained his position in the affairs of
the country.Some say that he owes his success to his great wealth;
others declare that his personal magnetism is responsible for all that
he ever attained.His enemies intimate that political chicanery is the
foundation of his progress, while his friends resent the intimation and
laud his sterling honesty as the basis of his successful career.No one has ever accused him of being the fortunate victim of
circumstances which carried him to the pre-eminent rank he occupies
among Englishmen, although such an opinion might readily be formed from
a personal study of the man.South Africa is the indolent man's
paradise, and of that garden of physical inactivity Mr.Rhodes, by
virtue of his pre-eminent qualifications, is king."Almost as lazy as
Rhodes" is a South Africanism that has caused lifelong enmities and
rivers of blood.He takes pride in his indolence, and declares that the man who performs
more labour than his physical needs demand is a fool.He says he never
makes a long speech because he is too lazy to expend the energy
necessary for its delivery.He declines to walk more than an eighth of
a mile unless it is impossible to secure a vehicle or native
hammock-bearers to convey him, and then he proceeds so slowly that his
progress is almost imperceptible.His indolence may be the result of
the same line of reasoning as that indulged in by the cautious man who
carries an umbrella when the sun shines, in which case every one who has
travelled in the tropics will agree that Mr.The only exercise he indulges in is an hour's canter on horseback in the
early morning, before the generous rays of the African sun appear.Notwithstanding his antipathy to physical exertion, Mr.Rhodes is a
great traveller, and is constantly moving from one place to another.One week may find him at Groote Schuur, his Cape Town residence, while
the following week he may be planning a new farm in far-away
Mashonaland.The third week may have him in the Portuguese possessions
on the east coast, and at the end of the month he may be back in Cape
Town, prepared for a voyage to England and a fortnight's stay in Paris.He will charter a bullock team or a steamship with like disregard of
expense in order that he may reach his destination at a specified time,
and in like manner he will be watchful of his comfort by causing houses
to be built in unfrequented territory which he may wish to investigate.So wealthy that he could almost double his fortune in the time it would
require to count it, Mr.Rhodes is a firm believer in the doctrine that
money was created for the purpose of being spent, and never hesitates to
put it into practice.He does not assist beggars, nor does he squander
sixpence in a year, but he will pay the expenses of a trip to Europe for
a man whom he wishes to reconcile, and will donate the value of a
thousand-acre farm to a tribe of natives which has pleased him by its
actions.His generosity is best illustrated by a story told by one of his most
intimate friends in Kimberley.Several years before Barney Barnato's
death, that not-too-honest speculator induced almost all of the
employees of the diamond mines to invest their savings in the stock of
the Pleiades gold mine in Johannesburg, which Barnato and his friends
were attempting to manipulate.The attempt was unsuccessful, and the
diamond miners lost all the money they had invested.Rhodes heard
of Barnato's deceit, and asked him to refund the money, but was laughed
at.Rhodes learned the total amount of the losses--about
twenty-five thousand dollars--and paid the money out of his own pocket.Although he has more financial patronage at his command than almost any
banking house in existence, Mr.Rhodes rarely has sufficient money in
his purse to buy lunch.His valet, a half-breed Malay named Tony, is
his banker, and from him he is continually borrowing money.It is
related that on a voyage to England he offered to make a wager of money,
but found that he had nothing less valuable than a handful of loose
rough diamonds in his trousers pocket.Rhodes is an eloquently silent man.He talks little, but his paucity
of words is no criterion of their weight.He can condense a chapter
into a word, and a book into a sentence.The man whose hobby is to run
an empire is almost as silent as the Sphinx in the land toward which
that empire is being elongated."I
want a railroad here," or "We want this mine," or "We must have this
strip of land," are common examples of his style of speech and the
expression of his dominant spirit.He has the faculty of leading people to believe that they want the exact
opposite of what they really want, and he does it in such a polished
manner that they give their consent before they realize what he has
asked them.His personal charm, which in itself is almost irresistible,
is fortified with a straight-forward, breezy heartiness, that carries
with it respect, admiration, confidence, and, finally, conviction.He
has argued and treated with persons ranging in intelligence and station
from a native chief to the most learned diplomats and rulers in the
world, and his experience has taught him that argument will win any
case.Lobengula called him "the brother who eats a whole country for his
dinner."To this title might be added "the debater who swallows up the
opposition in one breath."Rhodes never asks exactly what he wants.He will ask the shareholders of a company for ten million, when he
really needs only five million, but in that manner he is almost certain
of satisfying his needs.In the same way when he pleads with an
opponent he makes the demands so great that he can afford to yield half
and still attain his object.Rhodes demanded the
appointment of Prime Minister of the Colony, but he was satisfied with
the Commissionership of Crown Lands and Works, the real object of his
aim.Rhodes had cast his lines in America instead of South Africa, he
would be called a political boss.He would be the dominant factor of
one of the parties, and he would be able to secure delegates with as
much ease as he does in Cape Colony, where the population is less mixed
than in our country.His political lieutenants act with the same vigour
and on the same general lines as those in our country, and if a close
examination of their work could be made, many political tricks that the
American campaigner never heard of would probably be disclosed.One of the mildest accusations against him is that he paid fifty
thousand dollars for the support that first secured for him a seat in
the Cape Colony Parliament, but he has never considered it worth the
time to deny the report.His political success depends in no little
measure upon his personal acquaintanceship with the small men of his
party, and his method of treating them with as much consideration and
respect as those who have greater influence.He is in constant
communication with the leaders of the rural communities, and misses no
opportunity to show his appreciation of their support.Rhodes may
be kingly when he is among kings, but he is also a farmer among farmers,
and among the Cape Dutch and Boers such a metamorphosis is the necessary
stepping-stone to the hearts and votes of that numerous people.Rhodes among a party of farmers or transport
riders each one of whom has better clothing than the multimillionaire.Rhodes wore a hat which was so
shabby that it became the subject of newspaper importance.When he is in
Rhodesia he dons the oldest suit of clothing in his wardrobe, and
follows the habits of the pioneers who are settling the country.He
sleeps in a native kraal when he is not near a town, and eats of the
same canned beef and crackers that his Chartered Company serves to its
mounted police.When he is in that primeval country he despises
ostentation and displays in his honour, and will travel fifty miles on
horseback in an opposite direction in order to avoid a formal proceeding
of any nature.Two years ago, when the railroad to Buluwayo, the
capital of Rhodesia, was formally opened, Mr.Rhodes telegraphed his
regrets, and intimated that he was ill.As a matter of fact he
travelled night and day in order to escape to a place where telegrams
and messages could not reach him.When his host suggested that he was
missing many entertainments and the society of the most distinguished
men of South Africa, Mr.Rhodes smiled and said: "For that reason I
escaped."Formality bores him, and he would rather live a month coatless and
collarless in a native kraal with an old colony story-teller than spend
half an hour at a state dinner in the governor's mansion.It is related
in this connection that Mr.Rhodes was one of a distinguished party who
attended the opening of a railroad extension near Cape Town.While the
speeches were being made, and the chairman was trying to find him, Mr.Rhodes slipped quietly away, and was discovered discarding his clothing
preparatory to enjoying a bath in a near-by creek.Rhodes is unmarried, and throughout the country has the reputation
of being an avowed hater of women.He believes that a woman is an
impediment to a man's existence until he has attained the object and aim
of his life, and has become deserving of luxuries.He not only believes
in that himself, but takes advantage of every opportunity to impress the
belief upon the minds of those around him.In the summer of 1897 a
captain in the volunteer army, and one of his most faithful lieutenants
in Mashonaland, asked Mr.Rhodes for a three months' leave of absence to
go to Cape Colony.The captain had been through many native campaigns,
and richly deserved a vacation, although that was not the real object of
his request for leave.The man wanted to go to Cape Colony to marry,
and by severe cross-examination Mr.Rhodes learned that such was the
case."I can not let you go to Cape Colony; I want you to start for London
to-morrow.I'll cable instructions when you arrive there," said Mr.Rhodes, and the wedding was postponed.When the captain reached London,
a cablegram from Mr.Rhodes said simply, "Study London for three
months."Nowhere in South Africa is there anything more interesting than Groote
Schuur, the country residence of Mr.Rhodes, at Rondebosch, a suburb of
Cape Town.He has found time amid his momentous public duties to make
his estate the most magnificent on the continent of Africa.Besides a
mansion which is a relic of the first settlers of the peninsula, and now
a palace worthy of a king's occupancy, there is an estate which consists
of hundreds of acres of land overlooking both the Atlantic and Indian
Oceans, and under the walls of Table Mountain, the curio of a country.In addition to this, there are a zooelogical collection, which comprises
almost every specimen of African fauna that will thrive in captivity,
and hundreds of flowering trees and plants brought from great distances
to enrich the beauty of the landscape.The estate, which comprises almost twelve hundred acres, is situated
about five miles to the north of Cape Town, on the narrowest part of the
peninsula, through which the waters of the two oceans seem ever anxious
to rush and clasp hands.It lies along the northwestern base of Table
Mountain, and stretches down toward the waters of Table Bay and
northward toward the death-dealing desert known as the Great Karroo.From one of the shady streets winding toward Cape Town there stretches a
fine avenue of lofty pines and oaks to the mansion of Groote Schuur,
which, as its name indicates, was originally a granary, where two
hundred years ago the Dutch colonizers hoarded their stores of grain and
guarded them against the attacks of thieving natives.Although many changes have been made in the structure since it was
secured by Mr.Rhodes, it still preserves the quaint architectural
characteristics of Holland.The scrolled gables, moulded chimney pots,
and wide verandas, or "stoeps," are none the less indicative of the
tendencies of the old settlers than the Dutch cabinets, bureaus, and
other household furniture that still remains in the mansion from those
early days.The entire estate breathes of the old Dutch era.Everything has the
ancient setting, although not at the expense of modern convenience.While the buildings and grounds are arranged in the picturesque style of
Holland, the furnishings and comforts are the most modern that the
countries of Europe afford.The library contains, besides such classics
as a graduate of Oxford would have, one of the largest collections of
books and manuscripts bearing on Africa in existence.In the same room
is a museum of souvenirs connected with Mr.Rhodes's work of extending
English empire toward the heart of the continent.There are flags
captured in wars with the Portuguese, Union Jacks riddled with shot and
cut by assegai, and hundreds of curiosities gathered in Rhodesia after
the conquest of the natives.In this building have gathered for
conference the men who laid the foundations for all the great
enterprises of South Africa.There the Jameson raid was planned, it is
said, and there, the Boers say, the directors of the British South
Africa Chartered Company were drinking champagne while the forces of Dr.Jameson were engaged in mortal combat with those of Kruger near
Johannesburg.Surrounding the mansion are most beautiful gardens, such as can be found
only in semi-tropical climates.In the foreground of the view from the
back part of the house is a Dutch garden, rising in three terraces from
the marble-paved courtyard to a grassy knoll, fringed with tall pines,
and dotted here and there with graves of former dwellers at Groote
Schuur.Behind the pine fringe, but only at intervals obscured by it, is
the background of the picture--the bush-clad <DW72>s of Table Mountain
and the Devil's Peak, near enough for every detail of their strange
formations and innumerable attractions to be observed.Art and Nature
have joined hands everywhere to make lovely landscapes, in which the
colour effects are produced by hydrangeas, azaleas, and scores of other
flowers, growing in the utmost profusion.Besides the mimosa, palms,
firs, and other tropical trees that add beauty to the grounds, there is
a low tree which is found nowhere else on earth.Its leaves are like
the purest silver, and form a charming contrast to the deep green of the
firs and the vivid brightness of the flowers that are everywhere around.Undoubtedly, however, the most interesting feature of the estate is the
natural zooelogical garden.It is quite unique to have in this immense
park, with drives six miles in length and ornamentations brought
thousands of miles, wild animals of every variety wandering about with
as much freedom as if they were in their native haunts.In this
collection are represented every kind of African deer and antelope.Zebra, kangaroo, giraffe, emu, pheasant, and ostrich seem to be
perfectly contented with their adopted home, and have become so tame
that the presence of human beings has no terrors for them.Rhodes several million dollars to bring
to its present condition, sees but little of the former Premier of Cape
Colony.His vast enterprises in the diamond fields of Kimberley and in
the new country which bears his name require so much of his time that he
but seldom visits it.But his inability to enjoy the product of his
brain and labour does not cause the estate to be unappreciated, for he
has thrown this unique and charming pleasure resort open to the public,
and by them it is regarded as a national possession.CHAPTER VIII

                THE BOER GOVERNMENT--CIVIL AND MILITARY


The Constitution, or Grondwet, of the South African Republic is a
modified counterpart of that of the United States.It differs in some
salient features, but in its entirety it has the same general foundation
and the same objects.The executive head of the Government is the
President, who is elected for a term of five years.He directs the
policy of the Government, suggests the trend of the laws, and oversees
the conduct of the Executive Council, which constitutes the real
Government.The Executive Council consists of three heads of
departments and six unofficial members of the First Raad.These nine
officials are the authors of all laws, treaties, and policies that are
proposed to the Volksraads, which constitute the third part of the
Government.There are two Volksraads, one similar in purpose to our
Senate, and the other, the second Volksraad, not unlike our House of
Representatives, but with far less power.The first Volksraad consists of twenty-seven members elected from and by
the burghers, or voters, who were born in the country.A naturalized
burgher is ineligible to the upper House.The twenty-seven members of
the Second Raad are naturalized burghers, and are voted for only by men
who have received the franchise.The second House has control of the
management of the Government works, telephones, mails, and mines, and
has but little voice in the real government of the country.Its members
are undoubtedly more progressive and have more modern ideas than those
of the First Raad, and introduce many bills which would be of undoubted
benefit to the country, but the upper House invariably vetoes all bills
that reach them from that Raad.The First Raad receives bills and
suggestions from the Executive Council or from the President himself,
but refers them to a commission for investigation before any action is
taken upon them.The evidence in support of proposed measures does not
reach the Raad, which only concerns itself with the report of the
commission.The Raad can, by motion, make a suggestion to the Executive
Council that a certain measure should be formulated, but the Executive
Council and the President have the authority to ignore the suggestion,
leaving the First Raad without a vestige of authority.The upper House
concerns itself chiefly with the questions of finance, changes in the
Constitution, and the care of the natives.As the question of finance
is so closely connected with almost every subject that comes before the
Government, it follows that the First Raad concerns itself with
practically the entire business of the Government.The popular
conception is that the Second Raad, being composed of naturalized
citizens, takes less interest in the affairs of the country, and can
therefore be less safely trusted with their conduct than the old
burghers and Voortrekkers of the upper House, who would rather declare
war against a foreign power than pass a law in the least unfavourable to
their own country's interests.In consequence of the Second Raad's
infinitesimal powers, almost the entire law-making power of the
Government is vested in the Executive Council and the First Raad.The
First Raad of the Transvaal Republic is the direct successor of the
democratic form of government that was established by the Voortrekkers
of 1835 when they were journeying from Cape Colony to the northern
lands.The Second Raad was established in 1890, in order that the
Uitlanders might have representation in the government of the country.It was believed that the newly arrived population would take advantage
of the opportunities thus offered to take part in the legislation of the
republic, and in that way bridge over the gulf which had been formed
between the two races.The Uitlanders cared little for the privilege
offered to them, and so far in the history of the Second Raad less than
half a score of its members have been elected by the new population.The annual sessions of the Volksraads commence on the first Monday in
May, and continue until all the business of the republic has been
transacted.The members of the two Houses receive fifteen dollars a
day, and seventy-five cents an hour for services extending over more
than the five hours a day required by the law.The chairmen, or
voorzitters, of the Raads receive seventeen dollars and fifty cents a
day, and one dollar an hour for extra time.The sessions of the Raad are held in the new million-dollar Government
House in the central part of the town of Pretoria, and are open to the
public except when executive business is being transacted.The Raad
chambers are exquisitely fitted out with rich furniture and tapestries,
the windows are of costly stained glass, and the walls lavishly
decorated with carved wood and fine paintings of the country's notable
men.On a lofty elevation facing the entrance to the First Raad chamber
is a heavily carved mahogany desk, behind which is seated the chairman.On his right is a seat for the President, while on the right side of
that are the nine chairs for the Executive Council.Directly in front
and beneath the chairman's desk are the desks of the three official
secretaries, and in front of these, in semicircular form, the two rows
of seats and desks of the Raad members.In the rear of the chamber on
either side of the entrance are chairs for visitors, while high in the
left side of the lofty chamber is a small balcony for the newspaper men.All the members of the Raad are obliged by law to wear black clothing
and white neckties.This law was framed to prevent some of the rural
members from appearing in their burgher costumes, and has had the effect
of making of the Boer Raads a most sombre-looking body of lawmakers.Almost all members wear long frock-coats, silk hats, and heavy black
boots, and when, during the recesses, they appear on the piazza of the
Government Building with huge pipes in their mouths, the wisdom of the
black-clothing law is not apparent.There is little formality in the
proceedings of the Raads.Certain rules are necessarily followed, but
the members attack a bill in much the same vehement manner as they would
a lion or a panther.There is little eloquence in the taal, or dialect,
that is spoken in the Raads, and the similes and metaphors bespeak the
open veldt and the transport path rather than the council chamber of a
nation.The black-garbed legislators make no pretensions to dignified procedure,
and when a playful member trips another so that he falls to the floor,
or pelts him with paper balls, the whole Raad joins in laughter.The
gaudily dressed pages--one of them is sixty-five years old and wears a
long beard--are on terms of great familiarity with the members, and have
become mildly famous throughout the country on account of some practical
jokes they have perpetrated upon the members.It is only justice to say
that these light proceedings take place only when the President is not
present.When he arrives in the chamber every one rises and remains
standing until the President has seated himself.He generally takes a
deep interest in the subjects before the House, and not infrequently
speaks at length upon measures for which he desires a certain line of
action.Many of President Kruger's most important speeches have been
delivered to the Raads, and so great is his influence over the members
that his wishes are rarely disregarded.When he meets with opposition
to his views he quickly loses his temper, and upon one occasion called a
certain member who opposed him a traitor, and angrily left the chamber.A short time afterward he returned and apologized to the member and to
the Raad for having in his anger used unseemly language.One of the most disappointing scenes to be observed in Pretoria is the
horde of Uitlander politicians and speculators who are constantly
besieging the Raad members and the Government officials.At probably no
other national capital are the legislators tempted to such a great
extent as are the Boers, who, for the most part, are ignorant of the
ways of the world and unfamiliar with great amounts of money.Every
train from Johannesburg, the Uitlander capital, takes to Pretoria scores
of lobbyists, who use all their powers, both of persuasion and finance,
to influence the minds of the legislators, either in the way of granting
valuable concessions for small considerations or of securing the passage
of bills favourable to the lobbyists.It is no wonder that the
Uitlanders declare that less than one fourth of the Raad members are
unassailably honest and that all the others can be bribed.The Boer
alone is not blameworthy who, having never possessed more than one
hundred dollars at one time, yields to the constant importunities of the
lobbyist and sells his vote for several thousand dollars.Beset by such influences, the Raad members are naturally suspicious of
every bill that is brought before them for consideration.Their
deliberations are marked by a feeling of insecurity akin to that
displayed by the inhabitants of a sheep-pen surrounded by a pack of
hungry wolves.They fear to make a move in any direction lest their
motives be misunderstood, or they play into the hands of the Uitlanders.As a consequence of this external pressure, progress in the improvement
of the methods of governing the country has been slow.One of the
results of the Volksraad's fearfulness is the absence of local
governments throughout the republic.There are no municipalities,
counties, or townships which can formulate and execute local laws.Even
Johannesburg, a city of one hundred thousand population, has no
municipal government, although several attempts have been made to
establish one.The Raads are burdened with the necessity of attending to all the
details which govern the administration of every city, village, hamlet,
and district in the entire country, and the time consumed in doing all
this leaves little for the weightier affairs of state.If a five-dollar
road bridge is required in an out-of-the-way place in the northern part
of the republic, the Raad is obliged to discuss the matter.If an
application for a liquor license comes from a distant point in the
interior, the Raad is compelled to investigate its character before it
can be voted upon.The disadvantages of this system are so evident that
it is hardly conceivable that no remedy has been applied long ago, but
the fear of local mismanagement has prevented the Raad from ridding
itself of this encumbrance upon its time and patience.Every legislature of whatever country has its idiosyncracies, and the
Raad is no exception.Laws are upon the statute books of some of the
American States that are quite as remarkable as some of those made by
the Boer legislators.Bills quite as marvellous have been introduced
and defeated in the legislatures of all countries.The Boer Volksraad
has no monopoly of men with quaint ideas.The examples of Raad
workmanship here given are rare, but true nevertheless:

A man named Dums, whose big farm on the border became British territory
through a treaty, sued the Transvaal Government for damages, whereupon
the Raad passed a law that Dums could never sue the Government for
anything.The High Court sustained the law, and Dums is now a poor
cab-driver in Pretoria.Another man sued the Government for damages for
injuries resulting from a fall in the street.He was successful in his
suit, but the Raad immediately thereafter passed a law making it
impossible for any person to sue the Government for injuries received on
public property.During a severe drought in the Transvaal an American professional
rain-maker asked the Raad for a concession allowing him the exclusive
privilege to precipitate rain by means of explosives in the air.The
Raad had a long and animated discussion on the subject, owing to the
opposition of several of the less enlightened members, who declared that
the project was sacrilegious."It is a sin," they declared, "to poke
your fingers in the Lord's eye to make him weep."The abiding faith
which some of the Raad members have in divine guidance is illustrated by
a discussion that took place in the body shortly after the Jameson raid.One member declared that "the Lord will assist us in this matter if we
will only bide our time," whereupon another member rose and said, "If we
do not soon get down to business and do something without the Lord's
assistance, the Lord will take a holiday and let the Transvaal go to
hell."A law which was in effect for almost two years made it a
misdemeanour for any one to sing "God save the Queen" or "Rule
Britannia" in the country.Mass meetings are prohibited in the
Transvaal, but Germany and other countries with less political foment
have equally stringent regulations on the same subject, so the
Uitlanders' grievance on that account is nullified.Second to that of the Volksraad, the highest power in the Government of
the country is the High Court, which is composed of some of the ablest
jurists in South Africa.From a constitutional standpoint the High
Court has no right or power to review the acts of the Volksraad.The
Constitution of the country gives supreme power to the Volksraad in all
legislative matters, and when a chief justice of the High Court recently
attempted to extend his jurisdiction over the acts of the Volksraad that
body unceremoniously dismissed him.The purpose of that part of the
Constitution which relates to the subjugation of the High Court is to
prevent some influential enemy of the republic from debauching the High
Court and in that way defying the authority of the Volksraad.In a
country which has so many peculiar conditions and circumstances to
contend with, the safety of its institutions depends upon the
centralization of its legislative and administrative branches, and the
wisdom of the early burghers who framed the Constitution so that the
entire governing power lay in the hands of the country's real patriots
has been amply demonstrated upon several occasions.The civil and criminal laws of the country are administered throughout
the different political divisions by local magistrates, called
land-drosts, who also collect the revenues of the district and inform
the Volksraad of the needs of the people under their jurisdiction.The
land-drost is the prototype of the old-time American country squire, in
that he settles disputes, awards damages, and conducts official business
generally.In the majority of cases the land-drosts are aged persons
who have the respect and esteem of the members of the community in which
they dwell and to whom they bear the relation of fatherly advisers in
all things.In Johannesburg and Pretoria the land-drosts are men of
eminent station in the legal profession of South Africa, and are drawn
from all parts of the country, regardless of their political or racial
qualifications.All the court proceedings are conducted in the Dutch
language, and none but Dutch-speaking lawyers are admitted to practise
before the bar.The law of the land is Holland-Roman.The military branch of the Government is undoubtedly the best and most
effective because it is the simplest.It is almost primitive in its
simplicity, yet for effectiveness its superior is not easily found.The
Transvaal glories in its army, and, as every man between the ages of
sixteen and sixty is a nominal member of the army, nothing is left
undone to make it worthy of its glory.The standing army of the
republic numbers less than two hundred men, and these are not always
actively engaged.A detachment of about twenty soldiers is generally on
duty in the vicinity of the Government House at Pretoria, and the others
are stationed at the different forts throughout the republic.The real
army of the Transvaal, however, is composed of the volunteer soldiers,
who can be mobilized with remarkable facility.The head of the army is the commandant-general, who has his headquarters
in Pretoria.He is under the immediate jurisdiction of the Volksraad and
the President, who have the power to declare war and direct its conduct.Second in authority to the commandant-general are the commandants,
permanent officials who have charge of the military affairs of the
seventeen districts of the republic.Under the old South African
burgher law each commandant in any emergency "commandeers" a certain
portion of men from his district.The various districts are subdivided into divisions in charge of
field-cornets and assistant field-cornets.As soon as the
commandant-general issues an order for the mobilization of the volunteer
army the commandants and their assistants, the field-cornets, speedily
go from one house to another in their districts and summon the burghers
from their homes.When the burgher receives the call, he provides his
own gun, horse, and forage, and hastens to the district rendezvous,
where he places himself under the orders of the field-cornet.After all
the burghers of the district have gathered together, the body proceeds
into an adjoining district, where it joins the forces that have been
similarly mobilized there.As a certain number of districts are obliged
to join their forces at a defined locality, the forces of the republic
are consequently divided into different army divisions under the
supervisions of the commandants.In the event that Pretoria were threatened with attack, the order would
be given to move all the forces to that city.The districts on the
border would gather their men and march toward Pretoria, carrying with
them all the forces of the districts through which they were obliged to
pass.So simple and perfect is the system that within forty-eight hours
after the call is issued by the commandant-general four army divisions,
representing the districts in the four quarters of the republic and
consisting of all the able-bodied men in the country, can be mobilized
on the outskirts of Pretoria.It is doubtful whether there is another
nation on earth that can gather its entire fighting strength at its seat
of government in such a brief time.The Transvaal Boer is constantly prepared for the call to arms.He has
his own rifle and ammunition at his home, and when the call comes he
need only bridle his horse--if he is so fortunate as to possess an
animal so rare in the Transvaal--stuff several pounds of biltong, or
dried beef, in his pockets, and commence the march over the veldt to the
district rendezvous.He can depend upon his wife and children to care
for the flocks and herds; but if the impending danger appears to be
great, the cattle are deserted and the women and children are taken to a
rendezvous specially planned for such an emergency.If there is a need,
the Boer woman will stand side by side with her husband or her brother
or her sweetheart, and will allow no one to surpass her in repelling the
attacks of the enemy.Joan of Arcs have been as numerous in the Boer
armies as they have been unheralded.The head of the military branch of the Transvaal Government for many
years has been Commandant-General P. J. Joubert, who, following
President Kruger, is the ablest as well as the most popular Boer in
South Africa.General Joubert is the best type of the Boer fighter in
the country, and as he represents the army, he has always been a
favourite with the class which would rather decide a disputed point by
means of the rifle than by diplomacy, as practised by President Kruger.General Joubert, although the head of the army, is not of a quarrelsome
disposition, and he too believes in the peaceful arbitration of
differences rather than a resort to arms.By the Uitlanders he is
considered to be the most liberal Boer in the republic, and he has upon
numerous occasions shown that he would treat the newcomers in the
country with more leniency than the Kruger Government if he were in
power.In his capacity of Vice-President of the republic he has been as
impotent as the Vice-President is in the United States, but his
influence has always been wielded with a view of harmonizing the
differences of the native and alien populations.Twice the more liberal
and progressive party of the Boers has put him forward as a candidate
for the presidency in opposition to Mr.Kruger, and each time he has
been defeated by only a small majority.The younger Boers who have come
in touch with the more modern civilization have steadfastly supported
General Joubert, while the older Boers, who are ever fearful that any
one but Mr.Kruger would grant too many concessions to the Uitlanders,
have wielded their influence against him.Concerning the franchise for
Uitlanders, General Joubert is more liberal than President Kruger, who
holds that the stability of the Government depends upon the
exclusiveness of the franchise privilege.General Joubert believes that
there are many persons among the Uitlanders who have a real desire to
become citizens of the republic and to take part in the government.He
believes that an intending burgher should take an oath of fidelity, and
afterward be prepared to do what he can for the country, either in peace
or war.If after three or four years the applicant for the franchise
has shown that he worked in the interests of the country and obeyed its
laws, General Joubert believes that the Uitlander should enjoy all the
privileges that a native burgher enjoys--namely, voting for the
candidates for the presidency and the First Volksraad.General Joubert's name has been connected with Transvaal history almost
as long and as prominently as that of President Kruger.The two men are
virtually the fathers of the Boer republic.General Joubert has always
been the man who fought the battles with armies, while Mr.Kruger
conducted the diplomatic battles, and both were equally successful in
their parts.General Joubert, as a youth among the early trekkers from
Natal, was reared amid warfare.During the Transvaal's early battles
with the natives he was a volunteer soldier under the then
Commandant-General Kruger, and later, when the war of independence was
fought, he became General Joubert.He commanded the forces which fought
the battles of Laing's Nek, Bronkhorst Spruit, and Majuba Hill, and he
was one of the triumvirate that conducted the affairs of the Government
during that crucial time.He has been Vice-President of the republic
since the independence of the country has been re-established, and
conducted the affairs of the army during the time when Jameson's
troopers threatened the safety of the country.He has had a notable
career in the service of his country, and as a reward for his services
he is deserving of nothing less than the presidency of the republic
after Mr.Kruger's life-work is ended.General Joubert is no less distinguished as a diplomatist among his
countrymen than President Kruger, and many stories are current in
Pretoria showing that he has been able to accomplish many things wherein
Mr.An incident which occurred immediately after the
Jameson raid, and which is repeated here exactly as related by one of
the participants of the affair, is illustrative of General Joubert and
his methods of dealing with his own people.The story is given in
almost the exact language of the narrator who was the eyewitness:

"Shortly after Jameson and his officers were brought to Pretoria,
President Kruger called about twenty of the Boer commanders to his house
for a consultation.The townspeople were highly excited, and the
presence of the men who had tried to destroy the republic aggravated
their condition so that there were few calm minds in the capital.President Kruger was deeply affected by the seriousness of the events of
the days before, but counselled all those present to be calm.There
were some in the gathering who advised that Jameson and his men should
be shot immediately, while one man jocosely remarked that they should
not be treated so leniently, and suggested that a way to make them
suffer would be to cut off their ears."One of the men who was obliged to leave the meeting gave this account
to the waiting throngs in the street, and a few hours afterward the
cable had carried the news to Europe and America, with the result that
the Boers were called brutal and inhuman.President Kruger used all his
influence and eloquence to save the lives of the prisoners, and for a
long time he was unsuccessful in securing the smallest amount of
sympathy for Jameson and his men.It was dawn when General Joubert was
won to the President's way of thinking, and he continued the argument in
behalf of the prisoners."'My friends, I will ask you to listen patiently to me for several
minutes,' he commenced.'I will tell you the story of the farmer and
the neighbour's dog.Suppose that near your farm lives a man whose
valuable dogs attack your sheep and kill many.Will you shoot the dogs
as soon as you see them, and in that way make yourself liable for
damages greater than the value of the sheep that were destroyed?Or
will you catch the dogs when you are able to do so and, carrying them to
your neighbour, say to him: "I have caught your dogs; now pay me for the
damage they have done me, and they shall be returned to you."'"After a moment's silence General Joubert's face lighted up joyfully,
and he exclaimed:

"'We have the neighbour's dogs in the jail."The parable was effective, and the council of war decided almost
instantly to deliver the prisoners to the British Government."CHAPTER IX

                   CAUSES OF THE PRESENT DISSENSIONS


The politicians and the speculators have been the bane of South Africa.Ill-informed secretaries of the British Colonial Office might augment
the list, but their stupidity in treating with colonial grievances is so
proverbial as to admit them to the rank of natural or providential
causes of dissension.Until the Boer Government came into the
foreground, the politicians and speculators used South Africa as a huge
chessboard, whereon they could manipulate the political and commercial
affairs of hundreds of thousands of persons to suit their own fancies
and convenience.It was a dilettante politician who operated in South Africa and could
not make a cat's-paw of the colonial secretary in Downing Street, and it
was a stupid speculator who was unable to be the power behind the
enthroned politician.Hundreds of
men have gone to South Africa and have become millionaires, but
thousands remain in the country praying for money wherewith to return
home.The former are the politicians and the speculators; the latter
are the miners, the workingmen, and the tradespeople.It is a country where the man with a million becomes a multimillionaire,
and the man with hundreds becomes penniless.It is the wealthy man's
footstool and the poor man's cemetery.Men go there to acquire riches;
few go there to assist in making it tenable for white men.Thousands go
there with the avowed intention of making their fortunes and then to
return.Those who go there as came the immigrants to America--to settle
and develop the new country--can be counted only by the score.Of the
million white people south of the Zambezi, probably one half are mere
fortune-seekers, who would leave the country the very instant they
secured a moderate fortune.These have the welfare of the country at heart only in so far as it
interferes or assists them in attaining their desired goal.They would
ask that Portugal be allowed to rule all of South Africa if they
received the assurance that the much-sought-after fortune could be
secured six months sooner.They have no conscience other than that
which prevents them from stabbing a man to relieve him of his money.They go to the gold and diamond fields to secure wealth, and not to
assist in developing law and order, good government, or good
institutions.The other half of the white population is composed of men and women who
were born in the country--Afrikanders, Dutch, Boers, and other racial
representatives, and others who have emigrated thither from the densely
populated countries of Europe, with the intention of remaining in the
country and taking part in its government and institutions.These
classes comprise the South Africans, who love their country and take a
real interest in its development and progress.They know its needs and
prospects, and are abundantly able to conduct its government so that it
will benefit Boer, Englishman, Dutchman, Natalian, and native.The defects in the Government of Cape Colony and Natal are the natural
results of the handicaps that have been placed on the local legislation
by the Colonial Office in London, who are as ignorant of the real
conditions of their colonies as a Zulu chieftain is of the political
situation in England.The colonial papers teem with letters from
residents who express their indignation at the methods employed by the
Colonial Office in dealing with colonial affairs.Especially is this
the case in Natal, the Eden of South Africa, where the dealings of the
Colonial Office with regard to the Zulus have been stupidly carried on.South African men of affairs who are not bigoted do not hesitate to
express their opinion that Cape Colony and Natal have been retarded a
quarter of a century in their natural growth by the handicap of the
Colonial Office.Their opinion is based upon the fact that every war,
with the exception of several native outbreaks, has been caused by
blundering in the Colonial Office, and that all the wars have retarded
the natural growth and development of the colonies to an aggregate of
twenty-five years.In this estimate is not included the great harm to
industries that has been caused by the score or more of heavy war clouds
with which the country has been darkened during the last half century.These being some of the difficulties with which the two British colonies
in South Africa are beset, it can be readily inferred to what extent the
Boers of the Transvaal have had cause for grievance.In their dealings
with the Boers the British have invariably assumed the role of
aristocrats, and have looked upon and treated the "trekkers" as
_sans-culottes_.[Illustration: Cape Colony Government House, at Cape Town.]This natural antipathy of one race for another has given glorious
opportunities for strife, and neither one nor the other has ever failed
to take quick advantage.The struggle between the Boers and the British
began in Cape Colony almost one hundred years ago, and it has continued,
with varying degrees of bitterness, until the present day.The recent
disturbances in the Transvaal affairs date from the conclusion of the
war of independence in 1881.When the Peace Commissioners met there was
inserted in the treaty one small clause which gave to England her only
right to interfere in the political affairs of the Transvaal.The Boer country at that time was considered of such little worth that
Gladstone declared it was not of sufficient value to be honoured with a
place under the British flag.To the vast majority of the British
people it was a matter of indifference whether the Transvaal was an
independent country or a dependency of their own Government.The clause
which was allowed to enter the treaty unnoticed, and which during recent
years has figured so prominently in the discussions of South African
affairs, reads:

"The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engagement with
any state or nation other than the Orange Free State, nor with any
native tribe to the eastward or the westward of the republic, until the
same has been approved by her Majesty the Queen.Such approval shall be
considered to have been granted if her Majesty's Government shall not,
within six months after receiving a copy of such treaty (which shall be
delivered to them immediately upon its completion), have notified that
the conclusion of the treaty is in conflict with the interests of Great
Britain, or of any of her Majesty's possessions in South Africa."When the contents of the treaty were published to the Boer people, many
of them objected strongly to this clause, and insisted that it gave the
British too great power in the affairs of the republic, and a strenuous
effort was made to have the offending clause eliminated.In the year
1883 a deputation, which included Paul Kruger, was sent to London, with
a view of obtaining the abolition of the suzerainty.This deputation
negotiated a new convention the following year, from which the word
"suzerainty" and the stipulations in regard thereto were removed.In
their report to the Volksraad, made in 1884, the deputation stated that
the new convention put an end to the British suzerainty.February 4, 1884, in a letter to Lord Derby, then in charge of British
affairs, the deputation announced to him that they expected an agreement
to be contained in the treaty relative to the abolition of the
suzerainty.In his reply of a week later, Lord Derby made a statement
upon which the Boers base their strongest claim that the suzerainty was
abolished.He said:

"By the omission of those articles of the convention of Pretoria which
assigned to her Majesty and to the British resident certain specific
powers and functions connected with the internal government and the
foreign relations of the Transvaal state, your Government will be left
free to govern the country without interference, and to conduct its
diplomatic intercourse and shape its foreign policy, subject only to the
requirement embodied in the fourth article of the new draft, that any
treaty with a foreign state shall not have effect without the approval
of the Queen."For a period of almost ten years the suzerainty of England over the
Transvaal was an unknown quantity.With the exception of several
Government officials, there were hardly any Englishmen in the country,
and no one had the slightest interest in the affairs of the Transvaal
Government.When gold was discovered in the Randt in quantities that
equalled those of the early days of the California gold fields, an
unparalleled influx of Englishmen and foreigners followed, and in
several years the city of Johannesburg had sprung up in the veldt.The opening of hundreds of mines, and the consequent increase in
expenditures, made it necessary for the Transvaal Government to increase
its revenues.Mining laws had to be formulated, new offices had to be
created, hundreds of new officials had to be appointed, and all this
required the expenditure of more money in one year than the Government
had spent in a decade before the opening of the mines.The Government
found itself in a quandary, and it solved the problem of finances as
many a stronger and wealthier government has done.Concessions were granted to dynamite, railway, electric light, electric
railway, water, and many other companies, and these furnished to the
Government the nucleus upon which depended its financial existence.Few
of the concessions were obtained by British subjects, and when the
monopolies took advantage of their opportunities, and raised the price
of dynamite and the rates for carrying freight, the Englishmen, who
owned all the mines, naturally objected.The Boer Government, having
bound itself hand and foot when hard pressed for money, was unable to
compel the concessionaries to reduce their rates.At that period of the Randt's existence the speculators appeared, and
soon thereafter the London Stock Exchange became a factor in the affairs
of the Randt.Where the Stock Exchange leads, the politicians follow,
and they too soon became interested in South African affairs.Then the
treaty of 1883 was found in the Colonial Office archives, and next
appears a demand to the Boer Government that all British residents of
the Transvaal be allowed to vote.The Boers refused to give the
franchise to any applicant unless he first renounced his allegiance to
other countries, and, as the British subjects declined to accede to the
request, the politicians became busily engaged in formulating other
plans whereby England might obtain control of the country.At that inopportune time Jameson's troopers entered the Transvaal
territory and attempted to take forcible possession of the country; but
they were unsuccessful, and only succeeded in directing the world's
sympathy to the Boers.The Jameson raid was practically Cecil J.
Rhodes's first important attempt to add the Transvaal to the list of
South African additions he has made to the British Empire.The result
was especially galling to him, as it was the first time his great
political schemes failed of success.But Rhodes is not the man to weep over disasters.Before the excitement
over the raid had subsided, Rhodes had concocted a plan to inflict a
commercial death upon the Transvaal, and in that manner force it to beg
for the protection of the English flag.He opened Rhodesia, an
adjoining country, for settlement, and by glorifying the country, its
mineral and agricultural wealth, and by offering golden inducements to
Transvaal tradespeople, miners, and even Transvaal subjects, he hoped to
cause such an efflux from the Transvaal that the Government would be
embarrassed in less than two years.The country which bears his name
was found to be amazingly free from mountains of gold and rivers of
honey, and the several thousand persons who had faith in his alluring
promises remained in Rhodesia less than a year, and then returned to the
Transvaal.The reports of the Rhodesian country that were brought back by the
disappointed miners and settlers were not flattering to the condition of
the country or the justice of the Government.Of two evils, they chose
the lesser, and again placed themselves under the Kruger Government.When revolution and enticement failed to bring the Transvaal under the
British flag, Rhodes inaugurated a political propaganda.His last
resort was the Colonial Office in London, and in that alone lay the only
course by which he could attain his object.Again the franchise question was resorted to as the ground of the
contention, the dynamite and railway subjects having been so thoroughly
debated as to be as void of ground for further contention as they had
always been foreign to British control or interference.The question of
granting the right of voting to the Uitlanders in the Transvaal is one
which so vitally affects the future life of the Government that the
Boers' concession of that right would be tantamount to presenting the
country to the British Government.of the Uitlanders of the Transvaal are no more
than transient citizens.They were attracted thither by the gold mines
and the attendant industries, and they have no thought of staying in the
Transvaal a minute after they have amassed a fortune or a competency.Under no consideration would they remain in the country for the rest of
their lives, because the climate and nature of the country are not
conducive to a desire for long residence.It has been demonstrated that
less than one per cent.of the Uitlanders had sufficient interest in the
country to pass through the formality of securing naturalization papers
preparatory to becoming eligible for the franchise.The Boer Government has offered that all Uitlanders of nine years'
residence, having certain unimportant qualifications, should be
enfranchised in two years, and that others should be enfranchised in
seven years--two years for naturalization and five more years'
resident--before acquiring the right to vote.There is a provision for a property qualification, which makes it
necessary for the naturalized citizen to own a house of no less value
than two hundred and fifty dollars in renting value, or an income of one
thousand dollars.The residence clause in the Transvaal qualifications
compares favourably with those of London, where an Englishman from any
part of the country and settling in the municipality is obliged to live
two years and have certain property qualifications before acquiring the
right of franchise.In full knowledge of these conditions the Uitlanders insist upon having
an unconditional franchise--one that will require nothing more than a
two-years' residence in the country.The Boers are well aware of the
results that would follow the granting of the concessions demanded, but
not better so than the Uitlanders who make the demands.The latest
Transvaal statistics place the number of Boer burghers in the country at
less than thirty thousand.At the lowest estimate there are in the
Transvaal fifty thousand Uitlanders having the required qualifications,
and all of these would become voters in two years.At the first
election held after the two years had elapsed the Uitlanders would be
victorious, and those whom they elected would control the machinery of
the Government.The Uitlanders' plan is as transparent as air, yet it
has the approval and sanction of the English politicians, press, and
public.The propaganda which Rhodes and other politicians and stock brokers
interested in the Transvaal gold mines inaugurated a short time after
the Jameson raid has been successful in arousing the people in England
to what they have been led to believe is a situation unequalled in the
history of the empire-building.At the
same time the British Parliament was discussing the subject of the
alleged injustice under which the English residents of the Transvaal
were suffering, the colonial secretary was engaged in disposing of
grievances which reached him from the Dutch residents of British Guiana,
in South America, and which recited conditions parallel to those
complained of by the Uitlanders.The grievances were made by foreign
residents of English territory, instead of by English subjects in a
foreign country, and consequently demanded less serious attention, but
their justice was none the less patent.The three thousand native Dutch
voters in British Guiana have no voice in the legislative or
administrative branches of the colonial government, owing to the
peculiar laws which give to the three thousand British-born citizens the
complete control of the franchise.The population of the colony is
three hundred thousand, yet the three thousand British subjects make and
administer the laws for the other two hundred and ninety-seven thousand
inhabitants, who compose the mining and agricultural communities and are
treated with the same British contempt as the Boers.The Dutch
residents have made many appeals for a fuller representation in the
Government, but no reforms have been inaugurated or promised.The few grievances which the Uitlanders had before the Jameson raid have
been multiplied a hundredfold and no epithet is too venomous for them to
apply to the Boers.The letters in the home newspapers have allied the
name of the Boers with every vilifying adjective in the English
dictionary, and returning politicians have never failed to supply the
others that do not appear in the book.Petitions with thousands of names, some real, but many non-existent,
have been forwarded to the Colonial Office and to every other office in
London where they would be received, and these have recited grievances
that even the patient Boer Volksraad had never heard about.It has been
a propaganda of petitions and letters the like of which has no parallel
in the history of politics.It has been successful in arousing
sentiment favourable to the Uitlanders, and at this time there is hardly
a handful of persons in England who are not willing to testify to the
utter degradation of the Boers.Another branch of the propaganda operated through the Stock Exchange,
and its results were probably more practical than those of the literary
branch.It is easier to reach the English masses through the Stock
Exchange than by any other means.Whenever one of the "Kaffir" or
Transvaal companies failed to make both ends meet in a manner which
pleased the stockholders, it was only necessary to blame the Boer
Government for having impeded the digging of gold, and the stockholders
promptly outlined to the Colonial Office the policy it should pursue
toward the Boers.The impressions that are formed in watching the tide of events in the
Transvaal are that the Boer Government is not greatly inferior to the
Government of Lord Salisbury and Secretary Chamberlain.The only
appreciable difference between the two is that the Boers are fighting
the cause of the masses against the classes, while the English are
fighting that of the classes against the masses.In England, where the
rich have the power, the poor pay the taxes, while in the Transvaal the
poor have the power and compel the rich to pay the taxes.If the
Transvaal taxes were of such serious proportions as to be almost
unbearable, there might be a cause for interference by the Uitlander
capitalists who own the mines, but there no injustice is shown to any
one.The only taxes that the Uitlanders are compelled to pay are the
annual poll tax of less than four dollars and a half, mining taxes of a
dollar and a quarter a month for each claim for prospecting licenses,
and five dollars a claim for diggers' licenses.Boer and Uitlander are
compelled to pay these taxes without distinction.The Boers, in this contention, must win or die.In earlier days, before
every inch of African soil was under the flag of one country or another,
they were able to escape from English injustice by loading their few
possessions on wagons and "trekking" into new and unexplored lands.John went back to the hallway.If
they yield their country to the English without a struggle, they will be
forced to live under a future Stock Exchange Government, which has been
described by a member of the British Parliament as likely to be "the
vilest, the most corrupt, and the most pernicious known to man."[#]


[#] The Hon.Henry Labouchere, in London Truth.The Boers have no better argument to advance in support of their claim
than that which is contained in the Transvaal national hymn.It at once
gives a history of their country, its many struggles and
disappointments, and its hopes.It is written in the "taal" of the
country, and when sung by the patriotic, deep-voiced Boers is one of the
most impressive hymns that ever inspired a nation.The four-colours of our dear old land
      Again float o'er Transvaal,
    And woe the God-forgetting hand
      That down our flag would haul!Wave higher now in clearer sky
      Our Transvaal freedom's stay!Our enemies with fright did fly;
      Now dawns a glorious day.Through many a storm ye bravely stood,
      And we stood likewise true;
    Now, that the storm is o'er, we would
      Leave nevermore from you
    Bestormed by Kaffir, Lion, Brit,
      Wave ever o'er their head;
    And then to spite we hoist thee yet
      Up to the topmost stead!Four long years did we beg--aye, pray--
      To keep our lands clear, free,
    We asked you, Brit, we loath the fray:
      "Go hence, and let us be!We've waited, Brit, we love you not,
      To arms we call the Boer;"
        (Lit., Now take we to our guns.)"You've teased us long enough, we troth,
      Now wait we nevermore."And with God's help we cast the yoke
      Of England from our knee;
    Our country safe--behold and look--
      Once more our flag waves free!Though many a hero's blood it cost,
      May all the nations see
        (Lit., Though England ever so much more.)That God the Lord redeemed our hosts;
      The glory his shall be.Wave high now o'er our dear old land,
      Wave four-colours of Transvaal!And woe the God-forgetting hand
      That dares you down to haul!Wave higher now in clearer sky
      Our Transvaal freedom's stay!Our enemies with fright did fly;
      Now dawns a glorious day.CHAPTER X

                        PREPARATIONS FOR DEFENCE


Ever since the Jameson raid both the Boers and the Uitlanders have
realized that a peaceful solution of the differences between the two is
possible but highly improbable.The Uitlanders refused to concede
anything to the Boer, and asked for concessions that implied a virtual
abandonment of their country to the English, whom they have always
detested.The Boers themselves have not been unmindful of the
inevitable war with their powerful antagonist, and, not unlike the tiny
ant of the African desert, which fortifies its abode against the
anticipated attack of wild beasts, have made of their country a
veritable arsenal.Probably no inland country in the world is half so well prepared for war
at any time as that little Government, which can boast of having less
than thirty thousand voters.The military preparation has been so
enormous that Great Britain has been compelled, according to the
colonial secretary's statement to the British Parliament, to expend two
and a half million dollars annually in South Africa in order to keep
pace with the Boers.Four years ago, when the Transvaal Government
learned that the Uitlanders of Johannesburg were planning a revolution,
it commenced the military preparations which have ever since continued
with unabating vigour.German experts were employed to formulate plans
for the defence of the country, and European artillerists were secured
to teach the arts of modern warfare to the men at the head of the Boer
army.Several Americans of military training became the instructors in
the national military school at Pretoria; and even the women and
children became imbued with the necessity of warlike preparation, and
learned the use of arms.Several million pounds were annually spent in
Europe in the purchase of the armament required by the plans formulated
by the experts, and the whole country was placed on a war footing.Every important strategic position was made as impregnable as modern
skill and arms could make it, and every farmer's cottage was supplied
with arms and ammunition, so that the volunteer army might be mobilized
in a day.In order to demonstrate the extent to which the military preparation has
been carried, it is only necessary to give an account of the defences of
Pretoria and Johannesburg, the two principal cities of the country.Pretoria, being the capital, and naturally the chief point of attack by
the enemy, has been prepared to resist the onslaught of any number of
men, and is in a condition to withstand a siege of three years.The
city lies in the centre of a square, at each corner of which is a lofty
hill surmounted by a strong fort, which commands the valleys and the
surrounding country.Each of the four forts has four heavy cannon, four
French guns of fifteen miles range, and thirty heavy Gatling guns.Besides this extraordinary protection, the city has fifty light Gatling
guns which can be drawn by mules to any point on the hills where an
attack may be made.Three large warehouses are filled with ammunition,
and the large armory is packed to the eaves with Mauser, Martini-Henry,
and Wesley-Richards rifles.Two extensive refrigerators, with a
capacity of two thousand oxen each, are ample provision against a siege
of many months.It is difficult to compute the total expenditures for
war material by the Boer Government during the last four years, but the
following official announcement of expenses for one year will serve to
give an idea of the vastness of the preparations that the Government has
been compelled to make in order to guard the safety of the country:

    War-Office salaries .$262,310
    War purposes.4,717,550
    Johannesburg revolt .800,000
    Public works.3,650,000
                                           ----------
                                           $9,429,860


Johannesburg has extensive fortifications around it, but the Boers will
use them for other purposes than those of self-protection.The forts at
the Golden City were erected for the purpose of quelling any revolution
of the Uitlanders, who constitute almost entirely the population of the
city.One of the forts is situated on a small eminence about half a mile north
of the business part, and commands the entire city with its guns.Two
years were consumed in building the fortification and in placing the
armament in position.Its guns can rake not only every street of the
city, but ten of the principal mine works as well, and the damage that
their fire could cause is incalculable.Another fort, almost as strong
as the one in Johannesburg, is situated a mile east of the city, and
overshadows the railway and the principal highway to Johannesburg.The
residents of the city are greatly in fear of underground works, which
they have been led to believe were constructed since the raid.Vast
quantities of earth were taken out of the Johannesburg fort, and for
such a length of time did the work continue that the Uitlanders decided
that the Boers were undermining the city, and protested to the
Government against such a course.As soon as war is declared and the
women and children have been removed from the city, Johannesburg will be
rent with shot and shell.The Boers have announced their intention of
doing this, and the Uitlanders, anticipating it, seek safety in flight
whenever there are rumours of war, as thousands did immediately before
and after the Jameson affair.The approaches to the mountain passes on the border have been fortified
with vast quantities of German and French ordnance, and equipped with
garrisons of men born or trained in Europe.The approaches to Laing's
Nek, near the Natal border, which have several times been the battle
ground of the English and Boer forces, have been prepared to resist an
invading army from Natal.Much attention has been directed to the
preparations in that part of the republic, because the British
commanders will find it easier to transfer forces from the port of
Durban, which is three hundred and six miles from the Transvaal border,
while Cape Town is almost a thousand miles distant.But the Pretorian Government has made many provisions for war other than
those enumerated.It has made alliances and friends that will be of
equal worth in the event of an attack by England.The Orange Free
State, whose existence is as gravely imperilled as that of the
Transvaal, will fight hand-in-hand with its neighbour, just as it was
prepared to do at the time of the Jameson raid, when almost every Free
State burgher lay armed on the south bank of the Vaal River, awaiting
the summons for assistance from the Kruger Government.In the event of
war the two Governments will be as one, and, in anticipation of the
struggle of the Boers against the British, the Free State Government has
been expending vast sums of money every year in strengthening the
country's defences.At the same time that the Free State is being
prepared for war, its Government officials are striving hard to prevent
a conflict, and are attempting to conciliate the two principals in the
strife by suggesting that concessions be made by both.The Free State
is not so populous as the Transvaal, and consequently can not place as
many men in the field, but the ten thousand burghers who will answer the
call to arms will be an acceptable addition to the Boer forces.The element of doubt enters into the question of what the Boers and
their co-religionists of Cape Colony and Natal will do in the event of
war.The Dutch of Cape Colony are the majority of the population, and,
although loyal British subjects under ordinary circumstances, are
opposed to English interference in the Transvaal's affairs.Those of
Natal, while not so great in numbers, are equally friendly with the
Transvaal Boers, and would undoubtedly recall some of their old
grievances against the British Government as sufficient reason to join
the Boers in war.In Cape Colony there is an organization called the Afrikander Bond which
recently has gained control of the politics of the colony, and which
will undoubtedly be supreme for many years to come.The motto of the
organization is "South Africa for South Africans," and its doctrine is
that South Africa shall be served first and Great Britain afterward.Its members, who are chiefly Dutch, believe their first duty is to
assist the development of the resources of their own country by proper
protective tariffs and stringent legislation in native affairs, and they
regard legislation with a view to British interests as of secondary
importance.The Bond has been very amicably inclined toward its
Afrikander kinsmen in the Transvaal, especially since the Jameson raid,
and every sign of impending trouble between England and the Boers widens
the chasm between the English and Afrikanders of South Africa.The
Dutch approve of President Kruger's course in dealing with the franchise
problems, and if hostilities break out it would be not the least
incompatible with their natures to assist their Transvaal and Free State
kinsmen even at the risk of plunging the whole of South Africa into a
civil war.W. P. Schreiner, the Premier of Cape Colony, is the leading
member of the Bond, and with him he has associated the majority of the
leading men in the colony.Under ordinary conditions their loyalty to
Great Britain is undoubted, but whether they could resist the influence
of their friends in the Bond if it should decide to cast its fortunes
with the Boers in case of war is another matter.Of such vast importance is the continued loyalty of the Dutch of the two
colonies that upon it depends practically the future control of the Cape
by the British Government.Being in the majority as three to two, and
almost in supreme control of the local government, the Dutch of Cape
Colony are in an excellent position to secede from the empire, as they
have already threatened to do, in which event England would be obliged
to fight almost the united population of the whites if she desired to
retain control of the country.With this in mind, it is no wonder that
Mr.Chamberlain declared that England had reached a critical turning
point in the history of the empire.The uncertainty of the situation is increased by the doubtful stand
which the native races are taking in the dispute.Neither England nor
the Boers has the positive assurance of support from any of the tribes,
which outnumber the whites as ten to one; but it will not be an
unwarranted opinion to place the majority of the native tribes on the
side of the Boers.The native races are always eager to be the friends
of the paramount power, and England's many defeats in South Africa
during recent years have not assisted in gaining for it that prestige.When England enters upon a war with the Transvaal the natives will
probably follow the example of the Matabele natives, who rebelled
against the English immediately after Jameson and his men were defeated
by the Boers, because they believed a conquered nation could offer no
resistance.The Boers, having won the last battle, are considered by the
natives to be the paramount power, and it is always an easy matter to
induce a subjected people to ally itself with a supposedly powerful one.The Zulus, still stinging under the defeat which they received from the
British less than twenty years ago, might gather their war parties and,
with the thousands of guns they have been allowed to buy, attempt to
secure revenge.The Basutos, east of the Orange Free State, now the
most powerful and the only undefeated nation in the country, would
hardly allow a war to be fought unless they participated in it, even if
only to demonstrate to the white man that they still retain their
old-time courage and ability.The million and a half natives in Cape
Colony, and the equal number in the Transvaal, have complained of so
many alleged grievances at the hands of their respective governments
that they might be presumed to rise against them, though it is never
possible to determine the trend of the African <DW64>'s mind.What the
various tribes would do in such an emergency can be answered only by the
chiefs themselves, and they will not speak until the time for action is
at hand.Perhaps when that time does arrive there may be a realization
of the natives' dream--that a great leader will come from the north who
will organize all the various tribes into one grand army and with it
drive the hated white men into the sea.It is impossible to secure accurate statistics in regard to the military
strength of the various colonies, states, and tribes in the country, but
the following table gives a fair idea of the number of men who are
liable to military duty:

                              Dutch.Cape Colony               20,000        10,000        177,000
    Natal                      7,000         5,000        100,000
    Orange Free State         10,000       ......         30,000
    Transvaal                 30,000        20,000        140,000
    Rhodesia                 ......         2,000         25,000
    Swaziland and Basutoland ......       ......         30,000
                              ------        ------        -------
    Total                     67,000        37,000        570,000


To him who delights in forming possible coalitions and war situations
this table offers vast opportunities.Probably no other country can
offer such a vast number of possibilities for compacts between nations,
races, and tribes as is presented in South Africa.There all the
natives may unite against the whites, or a part of them against a part
of the whites, while whites and natives may unite against a similar
combination.The possibilities are boundless; the probabilities are
uncertain.The Pretorian Government has had an extensive secret service for several
years, and this has been of inestimable value in securing the support of
the natives as well as the friendship of many whites, both in South
Africa and abroad.The several thousand Irishmen in South Africa have
been organized into a secret compact, and have been and will continue to
be of great value to the Boers.The head of the organization is a man
who is one of President Kruger's best friends, and his lieutenants are
working even as far away as America.The sympathy of the majority of
the Americans in the Transvaal is with the Boer cause, and, although the
American consul-general at Cape Town has cautioned them to remain
neutral, they will not stand idly by and watch the defeat of a cause
which they believe to be as just as that for which their forefathers
fought at Bunker Hill and Lexington.But the Boers do not rely upon external assistance to win their battles
for them.When it becomes necessary to defend their liberty and their
country they reverently place their trust in Providence and their
rifles.Their forefathers' battles were won with such confidence, and
the later generations have been similarly successful under like
conditions.The rifle is the young Boer's primer and the grandfather's
testament.It is the Boers' avenger of wrong and the upholder of right.That their confidence in their rifles has not been misapplied has been
demonstrated at Laing's Nek, Majuba Hill, Doornkop, and in battles with
natives.The natural opportunities provided by Nature which in former years were
responsible for the confidence which the Boers reposed in their rifles
may have disappeared with the approach of advancing civilization, but
the Boer of to-day is as dangerous an adversary with a gun as his father
was in the wars with the Zulus and the Matabeles half a century ago.The
buck, rhinoceros, elephant, and hippopotamus are not as numerous now as
then, but the Boer has devised other means by which he may perfect
himself in marksmanship.Shooting is one of the main diversions of the
Boer, and prizes are offered for the best results in contests.It is
customary to mark out a ring, about two hundred and fifty feet in
diameter, in the centre of which a small stuffed figure resembling a
bird is attached to a pole.The marksmen stand on the outside of the
circle and fire in turn at the target.A more curious target, and one
that taxes the ability of the marksman, is in more general use
throughout the country.A hole sufficiently deep to retain a
turkey-cock is dug in a level plot of ground, and over this is placed a
piece of canvas which contains a small hole through which the bird can
extend and withdraw its head.At a distance of three hundred feet the
bird's head is a target by no means easily hit.Military men are accustomed to sneer at the lack of generalship of the
Boer forces, but in only one of the battles in which they have engaged
the British forces have the trained military men and leaders been able
to cope with them.In the battle of Boomplaats, fought in 1848, the
English officers can claim their only victory over the Boers, who were
armed with flintlocks, while the British forces had heavy artillery.In
almost all the encounters that have taken place the Boer forces were not
as large as those of the enemy, yet the records show that many more
casualties were inflicted than received by them.In the chief
engagements the appended statistics show that the Boers had only a small
percentage of their men in the casualty list, while the British losses
were much greater.Laing's Nek           400        550          190         24
    Ingogo                300        250          142         17

It is hardly fair to assume that the Boers' advantages in these battles
were gained without the assistance of capable generals when it is taken
into consideration that there is a military axiom which places the value
of an army relatively with the ability of its commanders.The Boers may
exaggerate when they assert that one of their soldiers is the equal in
fighting ability of five British soldiers, but the results of the
various battles show that they have some slight foundation for their
theory.The regular British force in South Africa is comparatively small, but it
would require less than a month to transport one hundred thousand
trained soldiers from India and England and place them on the scene of
action.Several regiments of trained soldiers are always stationed in
different parts of the country near the Transvaal border, and at brief
notice they could be placed on Boer territory.Charlestown, Ladysmith,
and Pietermaritzburg, in Natal, have been British military headquarters
for many years, and during the last three years they have been
strengthened by the addition of several regular regiments.The British
Colonial Office has been making preparations for several years for a
conflict.Every point in the country has been strengthened, and all the
foreign powers whose interests in the country might lead them to
interfere in behalf of the Boers have been placated.Germany has been
taken from the British zone of danger by favourable treaties; France is
fearful to try interference alone; and Portugal, the only other nation
interested, is too weak and too deeply in England's debt to raise her
voice against anything that may be done.By leasing the town of Lorenzo Marques from the Portuguese Government,
Great Britain has acquired one of the best strategic points in South
Africa.The lease, the terms of which are unannounced, was the
culmination of much diplomatic dickering, in which the interests of
Germany and the South African Republic were arrayed against those of
England and Portugal.There is no doubt that England made the lease
only in order to gain an advantage over President Kruger, and to prevent
him from further fortifying his country with munitions of war imported
by way of Lorenzo Marques and Delagoa Bay.England gains a commercial
advantage too, but it is hardly likely that she would care to add the
worst fever-hole in Africa to her territory simply to please the few of
her merchants who have business interests in the town.Since the Jameson
raid the Boers have been purchasing vast quantities of guns and
ammunition in Europe for the purpose of preparing themselves for any
similar emergency.Delagoa Bay alone was an open port to the Transvaal,
every other port in South Africa being under English dominion and
consequently closed to the importation of war material.Lorenzo
Marques, the natural port of the Transvaal, is only a short distance
from the eastern border of that country, and is connected with Pretoria
and Johannesburg by a railway.It was over this railway that the Boers
were able to carry the guns and ammunition with which to fortify their
country, and England could not raise a finger to prevent the little
republic from doing as it pleased.Hardly a month has passed since the
raid that the Transvaal authorities did not receive a large consignment
of guns and powder from Germany and France by way of Lorenzo Marques.England could do nothing more than have several detectives at the docks
to take an inventory of the munitions as they passed in transit.The transfer of Lorenzo Marques to the British will put an effectual bar
to any further importation of guns into the Transvaal, and will
practically prevent any foreign assistance from reaching the Boers in
the event of another war.Both Germany and England tried for many years
to induce Portugal to sell Delagoa Bay, but being the debtor of both to
a great extent, the sale could not be made to one without arousing the
enmity of the other.Eighteen or twenty years ago Portugal would have
sold her sovereign right over the port to Mr.Gladstone's Government for
sixty thousand dollars, but that was before Delagoa Bay had any
commercial or political importance.Since then Germany became the
political champion of the Transvaal, and blocked all the schemes of
England to isolate the inland country by cutting off its only neutral
connection with the sea.Recently, however, Germany has been
disappointed by the Transvaal Republic, and one of the results is the
present cordial relations between the Teutons and the Anglo-Saxons in
South African affairs.The English press and people in South Africa have always asserted that
by isolating the Transvaal from the sea the Boers could be starved into
submission in case of a war.As soon as the lease becomes effective, Mr.Kruger's country will be completely surrounded by English territory, at
least in such a way that nothing can be taken into the Transvaal without
first passing through an English port, and no foreign power will be able
to send forces to the aid of the Boers unless they are first landed on
British soil.It is doubtful whether any nation would incur such a
grave responsibility for the sake of securing Boer favour.Both the Transvaal and England are fully prepared for war, and diplomacy
only can postpone its coming.The Uitlanders' present demands may be
conceded, but others that will follow may not fare so well.A coveted
country will always be the object of attacks by a stronger power, and
the aggressor generally succeeds in securing from the weaker victim
whatever he desires.Whether British soldiers will be obliged to fight
the Boers alone in order to gratify the wishes of their Government, or
whether the enemy will be almost the entire white and black population
of South Africa, will not be definitely known until the British troop
ships start for Cape Town and Durban.[Illustration: Cape Town and Table Mountain.]Whichever enemy it will be, the British Government will attack, and will
pursue in no half-hearted or half-prepared manner, as it has done in
previous campaigns in the country.The Boers will be able to resist and
to prolong the campaign to perhaps eight months or a year, but they will
finally be obliterated from among the nations of the earth.It will
cost the British Empire much treasure and many lives, but it will
satisfy those who caused it--the politicians and speculators.CHAPTER XI

                   AMERICAN INTERESTS IN SOUTH AFRICA


An idea of the nature and extent of American enterprise in South Africa
might be deduced from the one example of a Boston book agent, who made a
competency by selling albums of United States scenery to the <DW64>s
along the shores of the Umkomaas River, near Zululand.The book agent
is not an incongruity of the activity of Americans in that part of the
continent, but an example rather of the diversified nature of the
influences which owe their origin to the nation of Yankees ten thousand
miles distant.The United States of America have had a deeper influence
upon South Africa than that which pertains to commerce and trade.The
progress, growth, and prosperity of the American States have instilled
in the minds of the majority of South Africans a desire to be free from
European control, and to be united under a single banner, which is to
bear the insignia of the United States of South Africa.In public, editors and speechmakers in Cape Colony, Natal, and the
Transvaal spend hours in deploring the progress of Americanisms in South
Africa, but in their clubs and libraries they study and discuss the
causes which led to America's progress and pre-eminence, and form plans
by which they may be able to attain the same desirable ends.The
influence and example of the United States are not theoretical; they are
political factors which are felt in the discussion of every public
question and in the results of every election.The practical results of
American influence in South Africa may now be observed only in the
increasing exports to that country, but perhaps in another generation a
greater and better demonstration will be found in a constitution which
unites all the South African states under one independent government.If any corroboration of this sentiment were necessary, a statement made
by the man who is leader of the ruling party in Cape Colony would be
ample."If we want an example of the highest type of freedom," said W. P.
Schreiner, the present Premier of Cape Colony, "we must look to the
United States of America."[#]


[#] Americans' Fourth of July Banquet, Cape Town, 1897.American influences are felt in all phases of South African life, be
they social, commercial, religious, political, or retrogressive.Whether it be the American book agent on the banks of the Umkomaas, or
the American consul-general in the governor's mansion at Cape Town, his
indomitable energy, his breezy indifference to apparently insurmountable
difficulties, and his boundless resources will always secure for him
those material benefits for which men of other nationalities can do no
more than hope.Some of his rivals call it perverseness, callousness,
trickery, treachery, and what not; his admirers might ascribe his
success to energy, pluck, modern methods, or to that quality best
described by that Americanism--"hustling."American commercial interests in South Africa are of such recent growth,
and already of such great proportions, that the other nations who have
been interested in the trade for many years are not only astounded, but
are fearful that the United States will soon be the controlling spirit
in the country's commercial affairs.The enterprise of American
business firms, and their ability to undersell almost all the other
firms represented in the country, have given an enormous impetus to the
export trade with South African countries.Systematic efforts have been
made by American firms to work the South African markets on an extensive
scale, and so successful have the efforts been that the value of exports
to that country has several times been more than doubled in a single
year.Five years ago America's share of the business of South Africa was
practically infinitesimal; to-day the United States hold second place in
the list of nations which have trade relations with that country, having
outranked Germany, France, Belgium, Holland, and Italy.In several
branches of trade America surpasses even England, which has always had
all the trade advantages owing to the supremacy of her flag over the
greater part of the country.That the British merchants are keenly alive
to the situation which threatens to transfer the trade supremacy into
American hands has been amply demonstrated by the efforts which they
have made to check the inroads the Americans are making on their field,
and by the appointment of committees to investigate the causes of the
decline of British commerce.American enterprise shows itself by the scores of representatives of
American business houses who are constantly travelling through the
country, either to secure orders or to investigate the field with a view
of entering into competition with the firms of other nations.Fifteen
American commercial travellers, representing as many different firms,
were registered at the Grand Hotel, Cape Town, at one time a year ago,
and that all had secured exceptionally heavy orders indicated that the
innovation in the method of working trade was successful.The laws of the country are unfavourable in no slight degree to the
foreign commercial travellers, who are obliged to pay heavy licenses
before they are permitted to enter upon any business negotiations.The
tax in the Transvaal and Natal is $48.66, and in the Orange Free State
and Cape Colony it amounts to $121.66.If an American agent wishes to
make a tour of all the states and colonies of the country, he is obliged
to pay almost three hundred and fifty dollars in license fees.The great superiority of certain American manufactured products is such
that other nations are unable to compete in those lines after the
American products have been introduced.Especially is this true of
American machinery, which can not be equalled by that of any other
country.Almost every one of the hundreds of extensive gold mines on
the Randt is fitted out wholly or in part with American machinery, and,
at the present rate of increase in the use of it, it will be less than
ten years when none other than United States machinery will be sent to
that district.In visiting the great mines the uninitiated American is
astonished to find that engines, crushing machinery, and even the
electric lights which illuminate them, bear the name plates of New York,
Philadelphia, and Chicago firms.The Kimberley diamond mines, which are among the most extensive and most
elaborate underground works in the world, use American-made machinery
almost exclusively, not only because it is much less costly, but because
no other country can furnish apparatus that will give as good results.Almost every pound of electrical machinery in use in the country was
made in America and was instituted by American workmen.Instances of successful American electrical enterprises are afforded by
the Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and Pretoria street railways, almost
every rail, wire, and car of which bears the marks of American
manufacture.It is a marvellous revelation to find Philadelphia-made
electric cars in the streets of Cape Town, condensing engines from New
York State in Port Elizabeth, and Pittsburg generators and switchboards
in the capital of the Transvaal, which less than fifty years ago was
under the dominion of savages.Not only did Americans install the
street railways, but they also secured the desirable concessions for
operating the lines for a stated period.American electricians operate
the plants, and in not a few instances have financially embarrassed
Americans received a new financial impetus by acting in the capacities
of motormen and conductors.One street car in Cape Town was for a long time distinguished because of
its many American features.The Philadelphia-made car was propelled
over Pittsburg tracks by means of the power passing through Wilkesbarre
wires, and the human agencies that controlled it were a Boston motorman
and a San Francisco conductor.It might not be pursuing the subject too
far to add that of the twelve passengers in the car on a certain journey
ten were Americans, representing eight different States.One of the first railroads in South Africa--that which leads from
Lorenzo Marques to the Transvaal border--was built by an American, a Mr.Murdock, while American material entered largely into the construction
of the more extensive roads from the coast to the interior.American
rails are more quickly and more cheaply[#] obtainable in South Africa
than those of English make, but the influence which is exerted against
the use of other than British rails prevents their universal adoption.Notwithstanding the efforts of the influential Englishmen to secure
British manufactures wherever and whenever possible, American firms have
recently secured the contracts for forty thousand tons of steel rails
for the Cape Colony Railway system, and the prospects are that more
orders of a similar nature will be forthcoming.[#] "But the other day we gave an order for two hundred and fifty miles
of rails.We had a large number of tenders, and the lowest tender, you
may be sorry to hear, was sent by an American, Mr.Fortunately, however, the tender was not in order, and we were therefore
able to give the work to our own people.It may be said that this
American tender was a question of workmen and strikes."--Cecil J.
Rhodes, at a meeting of the stockholders of the Cape-Cairo Railway,
London, May 2, 1899.It is not in the sale of steel rails alone that the American
manufacturer is forging ahead of his competitors in South Africa.American manufactured wares of all kinds are in demand, and in many
instances they are leaders in the market.Especially true is this of
American agricultural implements, which are so much more adaptable to
the soil and much cheaper than any other make.Small stores in the
farming communities of Natal and Cape Colony sell American ploughshares,
spades, forks, rakes, and hoes almost exclusively, and it amazes the
traveller to find that almost every plough and reaper used by the more
progressive agriculturists bears the imprint "Made in the United
States."It is a strange fact that, although South Africa has vast areas covered
with heavy timber, almost all the lumber used in the mining districts is
transported thither from Puget Sound.The native timber being unsuited
for underground purposes and difficult of access, all the mine owners
are obliged to import every foot of wood used in constructing surface
and underground works of their mines, and at great expense, for to the
original cost of the timber is added the charges arising from the sea
and land transportation, import duties, and handling.The docks at Cape
Town almost all the year round contain one or more lumber vessels from
Puget Sound, and upon several occasions five such vessels were being
unloaded at the same time.American coal, too, has secured a foothold in South Africa, a sample
cargo of three thousand tons having been despatched thither at the
beginning of the year.Coal of good quality is found in several parts
of the Transvaal and Natal, but progress in the development of the mines
has been so slow that almost the total demand is supplied by Wales.Cape Colony has an extensive petroleum field, but it is in the hands of
concessionaires, who, for reasons of their own, refuse to develop it.American and Russian petroleums are used exclusively, but the former is
preferred, and is rapidly crowding the other out of the market.Among the many other articles of export to South Africa are flour, corn,
butter, potatoes, canned meats, and vegetables--all of which might be
produced in the country if South Africans took advantage of the
opportunities offered by soil and Nature.American live stock has been
introduced into the country since the rinderpest disease destroyed
almost all of the native cattle, and with such successful results that
several Western firms have established branches in Cape Town, and are
sending thither large cargoes of mules, horses, cattle, and sheep.Cecil J. Rhodes has recently stocked his immense Rhodesian farm with
American live stock, and, as his example is generally followed
throughout the country, a decided increase in the live-stock export
trade is anticipated.Statistics only can give an adequate idea of American trade with South
Africa; but even these are not reliable, for the reason that a large
percentage of the exports sent to the country are ordered through London
firms, and consequently do not appear in the official figures.As a
criterion of what the trade amounts to, it will only be necessary to
quote a few statistics, which, however, do not represent the true totals
for the reason given.The estimated value of the exports and the
percentage increase of each year's business over that of the preceding
year is given, in order that a true idea of the growth of American trade
with South Africa may be formed:

    YEAR.Per cent
                                         increase.1895                  $5,000,000
    1896                  12,000,000        140
    1897                  16,000,000         33 1/8
    1898 (estimated)      20,000,000         25


A fact that is deplored by Americans who are eager to see their country
in the van in all things pertaining to trade is that almost every
dollar's worth of this vast amount of material is carried to South
Africa in ships sailing under foreign colours.Three lines of
steamships, having weekly sailings, ply between the two countries, and
are always laden to the rails with American goods, but the American flag
is carried by none of them.A fourth line of steamships, to ply between
Philadelphia and Cape Town, is about to be established under American
auspices, and is to carry the American flag.A number of small American
sailing vessels trade between the two countries, but their total
capacity is so small as to be almost insignificant when compared with
the great volume carried in foreign bottoms.The American imports from South Africa are of far less value than the
exports, for the reason that the country produces only a few articles
that are not consumed where they originate.America is the best market
in the world for diamonds, and about one fourth of the annual output of
the Kimberley mines reaches the United States.Hides and tallow
constitute the leading exportations to America, while aloes and ostrich
feathers are chief among the few other products sent here.Owing to this
lack of exports, ships going to South Africa are obliged to proceed to
India or Australia for return cargoes in order to reduce the expenses of
the voyage.However great the commercial interests of the United States in South
Africa, they are small in comparison with the work of individual
Americans, who have been active in the development of that country
during the last quarter of a century.Wherever great enterprises have
been inaugurated, Americans have been prominently identified with their
growth and development, and in not a few instances has the success of
the ventures been wholly due to American leadership.European capital
is the foundation of all the great South African institutions, but it is
to American skill that almost all of them owe the success which they
have attained.British and continental capitalists have recognised the superiority of
American methods by intrusting the management of almost every large mine
and industry to men who were born and received their training in the
United States.It is an expression not infrequently heard when the
success of a South African enterprise is being discussed, "Who is the
Yankee?"The reason of this is involved in the fact that almost all the
Americans who went to South Africa after the discovery of gold had been
well fitted by their experiences in the California and Colorado mining
fields for the work which they were called upon to do on the Randt, and,
owing to their ability, were able to compete successfully with the men
from other countries who were not so skilled.Unfortunately, not all the Americans in South Africa have been a credit
to their native country, and there is a considerable class which has
created for itself an unenviable reputation.The component parts of
this class are men who, by reason of criminal acts, were obliged to
leave America for new fields of endeavour, and non-professional men who
follow gold booms in all parts of the world and trust to circumstances
for a livelihood.In the early days of the Johannesburg gold fields
these men oftentimes resorted to desperate means, with the result that
almost every criminal act of an unusually daring description is now
credited against them by the orderly inhabitants.Highwaymen,
pickpockets, illicit gold buyers, confidence men, and even train-robbers
were active, and for several years served to discredit the entire
American colony.Since the first gold excitement has subsided, this
class of Americans, in which was also included by the residents all the
other criminal characters of whatever nationality, has been compelled to
leave the country, and to-day the American colony in Johannesburg
numbers about three thousand of the most respected citizens of the city.The American who has been most prominent in South African affairs, and
the stanchest supporter of American interests in that country, is
Gardner F. Williams, the general manager and one of the alternate life
governors of the De Beers Consolidated Diamond Mines at Kimberley.Williams gained his mining experience in the
mining districts of California and other Western States, and went to
South Africa in 1887 to take charge of the Kimberley mines, which were
then in an almost chaotic condition.By the application of American
ideas, Mr.Williams succeeded in making of the mines a property which
yields an annual profit of about ten million dollars on a nominal
capital of twice that amount.He has introduced American machinery into
the mines, and has been instrumental in many other ways in advancing the
interests of his native country.Williams receives a salary
twice as great as that of the President of the United States, he is
proud to be the American consular agent at Kimberley--an office which
does not carry with it sufficient revenue to provide the star-spangled
banner which constantly floats from a staff in front of his residence.J. Perrott Prince is another American who has assisted materially in
extending American interests in South Africa, and it is due to his own
unselfish efforts that the commerce of the United States with the port
of Durban has risen from insignificant volume to its present size.Prince was a surgeon in the Union army during the civil war, and
afterward was one of the first Americans to go to the Kimberley diamond
fields.Leander Starr Jameson to
accompany him to Kimberley in the capacity of assistant surgeon--a
service which he performed with great distinction until Mr.Rhodes sent
him into Matabeleland to take charge of the military forces, which later
he led into the Transvaal.Prince's renown as a physician was responsible for a call to
Madagascar, whither he was summoned by Queen Ranavalo.He remained in
Madagascar as the queen's physician until the French took forcible
possession of the island and sent the queen into exile on the Reunion
Islands.Prince has lived in Durban, Natal, for several years, and
during the greater part of that time conducted the office of American
consular agent at a financial loss to himself.Prince was obliged to end his connection with the consular service, and
the United States are now represented in Durban by a foreigner, who on
the last Fourth of July inquired why all the Americans in the city were
making such elaborate displays of bunting and the Stars and Stripes.The consular agent at Johannesburg is John C. Manion, of Herkimer, N.Y.,
who represents a large American machinery company.Manion, in 1896,
carried on the negotiations with the Transvaal Government by which John
Hays Hammond, an American mining engineer, was released from the
Pretoria prison, where he had been confined for complicity in the
uprising at Johannesburg.American machinery valued at several million
dollars has been sent to South Africa as the result of Mr.In the gold industry on the Randt, Americans have been specially active,
and it is due to one of them, J. S. Curtis, that the deep-level mines
were discovered.In South Africa a mining claim extends only a
specified distance below the surface of the earth, and the Governments
do not allow claim-owners to dig beyond that depth.Curtis found
that paying reefs existed below the specified depth, and the result was
that the Government sold the underground or deep-level claims with great
profit to itself and the mining community.The consulting engineers of almost all the mines of any importance in
the country are Americans, and their salaries range from ten thousand to
one hundred thousand dollars a year.John Hays Hammond, who was one of
the first American engineers to reach the gold fields, was official
mining engineer for the Transvaal Government, and received a yearly
salary of twenty-five thousand dollars for formulating the mining laws
of the country.He resigned that office, and is now the consulting
engineer for the British South Africa Company in Rhodesia and several
gold mines on the Randt, at salaries which aggregate almost one hundred
thousand dollars a year.Among the scores of other American engineers on
the Randt are L. I. Seymour, who has control of the thirty-six shafts of
the Randt Mines; Captain Malan, of the Robinson mines; and H. S. Watson,
of the Simmer en Jack mines, in developing which more than ten million
dollars have been spent.Another American introduced the system of treating the abandoned
tailings of the mines by the cyanide process, whereby thousands of
ounces of gold have been abstracted from the offal of the mills, which
had formerly been considered valueless.Others have revolutionized
different parts of the management of the mines, and in many instances
have taken abandoned properties and placed them on a paying basis.It
would not be fair to claim that American ingenuity and skill are
responsible for the entire success of the Randt gold mines, but it is
indisputable that Americans have done more toward it than the combined
representatives of all other nations.Every line of business on the Randt has its American representatives,
and almost without exception the firms who sent them thither chose able
men.W. E. Parks, of Chicago, represents Frazer & Chalmers, whose
machinery is in scores of the mines.His assistant is W. H. Haig, of
New York city.The American Trading and Importing Company, with its headquarters in
Johannesburg, and branches in every city and town in the country, deals
exclusively in American manufactured products, and annually sells
immense quantities of bicycles, stoves, beer, carriages, and other
goods, ranging from pins to pianos.Americans do not confine their endeavours to commercial enterprises, and
they may be found conducting missionary work among the Matabeles and
Mashonas, as well as building dams in Rhodesia.American missionaries
are very active in all parts of South Africa, and because of the
practical methods by which they endeavour to civilize and Christianize
the natives they have the reputation throughout the country of being
more successful than those who go there from any other country.Rhodes has given many contributions of land and
money to the American missionaries, and has on several occasions
complimented them by pronouncing their achievements unparalleled.A practical illustration will demonstrate the causes of the success of
the American missionary.An English missionary spent the first two
years after his arrival in the country in studying the natives' language
and in building a house for himself.In that time he had made no
converts.An American missionary arrived at almost the same time,
rented a hut, and hired interpreters.At the end of two years he had
one hundred and fifty converts, many more natives who were learning
useful occupations and trades, and had sent home a request for more
missionaries with which to extend his field.It is rather remarkable that the scouts who assisted in subduing the
American Indians should later be found on the African continent to
assist in the extermination of the blacks.In the Matabele and Mashona
campaigns of three years ago, Americans who scouted for Custer and Miles
on the Western plains were invaluable adjuncts to the British forces,
and in many instances did heroic work in finding the location of the
enemy and in making way for the American Maxim guns that were used in
the campaigns.The Americans in South Africa, although only about ten thousand in
number, have been of invaluable service to the land.They have taught
the farmers to farm, the miners to dig gold, and the statesmen to
govern.Their work has been a credit to the country which they continue
to revere, and whose flag they raise upon every proper occasion.They
have taken little part in the political disturbances of the Transvaal,
because they believe that the citizens of a republic should be allowed
to conduct its government according to their own idea of right and
justice, independently of the demands of those who are not citizens.CHAPTER XII

                         JOHANNESBURG OF TO-DAY


The palms and bamboos of Durban, the Zulu policemen and 'ricksha boys,
and the hospitable citizens have been left behind, and the little train
of English compartment cars, each with its destination "Johannesburg"
labelled conspicuously on its sides, is winding away through cane fields
and banana groves, past groups of open-eyed natives and solemn,
thin-faced Indian coolies.Pretty little farmers' cottages in settings of palms, mimosas, and
tropical plants are dotted in the green valleys winding around the
innumerable small hills that look for all the world like so many
inverted moss-covered china cups.Lumbering transport wagons behind a
score of sleek oxen, wincing under the fire of the far-reaching rawhide
in the hands of a sparsely clad Zulu driver, are met and passed in a
twinkling.Neatly thatched huts with natives lazily lolling in the sun
become more frequent as the train rolls on toward the interior, and the
greenness of the landscape is changing into the brown of dead verdure,
for it is the dry season--the South African winter.The hills become
more frequent, and the little locomotive goes more slowly, while the
train twists and writhes along its path like a huge python.Now it is on the hilltop from which the distant sea and its coast fringe
of green are visible on the one side, and nothing but treeless brown
mountain tops on the other.A minute later it plunges down the
hillside, along rocky precipices, over deep chasms, and then wearily
plods up the zigzag course of another hillside.For five hours or more
the monotony of miniature mountains continues, relieved by nothing more
interesting than the noise of the train and the hilarious laughter and
weird songs of a car load of Zulus bound for the gold fields.After
this comes an undulating plain and towns with far less interest in their
appearance than in their names.The traveller surfeited with Natal
scenery finds amusement and diversion in the conductor's call of Umbilo,
Umkomaas, Umgeni, Amanzimtoti, Isipingo, Mooi River, Zwartkop, or
Pietermaritzburg, but will not attempt to learn the proper pronunciation
of the names unless he has weeks at his command.[Illustration: Zulu maidens shaking hands.]Farther on in the journey an ostrich, escaped from a farm, stalks over
the plain, and, approaching to within several yards of the train, jogs
along for many miles, and perchance wheedles the engineer into impromptu
races.Hardly has the bird disappeared when on the wide veldt a herd of
buck galloping with their long heads down, or a large number of
wildebeest, plunging and jumping like animated hobby-horses, raise
clouds of dust as they dash away from the monster of iron and steam.Shortly afterward the train passes a waterfall almost thrice as lofty as
Niagara, but located in the middle of the plain, into whose surface the
water has riven a deep and narrow chasm.Since the balmy Indian Ocean has been left behind, the train has been
rising steadily, sometimes an inch in a mile but oftener a hundred feet,
and the air has grown cooler.The thousands of British soldiers at
Ladysmith are wearing heavy clothing; their horses, tethered in the open
air, are shivering, and far to the westward is the cause of it all--the
lofty, snow-covered peaks of the Dragon Mountain.Night comes on and
clothes the craggy mountains and broken valleys with varying shades of
sombreness.The moon outlines the snow far above, and with its rays
marks the lofty line where sky and mountain crest seem to join.Morning
light greets the train as it dashes down the mountain side, through the
passes that connect Natal with the Transvaal and out upon the withered
grass of the flat, uninteresting veldt of the Boer country.The South African veldt in all its winter hideousness lies before you.It stretches out in all directions--to the north and south, to the east
and west--and seems to have no boundaries.Its yellowish brownness eats
into the brain, and the eyes grow weary from the monotony of the scene.Hour after hour the train bears onward in a straight line, but the
landscape remains the same.But for noises and motions of the cars you
would imagine that the train was stationary, so far as change of scenery
is concerned.Occasionally a colony of huge ant-heaps or a few buck or
deer may be passed, but for hours it is veldt, veldt, veldt!An entire
day's journey, unrelieved except toward the end by a few straggling
towns of Boer farmhouses or the sheet-iron cabins of prospectors, bring
it to Heidelberg, once the metropolis as well as the capital of the
republic, but now pining because the former distinguishing mark has been
yielded to its neighbour, Johannesburg.As the shades of another night commence to fall, the veldt suddenly
assumes a new countenance.Lights begin to sparkle, buildings close
together appear, and scores of tall smokestacks tower against the
background of the sky.The presence of the smoke-stacks denote the
arrival at the Randt, and for twenty miles the train rushes along this
well-defined gold-yielding strip of land.Buildings, lights, stacks,
and people become more numerous as the train progresses into the city
limits of Johannesburg, and the traveller soon finds himself in the
middle of a crowd of enthusiastic welcoming and welcomed persons on the
platform of the station of the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche
Spoorweg-Maatschappij, and in the Golden City.The sudden change from the dreary lifelessness of the veldt to the
exciting crush and bustle of the station platform crowd is almost
bewildering, because it is so different from what is expected in
interior Africa.The station, a magnificent structure of stone and
iron, presents more animated scenes whenever trains arrive than the
Grand Central in New York or the Victoria in London, because every
passenger is invariably met at the train by all his friends and as many
of their friends as the station platform will accommodate.The crowd
which surges around this centre of the city's life is of a more
cosmopolitan character than that which can be found in any other city in
the world with the exceptions of Zanzibar and Port Said.Almost every
race is represented in the gathering, which is suggestive of a mass
meeting of the villagers of the Midway Plaisance at the Columbian
Exposition.In the crowd are stolid Anglo-Saxons shaking hands
effusively; enthusiastic Latins embracing each other; <DW64>s rubbing
noses and cheeks; smiling Japanese; cold, stern Chinese; Cingalese,
Russians, Malays, and Egyptians--all in their national costumes, and all
welcoming friends in their native manner and language.Meandering
through the crowd are several keen-eyed Boer policemen, commonly called
"Zarps," politely directing the attention of innocent-looking newcomers
to placards bearing the inscription "Pas op Zakkenrollers," which is the
Boer warning of pickpockets.After the traveller has forced a way through the crowd he is attacked by
a horde of cabmen who can teach tricks of the trade to the London and
New York night-hawks.Their equipages range from dilapidated broughams
to antique 'rickshas, but their charges are the same--"a quid," or five
dollars, either for a mile or a minute's ride.After the insults which
follow a refusal to enter one of their conveyances have subsided, the
agents of the hotels commence a vociferous campaign against the
newcomers, and very clever it is in its way.They are able to
distinguish a foreigner at one glance, and will change the name of the
hotel which they represent a score of times in as many seconds in order
to bag their quarry.For the patriotic American they have the New York
Hotel, the Denver House, the Hotel California, and many other hostelries
named after American cities.they will salute an American,
"Come up to the New York Hotel and patronize American enterprise."If
the traveller will accompany one of these agents he will find that all
the names apply to one hotel, which has an American name but is
conducted and patronized by a low class of foreigners.The victim of
misrepresentation will seek another hotel, and will be fortunate if he
finds comfortable quarters for less than ten dollars a day, or three
times the amount he would be called upon to pay at a far better hotel in
any American city of equal size.The privilege of fasting, or of
awakening in the morning with a layer of dust an eighth of an inch deep
on the counterpane and on the face may be ample return for the
extraordinary charges, but the stranger in the city is not apt to adopt
that view of the situation until he is acclimated.The person who has spent several days in crossing the veldt and enters
Johannesburg by night has a strange revelation before him when he is
awakened the following morning.He has been led to believe that the city
is a motley collection of corrugated-iron hovels, hastily constructed
cabins, and cheap public buildings.Instead he finds a beautiful city,
with well-paved streets, magnificent buildings of stone and brick,
expensive public buildings, and scores of palatial residences.Many
American cities of the same size and many times older can not show as
costly buildings or as fine public works.Hotels of five and six
stories, and occupying, in several instances, almost entire blocks, are
numerous; of office buildings costing a quarter of a million dollars
each there are half a score; banks, shops, and newspapers have three-
and four-story buildings of brick and stone, while there are hundreds of
other buildings that would be creditable to any large city in America or
Europe.The Government Building in the centre of the city is a
five-story granite structure of no mean architectural beauty.In the
suburbs are many magnificent private residences of mine owners and
managers who, although not permanent residents of the city, have
invested large amounts of money, so that the short time they spend in
the country may be amid luxurious and comfortable surroundings.One of the disagreeable features of living in Johannesburg is the dust
which is present everywhere during the dry season.It rises in great,
thick clouds on the surrounding veldt, and, obscuring the sun, wholly
envelops the city in semi-darkness.One minute the air is clear and
there is not a breath of wind; several minutes later a hurricane is
blowing and blankets of dust are falling.The dust clouds generally
rise west of the city, and almost totally eclipse the sun during their
progress over the plain.Sometimes the dust storms continue only a few
minutes, but very frequently the citizens are made uncomfortable by them
for days at a time.Whenever they arrive, the doors and windows of
buildings are tightly closed, business is practically at a standstill,
and every one is miserable.It penetrates
every building, however well protected, and it lodges in the food as
well as in the drink.Pedestrians on the street are unable to see ten
feet ahead, and are compelled to walk with head bowed and with
handkerchief over the mouth and nostrils.Umbrellas and parasols are
but slight protection against it.Only the miners, a thousand feet
below the surface, escape it.When the storm has subsided the entire
city is covered with a blanket of dust ranging in thickness from an inch
on the sidewalks to an eighth of an inch on the store counters,
furniture, and in pantries.It has never been computed how great a
quantity of the dust enters a man's lungs, but the feeling that it
engenders is one of colossal magnitude.Second to the dust, the main characteristic of Johannesburg is the
inhabitants' great struggle for sudden wealth.It is doubtful whether
there is one person in the city whose ambition is less than to become
wealthy in five years at least, and then to return to his native
country.It is not a chase after affluence; it is a stampede in which
every soul in the city endeavours to be in the van.In the city and in
the mines there are hundreds of honourable ways of becoming rich, but
there are thousands of dishonourable ones; and the morals of a mining
city are not always on the highest plane.There are business men of the
strictest probity and honesty, and men whose word is as good as their
bond, but there are many more who will allow their conscience to lie
dormant so long as they remain in the country.With them the passion is
to secure money, and whether they secure it by overcharging a regular
customer, selling illicit gold, or gambling at the stock exchanges is a
matter of small moment.Tradesmen and shopkeepers will charge according
to the apparel of the patron, and will brazenly acknowledge doing so if
reminded by the one who has paid two prices for like articles the same
day.Hotels charge according to the quantity of luggage the traveller
carries, and boarding-houses compute your wealth before presenting their
bills.Street-car fares and postage stamps alone do not fluctuate in
value, but the wise man counts his change.The experiences of an American with one large business house in the city
will serve as an example of the methods of some of those who are eager
to realize their ambitions.The American spent many weeks and much
patience and money in securing photographs throughout the country, and
took the plates to a large firm in Johannesburg for development and
printing.When he returned two weeks later he was informed that the
plates and prints had been delivered a week before, and neither prayers
nor threats secured a different answer.Justice in the courts is slow
and costly, and the American was obliged to leave the country without
his property.Shortly after his departure the firm of photographers
commenced selling a choice collection of new South African photographs
which, curiously, were of the same scenes and persons photographed by
the American.Gambling may be more general in some other cities, but it can not be
more public.The more refined gamblers patronize the two stock
exchanges, and there are but few too poor to indulge in that form of
dissipation.Probably nine tenths of the inhabitants of the city travel
the stock-exchange bypath to wealth or poverty.Women and boys are as
much infected by the fever as mine owners and managers, and it would not
be slandering the citizens to say that one fourth of the conversation
heard on the streets refers to the rise and fall of stocks.The popular gathering place in the city is the street in front of one of
the stock exchanges known as "The Chains."During the session of the
exchange the street is crowded with an excited throng of men, boys, and
even women, all flushed with the excitement of betting on the rise and
fall of mining stocks in the building.Clerks, office boys, and miners
spend the lunch hour at "The Chains," either to invest their wages or to
watch the market if their money is already invested.A fall in the
value of stocks is of far greater moment to them than war, famine, or
pestilence.The passion for gambling is also satisfied by a giant lottery scheme
known as "Sweepstakes," which has the sanction of the Government.Thousands of pounds are offered as prizes at the periodical drawings,
and no true Johannesburger ever fails to secure at least one ticket for
the drawing.When there are no sessions of the stock exchanges, no
sweepstakes, horse races, ball games, or other usual opportunities for
gambling, they will bet on the arrival of the Cape train, the length of
a sermon, or the number of lashes a <DW64> criminal can endure before
fainting.Drinking is a second diversion which occupies much of the time of the
average citizen, because of the great heat and the lack of amusement.The liquor that is drunk in Johannesburg in one year would make a stream
of larger proportions and far more healthier contents than the Vaal
River in the dry season.It is a rare occurrence to see a man drink
water unless it is concealed in brandy, and at night it is even rarer
that one is seen who is not drinking.Cape Smoke, the name given to a
liquor made in Cape Colony, is credited with the ability to kill a man
before he has taken the glass from his lips, but the popular Uitlander
beverage, brandy and soda, is even more fatal in its effects.Pure
liquor is almost unobtainable, and death-dealing counterfeits from
Delagoa Bay are the substitutes.Twenty-five cents for a glass of beer
and fifty cents for brandy and soda are not deterrent prices where
ordinary mine workers receive ten dollars a day and mine managers fifty
thousand dollars a year.Of social life there is little except such as is afforded by the clubs,
of which there are several of high standing.The majority of the men
left their families in their native countries on account of the severe
climate, and that fact, combined with the prevalent idea that the
weather is too torrid to do anything unnecessary, is responsible for
Johannesburg's lack of social amenity.There are occasional dances and
receptions, but they are participated in only by newcomers who have not
yet fallen under the spell of the South African sun.The Sunday night's
musical entertainments at the Wanderer's Club are practically the only
affairs to which the average Uitlander cares to go, because he can
clothe himself for comfort and be as dignified or as undignified as he
pleases.The true Johannesburger is the most independent man in the world.When
he meets a native on the sidewalk he promptly kicks him into the street,
and if the action is resented, bullies a Boer policeman into arresting
the offender.The policeman may demur and call the Johannesburger a
"Verdomde rooinek," but he will make the arrest or receive a drubbing.He may be arrested in turn, but he is ever willing and anxious to pay a
fine for the privilege of beating a "dumb Dutchman," as he calls him.He pays little attention to the laws of the country, because he has not
had the patience to learn what they consist of, and he rests content in
knowing that his home government will rescue him through diplomatic
channels if he should run counter to the laws.He cares nothing
concerning the government of the city except as it interferes with or
assists his own private interests, but he will take advantage of every
opportunity to defy the authority of the administrators of the laws.He
despises the Boers, and continually and maliciously ridicules them on
the slightest pretexts.Specially true is this of those newspapers
which are the representatives of the Uitlander population.Venomous
editorials against the Boer Government and people appear almost daily,
and serve to widen the breach between the two classes of inhabitants.The Boer newspapers for a long time ignored the assaults of the
Uitlander press, but recently they have commenced to retaliate, and the
editorial war is a bitter one.An extract from the Randt Post will show
the nature and depth of bitterness displayed by the two classes of
newspapers:

"Though Dr.Leyds may be right, and the Johannesburg population safe in
case of war, we advise that, at the first act of war on the English
side, the women and children, and well-disposed persons of this town, be
given twenty-four hours to leave, and then the whole place be shot down;
in the event, we repeat--which God forbid!--of war coming."If, indeed, there must be shooting, then it will be on account of
seditious words and deeds of Johannesburg agitators and the
co-shareholders in Cape Town and London, and the struggle will be
promoted for no other object than the possession of the gold.Well,
then, let such action be taken that the perpetrators of these turbulent
proceedings shall, if caught, be thrown into the deep shafts of their
mines, with the debris of the batteries for a costly shroud, and that
the whole of Johannesburg, with the exception of the Afrikander wards,
be converted into a gigantic rubbish heap to serve as a mighty tombstone
for the shot-down authors of a monstrous deed."If it be known that these valuable buildings and the lives of the
wire-pullers are the price of the mines, then people will take good heed
before the torch of war is set alight.Friendly talks and protests are
no use with England.Let force and rough violence be opposed to the
intrigues and plots of Old England, and only then will the Boer remain
master."It is on Saturday nights that the bitterness of the Uitlander population
is most noticeable, since then the workers from the mines along the
Randt gather in the city and discuss their grievances, which then become
magnified with every additional glass of liquor.It is then that the
city streets and places of amusement and entertainment are crowded with
a throng that finds relaxation by abusing the Boers.The theatre
audiences laugh loudest at the coarsest jests made at the expense of the
Boers, and the bar-room crowds talk loudest when the Boers are the
subject of discussion.The abuse continues even when the not-too-sober
Uitlander, wheeled homeward at day-break by his faithful Zulu 'ricksha
boy, casts imprecations upon the Boer policeman who is guarding his
property.Johannesburg is one of the most expensive places of residence in the
world.Situated in the interior of the continent, thousands of miles
distant from the sources of food and supplies, it is natural that
commodities should be high in price.Almost all food stuffs are carried
thither from America, Europe, and Australia, and consequently the
original cost is trebled by the addition of carriage and customs duties.The most common articles of food are twice as costly as in America,
while such commodities as eggs, imported from Madeira, frequently are
scarce at a dollar a dozen.Butter from America is fifty cents a pound,
and fruits and vegetables from Cape Colony and Natal are equally high in
price and frequently unobtainable.Good board can not be obtained
anywhere for less than five dollars a day, while the best hotels and
clubs charge thrice that amount.Rentals are exceptionally high owing
to the extraordinary land values and the cost of erecting buildings.A
small, brick-lined, corrugated-iron cottage of four rooms, such as a
married mine-employee occupies, costs from fifty to seventy-five dollars
a month, while a two-story brick house in a respectable quarter of the
city rents for one hundred dollars a month.Every object in the city is mutely expressive of a vast expenditure of
money.The idea that everything--the buildings, food, horses, clothing,
machinery, and all that is to be seen--has been carried across oceans
and continents unconsciously associates itself with the cost that it has
entailed.Four-story buildings that in New York or London would be
passed without remark cause mental speculation concerning their cost,
merely because it is so patent that every brick, nail, and board in them
has been conveyed thousands of miles from foreign shores.Electric
lights and street cars, so common in American towns, appear abnormal in
the city in the veldt, and instantly suggest an outlay of great amounts
of money even to the minds which are not accustomed to reducing
everything to dollars and pounds.Leaving the densely settled centre of
the city, where land is worth as much as choice plots on Broadway, and
wandering into the suburbs where the great mines are, the idea of cost
is more firmly implanted into the mind.The huge buildings, covering
acres of ground and thousands of tons of the most costly machinery, seem
to be of natural origin rather than of human handiwork.It is almost
beyond belief that men should be daring enough to convey hundreds of
steamer loads of lumber and machinery halfway around the world at
inestimable cost merely for the yellow metal that Nature has hidden so
far distant from the great centres of population.The cosmopolitanism of the city is a feature which impresses itself most
indelibly upon the mind.In a half-day's stroll in the city
representatives of all the peoples of the earth, with the possible
exception of the American Indian, Eskimos, and South Sea islanders, will
be seen variously engaged in the struggle for gold.On the floors of the
stock exchanges are money barons or their agents, as energetic and sharp
as their prototypes of Wall and Throckmorton Streets.These are chiefly
British, French, and German.Outside, between "The Chains," are readily
discernible the distinguishing features of the Americans, Afrikanders,
Portuguese, Russians, Spaniards, and Italians.A few steps distant is
Commissioner Street, the principal thoroughfare, where the surging
throng is composed of so many different racial representatives that an
analysis of it is not an easy undertaking.He is considered an expert
who can name the native country of every man on the street, and if he
can distinguish between an American and a Canadian he is credited with
being a wise man.In the throng is the tall, well-clothed Briton, with silk hat and frock
coat, closely followed by a sparsely clad Matabele, bearing his master's
account books or golf-sticks.Near them a Chinaman, in circular
red-topped hat and flowing silk robes, is having a heated argument in
broken English with an Irish hansom-driver.Crossing the street are two
stately Arabs, in turbans and white robes, jostling easy-going Indian
coolies with their canes.Bare-headed Cingalese, their long, shiny hair
tied in knots and fastened down with circular combs, noiselessly gliding
along, or stopping suddenly to trade Oriental jewelry for Christian's
money; Malays, Turks, Egyptians, Persians, and New-Zealanders, each with
his distinctive costume; Hottentots, Matabeles, Zulus, Mashonas,
Basutos, and the representatives of hundreds of the other native races
south of the Zambezi pass by in picturesque lack of bodily adornment.It is an imposing array, too, for the majority of the throng is composed
of moderately wealthy persons, and even in the centre of Africa wealth
carries with it opportunities for display.John Chinaman will ride in a
'ricksha to his joss-house with as much conscious pride as the European
or American will sit in his brougham or automobile.Money is as easily
spent as made in Johannesburg, and it is a cosmopolitan habit to spend
it in a manner so that everybody will know it is being spent.To make a
display of some sort is necessary to the citizen's happiness.If he is
not of sufficient importance to have his name in the subsidized
newspapers daily he will seek notoriety by wearing a thousand pounds'
worth of diamonds on the street or making astonishing bets at the
race-track.In that little universe on the veldt every man tries to be
superior to his neighbour in some manner that may be patent to all the
city.When it is taken into consideration that almost all the
contestants were among the cleverest and shrewdest men in the countries
whence they came to Johannesburg, and not among the riffraff and
failures, then the intensity of the race for superiority can be
imagined.Johannesburg might be named the City of Surprises.Its youthful
existence has been fraught with astonishing works.It was born in a
day, and one day's revolution almost ended its existence.It grew from
the desert veldt into a garden of gold.Its granite residences, brick
buildings, and iron and steel mills sprang from blades of grass and
sprigs of weeds.It has transformed the beggar into a millionaire, and
it has seen starving men in its streets.It harbours men from every
nation and climate, but it is a home for few.It is far from the centre
of the earth's civilization, but it has often attracted the whole
world's attention.It supports its children, but by them it is cursed.Its god is in the earth upon which it rests, and its hope of future life
in that which it brings forth.And all this because a man upturned the
soil and called it gold.It was illumined by a distinct, yet soft
and subdued light, which harmonised with the beautiful repose of the
surrounding forms, and with the exotic perfume that was wafted about.A gallery led from this hall to an inner hall of quite a different
character; fantastic, glittering, variegated; full of strange shapes and
dazzling objects.The roof was carved and gilt in that honeycomb style prevalent in the
Saracenic buildings; the walls were hung with leather stamped in rich
and vivid patterns; the floor was a flood of mosaic; about were statues
of <DW64>s of human size with faces of wild expression, and holding
in their outstretched hands silver torches that blazed with an almost
painful brilliancy.From this inner hall a double staircase of white marble led to the grand
suite of apartments.These saloons, lofty, spacious, and numerous, had been decorated
principally in encaustic by the most celebrated artists of Munich.The
three principal rooms were only separated from each other by columns,
covered with rich hangings, on this night drawn aside.The decoration
of each chamber was appropriate to its purpose.On the walls of the
ball-room nymphs and heroes moved in measure in Sicilian landscapes,
or on the azure shores of Aegean waters.From the ceiling beautiful
divinities threw garlands on the guests, who seemed surprised that
the roses, unwilling to quit Olympus, would not descend on earth.The general effect of this fair chamber was heightened, too, by
that regulation of the house which did not permit any benches in the
ball-room.That dignified assemblage who are always found ranged in
precise discipline against the wall, did not here mar the flowing grace
of the festivity.The chaperons had no cause to complain.A large saloon
abounded in ottomans and easy chairs at their service, where their
delicate charges might rest when weary, or find distraction when not
engaged.All the world were at this fete of Sidonia.It exceeded in splendour and
luxury every entertainment that had yet been given.The highest rank,
even Princes of the blood, beauty, fashion, fame, all assembled in a
magnificent and illuminated palace, resounding with exquisite melody.Coningsby, though somewhat depressed, was not insensible to the magic
of the scene.Since the passage in the gardens of the Luxembourg, that
tone, that glance, he had certainly felt much relieved, happier.And yet
if all were, with regard to Sidonia, as unfounded as he could possibly
desire, where was he then?Had he forgotten his grandfather, that fell
look, that voice of intense detestation?The Spanish
parentage of Edith had only more perplexed Coningsby.There could be no connection between a Catalan family and his
mother, the daughter of a clergyman in a midland county.That there
was any relationship between the Millbank family and his mother was
contradicted by the conviction in which he had been brought up, that
his mother had no relations; that she returned to England utterly
friendless; without a relative, a connection, an acquaintance to whom
she could appeal.Her complete forlornness was stamped upon his brain.Tender as were his years when he was separated from her, he could yet
recall the very phrases in which she deplored her isolation; and there
were numerous passages in her letters which alluded to it.Coningsby
had taken occasion to sound the Wallingers on this subject; but he felt
assured, from the manner in which his advances were met, that they knew
nothing of his mother, and attributed the hostility of Mr.Millbank
to his grandfather, solely to political emulation and local rivalries.That was a fact; a clue
which ultimately, he was persuaded, must lead to some solution.Coningsby had met with great social success at Paris.He was at once a
favourite.The Parisian dames decided in his favour.He was a specimen
of the highest style of English beauty, which is popular in France.The men also liked him; he
had not quite arrived at that age when you make enemies.The moment,
therefore, that he found himself in the saloons of Sidonia, he was
accosted by many whose notice was flattering; but his eye wandered,
while he tried to be courteous and attempted to be sprightly.He had nearly reached the ball-room when he met her.She was on
the arm of Lord Beaumanoir, who had made her acquaintance at Rome, and
originally claimed it as the member of a family who, as the reader may
perhaps not forget, had experienced some kindnesses from the Millbanks.There were mutual and hearty recognitions between the young men; great
explanations where they had been, what they were doing, where they were
going.Lord Beaumanoir told Coningsby he had introduced steeple-chases
at Rome, and had parted with Sunbeam to the nephew of a Cardinal.Coningsby securing Edith's hand for the next dance, they all moved on
together to her aunt.Lady Wallinger was indulging in some Roman reminiscences with the
Marquess.'And you are not going to Astrachan to-morrow?''Not to-morrow,' said Coningsby.'You know that you said once that life was too stirring in these days to
permit travel to a man?''I wish nothing was stirring,' said Coningsby.All that I wish is, that this fete should never end.''Is it possible that you can be capricious?'Am I capricious because I dislike change?''It was the air of the Luxembourg that reminded me of the Desert,' said
Coningsby.Soon after this Coningsby led Edith to the dance.It was at a ball that
he had first met her at Paris, and this led to other reminiscences;
all most interesting.All mysteries, all
difficulties, were driven from his recollection; he lived only in the
exciting and enjoyable present.Some time after this, Coningsby, who was inevitably separated from
Edith, met his host.'Where have you been, child,' said Sidonia, 'that I have not seen you
for some days?'And I must think, I suppose, of Cambridge.''Well, you have seen something; you will find it more profitable when
you have digested it: and you will have opportunity.That's the true
spring of wisdom: meditate over the past.Adventure and Contemplation
share our being like day and night.'The resolute departure for England on the morrow had already changed
into a supposed necessity of thinking of returning to Cambridge.In
fact, Coningsby felt that to quit Paris and Edith was an impossibility.He silenced the remonstrance of his conscience by the expedient of
keeping a half-term, and had no difficulty in persuading himself that
a short delay in taking his degree could not really be of the slightest
consequence.The guests at a French ball are not seen to
advantage at this period.The custom of separating the sexes for this
refreshment, and arranging that the ladies should partake of it by
themselves, though originally founded in a feeling of consideration
and gallantry, and with the determination to secure, under all
circumstances, the convenience and comfort of the fair sex, is really,
in its appearance and its consequences, anything but European, and
produces a scene which rather reminds one of the harem of a sultan than
a hall of chivalry.To judge from the countenances of the favoured fair,
they are not themselves particularly pleased; and when their repast is
over they necessarily return to empty halls, and are deprived of the
dance at the very moment when they may feel most inclined to participate
in its graceful excitement.These somewhat ungracious circumstances, however, were not attendant on
the festival of this night.There was opened in the Hotel of Sidonia for
the first time a banqueting-room which could contain with convenience
all the guests.It was a vast chamber of white marble, the golden panels
of the walls containing festive sculptures by Schwanthaler, relieved by
encaustic tinting.In its centre was a fountain, a group of Bacchantes
encircling Dionysos; and from this fountain, as from a star, diverged
the various tables from which sprang orange-trees in fruit and flower.The banquet had but one fault; Coningsby was separated from Edith.The
Duchess of Grand Cairo, the beautiful wife of the heir of one of the
Imperial illustrations, had determined to appropriate Coningsby as
her cavalier for the moment.Distracted, he made his escape; but his
wandering eye could not find the object of its search; and he fell
prisoner to the charming Princess de Petitpoix, a Carlist chieftain,
whose witty words avenged the cause of fallen dynasties and a cashiered
nobility.Behold a scene brilliant in fancy, magnificent in splendour!All the
circumstances of his life at this moment were such as acted forcibly
on the imagination of Coningsby.Separated from Edith, he had still the
delight of seeing her the paragon of that bright company, the consummate
being whom he adored!and who had spoken to him in a voice sweeter than
a serenade, and had bestowed on him a glance softer than moonlight!The
lord of the palace, more distinguished even for his capacity than his
boundless treasure, was his chosen friend; gained under circumstances
of romantic interest, when the reciprocal influence of their personal
qualities was affected by no accessory knowledge of their worldly
positions.He himself was in the very bloom of youth and health; the
child of a noble house, rich for his present wants, and with a future of
considerable fortunes.Entrancing love and dazzling friendship, a
high ambition and the pride of knowledge, the consciousness of a great
prosperity, the vague, daring energies of the high pulse of twenty-one,
all combined to stimulate his sense of existence, which, as he looked
around him at the beautiful objects and listened to the delicious
sounds, seemed to him a dispensation of almost supernatural ecstasy.About an hour after this, the ball-room still full, but the other
saloons gradually emptying, Coningsby entered a chamber which seemed
deserted.Yet he heard sounds, as it were, of earnest conversation.It
was the voice that invited his progress; he advanced another step, then
suddenly stopped.There were two individuals in the room, by whom he was
unnoticed.They were sitting on a
sofa, Sidonia holding her hand and endeavouring, as it seemed, to soothe
her.Her tones were tremulous; but the expression of her face was fond
and confiding.Coningsby instantly
withdrew, yet could not escape hearing an earnest request from Edith to
her companion that he would write to her.In a few seconds Coningsby had quitted the hotel of Sidonia, and the
next day found him on his road to England.CHAPTER I.


It was one of those gorgeous and enduring sunsets that seemed to linger
as if they wished to celebrate the mid-period of the year.Perhaps the
beautiful hour of impending twilight never exercises a more effective
influence on the soul than when it descends on the aspect of some
distant and splendid city.What a contrast between the serenity and
repose of our own bosoms and the fierce passions and destructive cares
girt in the walls of that multitude whose domes and towers rise in
purple lustre against the resplendent horizon!And yet the disturbing emotions of existence and the bitter inheritance
of humanity should exercise but a modified sway, and entail but a light
burden, within the circle of the city into which the next scene of our
history leads us.For it is the sacred city of study, of learning,
and of faith; and the declining beam is resting on the dome of the
Radcliffe, lingering on the towers of Christchurch and Magdalen,
sanctifying the spires and pinnacles of holy St.A young Oxonian, who had for some time been watching the city in the
sunset, from a rising ground in its vicinity, lost, as it would seem, in
meditation, suddenly rose, and looking at his watch, as if remindful
of some engagement, hastened his return at a rapid pace.He reached
the High Street as the Blenheim light post coach dashed up to the Star
Hotel, with that brilliant precision which even the New Generation can
remember, and yet which already ranks among the traditions of English
manners.A peculiar and most animating spectacle used to be the arrival
of a firstrate light coach in a country town!The small machine,
crowded with so many passengers, the foaming and curvetting leaders, the
wheelers more steady and glossy, as if they had not done their ten miles
in the hour, the triumphant bugle of the guard, and the haughty routine
with which the driver, as he reached his goal, threw his whip to the
obedient ostlers in attendance; and, not least, the staring crowd, a
little awestruck, and looking for the moment at the lowest official of
the stable with considerable respect, altogether made a picture which
one recollects with cheerfulness, and misses now in many a dreary
market-town.Our Oxonian was a young man about the middle height, and naturally of a
thoughtful expression and rather reserved mien.The general character of
his countenance was, indeed, a little stern, but it broke into an almost
bewitching smile, and a blush suffused his face, as he sprang forward
and welcomed an individual about the same age, who had jumped off the
Blenheim.my dear Millbank, we have met at last,' said his friend.And here we must for a moment revert to what had occurred to Coningsby
since he so suddenly quitted Paris at the beginning of the year.The
wound he had received was deep to one unused to wounds.Yet, after all,
none had outraged his feelings, no one had betrayed his hopes.He had
loved one who had loved another.And
yet 'tis a bitter pang under any circumstances to find another preferred
to yourself.It is about the same blow as one would probably feel if
falling from a balloon.Your Icarian flight melts into a grovelling
existence, scarcely superior to that of a sponge or a coral, or redeemed
only from utter insensibility by your frank detestation of your rival.It is quite impossible to conceal that Coningsby had imbibed for Sidonia
a certain degree of aversion, which, in these days of exaggerated
phrase, might even be described as hatred.And there had seemed between them a sympathy so native and spontaneous,
creating at once the charm of intimacy without any of the disenchanting
attributes that are occasionally its consequence.He would recall the
tones of her voice, the expression of her soft dark eye, the airy spirit
and frank graciousness, sometimes even the flattering blush, with which
she had ever welcomed one of whom she had heard so long and so kindly.It seemed, to use a sweet and homely phrase, that they were made for
each other; the circumstances of their mutual destinies might have
combined into one enchanting fate.And yet, had she accorded him that peerless boon, her heart, with what
aspect was he to communicate this consummation of all his hopes to his
grandfather, ask Lord Monmouth for his blessing, and the gracious favour
of an establishment for the daughter of his foe, of a man whose name was
never mentioned except to cloud his visage?what was that mystery
that connected the haughty house of Coningsby with the humble blood of
the Lancashire manufacturer?Why was the portrait of his mother beneath
the roof of Millbank?Coningsby had delicately touched upon the subject
both with Edith and the Wallingers, but the result of his inquiries
only involved the question in deeper gloom.Edith had none but maternal
relatives: more than once she had mentioned this, and the Wallingers, on
other occasions, had confirmed the remark.Coningsby had sometimes drawn
the conversation to pictures, and he would remind her with playfulness
of their first unconscious meeting in the gallery of the Rue Tronchet;
then he remembered that Mr.Millbank was fond of pictures; then he
recollected some specimens of Mr.Millbank's collection, and after
touching on several which could not excite suspicion, he came to
'a portrait, a portrait of a lady; was it a portrait or an ideal
countenance?'Edith thought she had heard it was a portrait, but she was by no means
certain, and most assuredly was quite unacquainted with the name of the
original, if there were an original.Coningsby addressed himself to the point with Sir Joseph.He inquired of
the uncle explicitly whether he knew anything on the subject.Sir Joseph
was of opinion that it was something that Millbank had somewhere 'picked
up.'Millbank used often to 'pick up' pictures.Disappointed in his love, Coningsby sought refuge in the excitement
of study, and in the brooding imagination of an aspiring spirit.The
softness of his heart seemed to have quitted him for ever.He recurred
to his habitual reveries of political greatness and public distinction.And as it ever seemed to him that no preparation could be complete
for the career which he planned for himself, he devoted himself with
increased ardour to that digestion of knowledge which converts it into
wisdom.His life at Cambridge was now a life of seclusion.With the
exception of a few Eton friends, he avoided all society.And, indeed,
his acquisitions during this term were such as few have equalled, and
could only have been mastered by a mental discipline of a severe and
exalted character.At the end of the term Coningsby took his degree, and
in a few days was about to quit that university where, on the whole,
he had passed three serene and happy years in the society of fond and
faithful friends, and in ennobling pursuits.He had many plans for his
impending movements, yet none of them very mature ones.Lord Vere wished
Coningsby to visit his family in the north, and afterwards to go to
Scotland together: Coningsby was more inclined to travel for a year.Amid this hesitation a circumstance occurred which decided him to adopt
neither of these courses.It was Commencement, and coming out of the quadrangle of St.John's,
Coningsby came suddenly upon Sir Joseph and Lady Wallinger, who were
visiting the marvels and rarities of the university.Coningsby was a little embarrassed, for he could not forget the abrupt
manner in which he had parted from them; but they greeted him with
so much cordiality that he instantly recovered himself, and, turning,
became their companion.He hardly ventured to ask after Edith: at
length, in a depressed tone and a hesitating manner, he inquired whether
they had lately seen Miss Millbank.He was himself surprised at the
extreme light-heartedness which came over him the moment he heard she
was in England, at Millbank, with her family.He always very much liked
Lady Wallinger, but this morning he hung over her like a lover, lavished
on her unceasing and the most delicate attentions, seemed to exist only
in the idea of making the Wallingers enjoy and understand Cambridge;
and no one else was to be their guide at any place or under any
circumstances.He told them exactly what they were to see; how they were
to see it; when they were to see it.He told them of things which nobody
did see, but which they should.He insisted that Sir Joseph should dine
with him in hall; Sir Joseph could not think of leaving Lady Wallinger;
Lady Wallinger could not think of Sir Joseph missing an opportunity that
might never offer again.Besides, they might both join her after dinner.Except to give her husband a dinner, Coningsby evidently intended never
to leave her side.And the next morning, the occasion favourable, being alone with the
lady, Sir Joseph bustling about a carriage, Coningsby said suddenly,
with a countenance a little disturbed, and in a low voice, 'I was
pleased, I mean surprised, to hear that there was still a Miss Millbank;
I thought by this time she might have borne another name?'Lady Wallinger looked at him with an expression of some perplexity, and
then said, 'Yes, Edith was much admired; but she need not be precipitate
in marrying.Marriage is for a woman _the_ event.Edith is too precious
to be carelessly bestowed.''But I understood,' said Coningsby, 'when I left Paris,' and here, he
became very confused, 'that Miss Millbank was engaged, on the point of
marriage.''I am sure that Edith would never marry Monsieur de Sidonia, nor
Monsieur de Sidonia, Edith.'Possibly,' said Lady Wallinger; 'but he never even intimated his
admiration.''But he was very attentive to Miss Millbank?''Not more than our intimate friendship authorised, and might expect.''You have known Sidonia a long time?''It was Monsieur de Sidonia's father who introduced us to the care
of Mr.Wallinger,' said Lady Wallinger, 'and therefore I have ever
entertained for his son a sincere regard.Besides, I look upon him as
a compatriot.Recently he has been even more than usually kind to us,
especially to Edith.While we were at Paris he recovered for her a great
number of jewels which had been left to her by her uncle in Spain;
and, what she prized infinitely more, the whole of her mother's
correspondence which she maintained with this relative since her
marriage.Nothing but the influence of Sidonia could have effected this.Therefore, of course, Edith is attached to him almost as much as I am.In short, he is our dearest friend; our counsellor in all our cares.But
as for marrying him, the idea is ridiculous to those who know Monsieur
Sidonia.No earthly consideration would ever induce him to impair that
purity of race on which he prides himself.Besides, there are other
obvious objections which would render an alliance between him and my
niece utterly impossible: Edith is quite as devoted to her religion as
Monsieur Sidonia can be to his race.'A ray of light flashed on the brain of Coningsby as Lady Wallinger said
these words.The agitated interview, which never could be explained
away, already appeared in quite a different point of view.He became
pensive, remained silent, was relieved when Sir Joseph, whose return he
had hitherto deprecated, reappeared.Coningsby learnt in the course of
the day that the Wallingers were about to make, and immediately, a visit
to Hellingsley; their first visit; indeed, this was the first year that
Mr.Millbank had taken up his abode there.He did not much like the
change of life, Sir Joseph told Coningsby, but Edith was delighted with
Hellingsley, which Sir Joseph understood was a very distinguished place,
with fine gardens, of which his niece was particularly fond.When Coningsby returned to his rooms, those rooms which he was soon
about to quit for ever, in arranging some papers preparatory to his
removal, his eye lighted on a too-long unanswered letter of Oswald
Millbank.Coningsby had often projected a visit to Oxford, which he much
desired to make, but hitherto it had been impossible for him to effect
it, except in the absence of Millbank; and he had frequently postponed
it that he might combine his first visit to that famous seat of learning
with one to his old schoolfellow and friend.And immediately Coningsby wrote to apprise Millbank that he had
taken his degree, was free, and prepared to pay him immediately the
long-projected visit.Three years and more had elapsed since they had
quitted Eton.What new ideas, new
feelings, vast and novel knowledge!Though they had not met, they were
nevertheless familiar with the progress and improvement of each other's
minds.Their suggestive correspondence was too valuable to both of them
to have been otherwise than cherished.And now they were to meet on
the eve of entering that world for which they had made so sedulous a
preparation.There are few things in life more interesting than an unrestrained
interchange of ideas with a congenial spirit, and there are few things
more rare.How very seldom do you encounter in the world a man of great
abilities, acquirements, experience, who will unmask his mind, unbutton
his brains, and pour forth in careless and picturesque phrase all the
results of his studies and observation; his knowledge of men, books, and
nature.On the contrary, if a man has by any chance what he conceives
an original idea, he hoards it as if it were old gold; and rather avoids
the subject with which he is most conversant, from fear that you may
appropriate his best thoughts.One of the principal causes of our
renowned dulness in conversation is our extreme intellectual jealousy.It must be admitted that in this respect authors, but especially poets,
bear the palm.They never think they are sufficiently appreciated, and
live in tremor lest a brother should distinguish himself.Artists have
the repute of being nearly as bad.And as for a small rising politician,
a clever speech by a supposed rival or suspected candidate for office
destroys his appetite and disturbs his slumbers.One of the chief delights and benefits of travel is, that one is
perpetually meeting men of great abilities, of original mind, and rare
acquirements, who will converse without reserve.In these discourses
the intellect makes daring leaps and marvellous advances.The tone that
colours our afterlife is often caught in these chance colloquies, and
the bent given that shapes a career.And yet perhaps there is no occasion when the heart is more open, the
brain more quick, the memory more rich and happy, or the tongue more
prompt and eloquent, than when two school-day friends, knit by every
sympathy of intelligence and affection, meet at the close of their
college careers, after a long separation, hesitating, as it were, on
the verge of active life, and compare together their conclusions of the
interval; impart to each other all their thoughts and secret plans
and projects; high fancies and noble aspirations; glorious visions of
personal fame and national regeneration.Man is never so manly as when he feels deeply, acts boldly, and
expresses himself with frankness and with fervour.Most assuredly there never was a congress of friendship wherein more was
said and felt than in this meeting, so long projected, and yet perhaps
on the whole so happily procrastinated, between Coningsby and Millbank.In a moment they seemed as if they had never parted.Their faithful
correspondence indeed had maintained the chain of sentiment unbroken.Not an author that had influenced their taste or judgment
but was canvassed and criticised; not a theory they had framed or a
principle they had adopted that was not confessed.Often, with boyish
glee still lingering with their earnest purpose, they shouted as they
discovered that they had formed the same opinion or adopted the same
conclusion.They talked all day and late into the night.They condensed
into a week the poignant conclusions of three years of almost unbroken
study.And one night, as they sat together in Millbank's rooms at
Oriel, their conversation having for some time taken a political colour,
Millbank said,

'Now tell me, Coningsby, exactly what you conceive to be the state of
parties in this country; for it seems to me that if we penetrate the
surface, the classification must be more simple than their many names
would intimate.''The principle of the exclusive constitution of England having been
conceded by the Acts of 1827-8-32,' said Coningsby, 'a party has arisen
in the State who demand that the principle of political liberalism
shall consequently be carried to its extent; which it appears to them is
impossible without getting rid of the fragments of the old constitution
that remain.This is the destructive party; a party with distinct and
intelligible principles.They seek a specific for the evils of our
social system in the general suffrage of the population.'They are resisted by another party, who, having given up exclusion,
would only embrace as much liberalism as is necessary for the moment;
who, without any embarrassing promulgation of principles, wish to keep
things as they find them as long as they can, and then will manage them
as they find them as well as they can; but as a party must have the
semblance of principles, they take the names of the things that they
have destroyed.Thus they are devoted to the prerogatives of the Crown,
although in truth the Crown has been stripped of every one of its
prerogatives; they affect a great veneration for the constitution in
Church and State, though every one knows that the constitution in Church
and State no longer exists; they are ready to stand or fall with the
"independence of the Upper House of Parliament", though, in practice,
they are perfectly aware that, with their sanction, "the Upper House"
has abdicated its initiatory functions, and now serves only as a court
of review of the legislation of the House of Commons.Whenever public
opinion, which this party never attempts to form, to educate, or to
lead, falls into some violent perplexity, passion, or caprice, this
party yields without a struggle to the impulse, and, when the storm has
passed, attempts to obstruct and obviate the logical and, ultimately,
the inevitable results of the very measures they have themselves
originated, or to which they have consented.'I care not whether men are called Whigs or Tories, Radicals or
Chartists, or by what nickname a bustling and thoughtless race may
designate themselves; but these two divisions comprehend at present the
English nation.'With regard to the first school, I for one have no faith in the
remedial qualities of a government carried on by a neglected democracy,
who, for three centuries, have received no education.What prospect does
it offer us of those high principles of conduct with which we have
fed our imaginations and strengthened our will?I perceive none of the
elements of government that should secure the happiness of a people and
the greatness of a realm.'But in my opinion, if Democracy be combated only by Conservatism,
Democracy must triumph, and at no distant date.The man who enters public life at this epoch has to choose
between Political Infidelity and a Destructive Creed.''This, then,' said Millbank, 'is the dilemma to which we are brought
by nearly two centuries of Parliamentary Monarchy and Parliamentary
Church.'''Tis true,' said Coningsby.'We cannot conceal it from ourselves,
that the first has made Government detested, and the second Religion
disbelieved.''Many men in this country,' said Millbank, 'and especially in the class
to which I belong, are reconciled to the contemplation of democracy;
because they have accustomed themselves to believe, that it is the
only power by which we can sweep away those sectional privileges and
interests that impede the intelligence and industry of the community.''And yet,' said Coningsby, 'the only way to terminate what, in the
language of the present day, is called Class Legislation, is not to
entrust power to classes.You would find a Locofoco majority as much
addicted to Class Legislation as a factitious aristocracy.The only
power that has no class sympathy is the Sovereign.''But suppose the case of an arbitrary Sovereign, what would be your
check against him?''Suppose it was to vote itself perpetual?''And is public opinion of less influence on an individual than on a
body?'A nation may be misled, may be
corrupt.''If the nation that elects the Parliament be corrupt, the elected body
will resemble it.But this
only shows that there is something to be considered beyond forms of
government, national character.And herein mainly should we repose our
hopes.If a nation be led to aim at the good and the great, depend upon
it, whatever be its form, the government will respond to its convictions
and its sentiments.''Far from it: I look upon political change as the greatest of evils,
for it comprehends all.But if we have no faith in the permanence of
the existing settlement, if the very individuals who established it are,
year after year, proposing their modifications or their reconstructions;
so also, while we uphold what exists, ought we to prepare ourselves for
the change we deem impending?'Now I would not that either ourselves, or our fellow-citizens, should
be taken unawares as in 1832, when the very men who opposed the Reform
Bill offered contrary objections to it which destroyed each other, so
ignorant were they of its real character, its historical causes, its
political consequences.We should now so act that, when the occasions
arrives, we should clearly comprehend what we want, and have formed an
opinion as to the best means by which that want can be supplied.'For this purpose I would accustom the public mind to the contemplation
of an existing though torpid power in the constitution, capable
of removing our social grievances, were we to transfer to it those
prerogatives which the Parliament has gradually usurped, and used in
a manner which has produced the present material and moral
disorganisation.The House of Commons is the house of a few; the
Sovereign is the sovereign of all.The proper leader of the people is
the individual who sits upon the throne.''Then you abjure the Representative principle?'Representation is not necessarily, or even in a principal
sense, Parliamentary.Parliament is not sitting at this moment, and yet
the nation is represented in its highest as well as in its most minute
interests.I see in the
newspaper this morning that a pedagogue has brutally chastised his
pupil.We must not forget that a
principle of government is reserved for our days that we shall not find
in our Aristotles, or even in the forests of Tacitus, nor in our Saxon
Wittenagemotes, nor in our Plantagenet parliaments.Opinion is now
supreme, and Opinion speaks in print.The representation of the Press is
far more complete than the representation of Parliament.Parliamentary
representation was the happy device of a ruder age, to which it was
admirably adapted: an age of semi-civilisation, when there was a leading
class in the community; but it exhibits many symptoms of desuetude.It is controlled by a system of representation more vigorous and
comprehensive; which absorbs its duties and fulfils them more
efficiently, and in which discussion is pursued on fairer terms, and
often with more depth and information.''And to what power would you entrust the function of Taxation?''To some power that would employ it more discreetly than in creating
our present amount of debt, and in establishing our present system of
imposts.'In a word, true wisdom lies in the policy that would effect its ends
by the influence of opinion, and yet by the means of existing forms.Nevertheless, if we are forced to revolutions, let us propose to our
consideration the idea of a free monarchy, established on fundamental
laws, itself the apex of a vast pile of municipal and local government,
ruling an educated people, represented by a free and intellectual press.Before such a royal authority, supported by such a national opinion, the
sectional anomalies of our country would disappear.Under such a system,
where qualification would not be parliamentary, but personal, even
statesmen would be educated; we should have no more diplomatists who
could not speak French, no more bishops ignorant of theology, no more
generals-in-chief who never saw a field.'Now there is a polity adapted to our laws, our institutions, our
feelings, our manners, our traditions; a polity capable of great ends
and appealing to high sentiments; a polity which, in my opinion, would
render government an object of national affection, which would terminate
sectional anomalies, assuage religious heats, and extinguish Chartism.''You said to me yesterday,' said Millbank after a pause, 'quoting the
words of another, which you adopted, that Man was made to adore and to
obey.Now you have shown to me the means by which you deem it possible
that government might become no longer odious to the subject; you have
shown how man may be induced to obey.But there are duties and interests
for man beyond political obedience, and social comfort, and national
greatness, higher interests and greater duties.How would you deal
with their spiritual necessities?You think you can combat political
infidelity in a nation by the principle of enlightened loyalty; how
would you encounter religious infidelity in a state?By what means is
the principle of profound reverence to be revived?How, in short, is man
to be led to adore?'that is a subject which I have not forgotten,' replied Coningsby.'I know from your letters how deeply it has engaged your thoughts.I confess to you that it has often filled mine with perplexity and
depression.When we were at Eton, and both of us impregnated with the
contrary prejudices in which we had been brought up, there was still
between us one common ground of sympathy and trust; we reposed with
confidence and affection in the bosom of our Church.Time and thought,
with both of us, have only matured the spontaneous veneration of our
boyhood.But time and thought have also shown me that the Church of our
heart is not in a position, as regards the community, consonant with its
original and essential character, or with the welfare of the nation.''The character of a Church is universality,' replied Millbank.'Once
the Church in this country was universal in principle and practice; when
wedded to the State, it continued at least universal in principle, if
not in practice.All ties between the State and
the Church are abolished, except those which tend to its danger and
degradation.'What can be more anomalous than the present connection between State
and Church?Every condition on which it was originally consented to
has been cancelled.That original alliance was, in my view, an equal
calamity for the nation and the Church; but, at least, it was an
intelligible compact.Parliament, then consisting only of members of
the Established Church, was, on ecclesiastical matters, a lay synod, and
might, in some points of view, be esteemed a necessary portion of Church
government.But you have effaced this exclusive character of Parliament;
you have determined that a communion with the Established Church shall
no longer be part of the qualification for sitting in the House of
Commons.There is no reason, so far as the constitution avails, why
every member of the House of Commons should not be a dissenter.But the
whole power of the country is concentrated in the House of Commons.The House of Lords, even the Monarch himself, has openly announced and
confessed, within these ten years, that the will of the House of Commons
is supreme.A single vote of the House of Commons, in 1832, made the
Duke of Wellington declare, in the House of Lords, that he was obliged
to abandon his sovereign in "the most difficult and distressing
circumstances.""L'Etat c'est moi."The House of Commons virtually appoints the bishops.A sectarian assembly appoints the bishops of the Established Church.James II was expelled the throne
because he appointed a Roman Catholic to an Anglican see.A Parliament
might do this to-morrow with impunity.And this is the constitution in
Church and State which Conservative dinners toast!The only consequences
of the present union of Church and State are, that, on the side of the
State, there is perpetual interference in ecclesiastical government, and
on the side of the Church a sedulous avoidance of all those principles
on which alone Church government can be established, and by the
influence of which alone can the Church of England again become
universal.''But it is urged that the State protects its revenues?''No ecclesiastical revenues should be safe that require protection.Modern history is a history of Church spoliation.Not by
the people; not by the democracy.No; it is the emperor, the king, the
feudal baron, the court minion.The estate of the Church is the estate
of the people, so long as the Church is governed on its real principles.The Church is the medium by which the despised and degraded classes
assert the native equality of man, and vindicate the rights and power
of intellect.It made, in the darkest hour of Norman rule, the son of
a Saxon pedlar Primate of England, and placed Nicholas Breakspear, a
Hertfordshire peasant, on the throne of the Caesars.It would do as
great things now, if it were divorced from the degrading and tyrannical
connection that enchains it.You would have other sons of peasants
Bishops of England, instead of men appointed to that sacred office
solely because they were the needy scions of a factitious aristocracy;
men of gross ignorance, profligate habits, and grinding extortion, who
have disgraced the episcopal throne, and profaned the altar.''But surely you cannot justly extend such a description to the present
bench?''Surely not: I speak of the past, of the past that has produced so much
present evil.We live in decent times; frigid, latitudinarian, alarmed,
decorous.A priest is scarcely deemed in our days a fit successor to the
authors of the gospels, if he be not the editor of a Greek play; and he
who follows St.Paul must now at least have been private tutor of
some young nobleman who has taken a good degree!And then you are
all astonished that the Church is not universal!nothing but the
indestructibleness of its principles, however feebly pursued, could have
maintained even the disorganised body that still survives.'And yet, my dear Coningsby, with all its past errors and all its
present deficiencies, it is by the Church; I would have said until I
listened to you to-night; by the Church alone that I see any chance of
regenerating the national character.The parochial system, though
shaken by the fatal poor-law, is still the most ancient, the most
comprehensive, and the most popular institution of the country; the
younger priests are, in general, men whose souls are awake to the high
mission which they have to fulfil, and which their predecessors so
neglected; there is, I think, a rising feeling in the community, that
parliamentary intercourse in matters ecclesiastical has not tended
either to the spiritual or the material elevation of the humbler
orders.Divorce the Church from the State, and the spiritual power that
struggled against the brute force of the dark ages, against tyrannical
monarchs and barbarous barons, will struggle again in opposition to
influences of a different form, but of a similar tendency; equally
selfish, equally insensible, equally barbarising.The priests of God are
the tribunes of the people.that with such a mission they
should ever have cringed in the antechambers of ministers, or bowed
before parliamentary committees!''The Utilitarian system is dead,' said Coningsby.'It has passed through
the heaven of philosophy like a hailstorm, cold, noisy, sharp, and
peppering, and it has melted away.And yet can we wonder that it found
some success, when we consider the political ignorance and social torpor
which it assailed?Anointed kings turned into chief magistrates, and
therefore much overpaid; estates of the realm changed into parliaments
of virtual representation, and therefore requiring real reform; holy
Church transformed into national establishment, and therefore grumbled
at by all the nation for whom it was not supported.What an inevitable
harvest of sedition, radicalism, infidelity!I really think there is no
society, however great its resources, that could long resist the united
influences of chief magistrate, virtual representation, and Church
establishment!''I have immense faith in the new generation,' said Millbank, eagerly.'It is a holy thing to see a state saved by its youth,' said Coningsby;
and then he added, in a tone of humility, if not of depression,
'But what a task!What a variety of qualities, what a combination
of circumstances is requisite!What bright abilities and what noble
patience!What confidence from the people, what favour from the Most
High!''But He will favour us,' said Millbank.'And I say to you as Nathan said
unto David, "Thou art the man!"You were our leader at Eton; the friends
of your heart and boyhood still cling and cluster round you!they are
all men whose position forces them into public life.It is a nucleus of
honour, faith, and power.It is our privilege to live in an age when the career of the highest
ambition is identified with the performance of the greatest good.Of the
present epoch it may be truly said, "Who dares to be good, dares to be
great."''Heaven is above all,' said Coningsby.'The curtain of our fate is
still undrawn.We are happy in our friends, dear Millbank, and whatever
lights, we will stand together.For myself, I prefer fame to life;
and yet, the consciousness of heroic deeds to the most wide-spread
celebrity.'The beautiful light of summer had never shone on a scene and surrounding
landscape which recalled happier images of English nature, and better
recollections of English manners, than that to which we would now
introduce our readers.One of those true old English Halls, now
unhappily so rare, built in the time of the Tudors, and in its elaborate
timber-framing and decorative woodwork indicating, perhaps, the scarcity
of brick and stone at the period of its structure, as much as the
grotesque genius of its fabricator, rose on a terrace surrounded
by ancient and very formal gardens.The hall itself, during many
generations, had been vigilantly and tastefully preserved by its
proprietors.There was not a point which was not as fresh as if it had
been renovated but yesterday.It stood a huge and strange blending
of Grecian, Gothic, and Italian architecture, with a wild dash of the
fantastic in addition.The lantern watch-towers of a baronial castle
were placed in juxtaposition with Doric columns employed for chimneys,
while under oriel windows might be observed Italian doorways with
Grecian pediments.Beyond the extensive gardens an avenue of Spanish
chestnuts at each point of the compass approached the mansion, or led
into a small park which was table-land, its limits opening on all sides
to beautiful and extensive valleys, sparkling with cultivation, except
at one point, where the river Darl formed the boundary of the domain,
and then spread in many a winding through the rich country beyond.Such was Hellingsley, the new home that Oswald Millbank was about to
visit for the first time.Coningsby and himself had travelled together
as far as Darlford, where their roads diverged, and they had separated
with an engagement on the part of Coningsby to visit Hellingsley on the
morrow.As they had travelled along, Coningsby had frequently led the
conversation to domestic topics; gradually he had talked, and
talked much of Edith.Without an obtrusive curiosity, he extracted,
unconsciously to his companion, traits of her character and early days,
which filled him with a wild and secret interest.The thought that in a
few hours he was to meet her again, infused into his being a degree of
transport, which the very necessity of repressing before his companion
rendered more magical and thrilling.How often it happens in life that
we have with a grave face to discourse of ordinary topics, while all the
time our heart and memory are engrossed with some enchanting secret!The castle of his grandfather presented a far different scene on the
arrival of Coningsby from that which it had offered on his first visit.The Marquess had given him a formal permission to repair to it at
his pleasure, and had instructed the steward accordingly.But he came
without notice, at a season of the year when the absence of all sports
made his arrival unexpected.The scattered and sauntering household
roused themselves into action, and contemplated the conviction that it
might be necessary to do some service for their wages.There was a stir
in that vast, sleepy castle.At last the steward was found, and came
forward to welcome their young master, whose simple wants were limited
to the rooms he had formerly occupied.Coningsby reached the castle a little before sunset, almost the same
hour that he had arrived there more than three years ago.How much had
happened in the interval!Coningsby had already lived long enough to
find interest in pondering over the past.That past too must inevitably
exercise a great influence over his present.He recalled his morning
drive with his grandfather, to the brink of that river which was
the boundary between his own domain and Hellingsley.Who dwelt at
Hellingsley now?Restless, excited, not insensible to the difficulties, perhaps the
dangers of his position, yet full of an entrancing emotion in which all
thoughts and feelings seemed to merge, Coningsby went forth into the
fair gardens to muse over his love amid objects as beautiful.A rosy
light hung over the rare shrubs and tall fantastic trees; while a rich
yet darker tint suffused the distant woods.This euthanasia of the day
exercises a strange influence on the hearts of those who love.But as for Coningsby, the mitigating hour that softens the heart made
his spirit brave.Amid the ennobling sympathies of nature, the pursuits
and purposes of worldly prudence and conventional advantage subsided
into their essential nothingness.He willed to blend his life and fate
with a being beautiful as that nature that subdued him, and he felt in
his own breast the intrinsic energies that in spite of all obstacles
should mould such an imagination into reality.He descended the <DW72>s, now growing dimmer in the fleeting light, into
the park.The stillness was almost supernatural; the jocund sounds of
day had died, and the voices of the night had not commenced.A sacred calm had succeeded to that distraction of
emotion which had agitated him the whole day, while he had mused over
his love and the infinite and insurmountable barriers that seemed to
oppose his will.Now he felt one of those strong groundless convictions
that are the inspirations of passion, that all would yield to him as to
one holding an enchanted wand.Onward he strolled; it seemed without purpose, yet always proceeding.A
pale and then gleaming tint stole over the masses of mighty timber; and
soon a glittering light flooded the lawns and glades.The moon was high
in her summer heaven, and still Coningsby strolled on.He crossed the
broad lawns, he traversed the bright glades: amid the gleaming and
shadowy woods, he traced his prescient way.He came to the bank of a rushing river, foaming in the moonlight, and
wafting on its blue breast the shadow of a thousand stars.he said, 'that rollest to my mistress, bear her, bear her my
heart!'Lady Wallinger and Edith were together in the morning room of
Hellingsley, the morrow after the arrival of Oswald.Edith was arranging
flowers in a vase, while her aunt was embroidering a Spanish peasant in
correct costume.The daughter of Millbank looked as bright and fragrant
as the fair creations that surrounded her.Beautiful to watch her as she
arranged their forms and composed their groups; to mark her eye glance
with gratification at some happy combination of colour, or to listen to
her delight as they wafted to her in gratitude their perfume.Oswald and
Sir Joseph were surveying the stables; Mr.Millbank, who had been daily
expected for the last week from the factories, had not yet arrived.'I must say he gained my heart from the first,' said Lady Wallinger.'I wish the gardener would send us more roses,' said Edith.'He is so very superior to any young man I ever met,' continued Lady
Wallinger.'I think we must have this vase entirely of roses; don't you think so,
aunt?''I am fond of roses,' said Lady Wallinger.Coningsby gave us at Paris, Edith!''I must say, I was very happy when I met Mr.Coningsby again at
Cambridge,' said Lady Wallinger.'It gave me much greater pleasure than
seeing any of the colleges.''And very naturally,' said Lady Wallinger.'Oswald ought to deem
himself fortunate in having such a friend.Coningsby when we met him at Cambridge is what I never shall forget.But
he always was my favourite from the first time I saw him at Paris.Do
you know, Edith, I liked him best of all your admirers.'no, aunt,' said Edith, smiling, 'not more than Lord Beaumanoir; you
forget your great favourite, Lord Beaumanoir.'Coningsby at Rome,' said Lady Wallinger; 'I
cannot agree that anybody is equal to Mr.I cannot tell you
how pleased I am that he is our neighbour!'As Lady Wallinger gave a finishing stroke to the jacket of her
Andalusian, Edith, vividly blushing, yet speaking in a voice of affected
calmness, said,

'Here is Mr.And, truly, at this moment our hero might be discerned, approaching the
hall by one of the avenues; and in a few minutes there was a ringing at
the hall bell, and then, after a short pause, the servants announced Mr.Coningsby, and ushered him into the morning room.Edith was embarrassed; the frankness and the gaiety of her manner had
deserted her; Coningsby was rather earnest than self-possessed.Each
felt at first that the presence of Lady Wallinger was a relief.The
ordinary topics of conversation were in sufficient plenty; reminiscences
of Paris, impressions of Hellingsley, his visit to Oxford, Lady
Wallinger's visit to Cambridge.In ten minutes their voices seemed to
sound to each other as they did in the Rue de Rivoli, and their mutual
perplexity had in a great degree subsided.Oswald and Sir Joseph now entered the room, and the conversation became
general.Hellingsley was the subject on which Coningsby dwelt; he was
charmed with all that he had seen!Sir Joseph was
quite prepared to accompany him; but Lady Wallinger, who seemed to read
Coningsby's wishes in his eyes, proposed that the inspection should be
general; and in the course of half an hour Coningsby was walking by the
side of Edith, and sympathising with all the natural charms to which her
quick taste and lively expression called his notice and appreciation.Few things more delightful than a country ramble with a sweet companion!Exploring woods, wandering over green commons, loitering in shady lanes,
resting on rural stiles; the air full of perfume, the heart full of
bliss!It seemed to Coningsby that he had never been happy before.His heart was as
sunny as the summer scene.Past and Future were absorbed in the flowing
hour; not an allusion to Paris, not a speculation on what might arrive;
but infinite expressions of agreement, sympathy; a multitude of slight
phrases, that, however couched, had but one meaning, congeniality.He
felt each moment his voice becoming more tender; his heart gushing
in soft expressions; each moment he was more fascinated; her step was
grace, her glance was beauty.Now she touched him by some phrase of
sweet simplicity; or carried him spell-bound by her airy merriment.Oswald assumed that Coningsby remained to dine with them.There was not
even the ceremony of invitation.Coningsby could not but remember his
dinner at Millbank, and the timid hostess whom he then addressed so
often in vain, as he gazed upon the bewitching and accomplished woman
whom he now passionately loved.Oswald,
happy in his friend being his guest, under his own roof, indulged in
unwonted gaiety.The ladies withdrew; Sir Joseph began to talk politics, although the
young men had threatened their fair companions immediately to follow
them.This was the period of the Bed-Chamber Plot, when Sir Robert Peel
accepted and resigned power in the course of three days.Sir Joseph,
who had originally made up his mind to support a Conservative government
when he deemed it inevitable, had for the last month endeavoured to
compensate for this trifling error by vindicating the conduct of his
friends, and reprobating the behaviour of those who would deprive her
Majesty of the 'friends-of-her-youth.'Sir Joseph was a most chivalrous
champion of the 'friends-of-her-youth' principle.Sir Joseph, who was
always moderate and conciliatory in his talk, though he would go, at any
time, any lengths for his party, expressed himself to-day with
extreme sobriety, as he was determined not to hurt the feelings of
Mr.Coningsby, and he principally confined himself to urging temperate
questions, somewhat in the following fashion:--

'I admit that, on the whole, under ordinary circumstances, it would
perhaps have been more convenient that these appointments should have
remained with Sir Robert; but don't you think that, under the peculiar
circumstances, being friends of her Majesty's youth?'&c.

Sir Joseph was extremely astonished when Coningsby replied that he
thought, under no circumstances, should any appointment in the Royal
Household be dependent on the voice of the House of Commons, though he
was far from admiring the 'friends-of-her-youth' principle, which he
looked upon as impertinent.'But surely,' said Sir Joseph, 'the Minister being responsible to
Parliament, it must follow that all great offices of State should be
filled at his discretion.''But where do you find this principle of Ministerial responsibility?''And is not a Minister responsible to his Sovereign?'He had always heard that Ministers
were responsible to Parliament; and he had a vague conviction,
notwithstanding the reanimating loyalty of the Bed-Chamber Plot, that
the Sovereign of England was a nonentity.He took refuge in indefinite
expressions, and observed, 'The Responsibility of Ministers is surely a
constitutional doctrine.''The Ministers of the Crown are responsible to their master; they are
not the Ministers of Parliament.''But then you know virtually,' said Sir Joseph, 'the Parliament, that
is, the House of Commons, governs the country.''It did before 1832,' said Coningsby; 'but that is all past now.We got
rid of that with the Venetian Constitution.''We were governed in this country by the
Venetian Constitution from the accession of the House of Hanover.And now I hope we are in a state of transition from
the Italian Dogeship to the English Monarchy.''King, Lords, and Commons, the Venetian Constitution!''But they were phrases,' said Coningsby, 'not facts.The King was a
Doge; the Cabinet the Council of Ten.Your Parliament, that you call
Lords and Commons, was nothing more than the Great Council of Nobles.''The resemblance was complete,' said Millbank, 'and no wonder, for it
was not accidental; the Venetian Constitution was intentionally copied.''We should have had the Venetian Republic in 1640,' said Coningsby, 'had
it not been for the Puritans.'I am sure these ideas are not very generally known,' said Sir Joseph,
bewildered.'Because you have had your history written by the Venetian party,' said
Coningsby, 'and it has been their interest to conceal them.''I will venture to say that there are very few men on our side in the
House of Commons,' said Sir Joseph, 'who are aware that they were born
under a Venetian Constitution.''Let us go to the ladies,' said Millbank, smiling.Edith was reading a letter as they entered.'A letter from papa,' she exclaimed, looking up at her brother with
great animation.'We may expect him every day; and yet, alas!They now all spoke of Millbank, and Coningsby was happy that he was
familiar with the scene.At length he ventured to say to Edith, 'You
once made me a promise which you never fulfilled.'The song that you promised me at Millbank more than three years ago.'Then they spoke for a while of other recollections, and then Coningsby
appealing to Lady Wallinger for her influence, Edith rose and took up
her guitar.Her voice was rich and sweet; the air she sang gay, even
fantastically frolic, such as the girls of Granada chaunt trooping home
from some country festival; her soft, dark eye brightened with joyous
sympathy; and ever and anon, with an arch grace, she beat the guitar, in
chorus, with her pretty hand.The moon wanes; and Coningsby must leave these enchanted halls.Oswald
walked homeward with him until he reached the domain of his grandfather.Then mounting his horse, Coningsby bade his friend farewell till the
morrow, and made his best way to the Castle.CHAPTER V.


There is a romance in every life.The emblazoned page of Coningsby's
existence was now open.It had been prosperous before, with some moments
of excitement, some of delight; but they had all found, as it were,
their origin in worldly considerations, or been inevitably mixed up with
them.At Paris, for example, he loved, or thought he loved.But there
not an hour could elapse without his meeting some person, or hearing
something, which disturbed the beauty of his emotions, or broke his
spell-bound thoughts.There was his grandfather hating the Millbanks,
or Sidonia loving them; and common people, in the common world, making
common observations on them; asking who they were, or telling who they
were; and brushing the bloom off all life's fresh delicious fancies with
their coarse handling.He loved passionately, and he loved
in a scene and in a society as sweet, as pure, and as refined as his
imagination and his heart.There was no malicious gossip, no callous
chatter to profane his ear and desecrate his sentiment.All that he
heard or saw was worthy of the summer sky, the still green woods, the
gushing river, the gardens and terraces, the stately and fantastic
dwellings, among which his life now glided as in some dainty and
gorgeous masque.All the soft, social, domestic sympathies of his nature, which, however
abundant, had never been cultivated, were developed by the life he was
now leading.It was not merely that he lived in the constant presence,
and under the constant influence of one whom he adored, that made him so
happy.He was surrounded by beings who found felicity in the interchange
of kind feelings and kind words, in the cultivation of happy talents and
refined tastes, and the enjoyment of a life which their own good sense
and their own good hearts made them both comprehend and appreciate.Ambition lost much of its splendour, even his lofty aspirations
something of their hallowing impulse of paramount duty, when Coningsby
felt how much ennobling delight was consistent with the seclusion of a
private station; and mused over an existence to be passed amid woods and
waterfalls with a fair hand locked in his, or surrounded by his friends
in some ancestral hall.The morning after his first visit to Hellingsley Coningsby rejoined his
friends, as he had promised Oswald at their breakfast-table; and day
after day he came with the early sun, and left them only when the late
moon silvered the keep of Coningsby Castle.Millbank, who wrote
daily, and was daily to be expected, did not arrive.A week, a week
of unbroken bliss, had vanished away, passed in long rides and longer
walks, sunset saunterings, and sometimes moonlit strolls; talking of
flowers, and thinking of things even sweeter; listening to delicious
songs, and sometimes reading aloud some bright romance or some inspiring
lay.One day Coningsby, who arrived at the hall unexpectedly late; indeed it
was some hours past noon, for he had been detained by despatches
which arrived at the Castle from Mr.Rigby, and which required his
interposition; found the ladies alone, and was told that Sir Joseph and
Oswald were at the fishing-cottage where they wished him to join them.He was in no haste to do this; and Lady Wallinger proposed that
when they felt inclined to ramble they should all walk down to the
fishing-cottage together.So, seating himself by the side of Edith, who
was tinting a sketch which she had made of a rich oriel of Hellingsley,
the morning passed away in that slight and yet subtle talk in which a
lover delights, and in which, while asking a thousand questions, that
seem at the first glance sufficiently trifling, he is indeed often
conveying a meaning that is not expressed, or attempting to discover a
feeling that is hidden.And these are occasions when glances meet
and glances are withdrawn: the tongue may speak idly, the eye is more
eloquent, and often more true.Coningsby looked up; Lady Wallinger, who had more than once announced
that she was going to put on her bonnet, was gone.Yet still he
continued to talk trifles; and still Edith listened.'Of all that you have told me,' said Edith, 'nothing pleases me so much
as your description of St.How much I should like to catch
the deer at sunset on the heights!'You would like Eustace Lyle,' said Coningsby.'He is so shy and yet so
ardent.'Oswald was saying this morning there
was no one who had so many devoted friends.'It is the only bond of friendship; and
yet friendship--'

'Edith,' said Lady Wallinger, looking into the room from the garden,
with her bonnet on, 'you will find me roaming on the terrace.'There were yet a few pencil touches to be
given to the tinted sketch; Coningsby would cut the pencils.'Would you give me,' he said,'some slight memorial of Hellingsley and
your art?I would not venture to hope for anything half so beautiful as
this; but the slightest sketch.It would make me so happy when away to
have it hanging in my room.'A blush suffused the cheek of Edith; she turned her head a little aside,
as if she were arranging some drawings.And then she said, in a somewhat
hushed and hesitating voice,

'I am sure I will do so; and with pleasure.A view of the Hall itself;
I think that would be the best memorial.and she rose, and promised immediately to
return, left the room.Coningsby leant over the mantel-piece in deep abstraction, gazing
vacantly on a miniature of the father of Edith.A light step roused
him; she had returned.Unconsciously he greeted her with a glance of
ineffable tenderness.They went forth; it was a grey, sultry day.Indeed it was the covered
sky which had led to the fishing scheme of the morning.Sir Joseph was
an expert and accomplished angler, and the Darl was renowned for its
sport.They lingered before they reached the terrace where they were to
find Lady Wallinger, observing the different points of view which
the Hall presented, and debating which was to form the subject of
Coningsby's drawing; for already it was to be not merely a sketch, but a
drawing, the most finished that the bright and effective pencil of Edith
could achieve.If it really were to be placed in his room, and were
to be a memorial of Hellingsley, her artistic reputation demanded a
masterpiece.They reached the terrace: Lady Wallinger was not there, nor could they
observe her in the vicinity.Coningsby was quite certain that she had
gone onward to the fishing-cottage, and expected them to follow her;
and he convinced Edith of the justness of his opinion.To the
fishing-cottage, therefore, they bent their steps.They emerged from the
gardens into the park, sauntering over the table-land, and seeking as
much as possible the shade, in the soft but oppressive atmosphere.At
the limit of the table-land their course lay by a wild but winding path
through a gradual and wooded declivity.While they were yet in this
craggy and romantic woodland, the big fervent drops began to fall.Coningsby urged Edith to seek at once a natural shelter; but she, who
knew the country, assured him that the fishing-cottage was close by, and
that they might reach it before the rain could do them any harm.And truly, at this moment emerging from the wood, they found themselves
in the valley of the Darl.The river here was narrow and winding, but
full of life; rushing, and clear but for the dark sky it reflected; with
high banks of turf and tall trees; the silver birch, above all others,
in clustering groups; infinitely picturesque.At the turn of the river,
about two hundred yards distant, Coningsby observed the low, dark roof
of the fishing-cottage on its banks.They descended from the woods to
the margin of the stream by a flight of turfen steps, Coningsby holding
Edith's hand as he guided her progress.They reached, at a rapid pace, the cottage.The absent boat indicated that Sir Joseph and Oswald were on the river.The cottage was an old building of rustic logs, with a shelving roof,
so that you might obtain sufficient shelter without entering its walls.Coningsby found a rough garden seat for Edith.Nature, like man, sometimes weeps from gladness.It is the joy and
tenderness of her heart that seek relief; and these are summer showers.In this instance the vehemence of her emotion was transient, though the
tears kept stealing down her cheek for a long time, and gentle sighs and
sobs might for some period be distinguished.The oppressive atmosphere
had evaporated; the grey, sullen tint had disappeared; a soft breeze
came dancing up the stream; a glowing light fell upon the woods and
waters; the perfume of trees and flowers and herbs floated around.There
was a carolling of birds; a hum of happy insects in the air; freshness
and stir, and a sense of joyous life, pervaded all things; it seemed
that the heart of all creation opened.Coningsby, after repeatedly watching the shower with Edith, and
speculating on its progress, which did not much annoy them, had seated
himself on a log almost at her feet.And assuredly a maiden and a youth
more beautiful and engaging had seldom met before in a scene more fresh
and fair.Edith on her rustic seat watched the now blue and foaming
river, and the birch-trees with a livelier tint, and quivering in the
sunset air; an expression of tranquil bliss suffused her beautiful brow,
and spoke from the thrilling tenderness of her soft dark eye.Coningsby
gazed on that countenance with a glance of entranced rapture.His cheek
was flushed, his eye gleamed with dazzling lustre.She turned her head;
she met that glance, and, troubled, she withdrew her own.he said in a tone of tremulous passion, 'Let me call you Edith!Yes,' he continued, gently taking her hand, let me call you my Edith!She did not withdraw her hand; but turned away a face flushed as the
impending twilight.It was past the dinner hour when Edith and Coningsby reached the Hall;
an embarrassing circumstance, but mitigated by the conviction that they
had not to encounter a very critical inspection.What, then, were their
feelings when the first servant that they met informed them that Mr.Edith never could have believed that the return of
her beloved father to his home could ever have been to her other than
a cause of delight.And yet now she trembled when she heard the
announcement.The mysteries of love were fast involving her existence.Her heart was still agitated
by the tremulous admission that she responded to that fervent and
adoring love whose eloquent music still sounded in her ear, and the
pictures of whose fanciful devotion flitted over her agitated vision.Unconsciously she pressed the arm of Coningsby as the servant spoke,
and then, without looking into his face, whispering him to be quick, she
sprang away.As for Coningsby, notwithstanding the elation of his heart, and the
ethereal joy which flowed in all his veins, the name of Mr.Millbank
sounded, something like a knell.However, this was not the time to
reflect.He obeyed the hint of Edith; made the most rapid toilet that
ever was consummated by a happy lover, and in a few minutes entered the
drawing-room of Hellingsley, to encounter the gentleman whom he hoped by
some means or other, quite inconceivable, might some day be transformed
into his father-in-law, and the fulfilment of his consequent duties
towards whom he had commenced by keeping him waiting for dinner.'How do you do, sir,' said Mr.Millbank, extending his hand to
Coningsby.'You seem to have taken a long walk.'Coningsby looked round to the kind Lady Wallinger, and half addressed
his murmured answer to her, explaining how they had lost her, and their
way, and were caught in a storm or a shower, which, as it terminated
about three hours back, and the fishing-cottage was little more than a
mile from the Hall, very satisfactorily accounted for their not being in
time for dinner.Lady Wallinger then said something about the lowering clouds having
frightened her from the terrace, and Sir Joseph and Oswald talked a
little of their sport, and of their having seen an otter; but there was,
or at least there seemed to Coningsby, a tone of general embarrassment
which distressed him.The fact is, keeping people from dinner under
any circumstances is distressing.They are obliged to talk at the very
moment when they wish to use their powers of expression for a very
different purpose.They are faint, and conversation makes them more
exhausted.A gentleman, too, fond of his family, who in turn are devoted
to him, making a great and inconvenient effort to reach them by dinner
time, to please and surprise them; and finding them all dispersed,
dinner so late that he might have reached home in good time without any
great inconvenient effort; his daughter, whom he had wished a thousand
times to embrace, taking a singularly long ramble with no other
companion than a young gentleman, whom he did not exactly expect to
see; all these are circumstances, individually perhaps slight, and yet,
encountered collectively, it may be doubted they would not a little
ruffle even the sweetest temper.Millbank, too, had not the sweetest temper, though not a bad one;
a little quick and fiery.And when Edith,
who had providentially sent down a message to order dinner, entered and
embraced him at the very moment that dinner was announced, her father
forgot everything in his joy in seeing her, and his pleasure in being
surrounded by his friends.He gave his hand to Lady Wallinger, and Sir
Joseph led away his niece.Coningsby put his arm around the astonished
neck of Oswald, as if they were once more in the playing fields of Eton.my dear fellow,' he exclaimed, 'I am so sorry we kept your
father from dinner.'As Edith headed her father's table, according to his rigid rule,
Coningsby was on one side of her.They never spoke so little; Coningsby
would have never unclosed his lips, had he followed his humour.He was
in a stupor of happiness; the dining room took the appearance of
the fishing-cottage; and he saw nothing but the flowing river.Lady
Wallinger was however next to him, and that was a relief; for he felt
always she was his friend.Sir Joseph, a good-hearted man, and
on subjects with which he was acquainted full of sound sense, was
invaluable to-day, for he entirely kept up the conversation, speaking
of things which greatly interested Mr.And so their host soon
recovered his good temper; he addressed several times his observations
to Coningsby, and was careful to take wine with him.On the whole,
affairs went on flowingly enough.The gentlemen, indeed, stayed much
longer over their wine than on the preceding days, and Coningsby did not
venture on the liberty of quitting the room before his host.She tried to seek it on the bosom of her
aunt, as she breathed to her the delicious secret of her life.When the
gentlemen returned to the drawing-room the ladies were not there.Millbank again; he had not seen enough of his
daughter; he wished to hear her sing.But Edith managed to reappear; and
even to sing.Then Coningsby went up to her and asked her to sing the
song of the Girls of Granada.She said in a low voice, and with a fond
yet serious look,

'I am not in the mood for such a song, but if you wish me--'

She sang it, and with inexpressible grace, and with an arch vivacity,
that to a fine observer would have singularly contrasted with the
almost solemn and even troubled expression of her countenance a moment
afterwards.The day was about to die; the day the most important, the most precious
in the lives of Harry Coningsby and Edith Millbank.Words had been
spoken, vows breathed, which were to influence their careers for ever.For them hereafter there was to be but one life, one destiny, one world.Each of them was still in such a state of tremulous excitement, that
neither had found time or occasion to ponder over the mighty result.They both required solitude; they both longed to be alone.He pressed the soft hand of Edith, and his glance spoke
his soul.'We shall see you at breakfast to-morrow, Coningsby!'said Oswald,
very loud, knowing that the presence of his father would make Coningsby
hesitate about coming.Edith's heart fluttered; but she said nothing.It
was with delight she heard her father, after a moment's pause, say,

'Oh!'Not quite at so early an hour,' said Coningsby; 'but if you will permit
me, I hope to have the pleasure of hearing from you to-morrow, sir, that
your journey has not fatigued you.'To be alone; to have no need of feigning a tranquillity he could not
feel; of coining common-place courtesy when his heart was gushing
with rapture; this was a great relief to Coningsby, though gained by a
separation from Edith.The deed was done; he had breathed his long-brooding passion, he
had received the sweet expression of her sympathy, he had gained
the long-coveted heart.Youth, beauty, love, the innocence of
unsophisticated breasts, and the inspiration of an exquisite nature,
combined to fashion the spell that now entranced his life.He turned to
gaze upon the moonlit towers and peaked roofs of Hellingsley.Silent and
dreamlike, the picturesque pile rested on its broad terrace flooded with
the silver light and surrounded by the quaint bowers of its fantastic
gardens tipped with the glittering beam.Half hid in deep shadow, half
sparkling in the midnight blaze, he recognised the oriel window that had
been the subject of the morning's sketch.Almost he wished there should
be some sound to assure him of his reality.But nothing broke the
all-pervading stillness.Was his life to be as bright and as tranquil?Whither was he to bear the beautiful bride he had gained?Were the
portals of Coningsby the proud and hospitable gates that were to greet
her?How long would they greet him after the achievement of the last
four-and-twenty hours was known to their lord?Was this the return for
the confiding kindness of his grandsire?That he should pledge his troth
to the daughter of that grandsire's foe?Away with such dark and scaring visions!Is it not the noon of a summer
night fragrant with the breath of gardens, bright with the beam that
lovers love, and soft with the breath of Ausonian breezes?Within that
sweet and stately residence, dwells there not a maiden fair enough to
revive chivalry; who is even now thinking of him as she leans on her
pensive hand, or, if perchance she dream, recalls him in her visions?And himself, is he one who would cry craven with such a lot?What avail
his golden youth, his high blood, his daring and devising spirit, and
all his stores of wisdom, if they help not now?Does not he feel the
energy divine that can confront Fate and carve out fortunes?Besides it
is nigh Midsummer Eve, and what should fairies reign for but to aid such
a bright pair as this?He recalls a thousand times the scene, the moment, in which but a few
hours past he dared to tell her that he loved; he recalls a thousand
times the still, small voice, that murmured her agitated felicity: more
than a thousand times, for his heart clenched the idea as a diver grasps
a gem, he recalls the enraptured yet gentle embrace, that had sealed
upon her blushing cheek his mystical and delicious sovereignty.CHAPTER VIII


The morning broke lowering and thunderous; small white clouds, dull and
immovable, studded the leaden sky; the waters of the rushing Darl seemed
to have become black and almost stagnant; the terraces of Hellingsley
looked like the hard lines of a model; and the mansion itself had a
harsh and metallic character.Before the chief portal of his Hall, the
elder Millbank, with an air of some anxiety, surveyed the landscape and
the heavens, as if he were speculating on the destiny of the day.Often his eye wandered over the park; often with an uneasy and restless
step he paced the raised walk before him.The clock of Hellingsley
church had given the chimes of noon.His son and Coningsby appeared
at the end of one of the avenues.His eye lightened; his lip became
compressed; he advanced to meet them.'Are you going to fish to-day, Oswald?''We had some thoughts of it, sir.''A fine day for sport, I should think,' he observed, as he turned
towards the Hall with them.Coningsby remarked the fanciful beauty of the portal; its twisted
columns, and Caryatides carved in dark oak.'Yes, it's very well,' said Millbank; 'but I really do not know why I
came here; my presence is an effort.Oswald does not care for the place;
none of us do, I believe.'I like it now, father; and Edith doats on it.''She was very happy at Millbank,' said the father, rather sharply.'We are all of us happy at Millbank,' said Oswald.'I was much struck with the valley and the whole settlement when I first
saw it,' said Coningsby.'Suppose you go and see about the tackle, Oswald,' said Mr.Coningsby and I will take a stroll on the terrace in the
meantime.'The habit of obedience, which was supreme in this family, instantly
carried Oswald away, though he was rather puzzled why his father should
be so anxious about the preparation of the fishing-tackle, as he rarely
used it.Millbank turned to
Coningsby, and said very abruptly,

'You have never seen my own room here, Mr.Coningsby; step in, for I
wish to say a word to you.'And thus speaking, he advanced before the
astonished, and rather agitated Coningsby, and led the way through a
door and long passage to a room of moderate dimensions, partly furnished
as a library, and full of parliamentary papers and blue-books.Shutting
the door with some earnestness and pointing to a chair, he begged his
guest to be seated.Millbank, clearing his
throat, said without preface, 'I have reason to believe, Mr.Coningsby,
that you are attached to my daughter?''I have been attached to her for a long time most ardently,' replied
Coningsby, in a calm and rather measured tone, but looking very pale.'And I have reason to believe that she returns your attachment?''I believe she deigns not to disregard it,' said Coningsby, his white
cheek becoming scarlet.'It is then a mutual attachment, which, if cherished, must produce
mutual unhappiness,' said Mr.'I would fain believe the reverse,' said Coningsby.'Because I believe she possesses every charm, quality, and virtue, that
can bless man; and because, though I can make her no equivalent return,
I have a heart, if I know myself, that would struggle to deserve her.''I know you to be a man of sense; I believe you to be a man of honour,'
replied Mr.'As the first, you must feel that an union between
you and my daughter is impossible; what then should be your duty as a
man of correct principle is obvious.''I could conceive that our union might be attended with difficulties,'
said Coningsby, in a somewhat deprecating tone.'Sir, it is impossible,' repeated Mr.Millbank, interrupting him, though
not with harshness; 'that is to say, there is no conceivable marriage
which could be effected at greater sacrifices, and which would occasion
greater misery.''The sacrifices are more apparent to me than the misery,' said
Coningsby, 'and even they may be imaginary.''The sacrifices and the misery are certain and inseparable,' said Mr.I speak without reserve, for this
is a subject which cannot permit misconception, but with no feelings
towards you, sir, but fair and friendly ones.You are the grandson of
my Lord Monmouth; at present enjoying his favour, but dependent on his
bounty.You may be the heir of his wealth to-morrow, and to-morrow you
may be the object of his hatred and persecution.Your grandfather and
myself are foes; bitter, irreclaimable, to the death.It is idle to
mince phrases; I do not vindicate our mutual feelings, I may regret that
they have ever arisen; I may regret it especially at this exigency.They
are not the feelings of good Christians; they may be altogether to be
deplored and unjustifiable; but they exist, mutually exist; and have not
been confined to words.Lord Monmouth would crush me, had he the power,
like a worm; and I have curbed his proud fortunes often.Were it not
for this feeling I should not be here; I purchased this estate merely
to annoy him, as I have done a thousand other acts merely for his
discomfiture and mortification.In our long encounter I have done him
infinitely more injury than he could do me; I have been on the spot,
I am active, vigilant, the maker of my fortunes.He is an epicurean,
continually in foreign parts, obliged to leave the fulfilment of his
will to others.But, for these very reasons, his hate is more intense.I can afford to hate him less than he hates me; I have injured him more.But they do exist;
and now you are to go to this man, and ask his sanction to marry my
daughter!''But I would appease these hatreds; I would allay these dark passions,
the origin of which I know not, but which never could justify the end,
and which lead to so much misery.I would appeal to my grandfather; I
would show him Edith.''He has looked upon as fair even as Edith,' said Mr.Millbank, rising
suddenly from his seat, and pacing the room, 'and did that melt his
heart?The experience of your own lot should have guarded you from the
perils that you have so rashly meditated encountering, and the misery
which you have been preparing for others besides yourself.Is my
daughter to be treated like your mother?Your
mother's family were not Lord Monmouth's foes.They were simple and
innocent people, free from all the bad passions of our nature, and
ignorant of the world's ways.But because they were not noble, because
they could trace no mystified descent from a foreign invader, or the
sacrilegious minion of some spoliating despot, their daughter was hunted
from the family which should have exulted to receive her, and the land
of which she was the native ornament.Why should a happier lot await you
than fell to your parents?You are in the same position as your father;
you meditate the same act.The only difference being aggravating
circumstances in your case, which, even if I were a member of the same
order as my Lord Monmouth, would prevent the possibility of a prosperous
union.Marry Edith, and you blast all the prospects of your life, and
entail on her a sense of unceasing humiliation.Coningsby, with his head resting on his arm, his face a little shaded,
his eyes fixed on the ground, listened in silence.There was a pause;
broken by Coningsby, as in a low voice, without changing his posture or
raising his glance, he said, 'It seems, sir, that you were acquainted
with my mother!''I knew sufficient of her,' replied Mr.Millbank, with a kindling cheek,
'to learn the misery that a woman may entail on herself by marrying out
of her condition.I have bred my children in a respect for their class.I believe they have imbibed my feeling; though it is strange how in
the commerce of the world, chance, in their friendships, has apparently
baffled my designs.'do not say it is chance, sir,' said Coningsby, looking up, and
speaking with much fervour.'The feelings that animate me towards
your family are not the feelings of chance: they are the creation of
sympathy; tried by time, tested by thought.They were inevitable; they are indestructible.Yes, sir, it
is in vain to speak of the enmities that are fostered between you and
my grandfather; the love that exists between your daughter and myself is
stronger than all your hatreds.''You speak like a young man, and a young man that is in love,' said Mr.'This is mere rhapsody; it will vanish in an instant
before the reality of life.And you have arrived at that reality,' he
continued, speaking with emphasis, leaning over the back of his chair,
and looking steadily at Coningsby with his grey, sagacious eye;'my
daughter and yourself can meet no more.''It is impossible you can be so cruel!''So kind; kind to you both; for I wish to be kind to you as well as to
her.You are entitled to kindness from us all; though I will tell you
now, that, years ago, when the news arrived that my son's life had been
saved, and had been saved by one who bore the name of Coningsby, I had
a presentiment, great as was the blessing, that it might lead to
unhappiness.''I can answer for the misery of one,' said Coningsby, in a tone of great
despondency.'I feel as if my sun were set.why should there be such
wretchedness?Why are there family hatreds and party feuds?Why am I the
most wretched of men?''My good young friend, you will live, I doubt not, to be a happy one.Happiness is not, as we are apt to fancy, entirely dependent on these
contingencies.It is the lot of most men to endure what you are now
suffering, and they can look back to such conjunctures through the vista
of years with calmness.''Frankly, I should say, no.My daughter is in her room; I have had some
conversation with her.To
see her again will only aggravate woe.You leave under this roof, sir,
some sad memories, but no unkind ones.It is not likely that I can
serve you, or that you may want my aid; but whatever may be in my power,
remember you may command it; without reserve and without restraint.If I
control myself now, it is not because I do not respect your affliction,
but because, in the course of my life, I have felt too much not to be
able to command my feelings.''You never could have felt what I feel now,' said Coningsby, in a tone
of anguish.'You touch on delicate ground,' said Millbank; 'yet from me you may
learn to suffer.There was a being once, not less fair than the peerless
girl that you would fain call your own, and her heart was my proud
possession.There were no family feuds to baffle our union, nor was
I dependent on anything, but the energies which had already made me
flourishing.It was the first dream of my life,
and it was the last; my solitary passion, the memory of which softens my
heart.you dreaming scholars, and fine gentlemen who saunter through
life, you think there is no romance in the loves of a man who lives in
the toil and turmoil of business.Amid my career
of travail, there was ever a bright form which animated exertion,
inspired my invention, nerved my energy, and to gain whose heart and
life I first made many of those discoveries, and entered into many
of those speculations, that have since been the foundation of my wide
prosperity.'Her faith was pledged to me; I lived upon her image; the day was even
talked of when I should bear her to the home that I had proudly prepared
for her.'There came a young noble, a warrior who had never seen war, glittering
with gewgaws.He was quartered in the town where the mistress of my
heart, who was soon to share my life and my fortunes, resided.The tale
is too bitter not to be brief.He saw her, he sighed; I will hope that
he loved her; she gave him with rapture the heart which perhaps she
found she had never given to me; and instead of bearing the name I had
once hoped to have called her by, she pledged her faith at the altar to
one who, like you, was called, CONINGSBY.''You see, I too have had my griefs.''Dear sir,' said Coningsby, rising and taking Mr.Millbank's hand, 'I am
most wretched; and yet I wish to part from you even with affection.You
have explained circumstances that have long perplexed me.A curse, I
fear, is on our families.I have not mind enough at this moment even
to ponder on my situation.I go; yes, I quit this
Hellingsley, where I came to be so happy, where I have been so happy.Nay, let me go, dear sir!I must be alone, I must try to think.And tell
her, no, tell her nothing.Proceeding down the avenue with a rapid and distempered step, his
countenance lost, as it were, in a wild abstraction, Coningsby
encountered Oswald Millbank.He stopped, collected his turbulent
thoughts, and throwing on Oswald one look that seemed at the same time
to communicate woe and to demand sympathy, flung himself into his arms.he exclaimed, and then added, in a broken voice, 'I need a
friend.'Then in a hurried, impassioned, and somewhat incoherent strain, leaning
on Oswald's arm, as they walked on together, he poured forth all that
had occurred, all of which he had dreamed; his baffled bliss, his
actual despair.there was little room for solace, and yet all
that earnest affection could inspire, and a sagacious brain and a brave
spirit, were offered for his support, if not his consolation, by the
friend who was devoted to him.In the midst of this deep communion, teeming with every thought and
sentiment that could enchain and absorb the spirit of man, they came to
one of the park-gates of Coningsby.The command of
his father was peremptory, that no member of his family, under any
circumstances, or for any consideration, should set his foot on that
domain.Lady Wallinger had once wished to have seen the Castle, and
Coningsby was only too happy in the prospect of escorting her and Edith
over the place; but Oswald had then at once put his veto on the project,
as a thing forbidden; and which, if put in practice, his father would
never pardon.So it passed off, and now Oswald himself was at the gates
of that very domain with his friend who was about to enter them, his
friend whom he might never see again; that Coningsby who, from their
boyish days, had been the idol of his life; whom he had lived to see
appeal to his affections and his sympathy, and whom Oswald was now going
to desert in the midst of his lonely and unsolaced woe.'I ought not to enter here,' said Oswald, holding the hand of Coningsby
as he hesitated to advance; 'and yet there are duties more sacred even
than obedience to a father.I cannot leave you thus, friend of my best
heart!'The morning passed away in unceasing yet fruitless speculation on the
future.One moment something was to happen, the next nothing could
occur.Sometimes a beam of hope flashed over the fancy of Coningsby,
and jumping up from the turf, on which they were reclining, he seemed
to exult in his renovated energies; and then this sanguine paroxysm was
succeeded by a fit of depression so dark and dejected that nothing but
the presence of Oswald seemed to prevent Coningsby from flinging himself
into the waters of the Darl.The day was fast declining, and the inevitable moment of separation was
at hand.Oswald wished to appear at the dinner-table of Hellingsley,
that no suspicion might arise in the mind of his father of his having
accompanied Coningsby home.But just as he was beginning to mention the
necessity of his departure, a flash of lightning seemed to transfix the
heavens.The sky was very dark; though studded here and there with dingy
spots.The young men sprang up at the same time.'We had better get out of these trees,' said Oswald.'We had better get to the Castle,' said Coningsby.A clap of thunder that seemed to make the park quake broke over their
heads, followed by some thick drops.The Castle was close at hand;
Oswald had avoided entering it; but the impending storm was so menacing
that, hurried on by Coningsby, he could make no resistance; and, in a
few minutes, the companions were watching the tempest from the windows
of a room in Coningsby Castle.The fork-lightning flashed and scintillated from every quarter of the
horizon: the thunder broke over the Castle, as if the keep were rocking
with artillery: amid the momentary pauses of the explosion, the rain was
heard descending like dissolving water-spouts.Nor was this one of those transient tempests that often agitate
the summer.Time advanced, and its fierceness was little mitigated.Sometimes there was a lull, though the violence of the rain never
appeared to diminish; but then, as in some pitched fight between
contending hosts, when the fervour of the field seems for a moment to
allay, fresh squadrons arrive and renew the hottest strife, so a low
moaning wind that was now at intervals faintly heard bore up a great
reserve of electric vapour, that formed, as it were, into field in
the space between the Castle and Hellingsley, and then discharged its
violence on that fated district.'You must not think of going home
at present, my dear fellow,' said the first.'I am sure your father
would not be displeased.There is not a being here who even knows you,
and if they did, what then?'The servant entered the room, and inquired whether the gentlemen were
ready for dinner.'By all means; come, my dear Millbank, I feel reckless as the tempest;
let us drown our cares in wine!'Coningsby, in fact, was exhausted by all the agitation of the day, and
all the harassing spectres of the future.He found wine a momentary
solace.He ordered the servants away, and for a moment felt a degree of
wild satisfaction in the company of the brother of Edith.Thus they sat for a long time, talking only of one subject, and
repeating almost the same things, yet both felt happier in being
together.Oswald had risen, and opening the window, examined the
approaching night.The storm had lulled, though the rain still fell; in
the west was a streak of light.In a quarter of an hour, he calculated
on departing.As he was watching the wind he thought he heard the sound
of wheels, which reminded him of Coningsby's promise to lend him a light
carriage for his return.They sat down once more; they had filled their glasses for the last
time; to pledge to their faithful friendship, and the happiness of
Coningsby and Edith; when the door of the room opened, and there
appeared, MR.CHAPTER I.


It was the heart of the London season, nearly four years ago, twelve
months having almost elapsed since the occurrence of those painful
passages at Hellingsley which closed the last book of this history, and
long lines of carriages an hour before midnight, up the classic mount of
St.James and along Piccadilly, intimated that the world were received
at some grand entertainment in Arlington Street.It was the town mansion of the noble family beneath whose roof at
Beaumanoir we have more than once introduced the reader, to gain whose
courtyard was at this moment the object of emulous coachmen, and to
enter whose saloons was to reward the martyr-like patience of their
lords and ladies.Among the fortunate who had already succeeded in bowing to their hostess
were two gentlemen, who, ensconced in a good position, surveyed the
scene, and made their observations on the passing guests.They
were gentlemen who, to judge from their general air and the great
consideration with which they were treated by those who were
occasionally in their vicinity, were personages whose criticism bore
authority.'I say, Jemmy,' said the eldest, a dandy who had dined with the Regent,
but who was still a dandy, and who enjoyed life almost as much as in the
days when Carlton House occupied the terrace which still bears its name.'I say, Jemmy, what a load of young fellows there are!Begin to think fellows are younger than they used to be.At this moment an individual who came under the fortunate designation
of a young fellow, but whose assured carriage hardly intimated that
this was his first season in London, came up to the junior of the two
critics, and said, 'A pretty turn you played us yesterday at White's,
Melton.'My dear fellow, I am infinitely sorry; but I was obliged to go down to
Windsor, and I missed the return train.'A capital party, only you were wanted.We had Beaumanoir and Vere, and
Jack Tufton and Spraggs.'He told us a story about the
little Biron who was over here last year; I knew her at Paris; and an
Indian screen.Melton's companion, as the young man
moved away.A young fellow now of two or three and twenty
knows the world as men used to do after as many years of scrapes.I
wonder where there is such a thing as a greenhorn.Effie Crabbs says
the reason he gives up his house is, that he has cleaned out the old
generation, and that the new generation would clean him.''Buckhurst is not in that sort of way: he swears by Henry Sydney, a
younger son of the Duke, whom you don't know; and young Coningsby; a
sort of new set; new ideas and all that sort of thing.Beau tells me
a good deal about it; and when I was staying with the Everinghams,
at Easter, they were full of it.Coningsby had just returned from his
travels, and they were quite on the _qui vive_.Lady Everingham is one
of their set.I don't know what it is exactly; but I think we shall hear
more of it.''A sort of animal magnetism, or unknown tongues, I take it from your
description,' said his companion.'Well, I don't know what it is,' said Mr.Melton; 'but it has got hold
of all the young fellows who have just come out.Beau is a little bit
himself.I had some idea of giving my mind to it, they made such a fuss
about it at Everingham; but it requires a devilish deal of history, I
believe, and all that sort of thing.''It is difficult to turn to
with a new thing when you are not in the habit of it.'They told me you had the gout,
Cassilis?''So I had; but I have found out a fellow who cures the gout instanter.Pumicestone pills; sort
of a charm, I believe, and all that kind of thing: they say it rubs the
gout out of you.I sent him to Luxborough, who was very bad; cured him
directly.'Luxborough believes in the Millennium,' said Mr.'But here's a new thing that Melton has been telling me of, that all the
world is going to believe in,' said Mr.Cassilis,'something patronised
by Lady Everingham.''A very good patroness,' said Mr.'Young
Coningsby brought it from abroad; didn't you you say so, Jemmy?''No, no, my dear fellow; it is not at all that sort of thing.''But they say it requires a deuced deal of history,' continued Mr.'One must brush up one's Goldsmith.Canterton used to be the
fellow for history at White's.He was always boring one with William the
Conqueror, Julius Caesar, and all that sort of thing.'Ormsby, looking both sly and solemn, 'I
should not be surprised if, some day or another, we have a history about
Lady Everingham and young Coningsby.'Melton; 'he is engaged to be married to her sister, Lady
Theresa.'Ormsby; 'well, you are a friend of the family, and
I suppose you know.''He is a devilish good-looking fellow, that young Coningsby,' said Mr.'All the women are in love with him, they say.Lady Eleanor
Ducie quite raves about him.''By-the-bye, his grandfather has been very unwell,' said Mr.'I saw Lady Monmouth here just now,' said Mr.Daniel went to the hallway.'Got an odd story at White's that Lord Monmouth was going to separate
from her,' said Mr.'They are not going to separate, I believe,' said Mr.Melton; 'but I
rather think there was a foundation for the rumour.'Melton, 'all I know is, that it was looked upon
last winter at Paris as a settled thing.''There was some story about some Hungarian,' said Mr.'No, that blew over,' said Mr.Melton; 'it was Trautsmansdorff the row
was about.'Ormsby, as the friend of Lord and Lady Monmouth,
remained shaking his head; but as a member of society, and therefore
delighting in small scandal, appropriating the gossip with the greatest
avidity.'I should think old Monmouth was not the sort of fellow to blow up a
woman,' said Mr.'Provided she would leave him quietly,' said Mr.'Yes, Lord Monmouth never could live with a woman more than two years,'
said Mr.'And that I thought at the time rather an
objection to his marriage.'We must now briefly revert to what befell our hero after those unhappy
occurrences in the midst of whose first woe we left him.Rigby at the Castle, Coningsby quitted
it for London, and before a week had elapsed had embarked for Cadiz.He
felt a romantic interest in visiting the land to which Edith owed some
blood, and in acquiring the language which he had often admired as she
spoke it.A favourable opportunity permitted him in the autumn to visit
Athens and the AEgean, which he much desired.In the pensive beauties
of that delicate land, where perpetual autumn seems to reign, Coningsby
found solace.There is something in the character of Grecian scenery
which blends with the humour of the melancholy and the feelings of
the sorrowful.The wish of his
grandfather had rendered it necessary for him to return to England
somewhat abruptly.Lord Monmouth had not visited his native country
since his marriage; but the period that had elapsed since that event had
considerably improved the prospects of his party.The majority of the
Whig Cabinet in the House of Commons by 1840 had become little more than
nominal; and though it was circulated among their friends, as if from
the highest authority, that 'one was enough,' there seemed daily a
better chance of their being deprived even of that magical unit.For the
first time in the history of this country since the introduction of the
system of parliamentary sovereignty, the Government of England depended
on the fate of single elections; and indeed, by a single vote, it is
remarkable to observe, the fate of the Whig Government was ultimately
decided.This critical state of affairs, duly reported to Lord Monmouth, revived
his political passions, and offered him that excitement which he was
ever seeking, and yet for which he had often sighed.The Marquess, too,
was weary of Paris.Every day he found it more difficult to be amused.He, from whom nothing could be concealed,
perceived that often, while she elaborately attempted to divert him, her
mind was wandering elsewhere.Lord Monmouth was quite superior to all
petty jealousy and the vulgar feelings of inferior mortals, but his
sublime selfishness required devotion.He had calculated that a wife
or a mistress who might be in love with another man, however powerfully
their interests might prompt them, could not be so agreeable or amusing
to their friends and husbands as if they had no such distracting hold
upon their hearts or their fancy.Latterly at Paris, while Lucretia
became each day more involved in the vortex of society, where all
admired and some adored her, Lord Monmouth fell into the easy habit of
dining in his private rooms, sometimes tete-a-tete with Villebecque,
whose inexhaustible tales and adventures about a kind of society which
Lord Monmouth had always preferred infinitely to the polished and
somewhat insipid circles in which he was born, had rendered him the
prime favourite of his great patron.Sometimes Villebecque, too, brought
a friend, male or otherwise, whom he thought invested with the rare
faculty of distraction: Lord Monmouth cared not who or what they were,
provided they were diverting.Villebecque had written to Coningsby at Rome, by his grandfather's
desire, to beg him to return to England and meet Lord Monmouth there.The letter was couched with all the respect and good feeling which
Villebecque really entertained for him whom he addressed; still a letter
on such a subject from such a person was not agreeable to Coningsby, and
his reply to it was direct to his grandfather; Lord Monmouth, however,
had entirely given over writing letters.Coningsby had met at Paris, on his way to England, Lord and Lady
Everingham, and he had returned with them.This revival of an old
acquaintance was both agreeable and fortunate for our hero.The vivacity
of a clever and charming woman pleasantly disturbed the brooding memory
of Coningsby.There is no mortification however keen, no misery however
desperate, which the spirit of woman cannot in some degree lighten or
alleviate.About, too, to make his formal entrance into the great
world, he could not have secured a more valuable and accomplished
female friend.She gave him every instruction, every intimation that
was necessary; cleared the social difficulties which in some degree are
experienced on their entrance into the world even by the most highly
connected, unless they have this benign assistance; planted him
immediately in the position which was expedient; took care that he was
invited at once to the right houses; and, with the aid of her husband,
that he should become a member of the right clubs.'And who is to have the blue ribbon, Lord Eskdale?'said the Duchess to
that nobleman, as he entered and approached to pay his respects.'If I were Melbourne, I would keep it open,' replied his Lordship.'It
is a mistake to give away too quickly.''But suppose they go out,' said her Grace.there is always a last day to clear the House.The cliff will not be sapped before then.We made a
mistake last year about the ladies.''Quarrels about women are always a mistake.One should make it a rule to
give up to them, and then they are sure to give up to us.''You have no great faith in our firmness?''Male firmness is very often obstinacy: women have always something
better, worth all qualities; they have tact.''A compliment to the sex from so finished a critic as Lord Eskdale is
appreciated.'But at this moment the arrival of some guests terminated the
conversation, and Lord Eskdale moved away, and approached a group which
Lady Everingham was enlightening.'My dear Lord Fitz-booby,' her Ladyship observed, 'in politics we
require faith as well as in all other things.'Lord Fitz-booby looked rather perplexed; but, possessed of considerable
official experience, having held high posts, some in the cabinet, for
nearly a quarter of a century, he was too versed to acknowledge that he
had not understood a single word that had been addressed to him for the
last ten minutes.He looked on with the same grave, attentive stolidity,
occasionally nodding his head, as he was wont of yore when he received
a deputation on sugar duties or joint-stock banks, and when he made,
as was his custom when particularly perplexed, an occasional note on a
sheet of foolscap paper.'An Opposition in an age of revolution,' continued Lady Everingham,
'must be founded on principles.It cannot depend on mere personal
ability and party address taking advantage of circumstances.You have
not enunciated a principle for the last ten years; and when you seemed
on the point of acceding to power, it was not on a great question of
national interest, but a technical dispute respecting the constitution
of an exhausted sugar colony.''If you are a Conservative party, we wish to know what you want to
conserve,' said Lord Vere.'If it had not been for the Whig abolition of slavery,' said Lord
Fitz-booby, goaded into repartee, 'Jamaica would not have been an
exhausted sugar colony.''Then what you do want to conserve is slavery?''No,' said Lord Fitz-booby, 'I am never for retracing our steps.''But will you advance, will you move?And where will you advance, and
how will you move?''I think we have had quite enough of advancing,' said his Lordship.'I
had no idea your Ladyship was a member of the Movement party,' he added,
with a sarcastic grin.'But if it were bad, Lord Fitz-booby, to move where we are, as you
and your friends have always maintained, how can you reconcile it to
principle to remain there?''I would make the best of a bad bargain,' said Lord Fitz-booby.'With
a Conservative government, a reformed Constitution would be less
dangerous.''What are your distinctive principles that
render the peril less?''I appeal to Lord Eskdale,' said Lord Fitz-booby; 'there is Lady
Everingham turned quite a Radical, I declare.Is not your Lordship of
opinion that the country must be safer with a Conservative government
than with a Liberal?''I think the country is always tolerably secure,' said Lord Eskdale.Lady Theresa, leaning on the arm of Mr.Lyle, came up at this moment,
and unconsciously made a diversion in favour of Lord Fitz-booby.'Pray, Theresa,' said Lady Everingham, 'where is Mr.It so happened that on this day Coningsby
and Henry Sydney dined at Grillion's, at an university club, where,
among many friends whom Coningsby had not met for a long time, and among
delightful reminiscences, the unconscious hours stole on.It was late
when they quitted Grillion's, and Coningsby's brougham was detained for
a considerable time before its driver could insinuate himself into the
line, which indeed he would never have succeeded in doing had not he
fortunately come across the coachman of the Duke of Agincourt, who being
of the same politics as himself, belonging to the same club, and always
black-balling the same men, let him in from a legitimate party feeling;
so they arrived in Arlington Street at a very late hour.Coningsby was springing up the staircase, now not so crowded as it had
been, and met a retiring party; he was about to say a passing word to a
gentleman as he went by, when, suddenly, Coningsby turned deadly pale.The gentleman could hardly be the cause, for it was the gracious and
handsome presence of Lord Beaumanoir: the lady resting on his arm was
Edith.They moved on while he was motionless; yet Edith and himself
had exchanged glances.His was one of astonishment; but what was the
expression of hers?She must have recognised him before he had observed
her.She was collected, and she expressed the purpose of her mind in
a distant and haughty recognition.Coningsby remained for a moment
stupefied; then suddenly turning back, he bounded downstairs and hurried
into the cloak-room.He met Lady Wallinger; he spoke rapidly, he held
her hand, did not listen to her answers, his eyes wandered about.There
were many persons present, at length he recognised Edith enveloped in
her mantle.He went forward, he looked at her, as if he would have read
her soul; he said something.She changed colour as he addressed her,
but seemed instantly by an effort to rally and regain her equanimity;
replied to his inquiries with extreme brevity, and Lady Wallinger's
carriage being announced, moved away with the same slight haughty salute
as before, on the arm of Lord Beaumanoir.Sadness fell over the once happy family of Millbank after the departure
of Coningsby from Hellingsley.When the first pang was over, Edith
had found some solace in the sympathy of her aunt, who had always
appreciated and admired Coningsby; but it was a sympathy which aspired
only to soften sorrow, and not to create hope.But Lady Wallinger,
though she lengthened her visit for the sake of her niece, in time
quitted them; and then the name of Coningsby was never heard by Edith.Her brother, shortly after the sorrowful and abrupt departure of his
friend, had gone to the factories, where he remained, and of which, in
future, it was intended that he should assume the principal direction.Millbank himself, sustained at first by the society of his friend
Sir Joseph, to whom he was attached, and occupied with daily reports
from his establishment and the transaction of the affairs with his
numerous and busy constituents, was for a while scarcely conscious of
the alteration which had taken place in the demeanour of his daughter.But when they were once more alone together, it was impossible any
longer to be blind to the great change.That happy and equable gaiety of
spirit, which seemed to spring from an innocent enjoyment of existence,
and which had ever distinguished Edith, was wanting.She was not indeed always moody and dispirited, but she was
fitful, unequal in her tone.That temper whose sweetness had been a
domestic proverb had become a little uncertain.Not that her affection
for her father was diminished, but there were snatches of unusual
irritability which momentarily escaped her, followed by bursts of
tenderness that were the creatures of compunction.And often, after some
hasty word, she would throw her arms round her father's neck with the
fondness of remorse.She pursued her usual avocations, for she had
really too well-regulated a mind, she was in truth a person of
too strong an intellect, to neglect any source of occupation and
distraction.Her flowers, her pencil, and her books supplied her with
these; and music soothed, and at times beguiled, her agitated thoughts.But there was no joy in the house, and in time Mr.Millbank was vexed, irritated, grieved.Edith, his Edith, the pride
and delight of his existence, who had been to him only a source of
exultation and felicity, was no longer happy, was perhaps pining away;
and there was the appearance, the unjust appearance that he, her fond
father, was the cause and occasion of all this wretchedness.It would
appear that the name of Coningsby, to which he now owed a great debt of
gratitude, was still doomed to bear him mortification and misery.Truly
had the young man said that there was a curse upon their two families.And yet, on reflection, it still seemed to Mr.Millbank that he had
acted with as much wisdom and real kindness as decision.The union was impossible; the speedier their
separation, therefore, clearly the better.Unfortunate, indeed, had been
his absence from Hellingsley; unquestionably his presence might have
prevented the catastrophe.Millbank could not shut his eyes to the devotion of his son to
Coningsby.He felt he could count on no assistance in this respect from
that quarter.Yet how hard upon him that he should seem to figure as
a despot or a tyrant to his own children, whom he loved, when he had
absolutely acted in an inevitable manner!Edith seemed sad, Oswald
sullen; all was changed.All the objects for which this clear-headed,
strong-minded, kind-hearted man had been working all his life, seemed
to be frustrated.Because a young man had made love to his
daughter, who was really in no manner entitled to do so.Millbank found Hellingsley, under existing
circumstances, extremely wearisome; and he proposed to his daughter that
they should pay a visit to their earlier home.Edith assented without
difficulty, but without interest.Millbank immediately
perceived, the change was a judicious one; for certainly the spirits
of Edith seemed to improve after her return to their valley.There were
more objects of interest: change, too, is always beneficial.Millbank had been aware that Oswald had received a letter from
Coningsby, written before he quitted Spain, perhaps he might have
recognised a more satisfactory reason for the transient liveliness of
his daughter which had so greatly gratified him.About a month after Christmas, the meeting of Parliament summoned Mr.Millbank up to London; and he had wished Edith to accompany him.But
London in February to Edith, without friends or connections, her father
always occupied and absent from her day and night, seemed to them
all, on reflection, to be a life not very conducive to health or
cheerfulness, and therefore she remained with her brother.Oswald had
heard from Coningsby again from Rome; but at the period he wrote he did
not anticipate his return to England.His tone was affectionate, but
dispirited.Lady Wallinger went up to London after Easter for the season, and Mr.Millbank, now that there was a constant companion for his daughter, took
a house and carried Edith back with him to London.Lady Wallinger,
who had great wealth and great tact, had obtained by degrees a
not inconsiderable position in society.She had a fine house in a
fashionable situation, and gave profuse entertainments.The Whigs
were under obligations to her husband, and the great Whig ladies were
gratified to find in his wife a polished and pleasing person, to whom
they could be courteous without any annoyance.So that Edith, under the
auspices of her aunt, found herself at once in circles which otherwise
she might not easily have entered, but which her beauty, grace, and
experience of the most refined society of the Continent, qualified
her to shine in.One evening they met the Marquis of Beaumanoir, their
friend of Rome and Paris, and admirer of Edith, who from that time was
seldom from their side.His mother, the Duchess, immediately called both
on the Millbanks and the Wallingers; glad, not only to please her son,
but to express that consideration for Mr.Millbank which the Duke always
wished to show.It was, however, of no use; nothing would induce Mr.Millbank ever to enter what he called aristocratic society.He liked the
House of Commons; never paired off; never missed a moment of it; worked
at committees all the morning, listened attentively to debates all the
night; always dined at Bellamy's when there was a house; and when there
was not, liked dining at the Fishmongers' Company, the Russia Company,
great Emigration banquets, and other joint-stock festivities.That was
his idea of rational society; business and pleasure combined; a good
dinner, and good speeches afterwards.Edith was aware that Coningsby had returned to England, for her brother
had heard from him on his arrival; but Oswald had not heard since.A season in London only represented in the mind of Edith the chance,
perhaps the certainty, of meeting Coningsby again; of communing together
over the catastrophe of last summer; of soothing and solacing each
other's unhappiness, and perhaps, with the sanguine imagination of
youth, foreseeing a more felicitous future.She had been nearly a
fortnight in town, and though moving frequently in the same circles as
Coningsby, they had not yet met.It was one of those results which
could rarely occur; but even chance enters too frequently in the
league against lovers.The invitation to the assembly at ---- House was
therefore peculiarly gratifying to Edith, since she could scarcely
doubt that if Coningsby were in town, which her casual inquiries of Lord
Beaumanoir induced her to believe was the case, he would be present.Never, therefore, had she repaired to an assembly with such a flattering
spirit; and yet there was a fascinating anxiety about it that bewilders
the young heart.In vain Edith surveyed the rooms to catch the form of that being, whom
for a moment she had never ceased to cherish and muse over.He was not
there; and at the very moment when, disappointed and mortified, she most
required solace, she learned from Mr.Melton that Lady Theresa Sydney,
whom she chanced to admire, was going to be married, and to Mr.His silence, perhaps his shunning of her were no
longer inexplicable.What a return for all her romantic devotion in her
sad solitude at Hellingsley.Was this the end of their twilight rambles,
and the sweet pathos of their mutual loves?There seemed to be no truth
in man, no joy in life!All the feelings that she had so generously
lavished, all returned upon herself.She could have burst into a passion
of tears and buried herself in a cloister.Instead of that, civilisation made her listen with a serene though
tortured countenance; but as soon as it was in her power, pleading a
headache to Lady Wallinger, she effected, or thought she had effected,
her escape from a scene which harrowed her heart.As for Coningsby, he passed a sleepless night, agitated by the
unexpected presence of Edith and distracted by the manner in which
she had received him.To say that her appearance had revived all his
passionate affection for her would convey an unjust impression of the
nature of his feelings.His affection had never for a moment swerved; it
was profound and firm.But unquestionably this sudden vision had brought
before him, in startling and more vivid colours, the relations that
subsisted between them.There was the being whom he loved and who loved
him; and whatever were the barriers which the circumstances of life
placed against their union, they were partakers of the solemn sacrament
of an unpolluted heart.Coningsby, as we have mentioned, had signified to Oswald his return to
England: he had hitherto omitted to write again; not because his spirit
faltered, but he was wearied of whispering hope without foundation, and
mourning over his chagrined fortunes.Once more in England, once more
placed in communication with his grandfather, he felt with increased
conviction the difficulties which surrounded him.The society of Lady
Everingham and her sister, who had been at the same time her visitor,
had been a relaxation, and a beneficial one, to a mind suffering
too much from the tension of one idea.But Coningsby had treated the
matrimonial project of his gay-minded hostess with the courteous levity
in which he believed it had first half originated.He admired and liked
Lady Theresa; but there was a reason why he should not marry her, even
had his own heart not been absorbed by one of those passions from which
men of deep and earnest character never emancipate themselves.After musing and meditating again and again over everything that had
occurred, Coningsby fell asleep when the morning had far advanced,
resolved to rise when a little refreshed and find out Lady Wallinger,
who, he felt sure, would receive him with kindness.Yet it was fated that this step should not be taken, for while he was
at breakfast, his servant brought him a letter from Monmouth House,
apprising him that his grandfather wished to see him as soon as possible
on urgent business.Lord Monmouth was sitting in the same dressing-room in which he was
first introduced to the reader; on the table were several packets of
papers that were open and in course of reference; and he dictated his
observations to Monsieur Villebecque, who was writing at his left hand.Thus were they occupied when Coningsby was ushered into the room.'You see, Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, 'that I am much occupied to-day,
yet the business on which I wish to communicate with you is so pressing
that it could not be postponed.'He made a sign to Villebecque, and his
secretary instantly retired.'I was right in pressing your return to England,' continued Lord
Monmouth to his grandson, who was a little anxious as to the impending
communication, which he could not in any way anticipate.'These are not
times when young men should be out of sight.You may be astonished, but
it is a fact.They are going to dissolve their own House of Commons.Notwithstanding this and the Queen's name, we can beat them; but the
race requires the finest jockeying.Tadpole has
been here to me about Darlford; he came specially with a message, I may
say an appeal, from one to whom I can refuse nothing; the Government
count on the seat, though with the new Registration 'tis nearly a tie.If we had a good candidate we could win.He is too
much of the old clique; used up; a hack; besides, a beaten horse.We are
assured the name of Coningsby would be a host; there is a considerable
section who support the present fellow who will not vote against a
Coningsby.They have thought of you as a fit person, and I have approved
of the suggestion.You will, therefore, be the candidate for Darlford
with my entire sanction and support, and I have no doubt you will be
successful.You may be sure I shall spare nothing: and it will be very
gratifying to me, after being robbed of all our boroughs, that the only
Coningsby who cares to enter Parliament, should nevertheless be able to
do so as early as I could fairly desire.'Millbank on the hustings of Darlford!The fierce passions,
the gross insults, the hot blood and the cool lies, the ruffianism and
the ribaldry, perhaps the domestic discomfiture and mortification, which
he was about to be the means of bringing on the roof he loved best
in the world, occurred to him with anguish.The countenance of
Edith, haughty and mournful last night, rose to him again.He saw her
canvassing for her father, and against him.And for what was
he to make this terrible and costly sacrifice For his ambition?Not even
for that Divinity or Daemon for which we all immolate so much!Mighty
ambition, forsooth, to succeed to the Rigbys!To enter the House of
Commons a slave and a tool; to move according to instructions, and
to labour for the low designs of petty spirits, without even the
consolation of being a dupe.What sympathy could there exist between
Coningsby and the 'great Conservative party,' that for ten years in
an age of revolution had never promulgated a principle; whose only
intelligible and consistent policy seemed to be an attempt, very
grateful of course to the feelings of an English Royalist, to revive
Irish Puritanism; who when in power in 1835 had used that power only to
evince their utter ignorance of Church principles; and who were at this
moment, when Coningsby was formally solicited to join their ranks, in
open insurrection against the prerogatives of the English Monarchy?'Do you anticipate then an immediate dissolution, sir?'inquired
Coningsby after a moment's pause.'We must anticipate it; though I think it doubtful.It may be next
month; it may be in the autumn; they may tide over another year, as Lord
Eskdale thinks, and his opinion always weighs with me.Tadpole believes they will dissolve at once.But whether they dissolve
now, or in a month's time, or in the autumn, or next year, our course
is clear.Monday next, there is a great Conservative dinner at Darlford.You
must attend it; that will be the finest opportunity in the world for you
to announce yourself.''Don't you think, sir,' said Coningsby, 'that such an announcement would
be rather premature?It is, in fact, embarking in a contest which may
last a year; perhaps more.''What you say is very true,' said Lord Monmouth; 'no doubt it is very
troublesome; very disgusting; any canvassing is.But we must take things
as we find them.You cannot get into Parliament now in the good old
gentlemanlike way; and we ought to be thankful that this interest has
been fostered for our purpose.'Coningsby looked on the carpet, cleared his throat as if about to speak,
and then gave something like a sigh.'I think you had better be off the day after to-morrow,' said Lord
Monmouth.'I have sent instructions to the steward to do all he can in
so short a time, for I wish you to entertain the principal people.''You are most kind, you are always most kind to me, dear sir,' said
Coningsby, in a hesitating tone, and with an air of great embarrassment,
'but, in truth, I have no wish to enter Parliament.''I feel that I am not sufficiently prepared for so great a
responsibility as a seat in the House of Commons,' said Coningsby.How can any one have a more agreeable seat?The only person to
whom you are responsible is your own relation, who brings you in.And I
don't suppose there can be any difference on any point between us.You
are certainly still young; but I was younger by nearly two years when
I first went in; and I found no difficulty.All you have got to do is to vote with your party.As for speaking, if
you have a talent that way, take my advice; don't be in a hurry.Learn
to know the House; learn the House to know you.If a man be discreet, he
cannot enter Parliament too soon.''It is not exactly that, sir,' said Coningsby.'Then what is it, my dear Harry?You see to-day I have much to do; yet
as your business is pressing, I would not postpone seeing you an hour.I
thought you would have been very much gratified.''You mentioned that I had nothing to do but to vote with my party, sir,'
replied Coningsby.'You mean, of course, by that term what is understood
by the Conservative party.''I am sorry,' said Coningsby, rather pale, but speaking with firmness,
'I am sorry that I could not support the Conservative party.'exclaimed Lord Monmouth, starting in his seat,'some woman
has got hold of him, and made him a Whig!''No, my dear grandfather,' said Coningsby, scarcely able to repress a
smile, serious as the interview was becoming, 'nothing of the kind, I
assure you.No person can be more anti-Whig.''I don't know what you are driving at, sir,' said Lord Monmouth, in a
hard, dry tone.'I wish to be frank, sir,' said Coningsby, 'and am very sensible of your
goodness in permitting me to speak to you on the subject.What I mean to
say is, that I have for a long time looked upon the Conservative party
as a body who have betrayed their trust; more from ignorance, I admit,
than from design; yet clearly a body of individuals totally unequal
to the exigencies of the epoch, and indeed unconscious of its real
character.''Well, between ourselves, I am quite of the same opinion.But we must
mount higher; we must go to '28 for the real mischief.But what is the
use of lamenting the past?Peel is the only man; suited to the times and
all that; at least we must say so, and try to believe so; we can't go
back.And it is our own fault that we have let the chief power out of
the hands of our own order.It was never thought of in the time of your
great-grandfather, sir.And if a commoner were for a season permitted
to be the nominal Premier to do the detail, there was always a secret
committee of great 1688 nobles to give him his instructions.''I should be very sorry to see secret committees of great 1688 nobles
again,' said Coningsby.'Then what the devil do you want to see?''Political faith,' said Coningsby, 'instead of political infidelity.''Before I support Conservative principles,' continued Coningsby, 'I
merely wish to be informed what those principles aim to conserve.It
would not appear to be the prerogative of the Crown, since the principal
portion of a Conservative oration now is an invective against a late
royal act which they describe as a Bed-chamber plot.Is it the Church
which they wish to conserve?What is a threatened Appropriation Clause
against an actual Church Commission in the hands of Parliamentary
Laymen?Well, then, if it
is neither the Crown nor the Church, whose rights and privileges this
Conservative party propose to vindicate, is it your House, the House
of Lords, whose powers they are prepared to uphold?Is it not notorious
that the very man whom you have elected as your leader in that House,
declares among his Conservative adherents, that henceforth the assembly
that used to furnish those very Committees of great revolution nobles
that you mention, is to initiate nothing; and, without a struggle, is
to subside into that undisturbed repose which resembles the Imperial
tranquillity that secured the frontiers by paying tribute?''All this is vastly fine,' said Lord Monmouth; 'but I see no means by
which I can attain my object but by supporting Peel.After all, what is
the end of all parties and all politics?I want to
turn our coronet into a ducal one, and to get your grandmother's barony
called out of abeyance in your favour.It is impossible that Peel can
refuse me.I have already purchased an ample estate with the view
of entailing it on you and your issue.You will make a considerable
alliance; you may marry, if you please, Lady Theresa Sydney.Count on my at once entering into any arrangement
conducive to your happiness.''My dear grandfather, you have ever been to me only too kind and
generous.''To whom should I be kind but to you, my own blood, that has never
crossed me, and of whom I have reason to be proud?Yes, Harry, it
gratifies me to hear you admired and to learn your success.All I want
now is to see you in Parliament.There is a sort of stiffness about every man, no matter what may be his
talents, who enters Parliament late in life; and now, fortunately, the
occasion offers.You will go down on Friday; feed the notabilities
well; speak out; praise Peel; abuse O'Connell and the ladies of the
Bed-chamber; anathematise all waverers; say a good deal about Ireland;
stick to the Irish Registration Bill, that's a good card; and, above
all, my dear Harry, don't spare that fellow Millbank.Remember, in
turning him out you not only gain a vote for the Conservative cause
and our coronet, but you crush my foe.Spare nothing for that object; I
count on you, boy.''I should grieve to be backward in anything that concerned your
interest or your honour, sir,' said Coningsby, with an air of great
embarrassment.'I am sure you would, I am sure you would,' said Lord Monmouth, in a
tone of some kindness.'And I feel at this moment,' continued Coningsby, 'that there is no
personal sacrifice which I am not prepared to make for them, except one.My interests, my affections, they should not be placed in the balance,
if yours, sir, were at stake, though there are circumstances which might
involve me in a position of as much mental distress as a man could well
endure; but I claim for my convictions, my dear grandfather, a generous
tolerance.''I can't follow you, sir,' said Lord Monmouth, again in his hard tone.'Our interests are inseparable, and therefore there can never be
any sacrifice of conduct on your part.What you mean by sacrifice of
affections, I don't comprehend; but as for your opinions, you have no
business to have any other than those I uphold.'I am sure I wish to express them with no unbecoming confidence,'
replied Coningsby; 'I have never intruded them on your ear before;
but this being an occasion when you yourself said, sir, I was about
to commence my public career, I confess I thought it was my duty to be
frank; I would not entail on myself long years of mortification by one
of those ill-considered entrances into political life which so many
public men have cause to deplore.''You go with your family, sir, like a gentleman; you are not to consider
your opinions, like a philosopher or a political adventurer.''Yes, sir,' said Coningsby, with animation, 'but men going with their
families like gentlemen, and losing sight of every principle on which
the society of this country ought to be established, produced the Reform
Bill.'said Lord Monmouth; 'if the Duke had not
quarrelled with Lord Grey on a Coal Committee, we should never have had
the Reform Bill.'You are in as great peril now as you were in 1830,' said Coningsby.'No, no, no,' said Lord Monmouth; 'the Tory party is organised now; they
will not catch us napping again: these Conservative Associations have
done the business.''At the best to turn
out the Whigs.And when you have turned out the Whigs, what then?You
may get your ducal coronet, sir.But a duke now is not so great a man
as a baron was but a century back.We cannot struggle against the
irresistible stream of circumstances.Power has left our order; this is
not an age for factitious aristocracy.As for my grandmother's barony, I
should look upon the termination of its abeyance in my favour as the
act of my political extinction.What we want, sir, is not to fashion
new dukes and furbish up old baronies, but to establish great principles
which may maintain the realm and secure the happiness of the people.Let
me see authority once more honoured; a solemn reverence again the habit
of our lives; let me see property acknowledging, as in the old days
of faith, that labour is his twin brother, and that the essence of all
tenure is the performance of duty; let results such as these be brought
about, and let me participate, however feebly, in the great fulfilment,
and public life then indeed becomes a noble career, and a seat in
Parliament an enviable distinction.''I tell you what it is, Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, very drily,'members
of this family may think as they like, but they must act as I please.You must go down on Friday to Darlford and declare yourself a candidate
for the town, or I shall reconsider our mutual positions.I would say,
you must go to-morrow; but it is only courteous to Rigby to give him a
previous intimation of your movement.I
sent for Rigby this morning on other business which now occupies me, and
find he is out of town.He will return to-morrow; and will be here at
three o'clock, when you can meet him.You will meet him, I doubt not,
like a man of sense,' added Lord Monmouth, looking at Coningsby with a
glance such as he had never before encountered, 'who is not prepared to
sacrifice all the objects of life for the pursuit of some fantastical
puerilities.'His Lordship rang a bell on his table for Villebecque; and to prevent
any further conversation, resumed his papers.It would have been difficult for any person, unconscious of crime,
to have felt more dejected than Coningsby when he rode out of the
court-yard of Monmouth House.The love of Edith would have consoled
him for the destruction of his prosperity; the proud fulfilment of his
ambition might in time have proved some compensation for his crushed
affections; but his present position seemed to offer no single source
of solace.There came over him that irresistible conviction that is at
times the dark doom of all of us, that the bright period of our life is
past; that a future awaits us only of anxiety, failure, mortification,
despair; that none of our resplendent visions can ever be realised:
and that we add but one more victim to the long and dreary catalogue of
baffled aspirations.Nor could he indeed by any combination see the means to extricate
himself from the perils that were encompassing him.There was something
about his grandfather that defied persuasion.Prone as eloquent
youth generally is to believe in the resistless power of its appeals,
Coningsby despaired at once of ever moving Lord Monmouth.There had been
a callous dryness in his manner, an unswerving purpose in his spirit,
that at once baffled all attempts at influence.Nor could Coningsby
forget the look he received when he quitted the room.There was no
possibility of mistaking it; it said at once, without periphrasis,
'Cross my purpose, and I will crush you!'This was the moment when the sympathy, if not the counsels, of
friendship might have been grateful.A clever woman might have afforded
even more than sympathy; some happy device that might have even released
him from the mesh in which he was involved.And once Coningsby had
turned his horse's head to Park Lane to call on Lady Everingham.But
surely if there were a sacred secret in the world, it was the one which
subsisted between himself and Edith.Then there was Lady Wallinger; he could at least speak with freedom to
her.He looked in for a moment at a club
to take up the 'Court Guide' and find her direction.A few men were
standing in a bow window.Cassilis say,

'So Beau, they say, is booked at last; the new beauty, have you heard?''I saw him very sweet on her last night,' rejoined his companion.'Deuced deal, they say,' replied Mr.The father is a cotton
lord, and they all have loads of tin, you know.'He is in Parliament, is not he?'''Gad, I believe he is,' said Mr.Cassilis; 'I never know who is in
Parliament in these days.I remember when there were only ten men in the
House of Commons who were not either members of Brookes' or this place.'I hear 'tis an old affair of Beau,' said another gentleman.'It was all
done a year ago at Rome or Paris.''They say she refused him then,' said Mr.'Well, that is tolerably cool for a manufacturer's daughter,' said his
friend.'The Duke will be deuced glad to see Beau settled, I take it,' said Mr.'A good deal depends on the tin,' said his friend.Coningsby threw down the 'Court Guide' with a sinking heart.In spite
of every insuperable difficulty, hitherto the end and object of all his
aspirations and all his exploits, sometimes even almost unconsciously
to himself, was Edith.The strange manner of last night was
fatally explained.The heart that once had been his was now another's.To the man who still loves there is in that conviction the most profound
and desolate sorrow of which our nature is capable.All the recollection
of the past, all the once-cherished prospects of the future, blend into
one bewildering anguish.Coningsby quitted the club, and mounting his
horse, rode rapidly out of town, almost unconscious of his direction.He found himself at length in a green lane near Willesden, silent and
undisturbed; he pulled up his horse, and summoned all his mind to the
contemplation of his prospects.Now, should he return to his grandfather, accept his
mission, and go down to Darlford on Friday?Favour and fortune, power,
prosperity, rank, distinction would be the consequence of this step;
might not he add even vengeance?Was there to be no term to his
endurance?Might not he teach this proud, prejudiced manufacturer, with
all his virulence and despotic caprices, a memorable lesson?And his
daughter, too, this betrothed, after all, of a young noble, with her
flush futurity of splendour and enjoyment, was she to hear of him only,
if indeed she heard of him at all, as of one toiling or trifling in the
humbler positions of existence; and wonder, with a blush, that he ever
could have been the hero of her romantic girlhood?His cheek burnt at the possibility of such ignominy!It was a conjuncture in his life that required decision.He thought of
his companions who looked up to him with such ardent anticipations of
his fame, of delight in his career, and confidence in his leading; were
all these high and fond fancies to be balked?On the very threshold of
life was he to blunder?'Tis the first step that leads to all, and
his was to be a wilful error.He remembered his first visit to his
grandfather, and the delight of his friends at Eton at his report on his
return.After eight years of initiation was he to lose that favour then
so highly prized, when the results which they had so long counted on
were on the very eve of accomplishment?Parliament and riches, and rank
and power; these were facts, realities, substances, that none could
mistake.Was he to sacrifice them for speculations, theories, shadows,
perhaps the vapours of a green and conceited brain?He was like Caesar by the starry river's side, watching the image of the
planets on its fatal waters.The sun set; the twilight spell fell upon his soul; the exaltation
of his spirit died away.Beautiful thoughts, full of sweetness and
tranquillity and consolation, came clustering round his heart like
seraphs.He thought of Edith in her hours of fondness; he thought of
the pure and solemn moments when to mingle his name with the heroes of
humanity was his aspiration, and to achieve immortal fame the inspiring
purpose of his life.What were the tawdry accidents of vulgar ambition
to him?No domestic despot could deprive him of his intellect, his
knowledge, the sustaining power of an unpolluted conscience.If he
possessed the intelligence in which he had confidence, the world
would recognise his voice even if not placed upon a pedestal.If the
principles of his philosophy were true, the great heart of the nation
would respond to their expression.Coningsby felt at this moment a
profound conviction which never again deserted him, that the conduct
which would violate the affections of the heart, or the dictates of the
conscience, however it may lead to immediate success, is a fatal error.Conscious that he was perhaps verging on some painful vicissitude of his
life, he devoted himself to a love that seemed hopeless, and to a fame
that was perhaps a dream.It was under the influence of these solemn resolutions that he wrote,
on his return home, a letter to Lord Monmouth, in which he expressed
all that affection which he really felt for his grandfather, and all
the pangs which it cost him to adhere to the conclusions he had already
announced.In terms of tenderness, and even humility, he declined to
become a candidate for Darlford, or even to enter Parliament, except as
the master of his own conduct.CHAPTER V.


Lady Monmouth was reclining on a sofa in that beautiful boudoir which
had been fitted up under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, but as he
then believed for the Princess Colonna.The walls were hung with amber
satin, painted by Delaroche with such subjects as might be expected from
his brilliant and picturesque pencil.Fair forms, heroes and heroines
in dazzling costume, the offspring of chivalry merging into what is
commonly styled civilisation, moved in graceful or fantastic groups amid
palaces and gardens.The ceiling, carved in the deep honeycomb fashion
of the Saracens, was richly gilt and picked out in violet.Upon a violet
carpet of velvet was represented the marriage of Cupid and Psyche.It was about two hours after Coningsby had quitted Monmouth House, and
Flora came in, sent for by Lady Monmouth as was her custom, to read to
her as she was employed with some light work.''Tis a new book of Sue,' said Lucretia.Flora, seated by her side, began to read.Reading was an accomplishment
which distinguished Flora; but to-day her voice faltered, her expression
was uncertain; she seemed but imperfectly to comprehend her page.More
than once Lady Monmouth looked round at her with an inquisitive glance.madam,' she at last exclaimed, 'if you would but speak to Mr.said Lady Monmouth, turning quickly on the sofa; then,
collecting herself in an instant, she continued with less abruptness,
and more suavity than usual, 'Tell me, Flora, what is it; what is the
matter?''My Lord,' sobbed Flora, 'has quarrelled with Mr.An expression of eager interest came over the countenance of Lucretia.'I do not know they have quarrelled; it is not, perhaps, a right term;
but my Lord is very angry with Mr.'Not very angry, I should think, Flora; and about what?'very angry, madam,' said Flora, shaking her head mournfully.'My
Lord told M. Villebecque that perhaps Mr.Coningsby would never enter
the house again.'Coningsby has only left this hour or two.He will not
do what my Lord wishes, about some seat in the Chamber.I do not know
exactly what it is; but my Lord is in one of his moods of terror: my
father is frightened even to go into his room when he is so.'Coningsby came, and he found that Mr.Lady Monmouth rose from her sofa, and walked once or twice up and down
the room.Then turning to Flora, she said, 'Go away now: the book is
stupid; it does not amuse me.Stop: find out all you can for me about
the quarrel before I speak to Mr.Lucretia remained for some time in meditation;
then she wrote a few lines, which she despatched at once to Mr.What a great man was the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby!Here was one
of the first peers of England, and one of the finest ladies in London,
both waiting with equal anxiety his return to town; and unable to
transact two affairs of vast importance, yet wholly unconnected, without
his interposition!What was the secret of the influence of this man,
confided in by everybody, trusted by none?His counsels were not deep,
his expedients were not felicitous; he had no feeling, and he could
create no sympathy.It is that, in most of the transactions of life,
there is some portion which no one cares to accomplish, and which
everybody wishes to be achieved.In the eye of the world he had constantly the appearance of being
mixed up with high dealings, and negotiations and arrangements of fine
management, whereas in truth, notwithstanding his splendid livery and
the airs he gave himself in the servants' hall, his real business in
life had ever been, to do the dirty work.Rigby had been shut up much at his villa of late.He was concocting,
you could not term it composing, an article, a'very slashing article,'
which was to prove that the penny postage must be the destruction of the
aristocracy.It was a grand subject, treated in his highest style.His
parallel portraits of Rowland Hill the conqueror of Almarez and Rowland
Hill the deviser of the cheap postage were enormously fine.It was full
of passages in italics, little words in great capitals, and almost drew
tears.The statistical details also were highly interesting and novel.Several of the old postmen, both twopenny and general, who had been in
office with himself, and who were inspired with an equal zeal against
that spirit of reform of which they had alike been victims, supplied him
with information which nothing but a breach of ministerial duty could
have furnished.The prophetic peroration as to the irresistible progress
of democracy was almost as powerful as one of Rigby's speeches on
Aldborough or Amersham.There never was a fellow for giving a good
hearty kick to the people like Rigby.Himself sprung from the dregs of
the populace, this was disinterested.What could be more patriotic and
magnanimous than his Jeremiads over the fall of the Montmorencis and the
Crillons, or the possible catastrophe of the Percys and the Manners!The
truth of all this hullabaloo was that Rigby had a sly pension which,
by an inevitable association of ideas, he always connected with the
maintenance of an aristocracy.All his rigmarole dissertations on the
French revolution were impelled by this secret influence; and when he
wailed over 'la guerre aux chateaux,' and moaned like a mandrake over
Nottingham Castle in flames, the rogue had an eye all the while to
quarter-day!Arriving in town the day after Coningsby's interview with his
grandfather, Mr.Rigby found a summons to Monmouth House waiting him,
and an urgent note from Lucretia begging that he would permit nothing
to prevent him seeing her for a few minutes before he called on the
Marquess.Lucretia, acting on the unconscious intimation of Flora, had in the
course of four-and-twenty hours obtained pretty ample and accurate
details of the cause of contention between Coningsby and her husband.Rigby not only that Lord Monmouth was
highly incensed against his grandson, but that the cause of their
misunderstanding arose about a seat in the House of Commons, and that
seat too the one which Mr.Rigby had long appropriated to himself,
and over whose registration he had watched with such affectionate
solicitude.Lady Monmouth arranged this information like a firstrate artist, and
gave it a grouping and a colour which produced the liveliest effect
upon her confederate.The countenance of Rigby was almost ghastly as
he received the intelligence; a grin, half of malice, half of terror,
played over his features.'I told you to beware of him long ago,' said Lady Monmouth.'He is, he
has ever been, in the way of both of us.''He is in my power,' said Rigby.'He is in love with the daughter of Millbank, the man who bought
Hellingsley.'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, in a prolonged tone.'He was at Coningsby all last summer, hanging about her.I found the
younger Millbank quite domiciliated at the Castle; a fact which, of
itself, if known to Lord Monmouth, would ensure the lad's annihilation.''And you kept this fine news for a winter campaign, my good Mr.Rigby,'
said Lady Monmouth, with a subtle smile.'The time is not always ripe,' said Mr.Let us not conceal it from ourselves that,
since his first visit to Coningsby, we have neither of us really been in
the same position which we then occupied, or believed we should occupy.My Lord, though you would scarcely believe it, has a weakness for this
boy; and though I by my marriage, and you by your zealous ability,
have apparently secured a permanent hold upon his habits, I have never
doubted that when the crisis comes we shall find that the golden fruit
is plucked by one who has not watched the garden.There is
no reason why we two should clash together: we can both of us find what
we want, and more securely if we work in company.''I trust my devotion to you has never been doubted, dear madam.'Rid
me of this Coningsby, and I will secure you all that you want.'It shall be done,' said Rigby; 'it must be done.If once the notion
gets wind that one of the Castle family may perchance stand for
Darlford, all the present combinations will be disorganised.'So I hear for certain,' said Lucretia.'Be sure there is no time to
lose.What does he want with you to-day?''I know not: there are so many things.''To be sure; and yet I cannot doubt he will speak of this quarrel.Whatever his mood, the subject may be
introduced.If good, you will guide him more easily; if dark, the love
for the Hellingsley girl, the fact of the brother being in his castle,
drinking his wine, riding his horses, ordering about his servants; you
will omit no details: a Millbank quite at home at Coningsby will lash
him to madness!Go,
go, or he may hear that you have arrived.I shall be at home all the
morning.It will be but gallant that you should pay me a little visit
when you have transacted your business._Au revoir!_'

Lady Monmouth took up again her French novel; but her eyes soon glanced
over the page, unattached by its contents.Her own existence was too
interesting to find any excitement in fiction.It was nearly three years
since her marriage; that great step which she ever had a conviction was
to lead to results still greater.Of late she had often been filled with
a presentiment that they were near at hand; never more so than on
this day.Irresistible was the current of associations that led her to
meditate on freedom, wealth, power; on a career which should at the same
time dazzle the imagination and gratify her heart.Notwithstanding the
gossip of Paris, founded on no authentic knowledge of her husband's
character or information, based on the haphazard observations of the
floating multitude, Lucretia herself had no reason to fear that her
influence over Lord Monmouth, if exerted, was materially diminished.But
satisfied that he had formed no other tie, with her ever the test of
her position, she had not thought it expedient, and certainly would have
found it irksome, to maintain that influence by any ostentatious means.She knew that Lord Monmouth was capricious, easily wearied, soon palled;
and that on men who have no affections, affection has no hold.Their
passions or their fancies, on the contrary, as it seemed to her, are
rather stimulated by neglect or indifference, provided that they are not
systematic; and the circumstance of a wife being admired by one who is
not her husband sometimes wonderfully revives the passion or renovates
the respect of him who should be devoted to her.The health of Lord Monmouth was the subject which never was long absent
from the vigilance or meditation of Lucretia.She was well assured that
his life was no longer secure.She knew that after their marriage he had
made a will, which secured to her a large portion of his great wealth in
case of their having no issue, and after the accident at Paris all
hope in that respect was over.Recently the extreme anxiety which Lord
Monmouth had evinced about terminating the abeyance of the barony to
which his first wife was a co-heiress in favour of his grandson, had
alarmed Lucretia.To establish in the land another branch of the house
of Coningsby was evidently the last excitement of Lord Monmouth, and
perhaps a permanent one.If the idea were once accepted, notwithstanding
the limit to its endowment which Lord Monmouth might at the first start
contemplate, Lucretia had sufficiently studied his temperament to be
convinced that all his energies and all his resources would ultimately
be devoted to its practical fulfilment.Her original prejudice against
Coningsby and jealousy of his influence had therefore of late been
considerably aggravated; and the intelligence that for the first time
there was a misunderstanding between Coningsby and her husband filled
her with excitement and hope.She knew her Lord well enough to feel
assured that the cause for displeasure in the present instance could not
be a light one; she resolved instantly to labour that it should not
be transient; and it so happened that she had applied for aid in this
endeavour to the very individual in whose power it rested to accomplish
all her desire, while in doing so he felt at the same time he was
defending his own position and advancing his own interests.Lady Monmouth was now waiting with some excitement the return of Mr.His interview with his patron was of unusual length.An hour, and
more than an hour, had elapsed.Lady Monmouth again threw aside the book
which more than once she had discarded.She paced the room, restless
rather than disquieted.She had complete confidence in Rigby's ability
for the occasion; and with her knowledge of Lord Monmouth's character,
she could not contemplate the possibility of failure, if the
circumstances were adroitly introduced to his consideration.Still time
stole on: the harassing and exhausting process of suspense was acting
on her nervous system.She began to think that Rigby had not found
the occasion favourable for the catastrophe; that Lord Monmouth, from
apprehension of disturbing Rigby and entailing explanations on himself,
had avoided the necessary communication; that her skilful combination
for the moment had missed.Two hours had now elapsed, and Lucretia, in a
state of considerable irritation, was about to inquire whether Mr.Rigby
were with his Lordship when the door of her boudoir opened, and that
gentleman appeared.'Now sit down and
tell me what has passed.'Lady Monmouth pointed to the seat which Flora had occupied.'I thank your Ladyship,' said Mr.Rigby, with a somewhat grave and yet
perplexed expression of countenance, and seating himself at some little
distance from his companion, 'but I am very well here.'Instead of responding to the invitation of Lady
Monmouth to communicate with his usual readiness and volubility, Mr.Rigby was silent, and, if it were possible to use such an expression
with regard to such a gentleman, apparently embarrassed.'Well,' said Lady Monmouth, 'does he know about the Millbanks?''His Lordship was greatly shocked,' replied Mr.Rigby, with a pious
expression of features.As his Lordship
very justly observed, "It is impossible to say what is going on under my
own roof, or to what I can trust."''But he made an exception in your favour, I dare say, my dear Mr.'Lord Monmouth was pleased to say that I possessed his entire
confidence,' said Mr.Rigby, 'and that he looked to me in his
difficulties.''The steps which his Lordship is about to take with reference to the
establishment generally,' said Mr.Rigby, 'will allow the connection
that at present subsists between that gentleman and his noble relative,
now that Lord Monmouth's eyes are open to his real character, to
terminate naturally, without the necessity of any formal explanation.''But what do you mean by the steps he is going to take in his
establishment generally?''Lord Monmouth thinks he requires change of scene.'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, with
great impatience.'I hope he is not going again to that dreadful castle in Lancashire.''Lord Monmouth was thinking that, as you were tired of Paris, you might
find some of the German Baths agreeable.''Why, there is nothing that Lord Monmouth dislikes so much as a German
bathing-place!''Then how capricious in him wanting to go to them?''He does not want to go to them!'said Lady Monmouth, in a lower voice, and
looking him full in the face with a glance seldom bestowed.There was a churlish and unusual look about Rigby.It was as if
malignant, and yet at the same time a little frightened, he had screwed
himself into doggedness.He suggests that if your Ladyship were
to pass the summer at Kissengen, for example, and a paragraph in the
_Morning Post_ were to announce that his Lordship was about to join you
there, all awkwardness would be removed; and no one could for a moment
take the liberty of supposing, even if his Lordship did not ultimately
reach you, that anything like a separation had occurred.''I would never have consented to
interfere in the affair, but to secure that most desirable point.''I will see Lord Monmouth at once,' said Lucretia, rising, her natural
pallor aggravated into a ghoul-like tint.'His Lordship has gone out,' said Mr.'Our conversation, sir, then finishes; I wait his return.''His Lordship will never return to Monmouth House again.'And
he really thinks that I am to be crushed by such an instrument as this!He may leave Monmouth House, but I shall not.'Still anxious to secure an amicable separation,' said Mr.Rigby, 'your
Ladyship must allow me to place the circumstances of the case fairly
before your excellent judgment.Lord Monmouth has decided upon a course:
you know as well as I that he never swerves from his resolutions.He has
left peremptory instructions, and he will listen to no appeal.He has
empowered me to represent to your Ladyship that he wishes in every way
to consider your convenience.He suggests that everything, in short,
should be arranged as if his Lordship were himself unhappily no more;
that your Ladyship should at once enter into your jointure, which
shall be made payable quarterly to your order, provided you can find
it convenient to live upon the Continent,' added Mr.Rigby, with some
hesitation.'Why, then, we will leave your Ladyship to the assertion of your
rights.''I beg your Ladyship's pardon.I speak as the friend of the family, the
trustee of your marriage settlement, well known also as Lord Monmouth's
executor,' said Mr.Rigby, his countenance gradually regaining its
usual callous confidence, and some degree of self-complacency, as he
remembered the good things which he enumerated.'I have decided,' said Lady Monmouth.Your
master has mistaken my character and his own position.He shall rue the
day that he assailed me.''I should be sorry if there were any violence,' said Mr.Rigby,
'especially as everything is left to my management and control.An
office, indeed, which I only accepted for your mutual advantage.I think, upon reflection, I might put before your Ladyship some
considerations which might induce you, on the whole, to be of opinion
that it will be better for us to draw together in this business, as we
have hitherto, indeed, throughout an acquaintance now of some years.'Rigby was assuming all his usual tone of brazen familiarity.'Your self-confidence exceeds even Lord Monmouth's estimate of it,' said
Lucretia.'Now, now, you are unkind.I am
interfering in this business for your sake.It would have fallen to another, who would have fulfilled
it without any delicacy and consideration for your feelings.View my
interposition in that light, my dear Lady Monmouth, and circumstances
will assume altogether a new colour.''I beg that you will quit the house, sir.''I would with pleasure, to oblige you, were
it in my power; but Lord Monmouth has particularly desired that I should
take up my residence here permanently.For your Ladyship's sake, I wish
everything to be accomplished with tranquillity, and, if possible,
friendliness and good feeling.You can have even a week for the
preparations for your departure, if necessary.Any carriages, too, that you desire; your jewels, at least all
those that are not at the bankers'.The arrangement about your jointure,
your letters of credit, even your passport, I will attend to myself;
only too happy if, by this painful interference, I have in any way
contributed to soften the annoyance which, at the first blush, you may
naturally experience, but which, like everything else, take my word,
will wear off.''I shall send for Lord Eskdale,' said Lady Monmouth.Rigby, 'that Lord Eskdale will give you the
same advice as myself, if he only reads your Ladyship's letters,' he
added slowly, 'to Prince Trautsmansdorff.''Pardon me,' said Rigby, putting his hand in his pocket, as if to guard
some treasure, 'I have no wish to revive painful associations; but I
have them, and I must act upon them, if you persist in treating me as
a foe, who am in reality your best friend; which indeed I ought to be,
having the honour of acting as trustee under your marriage settlement,
and having known you so many years.''Leave me for the present alone,' said Lady Monmouth.'Send me my
servant, if I have one.I shall not remain here the week which you
mention, but quit at once this house, which I wish I had never entered.Rigby, you are now lord of Monmouth House, and yet I cannot
help feeling you too will be discharged before he dies.'Rigby made Lady Monmouth a bow such as became the master of the
house, and then withdrew.A paragraph in the _Morning Post_, a few days after his interview with
his grandfather, announcing that Lord and Lady Monmouth had quitted town
for the baths of Kissengen, startled Coningsby, who called the same day
at Monmouth House in consequence.There he learnt more authentic details
of their unexpected movements.It appeared that Lady Monmouth had
certainly departed; and the porter, with a rather sceptical visage,
informed Coningsby that Lord Monmouth was to follow; but when, he could
not tell.At present his Lordship was at Brighton, and in a few days was
about to take possession of a villa at Richmond, which had for some time
been fitting up for him under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, who, as
Coningsby also learnt, now permanently resided at Monmouth House.All
this intelligence made Coningsby ponder.He was sufficiently acquainted
with the parties concerned to feel assured that he had not learnt the
whole truth.What had really taken place, and what was the real cause of
the occurrences, were equally mystical to him: all he was convinced of
was, that some great domestic revolution had been suddenly effected.Coningsby entertained for his grandfather a sincere affection.With the
exception of their last unfortunate interview, he had experienced from
Lord Monmouth nothing but kindness both in phrase and deed.There was
also something in Lord Monmouth, when he pleased it, rather fascinating
to young men; and as Coningsby had never occasioned him any feelings but
pleasurable ones, he was always disposed to make himself delightful to
his grandson.The experience of a consummate man of the world, advanced
in life, detailed without rigidity to youth, with frankness and
facility, is bewitching.Lord Monmouth was never garrulous: he was
always pithy, and could be picturesque.He revealed a character in a
sentence, and detected the ruling passion with the hand of a master.Besides, he had seen everybody and had done everything; and though, on
the whole, too indolent for conversation, and loving to be talked to,
these were circumstances which made his too rare communications the more
precious.With these feelings, Coningsby resolved, the moment that he learned that
his grandfather was established at Richmond, to pay him a visit.He
was informed that Lord Monmouth was at home, and he was shown into a
drawing-room, where he found two French ladies in their bonnets, whom he
soon discovered to be actresses.They also had come down to pay a visit
to his grandfather, and were by no means displeased to pass the interval
that must elapse before they had that pleasure in chatting with his
grandson.Coningsby found them extremely amusing; with the finest
spirits in the world, imperturbable good temper, and an unconscious
practical philosophy that defied the devil Care and all his works.And
well it was that he found such agreeable companions, for time flowed on,
and no summons arrived to call him to his grandfather's presence, and
no herald to announce his grandfather's advent.The ladies and Coningsby
had exhausted badinage; they had examined and criticised all the
furniture, had rifled the vases of their prettiest flowers; and
Clotilde, who had already sung several times, was proposing a duet to
Ermengarde, when a servant entered, and told the ladies that a carriage
was in attendance to give them an airing, and after that Lord Monmouth
hoped they would return and dine with him; then turning to Coningsby, he
informed him, with his lord's compliments, that Lord Monmouth was sorry
he was too much engaged to see him.Nothing was to be done but to put a tolerably good face upon it.'Embrace Lord Monmouth for me,' said Coningsby to his fair friends, 'and
tell him I think it very unkind that he did not ask me to dinner with
you.'Coningsby said this with a gay air, but really with a depressed spirit.He felt convinced that his grandfather was deeply displeased with him;
and as he rode away from the villa, he could not resist the strong
impression that he was destined never to re-enter it.It so happened that the idle message which Coningsby had left
for his grandfather, and which he never seriously supposed for a moment
that his late companions would have given their host, operated entirely
in his favour.Whatever were the feelings with respect to Coningsby at
the bottom of Lord Monmouth's heart, he was actuated in his refusal to
see him not more from displeasure than from an anticipatory horror of
something like a scene.Even a surrender from Coningsby without terms,
and an offer to declare himself a candidate for Darlford, or to do
anything else that his grandfather wished, would have been disagreeable
to Lord Monmouth in his present mood.As in politics a revolution is
often followed by a season of torpor, so in the case of Lord Monmouth
the separation from his wife, which had for a long period occupied his
meditation, was succeeded by a vein of mental dissipation.He did not
wish to be reminded by anything or any person that he had still in
some degree the misfortune of being a responsible member of society.He wanted to be surrounded by individuals who were above or below the
conventional interests of what is called 'the World.'He wanted to hear
nothing of those painful and embarrassing influences which from our
contracted experience and want of enlightenment we magnify into such
undue importance.For this purpose he wished to have about him persons
whose knowledge of the cares of life concerned only the means of
existence, and whose sense of its objects referred only to the sources
of enjoyment; persons who had not been educated in the idolatry of
Respectability; that is to say, of realising such an amount of what is
termed character by a hypocritical deference to the prejudices of the
community as may enable them, at suitable times, and under convenient
circumstances and disguises, to plunder the public.With these feelings, Lord Monmouth recoiled at this moment from
grandsons and relations and ties of all kinds.He did not wish to be
reminded of his identity, but to swim unmolested and undisturbed in
his Epicurean dream.When, therefore, his fair visitors; Clotilde, who
opened her mouth only to breathe roses and diamonds, and Ermengarde, who
was so good-natured that she sacrificed even her lovers to her friends;
saw him merely to exclaim at the same moment, and with the same voices
of thrilling joyousness,--

'Why did not you ask him to dinner?'And then, without waiting for his reply, entered with that rapidity of
elocution which Frenchwomen can alone command into the catalogue of his
charms and accomplishments, Lord Monmouth began to regret that he really
had not seen Coningsby, who, it appeared, might have greatly contributed
to the pleasure of the day.The message, which was duly given,
however, settled the business.Lord Monmouth felt that any chance of
explanations, or even allusions to the past, was out of the question;
and to defend himself from the accusations of his animated guests, he
said,

'Well, he shall come to dine with you next time.'There is no end to the influence of woman on our life.It is at the
bottom of everything that happens to us.And so it was, that, in spite
of all the combinations of Lucretia and Mr.Rigby, and the mortification
and resentment of Lord Monmouth, the favourable impression he casually
made on a couple of French actresses occasioned Coningsby, before a
month had elapsed since his memorable interview at Monmouth House, to
receive an invitation again to dine with his grandfather.Clotilde and Ermengarde had wits as sparkling
as their eyes.There was a manager of the Opera, a great friend of
Villebecque, and his wife, a splendid lady, who had been a prima donna
of celebrity, and still had a commanding voice for a chamber; a Carlist
nobleman who lived upon his traditions, and who, though without a sou,
could tell of a festival given by his family, before the revolution,
which had cost a million of francs; and a Neapolitan physician, in whom
Lord Monmouth had great confidence, and who himself believed in the
elixir vitae, made up the party, with Lucian Gay, Coningsby, and Mr.Our hero remarked that Villebecque on this occasion sat at the
bottom of the table, but Flora did not appear.In the meantime, the month which brought about this satisfactory and
at one time unexpected result was fruitful also in other circumstances
still more interesting.Coningsby and Edith met frequently, if to
breathe the same atmosphere in the same crowded saloons can be described
as meeting; ever watching each other's movements, and yet studious never
to encounter each other's glance.The charms of Miss Millbank had
become an universal topic, they were celebrated in ball-rooms, they were
discussed at clubs: Edith was the beauty of the season.All admired her,
many sighed even to express their admiration; but the devotion of Lord
Beaumanoir, who always hovered about her, deterred them from a rivalry
which might have made the boldest despair.As for Coningsby, he passed
his life principally with the various members of the Sydney family, and
was almost daily riding with Lady Everingham and her sister, generally
accompanied by Lord Henry and his friend Eustace Lyle, between whom,
indeed, and Coningsby there were relations of intimacy scarcely less
inseparable.Coningsby had spoken to Lady Everingham of the rumoured
marriage of her elder brother, and found, although the family had not
yet been formally apprised of it, she entertained little doubt of
its ultimate occurrence.She admired Miss Millbank, with whom her
acquaintance continued slight; and she wished, of course, that her
brother should marry and be happy.'But Percy is often in love,' she
would add, 'and never likes us to be very intimate with his inamoratas.He thinks it destroys the romance; and that domestic familiarity may
compromise his heroic character.However,' she added, 'I really believe
that will be a match.'On the whole, though he bore a serene aspect to the world, Coningsby
passed this month in a state of restless misery.His soul was brooding
on one subject, and he had no confidant: he could not resist the spell
that impelled him to the society where Edith might at least be seen, and
the circle in which he lived was one in which her name was frequently
mentioned.Alone, in his solitary rooms in the Albany, he felt all his
desolation; and often a few minutes before he figured in the world,
apparently followed and courted by all, he had been plunged in the
darkest fits of irremediable wretchedness.He had, of course, frequently met Lady Wallinger, but their salutations,
though never omitted, and on each side cordial, were brief.There seemed
to be a tacit understanding between them not to refer to a subject
fruitful in painful reminiscences.In the fulfilment of a project originally formed
in the playing-fields of Eton, often recurred to at Cambridge, and
cherished with the fondness with which men cling to a scheme of early
youth, Coningsby, Henry Sydney, Vere, and Buckhurst had engaged some
moors together this year; and in a few days they were about to quit town
for Scotland.They had pressed Eustace Lyle to accompany them, but he,
who in general seemed to have no pleasure greater than their society,
had surprised them by declining their invitation, with some vague
mention that he rather thought he should go abroad.It was the last day of July, and all the world were at a breakfast
given, at a fanciful cottage situate in beautiful gardens on the banks
of the Thames, by Lady Everingham.The weather was as bright as the
romances of Boccaccio; there were pyramids of strawberries, in bowls
colossal enough to hold orange-trees; and the choicest band filled the
air with enchanting strains, while a brilliant multitude sauntered on
turf like velvet, or roamed in desultory existence amid the quivering
shades of winding walks.'My fete was prophetic,' said Lady Everingham, when she saw Coningsby.'I am glad it is connected with an incident.Tell me what we are to
celebrate.''Then I, too, will prophesy, and name the hero of the romance, Eustace
Lyle.''You have been more prescient than I,' said Lady Everingham, 'perhaps
because I was thinking too much of some one else.''It seems to me an union which all must acknowledge perfect.I have had my suspicions a long time; and when
Eustace refused to go to the moors with us, though I said nothing, I was
convinced.''At any rate,' said Lady Everingham, sighing, with a rather smiling
face, 'we are kinsfolk, Mr.Coningsby; though I would gladly have wished
to have been more.'Happiness,' he
added, in a mournful tone, 'I fear can never be mine.''tis a tale too strange and sorrowful for a day when, like Seged,
we must all determine to be happy.''Here comes a group that will make you gay,' said Coningsby as he
moved on.Edith and the Wallingers, accompanied by Lord Beaumanoir, Mr.Melton, and Sir Charles Buckhurst, formed the party.They seemed profuse
in their congratulations to Lady Everingham, having already learnt the
intelligence from her brother.Coningsby stopped to speak to Lady St.Julians, who had still a daughter
to marry.Both Augustina, who was at Coningsby Castle, and Clara
Isabella, who ought to have been there, had each secured the right man.But Adelaide Victoria had now appeared, and Lady St.Julians had a great
regard for the favourite grandson of Lord Monmouth, and also for the
influential friend of Lord Vere and Sir Charles Buckhurst.In case
Coningsby did not determine to become her son-in-law himself, he might
counsel either of his friends to a judicious decision on an inevitable
act.Ormsby, who seemed
occupied with some delicacies.no, no, no; those days are passed.I think there is a little
easterly wind with all this fine appearance.''I am for in-door nature myself,' said Lord Eskdale.'Do you know, I do
not half like the way Monmouth is going on?He never gets out of that
villa of his.'I had a letter from her to-day: she writes in good spirits.I am sorry
it broke up, and yet I never thought it would last so long.''I gave them two years,' said Mr.'Lord Monmouth lived with his
first wife two years.And afterwards with the Mirandola at Milan, at
least nearly two years; it was a year and ten months.I must know,
for he called me in to settle affairs.I took the lady to the baths at
Lucca, on the pretence that Monmouth would meet us there.I remember I wanted
to bet Cassilis, at White's, on it when he married; but I thought, being
his intimate friend; the oldest friend he has, indeed, and one of his
trustees; it was perhaps as well not to do it.''You should have made the bet with himself,' said Lord Eskdale, 'and
then there never would have been a separation.''Hah, hah, hah!About an hour after this, Coningsby, who had just quitted the Duchess,
met, on a terrace by the river, Lady Wallinger, walking with Mrs.Guy
Flouncey and a Russian Prince, whom that lady was enchanting.Coningsby
was about to pass with some slight courtesy, but Lady Wallinger stopped
and would speak to him, on slight subjects, the weather and the fete,
but yet adroitly enough managed to make him turn and join her.Guy Flouncey walked on a little before with her Russian admirer.Lady
Wallinger followed with Coningsby.'The match that has been proclaimed to-day has greatly surprised me,'
said Lady Wallinger.said Coningsby: 'I confess I was long prepared for it.And it
seems to me the most natural alliance conceivable, and one that every
one must approve.''Lady Everingham seems much surprised at it.'Lady Everingham is a brilliant personage, and cannot deign to
observe obvious circumstances.'Coningsby, that I always thought you were engaged to
Lady Theresa?''Indeed, we were informed more than a month ago that you were positively
going to be married to her.''I am not one of those who can shift their affections with such
rapidity, Lady Wallinger.''You remember our meeting you on the
stairs at ---- House, Mr.'Edith had just been informed that you were going to be married to Lady
Theresa.''Not surely by him to whom she is herself going to be married?''I am not aware that she is going to be married to any one.Lord
Beaumanoir admires her, has always admired her.But Edith has given
him no encouragement, at least gave him no encouragement as long as she
believed; but why dwell on such an unhappy subject, Mr.I
am to blame; I have been to blame perhaps before, but indeed I think it
cruel, very cruel, that Edith and you are kept asunder.''You have always been my best, my dearest friend, and are the most
amiable and admirable of women.But tell me, is it indeed true that
Edith is not going to be married?'Guy Flouncey turned round, and assuring Lady
Wallinger that the Prince and herself had agreed to refer some point
to her about the most transcendental ethics of flirtation, this deeply
interesting conversation was arrested, and Lady Wallinger, with
becoming suavity, was obliged to listen to the lady's lively appeal of
exaggerated nonsense and the Prince's affected protests, while Coningsby
walked by her side, pale and agitated, and then offered his arm to Lady
Wallinger, which she accepted with an affectionate pressure.At the end
of the terrace they met some other guests, and soon were immersed in the
multitude that thronged the lawn.'There is Sir Joseph,' said Lady Wallinger, and Coningsby looked up,
and saw Edith on his arm.Lord
Beaumanoir was there, but he seemed to shrink into nothing to-day before
Buckhurst, who was captivated for the moment by Edith, and hearing
that no knight was resolute enough to try a fall with the Marquess, was
impelled by his talent for action to enter the lists.He had talked down
everybody, unhorsed every cavalier.Nobody had a chance against him:
he answered all your questions before you asked them; contradicted
everybody with the intrepidity of a Rigby; annihilated your anecdotes by
historiettes infinitely more piquant; and if anybody chanced to make a
joke which he could not excel, declared immediately that it was a Joe
Miller.He was absurd, extravagant, grotesque, noisy; but he was young,
rattling, and interesting, from his health and spirits.Edith was
extremely amused by him, and was encouraging by her smile his spiritual
excesses, when they all suddenly met Lady Wallinger and Coningsby.The eyes of Edith and Coningsby met for the first time since they so
cruelly encountered on the staircase of ---- House.A deep, quick blush
suffused her face, her eyes gleamed with a sudden coruscation; suddenly
and quickly she put forth her hand.he presses once more that hand which permanently to retain is the
passion of his life, yet which may never be his!It seemed that for the
ravishing delight of that moment he could have borne with cheerfulness
all the dark and harrowing misery of the year that had passed away since
he embraced her in the woods of Hellingsley, and pledged his faith by
the waters of the rushing Darl.He seized the occasion which offered itself, a moment to walk by her
side, and to snatch some brief instants of unreserved communion.'And now we are to each other as before?''And will be, come what come may.'CHAPTER I.


It was merry Christmas at St.There was a yule log blazing
on every hearth in that wide domain, from the hall of the squire to the
peasant's roof.The Buttery Hatch was open for the whole week from noon
to sunset; all comers might take their fill, and each carry away as much
bold beef, white bread, and jolly ale as a strong man could bear in
a basket with one hand.For every woman a red cloak, and a coat of
broadcloth for every man.All day long, carts laden with fuel and warm
raiment were traversing the various districts, distributing comfort and
dispensing cheer.For a Christian gentleman of high degree was Eustace
Lyle.Within his hall, too, he holds his revel, and his beauteous bride
welcomes their guests, from her noble parents to the faithful tenants of
the house.All classes are mingled in the joyous equality that becomes
the season, at once sacred and merry.There are carols for the eventful
eve, and mummers for the festive day.The Duke and Duchess, and every member of the family, had consented this
year to keep their Christmas with the newly-married couple.Coningsby,
too, was there, and all his friends.The party was numerous, gay,
hearty, and happy; for they were all united by sympathy.They were planning that Henry Sydney should be appointed Lord of
Misrule, or ordained Abbot of Unreason at the least, so successful had
been his revival of the Mummers, the Hobby-horse not forgotten.Their host had entrusted to Lord Henry the restoration of many old
observances; and the joyous feeling which this celebration of Christmas
had diffused throughout an extensive district was a fresh argument in
favour of Lord Henry's principle, that a mere mechanical mitigation of
the material necessities of the humbler classes, a mitigation which must
inevitably be limited, can never alone avail sufficiently to ameliorate
their condition; that their condition is not merely 'a knife and fork
question,' to use the coarse and shallow phrase of the Utilitarian
school; that a simple satisfaction of the grosser necessities of our
nature will not make a happy people; that you must cultivate the heart
as well as seek to content the belly; and that the surest means to
elevate the character of the people is to appeal to their affections.There is nothing more interesting than to trace predisposition.An
indefinite, yet strong sympathy with the peasantry of the realm had been
one of the characteristic sensibilities of Lord Henry at Eton.Yet a
schoolboy, he had busied himself with their pastimes and the details of
their cottage economy.As he advanced in life the horizon of his views
expanded with his intelligence and his experience; and the son of one of
the noblest of our houses, to whom the delights of life are offered with
fatal facility, on the very threshold of his career he devoted his
time and thought, labour and life, to one vast and noble purpose, the
elevation of the condition of the great body of the people.'I vote for Buckhurst being Lord of Misrule,' said Lord Henry: 'I will
be content with being his gentleman usher.''It shall be put to the vote,' said Lord Vere.'No one has a chance against Buckhurst,' said Coningsby.'Now, Sir Charles,' said Lady Everingham, 'your absolute sway is about
to commence.'The first thing must be my formal installation,' said Buckhurst.'I
vote the Boar's head be carried in procession thrice round the hall, and
Beau shall be the champion to challenge all who may question my right.Duke, you shall be my chief butler, the Duchess my herb-woman.She is to
walk before me, and scatter rosemary.Coningsby shall carry the Boar's
head; Lady Theresa and Lady Everingham shall sing the canticle; Lord
Everingham shall be marshal of the lists, and put all in the stocks who
are found sober and decorous; Lyle shall be the palmer from the Holy
Land, and Vere shall ride the Hobby-horse.Some must carry cups of
Hippocras, some lighted tapers; all must join in chorus.'He ceased his instructions, and all hurried away to carry them into
effect.Some hastily arrayed themselves in fanciful dresses, the ladies
in robes of white, with garlands of flowers; some drew pieces of armour
from the wall, and decked themselves with helm and hauberk; others waved
ancient banners.They brought in the Boar's head on a large silver dish,
and Coningsby raised it aloft.They formed into procession, the Duchess
distributing rosemary; Buckhurst swaggering with all the majesty of
Tamerlane, his mock court irresistibly humorous with their servility;
and the sweet voice of Lady Everingham chanting the first verse of the
canticle, followed in the second by the rich tones of Lady Theresa:

  I.
        Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade in hande bring I,
  With garlandes gay and rosemary:
  I pray you all singe merrily,
        Qui estis in convivio.Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade I understande
  Is the chief servyce in this lande
  Loke whereever it be fande,
        Servite cum cantico.Then they stopped; and the Lord
of Misrule ascended his throne, and his courtiers formed round him
in circle.Behind him they held the ancient banners and waved their
glittering arms, and placed on a lofty and illuminated pedestal the
Boar's head covered with garlands.It was a good picture, and the Lord
of Misrule sustained his part with untiring energy.He was addressing
his court in a pompous rhapsody of merry nonsense, when a servant
approached Coningsby, and told him that he was wanted without.A despatch had arrived for him from
London.Without any prescience of its purpose, he nevertheless broke
the seal with a trembling hand.His presence was immediately desired in
town: Lord Monmouth was dead.This was a crisis in the life of Coningsby; yet, like many critical
epochs, the person most interested in it was not sufficiently aware
of its character.The first feeling which he experienced at the
intelligence was sincere affliction.He was fond of his grandfather; had
received great kindness from him, and at a period of life when it was
most welcome.The neglect and hardships of his early years, instead of
leaving a prejudice against one who, by some, might be esteemed their
author, had by their contrast only rendered Coningsby more keenly
sensible of the solicitude and enjoyment which had been lavished on his
happy youth.The next impression on his mind was undoubtedly a natural and reasonable
speculation on the effect of this bereavement on his fortunes.Lord
Monmouth had more than once assured Coningsby that he had provided for
him as became a near relative to whom he was attached, and in a manner
which ought to satisfy the wants and wishes of an English gentleman.The
allowance which Lord Monmouth had made him, as considerable as usually
accorded to the eldest sons of wealthy peers, might justify him in
estimating his future patrimony as extremely ample.He was aware,
indeed, that at a subsequent period his grandfather had projected for
him fortunes of a still more elevated character.He looked to Coningsby
as the future representative of an ancient barony, and had been
purchasing territory with the view of supporting the title.But
Coningsby did not by any means firmly reckon on these views being
realised.He had a suspicion that in thwarting the wishes of his
grandfather in not becoming a candidate for Darlford, he had at the
moment arrested arrangements which, from the tone of Lord Monmouth's
communication, he believed were then in progress for that purpose;
and he thought it improbable, with his knowledge of his grandfather's
habits, that Lord Monmouth had found either time or inclination to
resume before his decease the completion of these plans.Indeed there
was a period when, in adopting the course which he pursued with respect
to Darlford, Coningsby was well aware that he perilled more than the
large fortune which was to accompany the barony.Had not a separation
between Lord Monmouth and his wife taken place simultaneously with
Coningsby's difference with his grandfather, he was conscious that the
consequences might have been even altogether fatal to his prospects; but
the absence of her evil influence at such a conjuncture, its permanent
removal, indeed, from the scene, coupled with his fortunate though not
formal reconciliation with Lord Monmouth, had long ago banished from his
memory all those apprehensions to which he had felt it impossible at the
time to shut his eyes.Before he left town for Scotland he had made a
farewell visit to his grandfather, who, though not as cordial as in
old days, had been gracious; and Coningsby, during his excursion to the
moors, and his various visits to the country, had continued at intervals
to write to his grandfather, as had been for some years his custom.On
the whole, with an indefinite feeling which, in spite of many a rational
effort, did nevertheless haunt his mind, that this great and sudden
event might exercise a vast and beneficial influence on his worldly
position, Coningsby could not but feel some consolation in the
affliction which he sincerely experienced, in the hope that he might at
all events now offer to Edith a home worthy of her charms, her virtues,
and her love.Although he had not seen her since their hurried yet sweet
reconciliation in the gardens of Lady Everingham, Coningsby was never
long without indirect intelligence of the incidents of her life; and the
correspondence between Lady Everingham and Henry Sydney, while they
were at the moors, had apprised him that Lord Beaumanoir's suit had
terminated unsuccessfully almost immediately after his brother had
quitted London.It was late in the evening when Coningsby arrived in town: he called at
once on Lord Eskdale, who was one of Lord Monmouth's executors; and he
persuaded Coningsby, whom he saw depressed, to dine with him alone.'You should not be seen at a club,' said the good-natured peer; 'and I
remember myself in old days what was the wealth of an Albanian larder.'Lord Eskdale, at dinner, talked frankly of the disposition of Lord
Monmouth's property.He spoke as a matter of course that Coningsby was
his grandfather's principal heir.'I don't know whether you will be happier with a large fortune?''It is a troublesome thing: nobody is satisfied with
what you do with it; very often not yourself.To maintain an equable
expenditure; not to spend too much on one thing, too little on another,
is an art.There must be a harmony, a keeping, in disbursement, which
very few men have.The thing to have is about ten
thousand a year, and the world to think you have only five.There is
some enjoyment then; one is let alone.But the instant you have a large
fortune, duties commence.And then impudent fellows borrow your money;
and if you ask them for it again, they go about town saying you are a
screw.'Lord Monmouth had died suddenly at his Richmond villa, which latterly
he never quitted, at a little supper, with no persons near him but those
who were amusing.He suddenly found he could not lift his glass to his
lips, and being extremely polite, waited a few minutes before he asked
Clotilde, who was singing a sparkling drinking-song, to do him that
service.When, in accordance with his request, she reached him, it was
too late.The ladies shrieked, being frightened: at first they were
in despair, but, after reflection, they evinced some intention of
plundering the house.Villebecque, who was absent at the moment, arrived
in time; and everybody became orderly and broken-hearted.The body had been removed to Monmouth House, where it had been embalmed
and laid in state.There was
nobody in town; some distinguished connections, however, came up from
the country, though it was a period inconvenient for such movements.After the funeral, the will was to be read in the principal saloon of
Monmouth House, one of those gorgeous apartments that had excited the
boyish wonder of Coningsby on his first visit to that paternal roof, and
now hung in black, adorned with the escutcheon of the deceased peer.The testamentary dispositions of the late lord were still unknown,
though the names of his executors had been announced by his family
solicitor, in whose custody the will and codicils had always remained.The executors under the will were Lord Eskdale, Mr.By a subsequent appointment Sidonia had been added.Coningsby, who had been chief mourner,
stood on the right hand of the solicitor, who sat at the end of a long
table, round which, in groups, were ranged all who had attended the
funeral, including several of the superior members of the household,
among them M. Villebecque.The solicitor rose and explained that though Lord Monmouth had been in
the habit of very frequently adding codicils to his will, the original
will, however changed or modified, had never been revoked; it was
therefore necessary to commence by reading that instrument.So saying,
he sat down, and breaking the seals of a large packet, he produced the
will of Philip Augustus, Marquess of Monmouth, which had been retained
in his custody since its execution.By this will, of the date of 1829, the sum of 10,000_l._ was left to
Coningsby, then unknown to his grandfather; the same sum to Mr.There was a great number of legacies, none of superior amount, most of
them of less: these were chiefly left to old male companions, and women
in various countries.There was an almost inconceivable number of small
annuities to faithful servants, decayed actors, and obscure foreigners.The residue of his personal estate was left to four gentlemen, three of
whom had quitted this world before the legator; the bequests, therefore,
had lapsed.The fourth residuary legatee, in whom, according to the
terms of the will, all would have consequently centred, was Mr.There followed several codicils which did not materially affect the
previous disposition; one of them leaving a legacy of 20,000_l._ to
the Princess Colonna; until they arrived at the latter part of the year
1832, when a codicil increased the 10,000_l._ left under the will to
Coningsby to 50,000_l._.After Coningsby's visit to the Castle in 1836 a very important change
occurred in the disposition of Lord Monmouth's estate.The legacy of
50,000_l._ in his favour was revoked, and the same sum left to the
Princess Lucretia.A similar amount was bequeathed to Mr.Rigby; and
Coningsby was left sole residuary legatee.An estate of about
nine thousand a year, which Lord Monmouth had himself purchased, and was
therefore in his own disposition, was left to Coningsby.Rigby was reduced to 20,000_l._, and the whole of his residue left
to his issue by Lady Monmouth.In case he died without issue, the estate
bequeathed to Coningsby to be taken into account, and the residue then
to be divided equally between Lady Monmouth and his grandson.It was
under this instrument that Sidonia had been appointed an executor and
to whom Lord Monmouth left, among others, the celebrated picture of
the Holy Family by Murillo, as his friend had often admired it.To Lord
Eskdale he left all his female miniatures, and to Mr.Ormsby his rare
and splendid collection of French novels, and all his wines, except his
Tokay, which he left, with his library, to Sir Robert Peel; though this
legacy was afterwards revoked, in consequence of Sir Robert's conduct
about the Irish corporations.The solicitor paused and begged permission to send for a glass of water.While this was arranging there was a murmur at the lower part of the
room, but little disposition to conversation among those in the vicinity
of the lawyer.Coningsby was silent, his brow a little knit.Rigby
was pale and restless, but said nothing.Ormsby took a pinch of
snuff, and offered his box to Lord Eskdale, who was next to him.They
exchanged glances, and made some observation about the weather.Sidonia
stood apart, with his arms folded.He had not, of course attended the
funeral, nor had he as yet exchanged any recognition with Coningsby.'Now, gentlemen,' said the solicitor, 'if you please, I will proceed.'They came to the year 1839, the year Coningsby was at Hellingsley.This
appeared to be a critical period in the fortunes of Lady Monmouth; while
Coningsby's reached to the culminating point.Rigby was reduced to
his original legacy under the will of 10,000_l._; a sum of equal amount
was bequeathed to Armand Villebecque, in acknowledgment of faithful
services; all the dispositions in favour of Lady Monmouth were revoked,
and she was limited to her moderate jointure of 3,000_l._ per annum,
under the marriage settlement; while everything, without reserve, was
left absolutely to Coningsby.A subsequent codicil determined that the 10,000_l._ left to Mr.Rigby
should be equally divided between him and Lucian Gay; but as some
compensation Lord Monmouth left to the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby
the bust of that gentleman, which he had himself presented to his
Lordship, and which, at his desire, had been placed in the vestibule
at Coningsby Castle, from the amiable motive that after Lord Monmouth's
decease Mr.Rigby might wish, perhaps, to present it to some other
friend.Ormsby took care not to catch the eye of Mr.As for Coningsby, he saw nobody.He maintained, during the extraordinary
situation in which he was placed, a firm demeanour; but serene and
regulated as he appeared to the spectators, his nerves were really
strung to a high pitch.It bore the date of June 1840, and was
made at Brighton, immediately after the separation with Lady Monmouth.It was the sight of this instrument that sustained Rigby at this great
emergency.He had a wild conviction that, after all, it must set all
right.He felt assured that, as Lady Monmouth had already been disposed
of, it must principally refer to the disinheritance of Coningsby,
secured by Rigby's well-timed and malignant misrepresentations of what
had occurred in Lancashire during the preceding summer.And then to whom
could Lord Monmouth leave his money?However he might cut and carve up
his fortunes, Rigby, and especially at a moment when he had so served
him, must come in for a considerable slice.All the dispositions in favour of'my
grandson Harry Coningsby' were revoked; and he inherited from his
grandfather only the interest of the sum of 10,000_l._ which had been
originally bequeathed to him in his orphan boyhood.The executors had
the power of investing the principal in any way they thought proper
for his advancement in life, provided always it was not placed in 'the
capital stock of any manufactory.'Coningsby turned pale; he lost his abstracted look; he caught the eye
of Rigby; he read the latent malice of that nevertheless anxious
countenance.What passed through the mind and being of Coningsby was
thought and sensation enough for a year; but it was as the flash that
reveals a whole country, yet ceases to be ere one can say it lightens.There was a revelation to him of an inward power that should baffle
these conventional calamities, a natural and sacred confidence in his
youth and health, and knowledge and convictions.Even the recollection
of Edith was not unaccompanied with some sustaining associations.At
least the mightiest foe to their union was departed.All this was the impression of an instant, simultaneous with the reading
of the words of form with which the last testamentary disposition of the
Marquess of Monmouth left the sum of 30,000_l._ to Armand Villebecque;
and all the rest, residue, and remainder of his unentailed property,
wheresoever and whatsoever it might be, amounting in value to nearly a
million sterling, was given, devised, and bequeathed to Flora, commonly
called Flora Villebecque, the step-child of the said Armand Villebecque,
'but who is my natural daughter by Marie Estelle Matteau, an actress at
the Theatre Francais in the years 1811-15, by the name of Stella.'said Coningsby, with a grave rather than agitated
countenance, to Sidonia, as his friend came up to greet him, without,
however, any expression of condolence.'This time next year you will not think so,' said Sidonia.'The principal annoyance of this sort of miscarriage,' said Sidonia,
'is the condolence of the gentle world.For the present we
will not speak of it.'So saying, Sidonia good-naturedly got Coningsby
out of the room.They walked together to Sidonia's house in Carlton Gardens, neither of
them making the slightest allusion to the catastrophe; Sidonia inquiring
where he had been, what he had been doing, since they last met, and
himself conversing in his usual vein, though with a little more feeling
in his manner than was his custom.When they had arrived there, Sidonia
ordered their dinner instantly, and during the interval between the
command and its appearance, he called Coningsby's attention to an old
German painting he had just received, its brilliant colouring and quaint
costumes.'Eat, and an appetite will come,' said Sidonia, when he observed
Coningsby somewhat reluctant.'Take some of that Chablis: it will put
you right; you will find it delicious.'In this way some twenty minutes passed; their meal was over, and they
were alone together.'I have been thinking all this time of your position,' said Sidonia.'A sorry one, I fear,' said Coningsby.'I really cannot see that,' said his friend.'You have experienced this
morning a disappointment, but not a calamity.If you had lost your eye
it would have been a calamity: no combination of circumstances could
have given you another.There are really no miseries except natural
miseries; conventional misfortunes are mere illusions.What seems
conventionally, in a limited view, a great misfortune, if subsequently
viewed in its results, is often the happiest incident in one's life.''I hope the day may come when I may feel this.''Now is the moment when philosophy is of use; that is to say, now is
the moment when you should clearly comprehend the circumstances which
surround you.You think, for
example, that you have just experienced a great calamity, because you
have lost the fortune on which you counted?''I ask you again, which would you have rather lost, your grandfather's
inheritance or your right leg?''Most certainly my inheritance,'

'Or your left arm?''Would you have received the inheritance on condition that your front
teeth should be knocked out?''Would you have given up a year of your life for that fortune trebled?''Even at twenty-three I would have refused the terms.''Come, come, Coningsby, the calamity cannot be very great.''Why, you have put it in an ingenious point of view; and yet it is
not so easy to convince a man, that he should be content who has lost
everything.''You have a great many things at this moment that you separately prefer
to the fortune that you have forfeited.How then can you be said to have
lost everything?''You have health, youth, good looks, great abilities, considerable
knowledge, a fine courage, a lofty spirit, and no contemptible
experience.With each of these qualities one might make a fortune; the
combination ought to command the highest.''You console me,' said Coningsby, with a faint blush and a fainter
smile.I think you are a most
fortunate young man; I should not have thought you more fortunate if
you had been your grandfather's heir; perhaps less so.But I wish you
to comprehend your position: if you understand it you will cease to
lament.''Bring your intelligence to bear on the right object.I make you no
offers of fortune, because I know you would not accept them, and indeed
I have no wish to see you a lounger in life.If you had inherited a
great patrimony, it is possible your natural character and previous
culture might have saved you from its paralysing influence; but it is a
question, even with you.Now you are free; that is to say, you are free,
if you are not in debt.A man who has not seen the world, whose fancy is
harassed with glittering images of pleasures he has never experienced,
cannot live on 300_l._ per annum; but you can.You have nothing to haunt
your thoughts, or disturb the abstraction of your studies.You have seen
the most beautiful women; you have banqueted in palaces; you know what
heroes, and wits, and statesmen are made of: and you can draw on
your memory instead of your imagination for all those dazzling and
interesting objects that make the inexperienced restless, and are the
cause of what are called scrapes.But you can do nothing if you be in
debt.Before, therefore, we proceed, I must beg you
to be frank on this head.If you have any absolute or contingent
incumbrances, tell me of them without reserve, and permit me to clear
them at once to any amount.You will sensibly oblige me in so doing:
because I am interested in watching your career, and if the racer start
with a clog my psychological observations will be imperfect.''You are, indeed, a friend; and had I debts I would ask you to pay
them.My grandfather was so lavish in his
allowance to me that I never got into difficulties.Besides, there
are horses and things without end which I must sell, and money at
Drummonds'.''That will produce your outfit, whatever the course you adopt.I
conceive there are two careers which deserve your consideration.In the
first place there is Diplomacy.If you decide upon that, I can assist
you.There exist between me and the Minister such relations that I can
at once secure you that first step which is so difficult to obtain.After that, much, if not all, depends on yourself.But I could advance
you, provided you were capable.You should, at least, not languish for
want of preferment.In an important post, I could throw in your way
advantages which would soon permit you to control cabinets.I doubt not your success, and for such a career,
speedy.Suppose
yourself in a dozen years a Plenipotentiary at a chief court, or at
a critical post, with a red ribbon and the Privy Council in immediate
perspective; and, after a lengthened career, a pension and a peerage.A Diplomatist is, after all,
a phantom.There is a want of nationality about his being.I always look
upon Diplomatists as the Hebrews of politics; without country, political
creeds, popular convictions, that strong reality of existence which
pervades the career of an eminent citizen in a free and great country.''You read my thoughts,' said Coningsby.'I should be sorry to sever
myself from England.''There remains then the other, the greater, the nobler career,' said
Sidonia, 'which in England may give you all, the Bar.I am absolutely
persuaded that with the requisite qualifications, and with perseverance,
success at the Bar is certain.It may be retarded or precipitated by
circumstances, but cannot be ultimately affected.You have a right to
count with your friends on no lack of opportunities when you are ripe
for them.You appear to me to have all the qualities necessary for the
Bar; and you may count on that perseverance which is indispensable, for
the reason I have before mentioned, because it will be sustained by your
experience.''I have resolved,' said Coningsby; 'I will try for the Great Seal.'Alone in his chambers, no longer under the sustaining influence of
Sidonia's converse and counsel, the shades of night descending
and bearing gloom to the gloomy, all the excitement of his spirit
evaporated, the heart of Coningsby sank.All now depended on himself,
and in that self he had no trust.And even success
could only be conducted to him by the course of many years.His career,
even if prosperous, was now to commence by the greatest sacrifice which
the heart of man could be called upon to sustain.Upon the stern altar
of his fortunes he must immolate his first and enduring love.Before,
he had a perilous position to offer Edith; now he had none.The future
might then have aided them; there was no combination which could improve
his present.Under any circumstances he must, after all his thoughts and
studies, commence a new novitiate, and before he could enter the arena
must pass years of silent and obscure preparation.He looked up, his eye caught that drawing of the towers of Hellingsley
which she had given him in the days of their happy hearts.That was all
that was to remain of their loves.He was to bear it to the future
scene of his labours, to remind him through revolving years of toil and
routine, that he too had had his romance, had roamed in fair gardens,
and whispered in willing ears the secrets of his passion.That drawing
was to become the altar-piece of his life.Coningsby passed an agitated night of broken sleep, waking often with a
consciousness of having experienced some great misfortune, yet with an
indefinite conception of its nature.It was a gloomy day, a raw north-easter blowing up the cloisters of
the Albany, in which the fog was lingering, the newspaper on his
breakfast-table, full of rumoured particulars of his grandfather's
will, which had of course been duly digested by all who knew him.To the bright, bracing morn of that merry
Christmas!That radiant and cheerful scene, and those gracious and
beaming personages, seemed another world and order of beings to the
one he now inhabited, and the people with whom he must now commune.It was the wild excitement of despair, the frenzied
hope that blends inevitably with absolute ruin, that could alone have
inspired such a hallucination!His
energies could rally no more.He gave orders that he was at home to no
one; and in his morning gown and slippers, with his feet resting on the
fireplace, the once high-souled and noble-hearted Coningsby delivered
himself up to despair.The day passed in a dark trance rather than a reverie.He was like a particle of chaos; at the best,
a glimmering entity of some shadowy Hades.Towards evening the wind
changed, the fog dispersed, there came a clear starry night, brisk and
bright.Coningsby roused himself, dressed, and wrapping his cloak around
him, sallied forth.Once more in the mighty streets, surrounded by
millions, his petty griefs and personal fortunes assumed their proper
position.Well had Sidonia taught him, view everything in its relation
to the rest.Here was the mightiest of
modern cities; the rival even of the most celebrated of the ancient.Whether he inherited or forfeited fortunes, what was it to the passing
throng?They would not share his splendour, or his luxury, or his
comfort.But a word from his lip, a thought from his brain, expressed
at the right time, at the right place, might turn their hearts, might
influence their passions, might change their opinions, might affect
their destiny.As civilisation
advances, the accidents of life become each day less important.The power of man, his greatness and his glory, depend on essential
qualities.Brains every day become more precious than blood.You must
give men new ideas, you must teach them new words, you must modify
their manners, you must change their laws, you must root out prejudices,
subvert convictions, if you wish to be great.Greatness no longer
depends on rentals, the world is too rich; nor on pedigrees, the world
is too knowing.'The greatness of this city destroys my misery,' said Coningsby, 'and my
genius shall conquer its greatness.'This conviction of power in the midst of despair was a revelation of
intrinsic strength.It is indeed the test of a creative spirit.From
that moment all petty fears for an ordinary future quitted him.He felt
that he must be prepared for great sacrifices, for infinite suffering;
that there must devolve on him a bitter inheritance of obscurity,
struggle, envy, and hatred, vulgar prejudice, base criticism, petty
hostilities, but the dawn would break, and the hour arrive, when the
welcome morning hymn of his success and his fame would sound and be
re-echoed.He returned to his rooms; calm, resolute.He slept the deep sleep of
a man void of anxiety, that has neither hope nor fear to haunt his
visions, but is prepared to rise on the morrow collected for the great
human struggle.Fresh, vigorous, not rash or precipitate, yet
determined to lose no time in idle meditation, Coningsby already
resolved at once to quit his present residence, was projecting a visit
to some legal quarter, where he intended in future to reside, when his
servant brought him a note.Coningsby, with
great earnestness, to do her the honour and the kindness of calling on
her at his earliest convenience, at the hotel in Brook Street where she
now resided.It was an interview which Coningsby would rather have avoided; yet it
seemed to him, after a moment's reflection, neither just, nor kind, nor
manly, to refuse her request.She was, after
all, his kin.Was it for a moment to be supposed that he was envious of
her lot?He replied, therefore, that in an hour he would wait upon her.In an hour, then, two individuals are to be brought together whose first
meeting was held under circumstances most strangely different.Then
Coningsby was the patron, a generous and spontaneous one, of a being
obscure, almost friendless, and sinking under bitter mortification.His favour could not be the less appreciated because he was the
chosen relative of a powerful noble.That noble was no more; his vast
inheritance had devolved on the disregarded, even despised actress,
whose suffering emotions Coningsby had then soothed, and whose fortune
had risen on the destruction of all his prospects, and the balk of all
his aspirations.Flora was alone when Coningsby was ushered into the room.The extreme
delicacy of her appearance was increased by her deep mourning; and
seated in a cushioned chair, from which she seemed to rise with an
effort, she certainly presented little of the character of a fortunate
and prosperous heiress.'You are very good to come to me,' she said, faintly smiling.Coningsby extended his hand to her affectionately, in which she placed
her own, looking down much embarrassed.'You have an agreeable situation here,' said Coningsby, trying to break
the first awkwardness of their meeting.'Yes; but I hope not to stop here long?''No; I hope never to leave England!'There was a slight pause; and then Flora sighed and said,

'I wish to speak to you on a subject that gives me pain; yet of which I
must speak.'I am sure,' said Coningsby, in a tone of great kindness, 'that you
could injure no one.''It was not mine by any right, legal or moral.There were others who
might have urged an equal claim to it; and there are many who will now
think that you might have preferred a superior one.''You had enemies; I was not one.They sought to benefit themselves by
injuring you.They have not benefited themselves; let them not say that
they have at least injured you.''We will not care what they say,' said Coningsby; 'I can sustain my
lot.'She sighed again with a downcast
glance.Then looking up embarrassed and blushing deeply, she added, 'I
wish to restore to you that fortune of which I have unconsciously and
unwillingly deprived you.''The fortune is yours, dear Flora, by every right,' said Coningsby,
much moved; 'and there is no one who wishes more fervently that it may
contribute to your happiness than I do.''It is killing me,' said Flora, mournfully; then speaking with unusual
animation, with a degree of excitement, she continued, 'I must tell what
I feel.I am happy in the inheritance, if you
generously receive it from me, because Providence has made me the means
of baffling your enemies.I never thought to be so happy as I shall be
if you will generously accept this fortune, always intended for you.I
have lived then for a purpose; I have not lived in vain; I have returned
to you some service, however humble, for all your goodness to me in my
unhappiness.''You are, as I have ever thought you, the kindest and most
tender-hearted of beings.But you misconceive our mutual positions,
my gentle Flora.The custom of the world does not permit such acts to
either of us as you contemplate.It is left you by
one on whose affections you had the highest claim.I will not say
that so large an inheritance does not bring with it an alarming
responsibility; but you are not unequal to it.You have a good heart; you have good sense; you have a
well-principled being.Your spirit will mount with your fortunes, and
blend with them.'I shall soon learn to find content, if not happiness, from other
sources,' said Coningsby; 'and mere riches, however vast, could at no
time have secured my felicity.''But they may secure that which brings felicity,' said Flora, speaking
in a choking voice, and not meeting the glance of Coningsby.'You had
some views in life which displeased him who has done all this; they may
be, they must be, affected by this fatal caprice.Speak to me, for I
cannot speak, dear Mr.Coningsby; do not let me believe that I, who
would sacrifice my life for your happiness, am the cause of such
calamities!''Whatever be my lot, I repeat I can sustain it,' said Coningsby, with a
cheek of scarlet.he is angry with me,' exclaimed Flora; 'he is angry with me!'and
the tears stole down her pale cheek.dear Flora; I have no other feelings to you than those of
affection and respect,' and Coningsby, much agitated, drew his chair
nearer to her, and took her hand.'I am gratified by these kind wishes,
though they are utterly impracticable; but they are the witnesses of
your sweet disposition and your noble spirit.There never shall exist
between us, under any circumstances, other feelings than those of kin
and kindness.'When she saw that, she started, and seemed to
summon all her energies.'You are going,' she exclaimed, 'and I have said nothing, I have said
nothing; and I shall never see you again.This fortune is yours; it must be yours.Do
not think I am speaking from a momentary impulse.I have
lived so much alone, I have had so little to deceive or to delude me,
that I know myself.If you will not let me do justice you declare my
doom.I cannot live if my existence is the cause of all your prospects
being blasted, and the sweetest dreams of your life being defeated.When
I die, these riches will be yours; that you cannot prevent.Refuse my
present offer, and you seal the fate of that unhappy Flora whose fragile
life has hung for years on the memory of your kindness.''You must not say these words, dear Flora; you must not indulge in these
gloomy feelings.You must live, and you must live happily.You have
every charm and virtue which should secure happiness.The duties and
the affections of existence will fall to your lot.It is one that will
always interest me, for I shall ever be your friend.You have conferred
on me one of the most delightful of feelings, gratitude, and for that I
bless you.CHAPTER V.


About a week after this interview with Flora, as Coningsby one morning
was about to sally forth from the Albany to visit some chambers in the
Temple, to which his notice had been attracted, there was a loud ring, a
bustle in the hall, and Henry Sydney and Buckhurst were ushered in.There never was such a cordial meeting; and yet the faces of his
friends were serious.The truth is, the paragraphs in the newspapers had
circulated in the country, they had written to Coningsby, and after a
brief delay he had confirmed their worst apprehensions.Immediately they
came up to town.Henry Sydney, a younger son, could offer little but
sympathy, but he declared it was his intention also to study for the
bar, so that they should not be divided.Buckhurst, after many embraces
and some ordinary talk, took Coningsby aside, and said, 'My dear fellow,
I have no objection to Henry Sydney hearing everything I say, but still
these are subjects which men like to be discussed in private.Of course
I expect you to share my fortune.There was something in Buckhurst's fervent resolution very lovable and a
little humorous, just enough to put one in good temper with human nature
and life.If there were any fellow's fortune in the world that Coningsby
would share, Buckhurst's would have had the preference; but while he
pressed his hand, and with a glance in which a tear and a smile seemed
to contend for mastery, he gently indicated why such arrangements were,
with our present manners, impossible.'I see,' said Buckhurst, after a moment's thought, 'I quite agree with
you.The thing cannot be done; and, to tell you the truth, a fortune
is a bore.What I vote that we three do at once is, to take plenty of
ready-money, and enter the Austrian service.'There is something in that,' said Coningsby.'In the meantime, suppose
you two fellows walk with me to the Temple, for I have an appointment to
look at some chambers.'It was a fine day, and it was by no means a gloomy walk.Though the
two friends had arrived full of indignation against Lord Monmouth, and
miserable about their companion, once more in his society, and finding
little difference in his carriage, they assumed unconsciously their
habitual tone.As for Buckhurst, he was delighted with the Temple, which
he visited for the first time.The tombs in the
church convinced him that the Crusades were the only career.He would
have himself become a law student if he might have prosecuted his
studies in chain armour.The calmer Henry Sydney was consoled for the
misfortunes of Coningsby by a fanciful project himself to pass a portion
of his life amid these halls and courts, gardens and terraces, that
maintain in the heart of a great city in the nineteenth century, so much
of the grave romance and picturesque decorum of our past manners.Henry Sydney was sanguine; he was reconciled to the disinheritance of
Coningsby by the conviction that it was a providential dispensation to
make him a Lord Chancellor.These faithful friends remained in town with Coningsby until he was
established in Paper Buildings, and had become a pupil of a celebrated
special pleader.They would have remained longer had not he himself
suggested that it was better that they should part.It seemed a terrible
catastrophe after all the visions of their boyish days, their college
dreams, and their dazzling adventures in the world.'And this is the end of Coningsby, the brilliant Coningsby, that we all
loved, that was to be our leader!'said Buckhurst to Lord Henry as
they quitted him.'Well, come what may, life has lost something of its
bloom.''The great thing now,' said Lord Henry, 'is to keep up the chain of
our friendship.We must write to him very often, and contrive to be
frequently together.It is dreadful to think that in the ways of life
our hearts may become estranged.I never felt more wretched than I do at
this moment, and yet I have faith that we shall not lose him.'said Buckhurst; 'but I feel my plan about the Austrian service
was, after all, the only thing.He might
have been prime minister; several strangers have been; and as for war,
look at Brown and Laudohn, and half a hundred others.I had a much
better chance of being a field-marshal than he has of being a Lord
Chancellor.''I feel quite convinced that Coningsby will be Lord Chancellor,' said
Henry Sydney, gravely.This change of life for Coningsby was a great social revolution.Within a month after the death of his grandfather
his name had been erased from all his fashionable clubs, and his horses
and carriages sold, and he had become a student of the Temple.He
entirely devoted himself to his new pursuit.His being was completely
absorbed in it.There was nothing to haunt his mind; no unexperienced
scene or sensation of life to distract his intelligence.One sacred
thought alone indeed there remained, shrined in the innermost sanctuary
of his heart and consciousness.But it was a tradition, no longer a
hope.The moment that he had fairly recovered from the first shock of
his grandfather's will; had clearly ascertained the consequences to
himself, and had resolved on the course to pursue; he had communicated
unreservedly with Oswald Millbank, and had renounced those pretensions
to the hand of his sister which it ill became the destitute to prefer.Millbank met Henry Sydney and
Buckhurst at the chambers of Coningsby.Once more they were all
four together; but under what different circumstances, and with what
different prospects from those which attended their separation at Eton!Alone with Coningsby, Millbank spoke to him things which letters could
not convey.He bore to him all the sympathy and devotion of Edith; but
they would not conceal from themselves that, at this moment, and in the
present state of affairs, all was hopeless.In no way did Coningsby ever
permit himself to intimate to Oswald the cause of his disinheritance.He
was, of course, silent on it to his other friends; as any communication
of the kind must have touched on a subject that was consecrated in his
inmost soul.The state of political parties in England in the spring of 1841 offered
a most remarkable contrast to their condition at the period commemorated
in the first chapter of this work.The banners of the Conservative camp
at this moment lowered on the Whig forces, as the gathering host of the
Norman invader frowned on the coast of Sussex.The Whigs were not
yet conquered, but they were doomed; and they themselves knew it.The
mistake which was made by the Conservative leaders in not retaining
office in 1839; and, whether we consider their conduct in a national
and constitutional light, or as a mere question of political tactics and
party prudence, it was unquestionably a great mistake; had infused into
the corps of Whig authority a kind of galvanic action, which only the
superficial could mistake for vitality.Even to form a basis for their
future operations, after the conjuncture of '39, the Whigs were obliged
to make a fresh inroad on the revenue, the daily increasing debility
of which was now arresting attention and exciting public alarm.It was
clear that the catastrophe of the government would be financial.Under all the circumstances of the case, the conduct of the Whig
Cabinet, in their final propositions, cannot be described as deficient
either in boldness or prudence.The policy which they recommended was
in itself a sagacious and spirited policy; but they erred in supposing
that, at the period it was brought forward, any measure promoted by the
Whigs could have obtained general favour in the country.The Whigs were
known to be feeble; they were looked upon as tricksters.The country
knew they were opposed by a powerful party; and though there certainly
never was any authority for the belief, the country did believe that
that powerful party were influenced by great principles; had in their
view a definite and national policy; and would secure to England,
instead of a feeble administration and fluctuating opinions, energy and
a creed.The future effect of the Whig propositions of '41 will not be
detrimental to that party, even if in the interval they be appropriated
piecemeal, as will probably be the case, by their Conservative
successors.But for the moment, and in the plight in which the Whig
party found themselves, it was impossible to have devised measures more
conducive to their precipitate fall.Great interests were menaced by a
weak government.Tadpole and Taper
saw it in a moment.They snuffed the factious air, and felt the coming
storm.Notwithstanding the extreme congeniality of these worthies,
there was a little latent jealousy between them.Tadpole worshipped
Registration: Taper, adored a Cry.Tadpole always maintained that it
was the winnowing of the electoral lists that could alone gain the day;
Taper, on the contrary, faithful to ancient traditions, was ever of
opinion that the game must ultimately be won by popular clamour.It
always seemed so impossible that the Conservative party could ever be
popular; the extreme graciousness and personal popularity of the leaders
not being sufficiently apparent to be esteemed an adequate set-off
against the inveterate odium that attached to their opinions; that the
Tadpole philosophy was the favoured tenet in high places; and Taper had
had his knuckles well rapped more than once for manoeuvring too actively
against the New Poor-law, and for hiring several link-boys to bawl
a much-wronged lady's name in the Park when the Court prorogued
Parliament.And now, after all, in 1841, it seemed that Taper was right.There was
a great clamour in every quarter, and the clamour was against the Whigs
and in favour of Conservative principles.What Canadian timber-merchants
meant by Conservative principles, it is not difficult to conjecture;
or West Indian planters.It was tolerably clear on the hustings
what squires and farmers, and their followers, meant by Conservative
principles.What they mean by Conservative principles now is another
question: and whether Conservative principles mean something higher than
a perpetuation of fiscal arrangements, some of them impolitic, none of
them important.But no matter what different bodies of men understood by
the cry in which they all joined, the Cry existed.Taper beat Tadpole;
and the great Conservative party beat the shattered and exhausted Whigs.Notwithstanding the abstraction of his legal studies, Coningsby could
not be altogether insensible to the political crisis.In the political
world of course he never mixed, but the friends of his boyhood were
deeply interested in affairs, and they lost no opportunity which
he would permit them, of cultivating his society.Their occasional
fellowship, a visit now and then to Sidonia, and a call sometimes
on Flora, who lived at Richmond, comprised his social relations.His
general acquaintance did not desert him, but he was out of sight, and
did not wish to be remembered.Ormsby asked him to dinner, and
occasionally mourned over his fate in the bow window of White's; while
Lord Eskdale even went to see him in the Temple, was interested in his
progress, and said, with an encouraging look, that, when he was called
to the bar, all his friends must join and get up the steam.Rigby, who was walking with the Duke of Agincourt,
which was probably the reason he could not notice a lawyer.Lord Eskdale had obtained from Villebecque accurate details as to the
cause of Coningsby being disinherited.Our hero, if one in such fallen
fortunes may still be described as a hero, had mentioned to Lord Eskdale
his sorrow that his grandfather had died in anger with him; but Lord
Eskdale, without dwelling on the subject, had assured him that he had
reason to believe that if Lord Monmouth had lived, affairs would have
been different.He had altered the disposition of his property at a
moment of great and general irritation and excitement; and had been too
indolent, perhaps really too indisposed, which he was unwilling ever to
acknowledge, to recur to a calmer and more equitable settlement.Lord
Eskdale had been more frank with Sidonia, and had told him all about
the refusal to become a candidate for Darlford against Mr.Millbank; the
communication of Rigby to Lord Monmouth, as to the presence of Oswald
Millbank at the castle, and the love of Coningsby for his sister; all
these details, furnished by Villebecque to Lord Eskdale, had been truly
transferred by that nobleman to his co-executor; and Sidonia, when he
had sufficiently digested them, had made Lady Wallinger acquainted with
the whole history.The dissolution of the Whig Parliament by the Whigs, the project of
which had reached Lord Monmouth a year before, and yet in which nobody
believed to the last moment, at length took place.All the world was
dispersed in the heart of the season, and our solitary student of the
Temple, in his lonely chambers, notwithstanding all his efforts, found
his eye rather wander over the pages of Tidd and Chitty as he remembered
that the great event to which he had so looked forward was now
occurring, and he, after all, was no actor in the mighty drama.It was
to have been the epoch of his life; when he was to have found himself
in that proud position for which all the studies, and meditations, and
higher impulses of his nature had been preparing him.It was a keen
trial of a man.Every one of his friends and old companions were
candidates, and with sanguine prospects.Lord Henry was certain for a
division of his county; Buckhurst harangued a large agricultural
borough in his vicinity; Eustace Lyle and Vere stood in coalition for
a Yorkshire town; and Oswald Millbank solicited the suffrages of an
important manufacturing constituency.They sent their addresses to
Coningsby.He was deeply interested as he traced in them the influence
of his own mind; often recognised the very expressions to which he
had habituated them.Amid the confusion of a general election, no
unimpassioned critic had time to canvass the language of an address to
an isolated constituency; yet an intelligent speculator on the movements
of political parties might have detected in these public declarations
some intimation of new views, and of a tone of political feeling that
has unfortunately been too long absent from the public life of this
country.It was the end of a sultry July day, the last ray of the sun shooting
down Pall Mall sweltering with dust; there was a crowd round the doors
of the Carlton and the Reform Clubs, and every now and then an express
arrived with the agitating bulletin of a fresh defeat or a new triumph.He was going to dine at the Oxford
and Cambridge Club, the only club on whose list he had retained his
name, that he might occasionally have the pleasure of meeting an Eton or
Cambridge friend without the annoyance of encountering any of his former
fashionable acquaintances.The latter did not notice him, but Mr.Tadpole, more good-natured, bestowed on him a rough nod, not unmarked by
a slight expression of coarse pity.Coningsby ordered his dinner, and then took up the evening papers, where
he learnt the return of Vere and Lyle; and read a speech of Buckhurst
denouncing the Venetian Constitution, to the amazement of several
thousand persons, apparently not a little terrified by this unknown
danger, now first introduced to their notice.Being true Englishmen,
they were all against Buckhurst's opponent, who was of the Venetian
party, and who ended by calling out Buckhurst for his personalities.Coningsby had dined, and was reading in the library, when a waiter
brought up a third edition of the _Sun_, with electioneering bulletins
from the manufacturing districts to the very latest hour.Some large
letters which expressed the name of Darlford caught his eye.There
seemed great excitement in that borough; strange proceedings had
happened.The column was headed, 'Extraordinary Affair!His eye glanced over an animated speech of Mr.Millbank, his
countenance changed, his heart palpitated.Millbank had resigned
the representation of the town, but not from weakness; his avocations
demanded his presence; he had been requested to let his son supply his
place, but his son was otherwise provided for; he should always take a
deep interest in the town and trade of Darlford; he hoped that the
link between the borough and Hellingsley would be ever cherished; loud
cheering; he wished in parting from them to take a step which should
conciliate all parties, put an end to local heats and factious
contentions, and secure the town an able and worthy representative.For
these reasons he begged to propose to them a gentleman who bore a
name which many of them greatly honoured; for himself, he knew the
individual, and it was his firm opinion that whether they considered his
talents, his character, or the ancient connection of his family with
the district, he could not propose a candidate more worthy of their
confidence than HARRY CONINGSBY, ESQ.This proposition was received with that wild enthusiasm which
occasionally bursts out in the most civilised communities.The contest
between Millbank and Rigby was equally balanced, neither party was
over-confident.The Conservatives were not particularly zealous in
behalf of their champion; there was no Marquess of Monmouth and no
Coningsby Castle now to back him; he was fighting on his own resources,
and he was a beaten horse.The Liberals did not like the prospect of a
defeat, and dreaded the mortification of Rigby's triumph.The Moderate
men, who thought more of local than political circumstances, liked the
name of Coningsby.Millbank had dexterously prepared his leading
supporters for the substitution.Some traits of the character and
conduct of Coningsby had been cleverly circulated.Thus there was a
combination of many favourable causes in his favour.In half an hour's
time his image was stamped on the brain of every inhabitant of the
borough as an interesting and accomplished youth, who had been wronged,
and who deserved to be rewarded.It was whispered that Rigby was his
enemy.Rigby into the river, or to burn down his hotel, in case he was
prudent enough not to show.Rigby determined to fight to the last.All his hopes were now staked on the successful result of this contest.It were impossible if he were returned that his friends could refuse him
high office.The whole of Lord Monmouth's reduced legacy was devoted
to this end.The third edition of the _Sun_ left Mr.Rigby in vain
attempting to address an infuriated populace.Here was a revolution in the fortunes of our forlorn Coningsby!When his
grandfather first sent for him to Monmouth House, his destiny was
not verging on greater vicissitudes.He rose from his seat, and was
surprised that all the silent gentlemen who were about him did not mark
his agitation.It was now an hour
to midnight, and to-morrow the almost unconscious candidate was to go to
the poll.In a tumult of suppressed emotion, Coningsby returned to his
chambers.He found a letter in his box from Oswald Millbank, who had
been twice at the Temple.Oswald had been returned without a contest,
and had reached Darlford in time to hear Coningsby nominated.He set off
instantly to London, and left at his friend's chambers a rapid narrative
of what had happened, with information that he should call on him
again on the morrow at nine o'clock, when they were to repair together
immediately to Darlford in time for Coningsby to be chaired, for no one
entertained a doubt of his triumph.Coningsby did not sleep a wink that night, and yet when he rose early
felt fresh enough for any exploit, however difficult or hazardous.He
felt as an Egyptian does when the Nile rises after its elevation had
been despaired of.At the very lowest ebb of his fortunes, an event
had occurred which seemed to restore all.He dared not contemplate the
ultimate result of all these wonderful changes.Enough for him, that
when all seemed dark, he was about to be returned to Parliament by
the father of Edith, and his vanquished rival who was to bite the dust
before him was the author of all his misfortunes.Love, Vengeance,
Justice, the glorious pride of having acted rightly, the triumphant
sense of complete and absolute success, here were chaotic materials from
which order was at length evolved; and all subsided in an overwhelming
feeling of gratitude to that Providence that had so signally protected
him.It seemed
that Oswald was as excited as Coningsby.His eye sparkled, his manner
was energetic.'We must talk it all over during our journey.We have not a minute to
spare.'During that journey Coningsby learned something of the course of affairs
which gradually had brought about so singular a revolution in his
favour.We mentioned that Sidonia had acquired a thorough knowledge of
the circumstances which had occasioned and attended the disinheritance
of Coningsby.These he had told to Lady Wallinger, first by letter,
afterwards in more detail on her arrival in London.Lady Wallinger had
conferred with her husband.She was not surprised at the goodness of
Coningsby, and she sympathised with all his calamities.He had ever been
the favourite of her judgment, and her romance had always consisted in
blending his destinies with those of her beloved Edith.Sir Joseph was a
judicious man, who never cared to commit himself; a little selfish, but
good, just, and honourable, with some impulses, only a little afraid
of them; but then his wife stepped in like an angel, and gave them the
right direction.They were both absolutely impressed with Coningsby's
admirable conduct, and Lady Wallinger was determined that her husband
should express to others the convictions which he acknowledged in unison
with herself.Millbank, who stared; but Sir
Joseph spoke feebly.Lady Wallinger conveyed all this intelligence, and
all her impressions, to Oswald and Edith.The younger Millbank talked
with his father, who, making no admissions, listened with interest,
inveighed against Lord Monmouth, and condemned his will.Millbank made inquiries about Coningsby, took an
interest in his career, and, like Lord Eskdale, declared that when he
was called to the bar, his friends would have an opportunity to evince
their sincerity.Affairs remained in this state, until Oswald thought
that circumstances were sufficiently ripe to urge his father on
the subject.The position which Oswald had assumed at Millbank had
necessarily made him acquainted with the affairs and fortune of his
father.When he computed the vast wealth which he knew was at his
parent's command, and recalled Coningsby in his humble chambers, toiling
after all his noble efforts without any results, and his sister pining
in a provincial solitude, Oswald began to curse wealth, and to
ask himself what was the use of all their marvellous industry and
supernatural skill?He addressed his father with that irresistible
frankness which a strong faith can alone inspire.What are the objects
of wealth, if not to bless those who possess our hearts?The only
daughter, the friend to whom the only son was indebted for his life,
here are two beings surely whom one would care to bless, and both are
unhappy.Millbank listened without prejudice, for he was already
convinced.But he felt some interest in the present conduct of
Coningsby.A Coningsby working for his bread was a novel incident for
him.He was resolved to
convince himself of the fact.And perhaps he would have gone on yet
for a little time, and watched the progress of the experiment,
already interested and delighted by what had reached him, had not the
dissolution brought affairs to a crisis.The misery of Oswald at the
position of Coningsby, the silent sadness of Edith, his own conviction,
which assured him that he could do nothing wiser or better than take
this young man to his heart, so ordained it that Mr.Millbank, who
was after all the creature of impulse, decided suddenly, and decided
rightly.Never making a single admission to all the representations of
his son, Mr.Millbank in a moment did all that his son could have dared
to desire.This is a very imperfect and crude intimation of what had occurred
at Millbank and Hellingsley; yet it conveys a faint sketch of the
enchanting intelligence that Oswald conveyed to Coningsby during their
rapid travel.When they arrived at Birmingham, they found a messenger
and a despatch, informing Coningsby, that at mid-day, at Darlford, he
was at the head of the poll by an overwhelming majority, and that Mr.He was, however, requested to remain at Birmingham,
as they did not wish him to enter Darlford, except to be chaired, so
he was to arrive there in the morning.At Birmingham, therefore, they
remained.There was Oswald's election to talk of as well as Coningsby's.They had
hardly had time for this.Men must have been at school together, to enjoy the real fun of meeting
thus, and realising boyish dreams.Often, years ago, they had talked
of these things, and assumed these results; but those were words and
dreams, these were positive facts; after some doubts and struggles, in
the freshness of their youth, Oswald Millbank and Harry Coningsby
were members of the British Parliament; public characters, responsible
agents, with a career.This afternoon, at Birmingham, was as happy an afternoon as usually
falls to the lot of man.Both of these companions were labouring under
that degree of excitement which is necessary to felicity.Edith was no longer a forbidden or a sorrowful
subject.There was rapture in their again meeting under such
circumstances.Then there were their friends; that dear Buckhurst, who
had just been called out for styling his opponent a Venetian, and all
their companions of early days.What a sudden and marvellous change in
all their destinies!Life was a pantomime; the wand was waved, and it
seemed that the schoolfellows had of a sudden become elements of power,
springs of the great machine.A train arrived; restless they sallied forth, to seek diversion in the
dispersion of the passengers.Coningsby and Millbank, with that glance,
a little inquisitive, even impertinent, if we must confess it, with
which one greets a stranger when he emerges from a public conveyance,
were lounging on the platform.The train arrived; stopped; the doors
were thrown open, and from one of them emerged Mr.Coningsby, who
had dined, was greatly tempted to take off his hat and make him a bow,
but he refrained.He was evidently
used up; a man without a resource; the sight of Coningsby his last blow;
he had met his fate.'My dear fellow,' said Coningsby, 'I remember I wanted you to dine with
my grandfather at Montem, and that fellow would not ask you.About eleven o'clock the next morning they arrived at the Darlford
station.Here they were met by an anxious deputation, who received
Coningsby as if he were a prophet, and ushered him into a car covered
with satin and blue ribbons, and drawn by six beautiful grey horses,
caparisoned in his colours, and riden by postilions, whose very whips
were blue and white.Triumphant music sounded; banners waved; the
multitude were marshalled; the Freemasons, at the first opportunity,
fell into the procession; the Odd Fellows joined it at the nearest
corner.Preceded and followed by thousands, with colours flying,
trumpets sounding, and endless huzzas, flags and handkerchiefs waving
from every window, and every balcony filled with dames and maidens
bedecked with his colours, Coningsby was borne through enthusiastic
Darlford like Paulus Emilius returning from Macedon.Uncovered, still
in deep mourning, his fine figure, and graceful bearing, and his
intelligent brow, at once won every female heart.The singularity was, that all were of the same opinion: everybody
cheered him, every house was adorned with his colours.His triumphal
return was no party question.Magog Wrath and Bully Bluck walked
together like lambs at the head of his procession.The car stopped before the principal hotel in the High Street.The broad street was so crowded, that, as
every one declared, you might have walked on the heads of the people.Every window was full; the very roofs were peopled.The car stopped,
and the populace gave three cheers for Mr.Their late member,
surrounded by his friends, stood in the balcony, which was fitted up
with Coningsby's colours, and bore his name on the hangings in gigantic
letters formed of dahlias.The flashing and inquiring eye of Coningsby
caught the form of Edith, who was leaning on her father's arm.The hustings were opposite the hotel, and here, after a while, Coningsby
was carried, and, stepping from his car, took up his post to address,
for the first time, a public assembly.Anxious as the people were
to hear him, it was long before their enthusiasm could subside into
silence.He spoke; his
powerful and rich tones reached every ear.In five minutes' time every
one looked at his neighbour, and without speaking they agreed that there
never was anything like this heard in Darlford before.He addressed them for a considerable time, for he had a great deal to
say; not only to express his gratitude for the unprecedented manner in
which he had become their representative, and for the spirit in which
they had greeted him, but he had to offer them no niggard exposition
of the views and opinions of the member whom they had so confidingly
chosen, without even a formal declaration of his sentiments.He did this with so much clearness, and in a manner so pointed and
popular, that the deep attention of the multitude never wavered.His
lively illustrations kept them often in continued merriment.But when,
towards his close, he drew some picture of what he hoped might be the
character of his future and lasting connection with the town, the vast
throng was singularly affected.There were a great many present at that
moment who, though they had never seen Coningsby before, would willingly
have then died for him.Coningsby had touched their hearts, for he had
spoken from his own.Darlford
believed in Coningsby: and a very good creed.And now Coningsby was conducted to the opposite hotel.The progress was slow, as every one wished to shake hands
with him.His friends, however, at last safely landed him.He sprang
up the stairs; he was met by Mr.Millbank, who welcomed him with the
greatest warmth, and offered his hearty congratulations.'It is to you, dear sir, that I am indebted for all this,' said
Coningsby.Millbank, 'it is to your own high principles, great
talents, and good heart.'After he had been presented by the late member to the principal
personages in the borough, Mr.Millbank said,

'I think we must now give Mr.Come with me,' he
added, 'here is some one who will be very glad to see you.'Speaking thus, he led our hero a little away, and placing his arm in
Coningsby's with great affection opened the door of an apartment.There
was Edith, radiant with loveliness and beaming with love.Their agitated
hearts told at a glance the tumult of their joy.The father joined their
hands, and blessed them with words of tenderness.The marriage of Coningsby and Edith took place early in the autumn.It was solemnised at Millbank, and they passed their first moon at
Hellingsley, which place was in future to be the residence of the member
for Darlford.The estate was to devolve to Coningsby after the death of
Mr.Millbank, who in the meantime made arrangements which permitted
the newly-married couple to reside at the Hall in a manner becoming its
occupants.Millbank assured Coningsby,
were effected not only with the sanction, but at the express instance,
of his son.An event, however, occurred not very long after the marriage of
Coningsby, which rendered this generous conduct of his father-in-law no
longer necessary to his fortunes, though he never forgot its exercise.The gentle and unhappy daughter of Lord Monmouth quitted a scene with
which her spirit had never greatly sympathised.Perhaps she might have
lingered in life for yet a little while, had it not been for that fatal
inheritance which disturbed her peace and embittered her days, haunting
her heart with the recollection that she had been the unconscious
instrument of injuring the only being whom she loved, and embarrassing
and encumbering her with duties foreign to her experience and her
nature.The marriage of Coningsby had greatly affected her, and from
that day she seemed gradually to decline.She died towards the end
of the autumn, and, subject to an ample annuity to Villebecque, she
bequeathed the whole of her fortune to the husband of Edith.Gratifying
as it was to him to present such an inheritance to his wife, it was not
without a pang that he received the intelligence of the death of Flora.Edith sympathised in his affectionate feelings, and they raised a
monument to her memory in the gardens of Hellingsley.Coningsby passed his next Christmas in his own hall with his beautiful
and gifted wife by his side, and surrounded by the friends of his heart
and his youth.They stand now on the threshold of public life.They are in the leash,
but in a moment they will be slipped.Will they
maintain in august assemblies and high places the great truths which, in
study and in solitude, they have embraced?Or will their courage exhaust
itself in the struggle, their enthusiasm evaporate before hollow-hearted
ridicule, their generous impulses yield with a vulgar catastrophe to the
tawdry temptations of a low ambition?Will their skilled intelligence
subside into being the adroit tool of a corrupt party?Will Vanity
confound their fortunes, or Jealousy wither their sympathies?Or will
they remain brave, single, and true; refuse to bow before shadows and
worship phrases; sensible of the greatness of their position, recognise
the greatness of their duties; denounce to a perplexed and disheartened
world the frigid theories of a generalising age that have destroyed
the individuality of man, and restore the happiness of their country by
believing in their own energies, and daring to be great?It was almost a
miraculous restoration.The next day he was carried to Berkeley House.This stopped his journey for the present, and caused my stay in town.He
had put all his affairs and his whole estate in England into my hands
during his intended absence, which though I was very unfit to undertake,
in regard of many businesses which then took me up, yet, upon the great
importunity of my lady and Mr.Godolphin (to whom I could refuse
nothing) I did take it on me.It seems when he was Deputy in Ireland,
not long before, he had been much wronged by one he left in trust with
his affairs, and therefore wished for some unmercenary friend who would
take that trouble on him; this was to receive his rents, look after his
houses and tenants, solicit supplies from the Lord Treasurer, and
correspond weekly with him, more than enough to employ any drudge in
England; but what will not friendship and love make one do?Dined at my Lord Chamberlain's, with my son.There
were the learned Isaac Vossius, and Spanhemius, son of the famous man of
Heidelberg; nor was this gentleman less learned, being a general
scholar.Among other pieces, he was author of an excellent treatise on
Medals.Being the day appointed for my Lord Ambassador to
set out, I met them with my coach at New Cross.There were with him my
Lady his wife, and my dear friend, Mrs.Godolphin, who, out of an
extraordinary friendship, would needs accompany my lady to Paris, and
stay with her some time, which was the chief inducement for permitting
my son to travel, but I knew him safe under her inspection, and in
regard my Lord himself had promised to take him into his special favor,
he having intrusted all he had to my care.Thus we set out three coaches (besides mine), three wagons, and about
forty horses.It being late, and my Lord as yet but valetudinary, we got
but to Dartford, the first day, the next to Sittingbourne.Cony, then an officer of mine for the sick
and wounded of that place, gave the ladies a handsome refreshment as we
came by his house.[Sidenote: DOVER]

12th November, 1675.We came to Canterbury: and, next morning, to Dover.There was in my Lady Ambassadress's company my Lady Hamilton, a
sprightly young lady, much in the good graces of the family, wife of
that valiant and worthy gentleman, George Hamilton, not long after slain
in the wars.She had been a maid of honor to the Duchess, and now turned
<DW7>.Being Sunday, my Lord having before delivered to me
his letter of attorney, keys, seal, and his Will, we took a solemn leave
of one another upon the beach, the coaches carrying them into the sea to
the boats, which delivered them to Captain Gunman's yacht, the "Mary."Being under sail, the castle gave them seventeen guns, which Captain
Gunman answered with eleven.Hence, I went to church, to beg a blessing
on their voyage.Being returned home, I visited Lady Mordaunt at
Parson's Green, my Lord, her son, being sick.This pious woman delivered
to me L100 to bestow as I thought fit for the release of poor prisoners,
and other charitable uses.Visited her Ladyship again, where I found the
Bishop of Winchester, whom I had long known in France; he invited me to
his house at Chelsea.Lady Sunderland gave me ten guineas, to bestow in
charities.Gunning, Bishop of Ely, preached before the
King from St.21, 22, 23, chiefly against an anonymous book,
called "Naked Truth," a famous and popular treatise against the
corruption in the Clergy, but not sound as to its quotations, supposed
to have been the Bishop of Hereford's and was answered by Dr.Turner, it
endeavoring to prove an equality of order of Bishop and Presbyter.Pritchard, Bishop of Gloucester, preached at
Whitehall, on Isaiah v.5, very allegorically, according to his manner,
yet very gravely and wittily.Povey, one of the Masters of
Requests, a nice contriver of all elegancies, and exceedingly formal.Supped with Sir J. Williamson, where were of our Society Mr.Robert
Boyle, Sir Christopher Wren, Sir William Petty, Dr.Holden, subdean of
his Majesty's Chapel, Sir James Shaen, Dr.Whistler, and our Secretary,
Mr.Sir Thomas Linch was returned from his government of
Jamaica.The Countess of Sunderland and I went by water to
Parson's Green, to visit my Lady Mordaunt, and to consult with her about
my Lord's monument.Lloyd, late Curate of Deptford, but now Bishop of
Llandaff, preached before the King, on 1 Cor.57, that though sin
subjects us to death, yet through Christ we become his conquerors.To Twickenham Park, Lord Berkeley's country seat, to
examine how the bailiffs and servants ordered matters.Brideoake, Bishop of Chichester, preached a mean
discourse for a Bishop.Fleetwood, Bishop of Worcester,
on Matt.38, of the sorrows of Christ, a deadly sorrow caused by
our sins; he was no great preacher.Dining with my Lady Sunderland, I saw a fellow swallow
a knife, and divers great pebble stones, which would make a plain
rattling one against another.The knife was in a sheath of horn.North, son of my Lord North, preached before the King, on Isaiah
liii.57, a very young but learned and excellent person.This was
the first time the Duke appeared no more in chapel, to the infinite
grief and threatened ruin of this poor nation.I had now notice that my dear friend Mrs.Godolphin, was
returning from Paris.On the 6th, she arrived to my great joy, whom I
most heartily welcomed.My wife entertained her Majesty at Deptford, for which
the Queen gave me thanks in the withdrawing room at Whitehall.The University of Oxford presented me with the "_Marmora Oxoniensia
Arundeliana_"; the Bishop of Oxford writing to desire that I would
introduce Mr.Prideaux, the editor (a young man most learned in
antiquities) to the Duke of Norfolk, to present another dedicated to his
Grace, which I did, and we dined with the Duke at Arundel House, and
supped at the Bishop of Rochester's with Isaac Vossius.I spoke to the Duke of York about my Lord Berkeley's
going to Nimeguen.Thence, to the Queen's Council at Somerset House,
about Mrs.Godolphin's lease of Spalding, in Lincolnshire.Montague's new palace, near Bloomsbury, built by Mr.Hooke, of our
Society, after the French manner.[36]

    [Footnote 36: Now the British Museum.]Returned home, and found my son returned from France;
praised be God!A chaplain of my Lord Ossory's preached,
after which we took barge to Trinity House in London.Pepys
(Secretary of the Admiralty) succeeded my Lord as Master.[Sidenote: ENFIELD]

2d June, 1676.I went with my Lord Chamberlain to see a garden, at
Enfield town; thence, to Mr.It
is a very pretty place, the house commodious, the gardens handsome, and
our entertainment very free, there being none but my Lord and myself.That which I most wondered at was, that, in the compass of twenty-five
miles, yet within fourteen of London, there is not a house, barn,
church, or building, besides three lodges.To this Lodge are three great
ponds, and some few inclosures, the rest a solitary desert, yet stored
with no less than 3,000 deer.These are pretty retreats for gentlemen,
especially for those who are studious and lovers of privacy.We returned in the evening by Hampstead, to see Lord Wotton's house and
garden (Bellsize House), built with vast expense by Mr.O'Neale, an
Irish gentleman who married Lord Wotton's mother, Lady Stanhope.The
furniture is very particular for Indian cabinets, porcelain, and other
solid and noble movables.The gallery very fine, the gardens very large,
but ill kept, yet woody and chargeable.The soil a cold weeping clay,
not answering the expense.I went to see Sir Thomas Bond's new and fine house by
Peckham; it is on a flat, but has a fine garden and prospect through the
meadows to London.Castillion, Prebend of Canterbury, preached before
the King, on John xv.Went to the funeral of Sir William Sanderson, husband
to the Mother of the Maids, and author of two large but mean histories
of King James and King Charles I. He was buried at Westminster.James's Chapel,
was christened a daughter of Dr.Leake's, the Duke's Chaplain:
godmothers were Lady Mary, daughter of the Duke of York, and the Duchess
of Monmouth: godfather, the Earl of Bath.Came to dine with me my Lord Halifax, Sir Thomas
Meeres, one of the Commissioners of the Admiralty, Sir John Clayton, Mr.Dined with Sir John Banks at his house in Lincoln's
Inn Fields, on recommending Mr.Upman to be tutor to his son going into
France.This Sir John Banks was a merchant of small beginning, but had
amassed L100,000.I dined at the Admiralty with Secretary Pepys, and
supped at the Lord Chamberlain's.Here was Captain Baker, who had been
lately on the attempt of the Northwest passage.He reported prodigious
depth of ice, blue as a sapphire, and as transparent.The thick mists
were their chief impediment, and cause of their return.I paid L1,700 to the Marquis de Sissac, which he had
lent to my Lord Berkeley, and which I heard the Marquis lost at play in
a night or two.The Dean of Chichester preached before the King, on Acts xxiv.Crichton preached the second sermon before him on Psalm xc.12, of
wisely numbering our days, and well employing our time.Dined at Captain Graham's, where I became acquainted
with Dr.Compton (brother to the Earl of Northampton), now Bishop of
London, and Mr.North, son to the Lord North, brother to the Lord
Chief-Justice and Clerk of the Closet, a most hopeful young man.The
Bishop had once been a soldier, had also traveled in Italy, and became a
most sober, grave, and excellent prelate.Supped at the Lord Chamberlain's, where also supped
the famous beauty and errant lady, the Duchess of Mazarine (all the
world knows her story), the Duke of Monmouth, Countess of Sussex (both
natural children of the King by the Duchess of Cleveland[37]), and the
Countess of Derby, a virtuous lady, daughter to my best friend, the Earl
of Ossory.[Footnote 37: Evelyn makes a slip here.The Duke of Monmouth's
    mother was, it is well known, Lucy Walters, sometimes called Mrs.Barlow, and heretofore mentioned in the "Diary."Nor is he more
    correct as to the Countess of Sussex.Lady Anne Fitzroy, as she is
    called in the Peerage books, was married to Lennard Dacre, Earl of
    Sussex, by whom she left a daughter only, who succeeded on her
    father's death to the Barony of Dacre.On the other hand, the Duke
    of Southampton, the Duke of Grafton, and the Duke of Northumberland,
    were all of them children of Charles II.by the Duchess of
    Cleveland.]Flamsted, the learned astrologer
and mathematician, whom his Majesty had established in the new
Observatory in Greenwich Park, furnished with the choicest instruments.To London, to take order about the building of a
house, or rather an apartment, which had all the conveniences of a
house, for my dear friend, Mr.Godolphin and lady, which I undertook to
contrive and survey, and employ workmen until it should be quite
finished; it being just over against his Majesty's wood-yard by the
Thames side, leading to Scotland Yard.To Lambeth, to that rare magazine of marble, to
take order for chimney-pieces, etc., for Mr.The
owner of the works had built for himself a pretty dwelling house; this
Dutchman had contracted with the Genoese for all their marble.We also
saw the Duke of Buckingham's glasswork, where they made huge vases of
metal as clear, ponderous, and thick as crystal; also looking-glasses
far larger and better than any that come from Venice.Godolphin and my wife to Blackwall,
to see some Indian curiosities; the streets being slippery, I fell
against a piece of timber with such violence that I could not speak nor
fetch my breath for some space; being carried into a house and let
blood, I was removed to the water-side and so home, where, after a day's
rest, I recovered.This being one of my greatest deliverances, the Lord
Jesus make me ever mindful and thankful!Being my birthday, and fifty-six years old, I spent
the morning in devotion and imploring God's protection, with solemn
thanksgiving for all his signal mercies to me, especially for that
escape which concerned me this month at Blackwall.Godolphin, and returned home through a prodigious and dangerous mist.Finished the lease of Spalding, for Mr.My son and I dining at my Lord Chamberlain's, he
showed us among others that incomparable piece of Raphael's, being a
Minister of State dictating to Guicciardini, the earnestness of whose
face looking up in expectation of what he was next to write, is so to
the life, and so natural, as I esteem it one of the choicest pieces of
that admirable artist.There was a woman's head of Leonardo da Vinci; a
Madonna of old Palma, and two of Vandyke's, of which one was his own
picture at length, when young, in a leaning posture; the other, an
eunuch, singing.I saw the great ball danced by all the gallants and
ladies at the Duchess of York's.There fell so deep a snow as hindered us from
church.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th December, 1676.To London, in so great a snow, as I remember not
to have seen the like.More snow falling, I was not able to get to church.I went to Roehampton, with my Lady Duchess of
Ormond.The garden and perspective is pretty, the prospect most
agreeable.Came the Earl of Peterborough, to desire me to be a
trustee for Lord Viscount Mordaunt and the Countess, for the sale of
certain lands set out by Act of Parliament, to pay debts.I went to London, to give the Lord Ambassador Berkeley
(now returned from the treaty at Nimeguen) an account of the great trust
reposed in me during his absence, I having received and remitted to him
no less than L20,000 to my no small trouble and loss of time, that
during his absence, and when the Lord Treasurer was no great friend [of
his] I yet procured him great sums, very often soliciting his Majesty in
his behalf; looking after the rest of his estates and concerns entirely,
without once accepting any kind of acknowledgment, purely upon the
request of my dear friend, Mr.I returned with abundance of
thanks and professions from my Lord Berkeley and my Lady.This business being now at an end, and myself delivered
from that intolerable servitude and correspondence, I had leisure to be
somewhat more at home and to myself.I sealed the deeds of sale of the manor of Blechingley to
Sir Robert Clayton, for payment of Lord Peterborough's debts, according
to the trust of the Act of Parliament.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

16th July, 1677.Evans, curate of Abinger,
preached an excellent sermon on Matt.Duncomb's, at Sheere, whose house stands
environed with very sweet and quick streams.Bohun, my Son's late tutor, preached at Abinger, on
Phil., iv.I went to visit my Lord Brounker, now taking the
waters at Dulwich.Dined at the Earl of Peterborough's the day after the
marriage of my Lord of Arundel to Lady Mary Mordaunt, daughter of the
Earl of Peterborough.To visit my Lord Chamberlain, in Suffolk; he sent his
coach and six to meet and bring me from St.Edmund's Bury to Euston.We hunted in the Park and killed a very fat buck.I went to visit my Lord Crofts, now dying at St.Edmunds Bury, and took the opportunity to see this ancient town, and the
remains of that famous monastery and abbey.There is little standing
entire, save the gatehouse; it has been a vast and magnificent Gothic
structure, and of great extent.The gates are wood, but quite plated
over with iron.There are also two stately churches, one especially.I went to Thetford, to the borough-town, where
stand the ruins of a religious house: there is a round mountain
artificially raised, either for some castle, or monument, which makes a
pretty landscape.As we went and returned, a tumbler showed his
extraordinary address in the Warren.I also saw the Decoy; much pleased
with the stratagem.There dined this day at my Lord's one Sir John
Gaudy, a very handsome person, but quite dumb, yet very intelligent by
signs, and a very fine painter; he was so civil and well bred, as it was
not possible to discern any imperfection in him.His lady and children
were also there, and he was at church in the morning with us.A stranger preached at Euston Church, and fell into
a handsome panegyric on my Lord's new building the church, which indeed
for its elegance and cheerfulness, is one of the prettiest country
churches in England.My Lord told me his heart smote him that, after he
had bestowed so much on his magnificent palace there, he should see
God's House in the ruin it lay in.He has also rebuilt the
parsonage-house, all of stone, very neat and ample.[Sidenote: EUSTON]

10th September, 1677.To divert me, my Lord would needs carry me to see
Ipswich, when we dined with one Mr.Mann by the way, who was Recorder of
the town.There were in our company my Lord Huntingtower, son to the
Duchess of Lauderdale, Sir Edward Bacon, a learned gentleman of the
family of the great Chancellor Verulam, and Sir John Felton, with some
other knights and gentlemen.After dinner came the bailiff and
magistrates in their formalities with their maces to compliment my Lord,
and invite him to the town-house, where they presented us a collation of
dried sweetmeats and wine, the bells ringing, etc.Then, we went to see
the town, and first, the Lord Viscount Hereford's house, which stands in
a park near the town, like that at Brussels, in Flanders; the house not
great, yet pretty, especially the hall.The stews for fish succeeded one
another, and feed one the other, all paved at bottom.There is a good
picture of the blessed virgin in one of the parlors, seeming to be of
Holbein, or some good master.Then we saw the Haven, seven miles from
Harwich.The tide runs out every day, but the bedding being soft mud, it
is safe for shipping and a station.The trade of Ipswich is for the most
part Newcastle coals, with which they supply London; but it was formerly
a clothing town.There is not any beggar asks alms in the whole place, a
thing very extraordinary, so ordered by the prudence of the magistrates.It has in it fourteen or fifteen beautiful churches: in a word, it is
for building, cleanness, and good order, one of the best towns in
England.Cardinal Wolsey was a butcher's son of Ipswich, but there is
little of that magnificent Prelate's foundation here, besides a school
and I think a library, which I did not see.His intentions were to build
some great thing.We returned late to Euston, having traveled about
fifty miles this day.Since first I was at this place, I found things exceedingly improved.It is seated in a bottom between two graceful swellings, the main
building being now in the figure of a Greek II with four pavilions, two
at each corner, and a break in the front, railed and balustered at the
top, where I caused huge jars to be placed full of earth to keep them
steady upon their pedestals between the statues, which make as good a
show as if they were of stone, and, though the building be of brick, and
but two stories besides cellars and garrets covered with blue slate, yet
there is room enough for a full court, the offices and outhouses being
so ample and well disposed.The King's apartment is painted _a fresco_,
and magnificently furnished.There are many excellent pictures of the
great masters.The gallery is a pleasant, noble room; in the break, or
middle, is a billiard table, but the wainscot, being of fir, and
painted, does not please me so well as Spanish oak without paint.The
chapel is pretty, the porch descending to the gardens.The orange garden
is very fine, and leads into the greenhouse, at the end of which is a
hall to eat in, and the conservatory some hundred feet long, adorned
with maps, as the other side is with the heads of the Caesars, ill cut in
alabaster; above are several apartments for my Lord, Lady, and Duchess,
with kitchens and other offices below, in a lesser form; lodgings for
servants, all distinct for them to retire to when they please and would
be in private, and have no communication with the palace, which he tells
me he will wholly resign to his son-in-law and daughter, that charming
young creature.The canal running under my Lady's dressing room chamber window, is full
of carps and fowl, which come and are fed there.The cascade at the end
of the canal turns a cornmill that provides the family, and raises water
for the fountains and offices.To pass this canal into the opposite
meadows, Sir Samuel Morland has invented a screw bridge, which, being
turned with a key, lands you fifty feet distant at the entrance of an
ascending walk of trees, a mile in length,--as it is also on the front
into the park,--of four rows of ash trees, and reaches to the park pale,
which is nine miles in compass, and the best for riding and meeting the
game that I ever saw.There were now of red and fallow deer almost a
thousand, with good covert, but the soil barren and flying sand, in
which nothing will grow kindly.The tufts of fir, and much of the other
wood, were planted by my direction some years before.This seat is
admirably placed for field sports, hawking, hunting, or racing.The
mutton is small, but sweet.The stables hold thirty horses and four
coaches.The out-offices make two large quadrangles, so as servants
never lived with more ease and convenience; never master more civil.Strangers are attended and accommodated as at their home, in pretty
apartments furnished with all manner of conveniences and privacy.There is a library full of excellent books; bathing rooms, elaboratory,
dispensary, a decoy, and places to keep and fat fowl in.He had now in
his new church (near the garden) built a dormitory, or vault, with
several repositories, in which to bury his family.In the expense of this pious structure, the church is most laudable,
most of the houses of God in this country resembling rather stables and
thatched cottages than temples in which to serve the Most High.He has
built a lodge in the park for the keeper, which is a neat dwelling, and
might become any gentleman.The same has he done for the parson, little
deserving it for murmuring that my Lord put him some time out of his
wretched hovel, while it was building.He has also erected a fair inn at
some distance from his palace, with a bridge of stone over a river near
it, and repaired all the tenants' houses, so as there is nothing but
neatness and accommodations about his estate, which I yet think is not
above L1,500 a year.I believe he had now in his family one hundred
domestic servants.His lady (being one of the Brederode's daughters, grandchild to a
natural son of Henry Frederick, Prince of Orange) is a good-natured and
obliging woman.They love fine things, and to live easily, pompously,
and hospitably; but, with so vast expense, as plunges my Lord into debts
exceedingly.My Lord himself is given into no expensive vice but
building, and to have all things rich, polite, and princely.He never
plays, but reads much, having the Latin, French, and Spanish tongues in
perfection.He has traveled much, and is the best bred and courtly
person his Majesty has about him, so as the public Ministers more
frequent him than any of the rest of the nobility.While he was
Secretary of State and Prime Minister, he had gotten vastly, but spent
it as hastily, even before he had established a fund to maintain his
greatness; and now beginning to decline in favor (the Duke being no
great friend of his), he knows not how to retrench.He was son of a
Doctor of Laws, whom I have seen, and, being sent from Westminster
School to Oxford, with intention to be a divine, and parson of
Arlington, a village near Brentford, when Master of Arts the Rebellion
falling out, he followed the King's Army, and receiving an HONORABLE
WOUND IN THE FACE, grew into favor, and was advanced from a mean
fortune, at his Majesty's Restoration, to be an Earl and Knight of the
Garter, Lord Chamberlain of the Household, and first favorite for a long
time, during which the King married his natural son, the Duke of
Grafton, to his only daughter and heiress, as before mentioned, worthy
for her beauty and virtue of the greatest prince in Christendom.My Lord
is, besides this, a prudent and understanding person in business, and
speaks well; unfortunate yet in those he has advanced, most of them
proving ungrateful.The many obligations and civilities I have received
from this noble gentleman, extracts from me this character, and I am
sorry he is in no better circumstances.Having now passed near three weeks at Euston, to my great satisfaction,
with much difficulty he suffered me to look homeward, being very earnest
with me to stay longer; and, to engage me, would himself have carried me
to Lynn-Regis, a town of important traffic, about twenty miles beyond,
which I had never seen; as also the Traveling Sands, about ten miles
wide of Euston, that have so damaged the country, rolling from place to
place, and, like the Sands in the Deserts of Lybia, quite overwhelmed
some gentlemen's whole estates, as the relation extant in print, and
brought to our Society, describes at large.My Lord's coach conveyed me to Bury, and thence
baiting at Newmarket, stepping in at Audley-End to see that house again,
I slept at Bishop-Stortford, and, the next day, home.I was accompanied
in my journey by Major Fairfax, of a younger house of the Lord Fairfax,
a soldier, a traveler, an excellent musician, a good-natured, well-bred
gentleman.Phillips (nephew of Milton) to the
service of my Lord Chamberlain, who wanted a scholar to read to and
entertain him sometimes.With Sir Robert Clayton to Marden, an estate he had
bought lately of my kinsman, Sir John Evelyn, of Godstone, in Surrey,
which from a despicable farmhouse Sir Robert had erected into a seat
with extraordinary expense.It is in such a solitude among hills, as,
being not above sixteen miles from London, seems almost incredible, the
ways up to it are so winding and intricate.The gardens are large, and
well-walled, and the husbandry part made very convenient and perfectly
understood.The barns, the stacks of corn, the stalls for cattle, pigeon
house, etc., of most laudable example.Innumerable are the plantations
of trees, especially walnuts.The orangery and gardens are very curious.He and his lady (who is very
curious in distillery) entertained me three or four days very freely.I
earnestly suggested to him the repairing of an old desolate dilapidated
church, standing on the hill above the house, which I left him in good
disposition to do, and endow it better; there not being above four or
five houses in the parish, besides that of this prodigious rich
Scrivener.This place is exceedingly sharp in the winter, by reason of
the serpentining of the hills: and it wants running water; but the
solitude much pleased me.All the ground is so full of wild thyme,
marjoram, and other sweet plants, that it cannot be overstocked with
bees; I think he had near forty hives of that industrious insect.I went to church at Godstone, and to see old Sir
John Evelyn's DORMITORY, joining to the church, paved with marble, where
he and his Lady lie on a very stately monument at length; he in armor of
white marble.The inscription is only an account of his particular
branch of the family, on black marble.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th October, 1677.Returned to London; in the evening, I saw the Prince
of Orange, and supped with Lord Ossory.Saw again the Prince of Orange; his marriage with the
Lady Mary, eldest daughter to the Duke of York, by Mrs.Hyde, the late
Duchess, was now declared.I was all this week composing matters between old
Mrs.Howard and Sir Gabriel Sylvius, upon his long and earnest addresses
to Mrs.Anne, her second daughter, maid of honor to the Queen.Godolphin (who exceedingly loved the young lady) was most
industrious in it, out of pity to the languishing knight; so as though
there were great differences in their years, it was at last effected,
and they were married the 13th, in Henry VII.'s Chapel, by the Bishop of
Rochester, there being besides my wife and Mrs.We dined at the old lady's, and supped at
Mr.The Queen's birthday, a great ball at Court, where
the Prince of Orange and his new Princess danced.They went away, and I saw embarked my Lady Sylvius,
who went into Holland with her husband, made Hoffmaester to the Prince,
a considerable employment.We parted with great sorrow, for the great
respect and honor I bore her, a most pious and virtuous lady.Dined at the Lord Treasurer's with Prince Rupert,
Viscount Falkenburg, Earl of Bath, Lord O'Brien, Sir John Lowther, Sir
Christopher Wren, Dr.Sir Joseph Williamson, Principal Secretary of
State, was chosen President of the Royal Society, after my Lord Viscount
Brouncker had possessed the chair now sixteen years successively, and
therefore now thought fit to CHANGE, that prescription might not
prejudice.Being the first day of his taking the chair, he gave
us a magnificent supper.Carried to my Lord Treasurer an account of the Earl
of Bristol's Library, at Wimbledon, which my Lord thought of purchasing,
till I acquainted him that it was a very broken collection, consisting
much in books of judicial astrology, romances, and trifles.I gave my son an office, with instructions how to
govern his youth; I pray God give him the grace to make a right use of
it!Dined with the Duke of Norfolk, being the first
time I had seen him since the death of his elder brother, who died at
Padua in Italy, where he had resided above thirty years.The Duke had
now newly declared his marriage to his concubine, whom he promised me he
never would marry.I went with him to see the Duke of Buckingham, thence
to my Lord Sunderland, now Secretary of State, to show him that rare
piece of Vosterman's (son of old Vosterman), which was a view, or
landscape of my Lord's palace, etc., at Althorpe in Northamptonshire.Supping at my Lord Chamberlain's I had a long
discourse with the Count de Castel Mellor, lately Prime Minister in
Portugal, who, taking part with his master, King Alphonso, was banished
by his brother, Don Pedro, now Regent; but had behaved himself so
uncorruptly in all his ministry that, though he was acquitted, and his
estate restored, yet would they not suffer him to return.He is a very
intelligent and worthy gentleman.My Lord Treasurer sent for me to accompany him to
Wimbledon, which he had lately purchased of the Earl of Bristol; so
breaking fast with him privately in his chamber, I accompanied him with
two of his daughters, my Lord Conway, and Sir Bernard Gascoyne; and,
having surveyed his gardens and alterations, returned late at night.[Sidenote: LONDON]

22d February, 1678.Pierce preached at Whitehall, on 2 Thessalonians
iii.6, against our late schismatics, in a rational discourse, but a
little over-sharp, and not at all proper for the auditory there.South preached _coram Rege_, an incomparable
discourse on this text, "A wounded spirit who can bear!"Note: Now was
our Communion table placed altarwise; the church steeple, clock, and
other reparations finished.I showed Don Emmanuel de Lyra (Portugal Ambassador)
and the Count de Castel Mellor, the Repository of the Royal Society, and
the College of Physicians.I went to see new Bedlam Hospital, magnificently
built, and most sweetly placed in Moorfields, since the dreadful fire in
London.I went to Windsor with my Lord Chamberlain (the castle
now repairing with exceeding cost) to see the rare work of Verrio, an
incomparable carving of Gibbons.Returned with my Lord by Hounslow Heath, where we saw
the newly raised army encamped, designed against France, in pretense, at
least; but which gave umbrage to the Parliament.His Majesty and a world
of company were in the field, and the whole army in battalia; a very
glorious sight.Now were brought into service a new sort of soldiers,
called GRENADIERS, who were dexterous in flinging hand grenades,
everyone having a pouch full; they had furred caps with coped crowns
like Janizaries, which made them look very fierce, and some had long
hoods hanging down behind, as we picture fools.Their clothing being
likewise piebald, yellow and red.Came to dine with me my Lord Longford, Treasurer of
Ireland, nephew to that learned gentleman, my Lord Aungier, with whom I
was long since acquainted; also the Lady Stidolph, and other company.The Earl of Ossory came to take his leave of me, going
into Holland to command the English forces.I went to the Tower to try a metal at the
Assay-master's, which only proved sulphur; then saw Monsieur Rotiere,
that excellent graver belonging to the Mint, who emulates even the
ancients, in both metal and stone;[38] he was now molding a horse for
the King's statue, to be cast in silver, of a yard high.[Footnote 38: Doubtless Philip Rotiere, who introduced the figure of
    Britannia into the coinage, taking for his model the King's
    favorite, Frances Stewart, Duchess of Richmond.]Elias Ashmole's library and curiosities,
at Lambeth.He had divers MSS., but most of them astrological, to which
study he is addicted, though I believe not learned, but very
industrious, as his History of the order of the Garter proves.He showed
me a toad included in amber.The prospect from a turret is very fine, it
being so near London, and yet not discovering any house about the
country.The famous John Tradescant bequeathed his Repository to this
gentleman, who has given them to the University of Oxford, and erected a
lecture on them, over the laboratory, in imitation of the Royal Society.Godolphin was made master of the robes to the King.There was sent me L70; from whom I knew not, to be by
me distributed among poor people; I afterward found it was from that
dear friend (Mrs.Godolphin), who had frequently given me large sums to
bestow on charities.I went to Lady Mordaunt, who put L100 into my hand to
dispose of for pious uses, relief of prisoners, poor, etc.Many a sum
had she sent me on similar occasions; a blessed creature she was, and
one that loved and feared God exemplarily.[Sidenote: WEYBRIDGE]

23d August, 1678.Upon Sir Robert Reading's importunity, I went to visit
the Duke of Norfolk, at his new palace at Weybridge, where he has laid
out in building near L10,000, on a copyhold, and in a miserable, barren,
sandy place by the street side; never in my life had I seen such expense
to so small purpose.The rooms are wainscotted, and some of them richly
pargeted with cedar, yew, cypress, etc.There are some good pictures,
especially that incomparable painting of Holbein's, where the Duke of
Norfolk, Charles Brandon and Henry VIII., are dancing with the three
ladies, with most amorous countenances, and sprightly motion exquisitely
expressed.It is a thousand pities (as I told my Lord of Arundel, his
son), that that jewel should be given away.Alban's house, at
Byfleet, an old, large building.Thence, to the papermills, where I
found them making a coarse white paper.They cull the rags which are
linen for white paper, woolen for brown; then they stamp them in troughs
to a pap, with pestles, or hammers, like the powder mills, then put it
into a vessel of water, in which they dip a frame closely wired with
wire as small as a hair and as close as a weaver's reed; on this they
take up the pap, the superfluous water draining through the wire; this
they dexterously turning, shake out like a pancake on a smooth board
between two pieces of flannel, then press it between a great press, the
flannel sucking out the moisture; then, taking it out, they ply and dry
it on strings, as they dry linen in the laundry; then dip it in alum
water, lastly, polish and make it up in quires.They put some gum in the
water in which they macerate the rags.The mark we find on the sheets is
formed in the wire.Sheldon (nephew to
the late Archbishop of Canterbury), and his pretty melancholy garden; I
took notice of the largest _arbor thuyris_ I had ever seen.The place is
finely watered, and there are many curiosities of India, shown in the
house.There was at Weybridge the Duchess of Norfolk, Lord Thomas Howard (a
worthy and virtuous gentleman, with whom my son was sometime bred in
Arundel House), who was newly come from Rome, where he had been some
time; also one of the Duke's daughters, by his first lady.My Lord
leading me about the house made no scruple of showing me all the hiding
places for the Popish priests, and where they said mass, for he was no
bigoted <DW7>.He told me he never trusted them with any secret, and
used Protestants only in all businesses of importance.I went this evening with my Lord Duke to Windsor, where was a
magnificent Court, it being the first time of his Majesty's removing
thither since it was repaired.I took leave of the Duke, and dined at Mr.Henry
Bruncker's, at the Abbey of Sheene, formerly a monastery of Carthusians,
there yet remaining one of their solitary cells with a cross.Within
this ample inclosure are several pretty villas and fine gardens of the
most excellent fruits, especially Sir William Temple's (lately
Ambassador into Holland), and the Lord Lisle's, son to the Earl of
Leicester, who has divers rare pictures, above all, that of Sir Brian
Tuke's, by Holbein.After dinner I walked to Ham, to see the house and garden of the Duke of
Lauderdale, which is indeed inferior to few of the best villas in Italy
itself; the house furnished like a great Prince's; the parterres,
flower-gardens, orangeries, groves, avenues, courts, statues,
perspectives, fountains, aviaries, and all this at the banks of the
sweetest river in the world, must needs be admirable.Hence, I went to my worthy friend, Sir Henry Capel [at Kew], brother to
the Earl of Essex; it is an old timber-house; but his garden has the
choicest fruit of any plantation in England, as he is the most
industrious and understanding in it.I was called to London to wait upon the Duke of
Norfolk, who having at my sole request bestowed the Arundelian Library
on the Royal Society; sent to me to take charge of the books, and remove
them, only stipulating that I would suffer the Herald's chief officer,
Sir William Dugdale, to have such of them as concerned heraldry and the
marshal's office, books of armory and genealogies, the Duke being Earl
Marshal of England.I procured for our Society, besides printed books,
near one hundred MSS.The printed
books being of the oldest impressions, are not the less valuable; I
esteem them almost equal to MSS.Among them, are most of the Fathers,
printed at Basil, before the Jesuits abused them with their expurgatory
Indexes; there is a noble MS.Many of these books had been
presented by Popes, Cardinals, and great persons, to the Earls of
Arundel and Dukes of Norfolk; and the late magnificent Earl of Arundel
bought a noble library in Germany, which is in this collection.I should
not, for the honor I bear the family, have persuaded the Duke to part
with these, had I not seen how negligent he was of them, suffering the
priests and everybody to carry away and dispose of what they pleased; so
that abundance of rare things are irrecoverably gone.Having taken order here, I went to the Royal Society to give them an
account of what I had procured, that they might call a Council and
appoint a day to wait on the Duke to thank him for this munificent gift.[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d September, 1678.I went to London, to dine with Mrs.Godolphin, and
found her in labor; she was brought to bed of a son, who was baptized in
the chamber, by the name of Francis, the susceptors being Sir William
Godolphin (head of the family), Mr.John Hervey, Treasurer to the Queen,
and Mrs.Boscawen, sister to Sir William and the father.While I was at church came a letter from Mr.Godolphin, that my dear friend his lady was exceedingly ill, and
desiring my prayers and assistance.My wife and I took boat immediately,
and went to Whitehall, where, to my inexpressible sorrow, I found she
had been attacked with a new fever, then reigning this excessive hot
autumn, and which was so violent, that it was not thought she could last
many hours.She died in the 26th year of her age, to the
inexpressible affliction of her dear husband, and all her relations, but
of none in the world more than of myself, who lost the most excellent
and inestimable friend that ever lived.Never was a more virtuous and
inviolable friendship; never a more religious, discreet, and admirable
creature, beloved of all, admired of all, for all possible perfections
of her sex.She is gone to receive the reward of her signal charity, and
all other her Christian graces, too blessed a creature to converse with
mortals, fitted as she was, by a most holy life, to be received into the
mansions above.She was for wit, beauty, good nature, fidelity,
discretion, and all accomplishments, the most incomparable person.How
shall I ever repay the obligations to her for the infinite good offices
she did my soul by so often engaging me to make religion the terms and
tie of the friendship there was between us!She was the best wife, the
best mistress, the best friend, that ever husband had.But it is not
here that I pretend to give her character, HAVING DESIGNED TO CONSECRATE
HER WORTHY LIFE TO POSTERITY.Her husband, struck with unspeakable affliction, fell down as dead.The
King himself, and all the Court, expressed their sorrow.To the poor and
miserable, her loss was irreparable; for there was no degree but had
some obligation to her memory.So careful and provident was she to be
prepared for all possible accidents, that (as if she foresaw her end)
she received the heavenly viaticum but the Sunday before, after a most
solemn recollection.She put all her domestic concerns into the exactest
order, and left a letter directed to her husband, to be opened in case
she died in childbed, in which with the most pathetic and endearing
expressions of the most loyal and virtuous wife, she begs his kindness
to her memory might be continued by his care and esteem of those she
left behind, even to her domestic servants, to the meanest of which she
left considerable legacies, as well as to the poor.It was now seven
years since she was maid of honor to the Queen, that she regarded me as
a father, a brother, and what is more, a friend.We often prayed,
visited the sick and miserable, received, read, discoursed, and
communicated in all holy offices together.She was most dear to my wife,
and affectionate to my children.This only is my
comfort, that she is happy in Christ, and I shall shortly behold her
again.She desired to be buried in the dormitory of his family, near
three hundred miles from all her other friends.So afflicted was her
husband at this severe loss, that the entire care of her funeral was
committed to me.Having closed the eyes, and dropped a tear upon the
cheek of my dear departed friend, lovely even in death, I caused her
corpse to be embalmed and wrapped in lead, a plate of brass soldered
thereon, with an inscription, and other circumstances due to her worth,
with as much diligence and care as my grieved heart would permit me; I
then retired home for two days, which were spent in solitude and sad
reflection.She was, accordingly, carried to Godolphin, in
Cornwall, in a hearse with six horses, attended by two coaches of as
many, with about thirty of her relations and servants.There accompanied
the hearse her husband's brother, Sir William, two more of his brothers,
and three sisters; her husband was so overcome with grief, that he was
wholly unfit to travel so long a journey, till he was more composed.I
went as far as Hounslow with a sad heart; but was obliged to return upon
some indispensable affairs.The corpse was ordered to be taken out of
the hearse every night, and decently placed in the house, with tapers
about it, and her servants attending, to Cornwall; and then was
honorably interred in the parish church of Godolphin.This funeral cost
not much less than L1,000.Godolphin, I looked over and sorted his lady's papers, most of
which consisted of Prayers, Meditations, Sermon-notes, Discourses, and
Collections on several religious subjects, and many of her own happy
composing, and so pertinently digested, as if she had been all her life
a student in divinity.We found a diary of her solemn resolutions,
tending to practical virtue, with letters from select friends, all put
into exact method.It astonished us to see what she had read and
written, her youth considered.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st October, 1678.The Parliament and the whole Nation were alarmed
about a conspiracy of some eminent <DW7>s for the destruction of the
King and introduction of Popery, discovered by one Oates and Dr.Tongue,[39] WHICH LAST I KNEW, BEING THE TRANSLATOR OF THE "Jesuits'
Morals"; I went to see and converse with him at Whitehall, with Mr.Oates, one that was lately an apostate to the church of Rome, and now
returned again with this discovery.He seemed to be a bold man, and, in
my thoughts, furiously indiscreet; but everybody believed what he said;
and it quite changed the genius and motions of the Parliament, growing
now corrupt and interested with long sitting and court practices; but,
with all this, Popery would not go down.This discovery turned them all
as one man against it, and nothing was done but to find out the depth of
this.Oates was encouraged, and everything he affirmed taken for gospel;
the truth is, the Roman Catholics were exceedingly bold and busy
everywhere, since the Duke forbore to go any longer to the chapel.[Footnote 39: Ezrael Tonge was bred in University College, Oxford,
    and being puritanically inclined, quitted the University; but in
    1648 returned, and was made a Fellow.He had the living of Pluckley,
    in Kent, which he resigned in consequence of quarrels with his
    parishioners and Quakers.In 1657, he was made fellow of the
    newly-erected College at Durham, and that being dissolved in 1660,
    he taught school at Islington.He then went with Colonel Edward
    Harley to Dunkirk, and subsequently took a small living in
    Herefordshire (Lentwardine); but quitted it for St.Mary Stayning,
    in London, which, after the fire in 1666, was united to St.These he held till his death, in 1680.He was a great
    opponent of the Roman Catholics.Wood mentions several publications
    of his, among which are, "The Jesuits Unmasked," 1678; "Jesuitical
    Aphorisms," 1678; and "The Jesuits' Morals," 1680 (1670); the two
    latter translated from the French.(Wood's "_Athenae, Oxon._" vol.Evelyn speaks of the last of these translations as
    having been executed by his desire: and it figures in a notable
    passage of Oates's testimony.Oates said, for example, "that Thomas
    Whitbread, a priest, on 13th of June, 16.did tell the rector of
    St.Omer's that a Minister of the Church of England had scandalously
    put out the 'Jesuits' Morals' in English, and had endeavored to
    render them odious, and had asked the Rector whether he thought
    Oates might know him?and the Rector called, the deponent, who heard
    these words as he stood at the chamber door, and when he went into
    the chamber of the Provincial, he asked him 'If he knew the author
    of the "Jesuits' Morals?"'deponent answered, 'His person, but not
    his name.'Whitbread then demanded, whether he would undertake to
    poison, or assassinate the author; which deponent undertook, having
    L50 reward promised him, and appointed to return to England."]Godolphin requested me to continue the trust his
wife had reposed in me, in behalf of his little son, conjuring me to
transfer the friendship I had for his dear wife, on him and his.The murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, found
strangled about this time, as was manifest, by the <DW7>s, he being the
Justice of the Peace, and one who knew much of their practices, as
conversant with Coleman (a servant of the... now accused), put the
whole nation into a new ferment against them.Being the 58th of my age, required my humble
addresses to Almighty God, and that he would take off his heavy hand,
still on my family; and restore comforts to us after the death of my
excellent friend.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1678.Tillotson preached before the Commons at St.He said the <DW7>s were now arrived at that impudence, as
to deny that there ever was any such as the gunpowder-conspiracy; but he
affirmed that he himself had several letters written by Sir Everard
Digby (one of the traitors), in which he gloried that he was to suffer
for it; and that it was so contrived, that of the <DW7>s not above two
or three should have been blown up, and they, such as were not worth
saving.I never saw the Court more
brave, nor the nation in more apprehension and consternation.Coleman
and one Staly had now been tried, condemned, and executed.On this,
Oates grew so presumptuous as to accuse the Queen of intending to poison
the King; which certainly that pious and virtuous lady abhorred the
thoughts of, and Oates's circumstances made it utterly unlikely in my
opinion.He probably thought to gratify some who would have been glad
his Majesty should have married a fruitful lady; but the King was too
kind a husband to let any of these make impression on him.However,
divers of the Popish peers were sent to the Tower, accused by Oates; and
all the Roman Catholic lords were by a new Act forever excluded the
Parliament; which was a mighty blow.The King's, Queen's, and Duke's
servants, were banished, and a test to be taken by everybody who
pretended to enjoy any office of public trust, and who would not be
suspected of Popery.I went with Sir William Godolphin, a member of the
Commons' House, to the Bishop of Ely (Dr.Peter Gunning), to be resolved
whether masses were idolatry, as the text expressed it, which was so
worded, that several good Protestants scrupled, and Sir William, though
a learned man and excellent divine himself, had some doubts about it.The Bishop's opinion was that he might take it, though he wished it had
been otherwise worded in the text.I went with my Lady Sunderland to Chelsa, and
dined with the Countess of Bristol [her mother] in the great house,
formerly the Duke of Buckingham's, a spacious and excellent place for
the extent of ground and situation in a good air.The house is large but
ill-contrived, though my Lord of Bristol, who purchased it after he sold
Wimbledon to my Lord Treasurer, expended much money on it.There were
divers pictures of Titian and Vandyke, and some of Bassano, very
excellent, especially an Adonis and Venus, a Duke of Venice, a butcher
in his shambles selling meat to a Swiss; and of Vandyke, my Lord of
Bristol's picture, with the Earl of Bedford's at length, in the same
table.There was in the garden a rare collection of orange trees, of
which she was pleased to bestow some upon me.Houblon's, a French merchant, who had his house furnished _en Prince_,
and gave us a splendid entertainment.The Long Parliament, which had sat ever since the
Restoration, was dissolved by persuasion of the Lord Treasurer, though
divers of them were believed to be his pensioner.At this, all the
politicians were at a stand, they being very eager in pursuit of the
late plot of the <DW7>s.Cudworth preached before the King at Whitehall,
on 2 Timothy iii.5, reckoning up the perils of the last times, in
which, among other wickedness, treasons should be one of the greatest,
applying it to the occasion, as committed under a form of reformation
and godliness; concluding that the prophecy did intend more particularly
the present age, as one of the last times; the sins there enumerated,
more abundantly reigning than ever.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d February, 1679.Durell, Dean of Windsor, preached to the
household at Whitehall, on 1 Cor.22; he read the whole sermon out
of his notes, which I had never before seen a Frenchman do, he being of
Jersey, and bred at Paris.Pierce, Dean of Salisbury, preached on 1 John,
iv.1, "Try the Spirits, there being so many delusory ones gone forth of
late into the world"; he inveighed against the pernicious doctrines of
Mr.My brother Evelyn, was now chosen Knight for the County of Surrey,
carrying it against my Lord Longford and Sir Adam Brown, of Bechworth
Castle.The country coming in to give him their suffrages were so many,
that I believe they ate and drank him out near L2,000, by a most
abominable custom.Godolphin, was now made one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury, and of the Privy Council.The Bishop of Gloucester preached in a manner very like
Bishop Andrews, full of divisions, and scholastical, and that with much
quickness.Our vicar preached exceedingly well on 1
Cor.The Holy Communion followed, at which I and my daughter, Mary
(now about fourteen years old), received for the first time.The Lord
Jesus continue his grace unto her, and improve this blessed beginning!The Duke of York, voted against by the Commons for his
recusancy, went over to Flanders; which made much discourse.Pepys in the Tower, he having been
committed by the House of Commons for misdemeanors in the Admiralty when
he was secretary; I believe he was unjustly charged.Here I saluted my
Lords Stafford and Petre, who were committed for the Popish plot.I saw the magnificent cavalcade and entry of the
Portugal Ambassador.I was godfather to a son of Sir Christopher Wren,
surveyor of his Majesty's buildings, that most excellent and learned
person, with Sir William Fermor, and my Lady Viscountess Newport, wife
of the Treasurer of the Household.Thence to Chelsea, to Sir Stephen Fox, and my lady, in order to the
purchase of the Countess of Bristol's house there, which she desired me
to procure a chapman for.I dined at Sir Robert Clayton's with Sir Robert Viner,
the great banker.There were now divers Jesuits executed about the plot,
and a rebellion in Scotland of the fanatics, so that there was a sad
prospect of public affairs.The new Commissioners of the Admiralty came to visit
me, viz, Sir Henry Capell, brother to the Earl of Essex, Mr.Finch,
eldest son to the Lord Chancellor, Sir Humphry Winch, Sir Thomas Meeres,
Mr.Hales, with some of the Commissioners of the Navy.I dined at Sir William Godolphin's, and with that
learned gentleman went to take the air in Hyde Park, where was a
glorious _cortege_.Sending a piece of venison to Mr.Pepys, still a
prisoner, I went and dined with him.Now were there papers, speeches, and libels, publicly
cried in the streets against the Dukes of York and Lauderdale, etc.,
obnoxious to the Parliament, with too much and indeed too shameful a
liberty; but the people and Parliament had gotten head by reason of the
vices of the great ones.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was now brought up to London a child, son of one Mr.Wotton,
formerly amanuensis to Dr.Andrews, Bishop of Winton, who both read and
perfectly understood Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Syriac, and most of
the modern languages; disputed in divinity, law, and all the sciences;
was skillful in history, both ecclesiastical and profane; in politics;
in a word, so universally and solidly learned at eleven years of age,
that he was looked on as a miracle.Lloyd, one of the most deeply
learned divines of this nation in all sorts of literature, with Dr.Burnet, who had severely examined him, came away astonished, and they
told me they did not believe there had the like appeared in the world.He had only been instructed by his father, who being himself a learned
person, confessed that his son knew all that he himself knew.But, what
was more admirable than his vast memory, was his judgment and invention,
he being tried with divers hard questions, which required maturity of
thought and experience.He was also dexterous in chronology,
antiquities, mathematics.In sum, an _intellectus universalis_, beyond
all that we read of Picus Mirandula, and other precocious wits, and yet
withal a very humble child.I went to see how things stood at Parson's Green, my
Lady Viscountess Mordaunt (now sick in Paris, whither she went for
health) having made me a trustee for her children, an office I could not
refuse to this most excellent, pious, and virtuous lady, my long
acquaintance.Sidney Godolphin, now one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury.I went early to the Old Bailey Sessions House, to the
famous trial of Sir George Wakeman, one of the Queen's physicians, and
three Benedictine monks; the first (whom I was well acquainted with, and
take to be a worthy gentleman abhorring such a fact), for intending to
poison the King; the others as accomplices to carry on the plot, to
subvert the government, and introduce Popery.The bench was crowded with
the judges, Lord Mayor justices, and innumerable spectators.Oates (as he called himself), and one Bedlow, a man of
inferior note.Their testimonies were not so pregnant, and I fear much
of it from hearsay, but swearing positively to some particulars, which
drew suspicion upon their truth; nor did circumstances so agree, as to
give either the bench or jury so entire satisfaction as was expected.After, therefore, a long and tedious trial of nine hours, the jury
brought them in not guilty, to the extraordinary triumph of the <DW7>s,
and without sufficient disadvantage and reflections on witnesses,
especially Oates and Bedlow.This was a happy day for the lords in the Tower, who, expecting their
trial, had this gone against the prisoners at the bar, would all have
been in the utmost hazard.For my part, I look on Oates as a vain,
insolent man, puffed up with the favor of the Commons for having
discovered something really true, more especially as detecting the
dangerous intrigue of Coleman, proved out of his own letters, and of a
general design which the Jesuited party of the <DW7>s ever had and
still have, to ruin the Church of England; but that he was trusted with
those great secrets he pretended, or had any solid ground for what he
accused divers noblemen of, I have many reasons to induce my contrary
belief.That among so many commissions as he affirmed to have delivered
to them from P. Oliva[40] and the Pope,--he who made no scruple of
opening all other papers, letters, and secrets, should not only not open
any of those pretended commissions, but not so much as take any copy or
witness of any one of them, is almost miraculous.But the Commons (some
leading persons I mean of them) had so exalted him that they took all he
said for Gospel, and without more ado ruined all whom he named to be
conspirators; nor did he spare whoever came in his way.But, indeed, the
murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, suspected to have been compassed by
the Jesuits' party for his intimacy with Coleman (a busy person whom I
also knew), and the fear they had that he was able to have discovered
things to their prejudice, did so exasperate not only the Commons, but
all the nation, that much of these sharpnesses against the more honest
Roman Catholics who lived peaceably, is to be imputed to that horrid
fact.[Footnote 40: Padre Oliva, General of the Order of Jesuits.]The sessions ended, I dined or rather supped (so late it was) with the
judges in the large room annexed to the place, and so returned home.Though it was not my custom or delight to be often present at any
capital trials, we having them commonly so exactly published by those
who take them in short-hand, yet I was inclined to be at this signal
one, that by the ocular view of the carriages and other circumstances of
the managers and parties concerned, I might inform myself, and regulate
my opinion of a cause that had so alarmed the whole nation.Dined at Clapham, at Sir D. Gauden's; went thence with
him to Windsor, to assist him in a business with his Majesty.I lay that
night at Eton College, the Provost's lodgings (Dr.Craddock), where I
was courteously entertained.[Sidenote: LONDON]

23d July, 1679.To Court: after dinner, I visited that excellent
painter, Verrio, whose works in _fresco_ in the King's palace, at
Windsor, will celebrate his name as long as those walls last.He showed
us his pretty garden, choice flowers, and curiosities, he himself being
a skillful gardener.I went to Clifden, that stupendous natural rock, wood, and prospect, of
the Duke of Buckingham's, and buildings of extraordinary expense.The
grots in the chalky rocks are pretty: it is a romantic object, and the
place altogether answers the most poetical description that can be made
of solitude, precipice, prospect, or whatever can contribute to a thing
so very like their imaginations.The stand, somewhat like Frascati as to
its front, and on the platform is a circular view to the utmost verge of
the horizon, which, with the serpenting of the Thames, is admirable.The
staircase is for its materials singular; the cloisters, descents,
gardens, and avenue through the wood, august and stately; but the land
all about wretchedly barren, and producing nothing but fern.Indeed, as
I told his Majesty that evening (asking me how I liked Clifden) without
flattery, that it did not please me so well as Windsor for the prospect
and park, which is without compare; there being but one only opening,
and that narrow, which led one to any variety; whereas that of Windsor
is everywhere great and unconfined.Returning, I called at my cousin Evelyn's, who has a very pretty seat in
the forest, two miles by hither Clifden, on a flat, with gardens
exquisitely kept, though large, and the house a staunch good old
building, and what was singular, some of the rooms floored dove
tail-wise without a nail, exactly close.One of the closets is pargeted
with plain deal, set in diamond, exceeding staunch and pretty.Dined at the Sheriff's, when, the Company of Drapers
and their wives being invited, there was a sumptuous entertainment,
according to the forms of the city, with music, etc., comparable to any
prince's service in Europe.I went this morning to show my Lord Chamberlain, his
Lady, and the Duchess of Grafton, the incomparable work of Mr.Gibbon,
the carver, whom I first recommended to his Majesty, his house being
furnished like a cabinet, not only with his own work, but divers
excellent paintings of the best hands.Thence, to Sir Stephen Fox's,
where we spent the day.After evening service, to see a neighbor, one Mr.Bohun, related to my son's late tutor of that name, a rich Spanish
merchant, living in a neat place, which he has adorned with many
curiosities, especially several carvings of Mr.Gibbons, and some
pictures by Streeter.To Windsor, to congratulate his Majesty on his
recovery; I kissed the Duke's hand, now lately returned from
Flanders[41] to visit his brother the King, on which there were various
bold and foolish discourses, the Duke of Monmouth being sent away.[Footnote 41: He returned the day before, the 12th of September.This is another of the indications that the entries of this Diary
    were not always made on the precise days they refer to.]My Lord Sunderland, one of the principal
Secretaries of State, invited me to dinner, where was the King's natural
son, the Earl of Plymouth, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Earl of Essex, Earl
of Mulgrave, Mr.After dinner I went to prayers
at Eton, and visited Mr.Henry Godolphin, fellow there, and Dr.Slingsby and Signor Verrio came to dine with
me, to whom I gave China oranges off my own trees, as good, I think, as
were ever eaten.Dined at my Lord Chamberlain's, the King being now
newly returned from his Newmarket recreations.Dined at the Lord Mayor's; and, in the evening, went
to the funeral of my pious, dear, and ancient learned friend, Dr.Jasper
Needham, who was buried at St.He was a true and holy
Christian, and one who loved me with great affection.Dove preached
with an eulogy due to his memory.I lost in this person one of my
dearest remaining sincere friends.I was invited to dine at my Lord Teviotdale's, a
Scotch Earl, a learned and knowing nobleman.Montague's new palace near Bloomsbury, built by our curator, Mr.Hooke, somewhat after the French; it was most nobly furnished, and a
fine, but too much exposed garden.[42]

    [Footnote 42: Now the British Museum.][Sidenote: LONDON]

6th November, 1679.Dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, and was this
evening at the remarriage of the Duchess of Grafton to the Duke (his
Majesty's natural son), she being now twelve years old.The ceremony was
performed in my Lord Chamberlain's (her father's) lodgings at Whitehall
by the Bishop of Rochester, his Majesty being present.A sudden and
unexpected thing, when everybody believed the first marriage would have
come to nothing; but, the measure being determined, I was privately
invited by my Lady, her mother, to be present.I confess I could give
her little joy, and so I plainly told her, but she said the King would
have it so, and there was no going back.This sweetest, most hopeful,
most beautiful, child, and most virtuous, too, was sacrificed to a boy
that had been rudely bred, without anything to encourage them but his
Majesty's pleasure.I pray God the sweet child find it to her advantage,
who, if my augury deceive me not, will in a few years be such a paragon
as were fit to make the wife of the greatest Prince in Europe!I staid
supper, where his Majesty sat between the Duchess of Cleveland (the
mother of the Duke of Grafton) and the sweet Duchess the bride; there
were several great persons and ladies, without pomp.My love to my Lord
Arlington's family, and the sweet child made me behold all this with
regret, though as the Duke of Grafton affects the sea, to which I find
his father intends to use him, he may emerge a plain, useful and robust
officer: and were he polished, a tolerable person; for he is exceedingly
handsome, by far surpassing any of the King's other natural issue.At Sir Stephen Fox's, and was agreeing for the
Countess of Bristol's house at Chelsea, within L500.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, being desired by the
Countess of Sunderland to carry her thither on a solemn day, that she
might see the pomp and ceremony of this Prince of Citizens, there never
having been any, who for the stateliness of his palace, prodigious
feasting, and magnificence, exceeded him.This Lord Mayor's acquaintance
had been from the time of his being apprentice to one Mr.Abbot, his
uncle, who being a scrivener, and an honest worthy man, one who was
condemned to die at the beginning of the troubles forty years past, as
concerned in the commission of array for King Charles I. had escaped
with his life; I often used his assistance in money matters.Robert
Clayton, then a boy, his nephew, became, after his uncle Abbot's death,
so prodigiously rich and opulent, that he was reckoned one of the
wealthiest citizens.He married a free-hearted woman, who became his
hospitable disposition; and having no children, with the accession of
his partner and fellow apprentice, who also left him his estate, he grew
excessively rich.He was a discreet magistrate, and though envied, I
think without much cause.Some believed him guilty of hard dealing,
especially with the Duke of Buckingham, much of whose estate he had
swallowed, but I never saw any ill by him, considering the trade he was
of.The reputation and known integrity of his uncle, Abbot, brought all
the royal party to him, by which he got not only great credit, but vast
wealth, so as he passed this office with infinite magnificence and
honor.Slingsby, Master of the Mint, with
my wife, invited to hear music, which was exquisitely performed by four
of the most renowned masters: Du Prue, a Frenchman, on the lute; Signor
Bartholomeo, an Italian, on the harpsichord; Nicholao on the violin;
but, above all, for its sweetness and novelty, the _viol d'amore_ of
five wire strings played on with a bow, being but an ordinary violin,
played on lyre-way, by a German.There was also a _flute douce_, now in
much request for accompanying the voice.Slingsby, whose son and
daughter played skillfully, had these meetings frequently in his house.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, to accompany my
worthiest and generous friend, the Earl of Ossory; it was on a Friday, a
private day, but the feast and entertainment might have become a King.Such an hospitable costume and splendid magistrature does no city in the
world show, as I believe.Allestree preached before the household on St.20, before the King, showing with
how little reason the <DW7>s applied those words of our blessed Savior
to maintain the pretended infallibility they boast of.I never heard a
more Christian and excellent discourse; yet were some offended that he
seemed to say the Church of Rome was a true church; but it was a
captious mistake; for he never affirmed anything that could be more to
their reproach, and that such was the present Church of Rome, showing
how much it had erred.There was not in this sermon so much as a shadow
for censure, no person of all the clergy having testified greater zeal
against the errors of the <DW7>s than this pious and most learned
person.I dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, and then went to St.Paul's to hear that great wit, Dr.His talent was a great memory,
never making use of notes, a readiness of expression in a most pure and
plain style of words, full of matter, easily delivered.I met the Earl of Clarendon with the rest of my
fellow executors of the Will of my late Lady Viscountess Mordaunt,
namely, Mr.Laurence Hyde, one of the Commissioners of the Treasury, and
lately Plenipotentiary-Ambassador at Nimeguen; Andrew Newport; and Sir
Charles Wheeler; to examine and audit and dispose of this year's account
of the estate of this excellent Lady, according to the direction of her
Will.I went to see Sir John Stonehouse, with whom I was
treating a marriage between my son and his daughter-in-law.Came over the Duke of Monmouth from Holland
unexpectedly to his Majesty; while the Duke of York was on his journey
to Scotland, whither the King sent him to reside and govern.The bells
and bonfires of the city at this arrival of the Duke of Monmouth
publishing their joy, to the no small regret of some at Court.This
Duke, whom for distinction they called the Protestant Duke (though the
son of an abandoned woman), the people made their idol.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th December, 1679.I dined, together with Lord Ossory and the Earl of
Chesterfield, at the Portugal Ambassador's, now newly come, at Cleveland
House, a noble palace, too good for that infamous.... The staircase is
sumptuous, and the gallery and garden; but, above all, the costly
furniture belonging to the Ambassador, especially the rich Japan
cabinets, of which I think there were a dozen.There was a billiard
table, with as many more hazards as ours commonly have; the game being
only to prosecute the ball till hazarded, without passing the port, or
touching the pin; if one miss hitting the ball every time, the game is
lost, or if hazarded.It is more difficult to hazard a ball, though so
many, than in our table, by reason the bound is made so exactly even,
and the edges not stuffed; the balls are also bigger, and they for the
most part use the sharp and small end of the billiard stick, which is
shod with brass, or silver.The entertainment was exceedingly civil;
but, besides a good olio, the dishes were trifling, hashed and condited
after their way, not at all fit for an English stomach, which is for
solid meat.There was yet good fowls, but roasted to coal, nor were the
sweetmeats good.I went to meet Sir John Stonehouse, and give him a
particular of the settlement on my son, who now made his addresses to
the young lady his daughter-in-law, daughter of Lady Stonehouse.Cave, author of "Primitive Christianity,"
etc., a pious and learned man, preached at Whitehall to the household,
on James iii.17, concerning the duty of grace and charity.I supped with Sir Stephen Fox, now made one of the
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.The writings for the settling jointure and other
contracts of marriage of my son were finished and sealed.The lady was
to bring L5,000, in consideration of a settlement of L500 a year present
maintenance, which was likewise to be her jointure, and L500 a year
after mine and my wife's decease.But, with God's blessing, it will be
at the least L1,000 a year more in a few years.I pray God make him
worthy of it, and a comfort to his excellent mother, who deserves much
from him!Martha
Spencer, daughter to my Lady Stonehouse by a former gentleman, at St.Andrew's, Holborn, by our Vicar, borrowing the church of Dr.We afterward
dined at a house in Holborn; and, after the solemnity and dancing was
done, they were bedded at Sir John Stonehouse's lodgings in Bow Street,
Convent Garden.To the Royal Society, where I met an Irish Bishop
with his Lady, who was daughter to my worthy and pious friend, Dr.Jeremy Taylor, late Bishop of Down and Connor; they came to see the
Repository.She seemed to be a knowing woman, beyond the ordinary talent
of her sex.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, in order to the meeting of
my Lady Beckford, whose daughter (a rich heiress) I had recommended to
my brother of Wotton for his only son, she being the daughter of the
lady by Mr.To London, to receive L3,000 of my daughter-in-law's
portion, which was paid in gold.The Dean of Sarum preached on Jerem.5, an hour
and a half from his common-place book, of kings and great men retiring
to private situations.[Sidenote: CASHIOBURY]

18th April, 1680.On the earnest invitation of the Earl of Essex, I went
with him to his house at Cashiobury, in Hertfordshire.It was on Sunday,
but going early from his house in the square of St.James, we arrived by
ten o'clock; this he thought too late to go to church, and we had
prayers in his chapel.The house is new, a plain fabric, built by my
friend, Mr.There are divers fair and good rooms, and
excellent carving by Gibbons, especially the chimney-piece of the
library.There is in the porch, or entrance, a painting by Verrio, of
Apollo and the Liberal Arts.One room pargeted with yew, which I liked
well.Some of the chimney mantels are of Irish marble, brought by my
Lord from Ireland, when he was Lord-Lieutenant, and not much inferior to
Italian.The tympanum, or gable, at the front is a bass-relievo of Diana
hunting, cut in Portland stone, handsomely enough.I do not approve of
the middle doors being round: but, when the hall is finished as
designed, it being an oval with a cupola, together with the other wing,
it will be a very noble palace.The library is large, and very nobly
furnished, and all the books are richly bound and gilded; but there are
no MSS., except the Parliament Rolls and Journals, the transcribing and
binding of which cost him, as he assured me, L500.No man has been more industrious than this noble Lord in planting about
his seat, adorned with walks, ponds, and other rural elegancies; but the
soil is stony, churlish, and uneven, nor is the water near enough to the
house, though a very swift and clear stream runs within a flight-shot
from it in the valley, which may fitly be called Coldbrook, it being
indeed excessively cold, yet producing fair trouts.It is a pity the
house was not situated to more advantage: but it seems it was built just
where the old one was, which I believe he only meant to repair; this
leads men into irremediable errors, and saves but a little.The land about is exceedingly addicted to wood, but the coldness of the
place hinders the growth.Black cherry trees prosper even to
considerable timber, some being eighty feet long; they make also very
handsome avenues.There is a pretty oval at the end of a fair walk, set
about with treble rows of Spanish chestnut trees.The gardens are very rare, and cannot be otherwise, having so skillful
an artist to govern them as Mr.Cooke, who is, as to the mechanic part,
not ignorant in mathematics, and pretends to astrology.There is an
excellent collection of the choicest fruit.As for my Lord, he is a sober, wise, judicious, and pondering person,
not illiterate beyond the rate of most noblemen in this age, very well
versed in English history and affairs, industrious, frugal, methodical,
and every way accomplished.His Lady (being sister of the late Earl of
Northumberland) is a wise, yet somewhat melancholy woman, setting her
heart too much on the little lady, her daughter, of whom she is over
fond.My Lord was not long since come from his Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland,
where he showed his abilities in administration and government, as well
as prudence in considerably augmenting his estate without reproach.He
had been Ambassador-extraordinary in Denmark, and, in a word, such a
person as became the son of that worthy hero his father to be, the late
Lord Capel, who lost his life for King Charles I.

We spent our time in the mornings in walking, or riding, and contriving
[alterations], and the afternoons in the library, so as I passed my time
for three or four days with much satisfaction.He was pleased in
conversation to impart to me divers particulars of state, relating to
the present times.He being no great friend to the D---- was now laid
aside, his integrity and abilities being not so suitable in this
conjuncture.To a meeting of the executors of late Viscountess
Mordaunt's estate, to consider of the sale of Parson's Green, being in
treaty with Mr.Loftus, and to settle the half year's account.Was a meeting of the feoffees of the poor of our parish.This year I would stand one of the collectors of their rents, to give
example to others.My son was added to the feoffees.This afternoon came to visit me Sir Edward Deering, of Surrendon, in
Kent, one of the Lords of the Treasury, with his daughter, married to my
worthy friend, Sir Robert Southwell, Clerk of the Council, now
Extraordinary-Envoy to the Duke of Brandenburgh, and other Princes in
Germany, as before he had been in Portugal, being a sober, wise, and
virtuous gentleman.Shish, master-shipwright
of his Majesty's Yard here, an honest and remarkable man, and his death
a public loss, for his excellent success in building ships (though
altogether illiterate), and for breeding up so many of his children to
be able artists.I held up the pall with three knights, who did him that
honor, and he was worthy of it.It was the custom of this good man to
rise in the night, and to pray, kneeling in his own coffin, which he had
lying by him for many years.He was born that famous year, the
Gunpowder-plot, 1605.Came to dine with us the Countess of Clarendon, Dr.Lloyd, Dean of Bangor (since Bishop of St.Burnet, author of
the "History of the Reformation," and my old friend, Mr.After
dinner we all went to see the Observatory, and Mr.Flamsted, who showed
us divers rare instruments, especially the great quadrant.[Sidenote: WINDSOR]

24th July, 1680.Went with my wife and daughter to Windsor, to see that
stately court, now near finished.There was erected in the court the
King on horseback, lately cast in copper, and set on a rich pedestal of
white marble, the work of Mr.Gibbons, at the expense of Toby Rustate, a
page of the back stairs, who by his wonderful frugality had arrived to a
great estate in money, and did many works of charity, as well as this of
gratitude to his master, which cost him L1,000.He is very simple,
ignorant, but honest and loyal creature.We all dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, afterward to see Signor
Verrio's garden, thence to Eton College, to salute the provost, and
heard a Latin speech of one of the alumni (it being at the election) and
were invited to supper; but took our leave, and got to London that night
in good time.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th July, 1680.My most noble and illustrious friend, the Earl of
Ossory, espying me this morning after sermon in the privy gallery,
calling to me, told me he was now going his journey (meaning to Tangier,
whither he was designed Governor, and General of the forces, to regain
the losses we had lately sustained from the Moors, when Inchiquin was
Governor).I asked if he would not call at my house (as he always did
whenever he went out of England on any exploit).He said he must embark
at Portsmouth, "wherefore let you and me dine together to-day; I am
quite alone, and have something to impart to you; I am not well, shall
be private, and desire your company."Being retired to his lodgings, and set down on a couch, he sent to his
secretary for the copy of a letter which he had written to Lord
Sunderland (Secretary of State), wishing me to read it; it was to take
notice how ill he resented it, that he should tell the King before Lord
Ossory's face, that Tangier was not to be kept, but would certainly be
lost, and yet added that it was fit Lord Ossory should be sent, that
they might give some account of it to the world, meaning (as supposed)
the next Parliament, when all such miscarriages would probably be
examined; this Lord Ossory took very ill of Lord Sunderland, and not
kindly of the King, who resolving to send him with an incompetent force,
seemed, as his Lordship took it, to be willing to cast him away, not
only on a hazardous adventure, but in most men's opinion, an
impossibility, seeing there was not to be above 300 or 400 horse, and
4,000 foot for the garrison and all, both to defend the town, form a
camp, repulse the enemy, and fortify what ground they should get in.This touched my Lord deeply, that he should be so little considered as
to put him on a business in which he should probably not only lose his
reputation, but be charged with all the miscarriage and ill success;
whereas, at first they promised 6,000 foot and 600 horse effective.My Lord, being an exceedingly brave and valiant person, and who had so
approved himself in divers signal battles, both at sea and land; so
beloved and so esteemed by the people, as one they depended on, upon all
occasions worthy of such a captain;--he looked on this as too great an
indifference in his Majesty, after all his services, and the merits of
his father, the Duke of Ormond, and a design of some who envied his
virtue.It certainly took so deep root in his mind, that he who was the
most void of fear in the world (and assured me he would go to Tangier
with ten men if his Majesty commanded him) could not bear up against
this unkindness.Having disburdened himself of this to me after dinner,
he went with his Majesty to the sheriffs at a great supper in
Fishmongers' Hall; but finding himself ill, took his leave immediately
of his Majesty, and came back to his lodging.Not resting well this
night, he was persuaded to remove to Arlington House, for better
accommodation.His disorder turned to a malignant fever, which
increasing, after all that six of the most able physicians could do, he
became delirious, with intervals of sense, during which Dr.Lloyd (after
Bishop of St.Asaph) administered the Holy Sacrament, of which I also
participated.He died the Friday following, the 30th of July, to the
universal grief of all that knew or heard of his great worth, nor had
any a greater loss than myself.Oft would he say I was the oldest
acquaintance he had in England (when his father was in Ireland), it
being now of about thirty years, contracted abroad, when he rode in the
Academy in Paris, and when we were seldom asunder.His Majesty never lost a worthier subject, nor father a better or more
dutiful son; a loving, generous, good-natured, and perfectly obliging
friend; one who had done innumerable kindnesses to several before they
knew it; nor did he ever advance any that were not worthy; no one more
brave, more modest; none more humble, sober, and every way virtuous.Unhappy England in this illustrious person's loss!Universal was the
mourning for him, and the eulogies on him; I stayed night and day by his
bedside to his last gasp, to close his dear eyes!O sad father, mother,
wife, and children!He deserved all that a sincere
friend, a brave soldier, a virtuous courtier, a loyal subject, an honest
man, a bountiful master, and good Christian, could deserve of his prince
and country.One thing more let me note, that he often expressed to me
the abhorrence he had of that base and unworthy action which he was put
upon, of engaging the Smyrna fleet in time of peace, in which though he
behaved himself like a great captain, yet he told me it was the only
blot in his life, and troubled him exceedingly.Though he was commanded,
and never examined further when he was so, yet he always spoke of it
with regret and detestation.The Countess was at the seat of her
daughter, the Countess of Derby, about 200 miles off.I went to visit a French gentleman, one Monsieur
Chardin, who having been thrice in the East Indies, Persia, and other
remote countries, came hither in our return ships from those parts, and
it being reported that he was a very curious and knowing man, I was
desired by the Royal Society to salute him in their name, and to invite
him to honor them with his company.Sir Joseph Hoskins and Sir
Christopher Wren accompanied me.We found him at his lodgings in his
eastern habit, a very handsome person, extremely affable, a modest,
well-bred man, not inclined to talk wonders.He spoke Latin, and
understood Greek, Arabic, and Persian, from eleven years' travels in
those parts, whither he went in search of jewels, and was become very
rich.After the usual civilities, we
asked some account of the extraordinary things he must have seen in
traveling over land to those places where few, if any, northern
Europeans used to go, as the Black and Caspian Sea, Mingrelia, Bagdad,
Nineveh, Persepolis, etc.He told us that the things most worthy of our
sight would be, the draughts he had caused to be made of some noble
ruins, etc.; for that, besides his own little talent that way, he had
carried two good painters with him, to draw landscapes, measure and
design the remains of the palace which Alexander burned in his frolic at
Persepolis, with divers temples, columns, relievos, and statues, yet
extant, which he affirmed to be sculpture far exceeding anything he had
observed either at Rome, in Greece, or in any other part of the world
where magnificence was in estimation.He said there was an inscription
in letters not intelligible, though entire.He was sorry he could not
gratify the curiosity of the Society at present, his things not being
yet out of the ship; but would wait on them with them on his return from
Paris, whither he was going the next day, but with intention to return
suddenly, and stay longer here, the persecution in France not suffering
Protestants, and he was one, to be quiet.He told us that Nineveh was a vast city, now all buried in her ruins,
the inhabitants building on the subterranean vaults, which were, as
appeared, the first stories of the old city, that there were frequently
found huge vases of fine earth, columns, and other antiquities; that the
straw which the Egyptians required of the Israelites, was not to burn,
or cover the rows of bricks as we use, but being chopped small to mingle
with the clay, which being dried in the sun (for they bake not in the
furnace) would else cleave asunder; that in Persia are yet a race of
Ignicolae, who worship the sun and the fire as Gods; that the women of
Georgia and Mingrelia were universally, and without any compare, the
most beautiful creatures for shape, features, and figure, in the world,
and therefore the Grand Seignor and Bashaws had had from thence most of
their wives and concubines; that there had within these hundred years
been Amazons among them, that is to say, a sort or race of valiant
women, given to war; that Persia was extremely fertile; he spoke also of
Japan and China, and of the many great errors of our late geographers,
as we suggested matter for discourse.We then took our leave, failing of
seeing his papers; but it was told us by others that indeed he dared not
open, or show them, till he had first showed them to the French King;
but of this he himself said nothing.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d September, 1680.I had an opportunity, his Majesty being still at
Windsor, of seeing his private library at Whitehall, at my full ease.I
went with expectation of finding some curiosities, but, though there
were about 1,000 volumes, there were few of importance which I had not
perused before.They consisted chiefly of such books as had from time to
time been dedicated, or presented to him; a few histories, some Travels
and French books, abundance of maps and sea charts, entertainments and
pomps, buildings and pieces relating to the navy, some mathematical
instruments; but what was most rare, were three or four Romish
breviaries, with a great deal of miniature and monkish painting and
gilding, one of which is most exquisitely done, both as to the figures,
grotesques, and compartments, to the utmost of that curious art.There
is another in which I find written by the hand of King Henry VII., his
giving it to his dear daughter, Margaret, afterward Queen of Scots, in
which he desires her to pray for his soul, subscribing his name at
length.There is also the process of the philosophers' great elixir,
represented in divers pieces of excellent miniature, but the discourse
is in high Dutch, a MS.in quarto, of above 300
years old, in French, being an institution of physic, and in the
botanical part the plants are curiously painted in miniature; also a
folio MS.of good thickness, being the several exercises, as Themes,
Orations, Translations, etc., of King Edward VI., all written and
subscribed by his own hand, and with his name very legible, and divers
of the Greek interleaved and corrected after the manner of schoolboys'
exercises, and that exceedingly well and proper; with some epistles to
his preceptor, which show that young prince to have been extraordinarily
advanced in learning, and as Cardan, who had been in England affirmed,
stupendously knowing for his age.There is likewise his journal, no less
testifying his early ripeness and care about the affairs of state.There are besides many pompous volumes, some embossed with gold, and
intaglios on agates, medals, etc.I spent three or four entire days,
locked up, and alone, among these books and curiosities.In the rest of
the private lodgings contiguous to this, are divers of the best pictures
of the great masters, Raphael, Titian, etc., and in my esteem, above
all, the "_Noli me tangere_" of our blessed Savior to Mary Magdalen
after his Resurrection, of Hans Holbein; than which I never saw so much
reverence and kind of heavenly astonishment expressed in a picture.There are also divers curious clocks, watches, and pendules of exquisite
work, and other curiosities.An ancient woman who made these lodgings
clean, and had all the keys, let me in at pleasure for a small reward,
by means of a friend.I dined with Sir Stephen Fox, now one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury.This gentleman came first a poor boy from
the choir of Salisbury, then he was taken notice of by Bishop Duppa, and
afterward waited on my Lord Percy (brother to Algernon, Earl of
Northumberland), who procured for him an inferior place among the clerks
of the kitchen and Greencloth side, where he was found so humble,
diligent, industrious, and prudent in his behavior, that his Majesty
being in exile, and Mr.Fox waiting, both the King and Lords about him
frequently employed him about their affairs, and trusted him both with
receiving and paying the little money they had.Returning with his
Majesty to England, after great want and great sufferings, his Majesty
found him so honest and industrious, and withal so capable and ready,
that, being advanced from clerk of the kitchen to that of the
Greencloth, he procured to be paymaster of the whole army, and by his
dexterity and punctual dealing he obtained such credit among the
bankers, that he was in a short time able to borrow vast sums of them
upon any exigence.The continual turning thus of money, and the
soldiers' moderate allowance to him for keeping touch with them, did so
enrich him, that he is believed to be worth at least L200,000, honestly
got and unenvied; which is next to a miracle.With all this he continues
as humble and ready to do a courtesy as ever he was.He is generous, and lives very honorably, of a sweet nature,
well-spoken, well-bred, and is so highly in his Majesty's esteem, and so
useful, that being long since made a knight, he is also advanced to be
one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and has the reversion of
the Cofferer's place after Harry Brouncker.He has married his eldest
daughter to my Lord Cornwallis, and gave her L12,000, and restored that
entangled family besides.Trollop, who brings
with her (besides a great sum) near, if not altogether, L2,000 per
annum.Sir Stephen's lady (an excellent woman) is sister to Mr.Whittle,
one of the King's chirurgeons.In a word, never was man more fortunate
than Sir Stephen; he is a handsome person, virtuous, and very religious.Came to my house some German strangers and Signor
Pietro, a famous musician, who had been long in Sweden in Queen
Christina's Court; he sung admirably to a guitar, and had a perfect good
tenor and bass, and had set to Italian composure many of Abraham
Cowley's pieces which showed extremely well.He told me that in Sweden
the heat in some part of summer was as excessive as the cold in winter;
so cold, he affirmed, that the streets of all the towns are desolate, no
creatures stirring in them for many months, all the inhabitants retiring
to their stoves.He spoke high things of that romantic Queen's learning
and skill in languages, the majesty of her behavior, her exceeding wit,
and that the histories she had read of other countries, especially of
Italy and Rome, had made her despise her own.That the real occasion of
her resigning her crown was the nobleman's importuning her to marry, and
the promise which the Pope had made her of procuring her to be Queen of
Naples, which also caused her to change her religion; but she was
cheated by his crafty Holiness,[43] working on her ambition; that the
reason of her killing her secretary at Fontainebleau, was, his revealing
that intrigue with the Pope.But, after all this, I rather believe it
was her mad prodigality and extreme vanity, which had consumed those
vast treasures the great Adolphus, her father, had brought out of
Germany during his [campaigns] there and wonderful successes; and that,
if she had not voluntarily resigned, as foreseeing the event, the
Estates of her kingdom would have compelled her to do so.[Footnote 43: Pope Alexander VII., of the family of Chighi, at
    Sienna.][Sidenote: LONDON]

30th October, 1680.I went to London to be private, my birthday being
the next day, and I now arrived at my sixtieth year; on which I began a
more solemn survey of my whole life, in order to the making and
confirming my peace with God, by an accurate scrutiny of all my actions
past, as far as I was able to call them to mind.How difficult and
uncertain, yet how necessary a work!The Lord be merciful to me, and
accept me!Teach me, therefore, so to
number my days, that I may apply my heart unto wisdom, and make my
calling and election sure.A stranger
preached at Whitehall[44] on Luke xvi.15; the
Holy Communion followed, at which I participated, humbly imploring God's
assistance in the great work I was entering into.Margaret's, on Acts xvii.[Footnote 44: Probably to the King's household, very early in the
    morning, as the custom was.]I began and spent the whole week in examining my life, begging pardon
for my faults, assistance and blessing for the future, that I might, in
some sort, be prepared for the time that now drew near, and not have the
great work to begin, when one can work no longer.I therefore stirred little abroad till the 5th of
November, when I heard Dr.Tenison, the now vicar of St.Lloyd, the former incumbent, being made Bishop of St.I participated of the blessed Communion, finishing
and confirming my resolutions of giving myself up more entirely to God,
to whom I had now most solemnly devoted the rest of the poor remainder
of life in this world; the Lord enabling me, who am an unprofitable
servant, a miserable sinner, yet depending on his infinite goodness and
mercy accepting my endeavors.Came to dine with us Sir Richard Anderson, his
lady, son and wife, sister to my daughter-in-law.[Sidenote: LONDON]

30th November, 1680.The anniversary election at the Royal Society
brought me to London, where was chosen President that excellent person
and great philosopher, Mr.Robert Boyle, who indeed ought to have been
the very first; but neither his infirmity nor his modesty could now any
longer excuse him.I desired I might for this year be left out of the
Council, by reason my dwelling was in the country.The Society according
to custom dined together.The signal day begun the trial (at which I was present) of my Lord
Viscount Stafford, (for conspiring the death of the King), second son to
my Lord Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Marshal of
England, and grandfather to the present Duke of Norfolk, whom I so well
knew, and from which excellent person I received so many favors.It was
likewise his birthday, The trial was in Westminster Hall, before the
King, Lords, and Commons, just in the same manner as, forty years past,
the great and wise Earl of Strafford (there being but one letter
differing their names) received his trial for pretended ill government
in Ireland, in the very same place, this Lord Stafford's father being
then High Steward.The place of sitting was now exalted some
considerable height from the paved floor of the hall, with a stage of
boards.The throne, woolsacks for the Judges, long forms for the Peers,
chair for the Lord Steward, exactly ranged, as in the House of Lords.The sides on both hands scaffolded to the very roof for the members of
the House of Commons.At the upper end, and on the right side of the
King's state, was a box for his Majesty, and on the left others for the
great ladies, and over head a gallery for ambassadors and public
ministers.At the lower end, or entrance, was a bar, and place for the
prisoner, the Lieutenant of the Tower of London, the ax-bearer and
guards, my Lord Stafford's two daughters, the Marchioness of Winchester
being one; there was likewise a box for my Lord to retire into.At the
right hand, in another box, somewhat higher, stood the witnesses; at the
left, the managers, in the name of the Commons of England, namely,
Serjeant Maynard (the great lawyer, the same who prosecuted the cause
against the Earl of Strafford forty years before, being now near eighty
years of age), Sir William Jones, late Attorney-General, Sir Francis
Winnington, a famous pleader, and Mr.Treby, now Recorder of London, not
appearing in their gowns as lawyers, but in their cloaks and swords, as
representing the Commons of England: to these were joined Mr.Poule, Colonel Titus, Sir Thomas Lee, all gentlemen
of quality, and noted parliamentary men.The first two days, in which
were read the commission and impeachment, were but a tedious entrance
into matter of fact, at which I was but little present.But, on
Thursday, I was commodiously seated among the Commons, when the
witnesses were sworn and examined.Oates
swore that he delivered a commission to Viscount Stafford from the Pope,
to be Paymaster-General to an army intended to be raised; Dugdale, that
being at Lord Aston's, the prisoner dealt with him plainly to murder his
Majesty; and Turberville, that at Paris he also proposed the same to
him.The depositions of my Lord's witnesses were taken, to
invalidate the King's witnesses; they were very slight persons, but,
being fifteen or sixteen, they took up all that day, and in truth they
rather did my Lord more injury than service.Came other witnesses of the Commons to corroborate
the King's, some being Peers, some Commons, with others of good quality,
who took off all the former day's objections, and set the King's
witnesses _recti in curia_.Sir William Jones summed up the evidence; to him
succeeded all the rest of the managers, and then Mr.Henry Poule made a
vehement oration.After this my Lord, as on all occasions, and often
during the trial, spoke in his own defense, denying the charge
altogether, and that he had never seen Oates, or Turberville, at the
time and manner affirmed: in truth, their testimony did little weigh
with me; Dugdale's only seemed to press hardest, to which my Lord spoke
a great while, but confusedly, without any method.One thing my Lord said as to Oates, which I confess did exceedingly
affect me: That a person who during his depositions should so vauntingly
brag that though he went over to the Church of Rome, yet he was never a
<DW7>, nor of their religion, all the time that he seemed to apostatize
from the Protestant, but only as a spy; though he confessed he took
their sacrament; worshiped images, went through all their oaths and
discipline of their proselytes, swearing secrecy and to be faithful, but
with intent to come over again and betray them; that such a hypocrite,
that had so deeply prevaricated as even to turn idolater (for so we of
the Church of England termed it), attesting God so solemnly that he was
entirely theirs and devoted to their interest, and consequently (as he
pretended) trusted; I say, that the witness of such a profligate wretch
should be admitted against the life of a peer,--this my Lord looked upon
as a monstrous thing, and such as must needs redound to the dishonor of
our religion and nation.And verily I am of his Lordship's opinion: such
a man's testimony should not be taken against the life of a dog.But the
merit of something material which he discovered against Coleman, put him
in such esteem with the Parliament, that now, I fancy, he stuck at
nothing, and thought everybody was to take what he said for Gospel.The
consideration of this, and some other circumstances, began to stagger
me; particularly how it was possible that one who went among the <DW7>s
on such a design, and pretended to be intrusted with so many letters and
commissions from the Pope and the party,--nay, and delivered them to so
many great persons,--should not reserve one of them to show, nor so much
as one copy of any commission, which he who had such dexterity in
opening letters might certainly have done, to the undeniable conviction
of those whom he accused; but, as I said, he gained credit on Coleman.But, as to others whom he so madly flew upon, I am little inclined to
believe his testimony, he being so slight a person, so passionate, ill
bred, and of such impudent behavior; nor is it likely that such piercing
politicians as the Jesuits should trust him with so high and so
dangerous secrets.On Tuesday, I was again at the trial, when judgment
was demanded; and, after my Lord had spoken what he could in denying the
fact, the managers answering the objections, the Peers adjourned to
their House, and within two hours returned again.There was, in the
meantime, this question put to the judges, "whether there being but one
witness to any single crime, or act, it could amount to convict a man of
treason."They gave an unanimous opinion that in case of treason they
all were overt acts for though no man should be condemned by one witness
for any one act, yet for several acts to the same intent, it was valid;
which was my Lord's case.This being past, and the Peers in their seats
again, the Lord Chancellor Finch (this day the Lord High-Steward)
removing to the woolsack next his Majesty's state, after summoning the
Lieutenant of the Tower to bring forth his prisoner, and proclamation
made for silence, demanded of every Peer (who were in all eighty-six)
whether William, Lord Viscount Stafford, were guilty of the treason laid
to his charge, or not guilty.Then the Peer spoken to, standing up, and laying his right hand upon his
breast, said guilty, or not guilty, upon my honor, and then sat down,
the Lord Steward noting their suffrages as they answered upon a paper:
when all had done, the number of not guilty being but 31, the guilty 55;
and then, after proclamation for silence again, the Lord Steward
directing his speech to the prisoner, against whom the ax was turned
edgeways and not before, in aggravation of his crime, he being ennobled
by the King's father, and since received many favors from his present
Majesty: after enlarging on his offense, deploring first his own
unhappiness that he who had never condemned any man before should now be
necessitated to begin with him, he then pronounced sentence of death by
hanging, drawing, and quartering, according to form, with great
solemnity and dreadful gravity; and, after a short pause, told the
prisoner that he believed the Lords would intercede for the omission of
some circumstances of his sentence, beheading only excepted; and then
breaking his white staff, the Court was dissolved.My Lord Stafford
during all this latter part spoke but little, and only gave their
Lordships thanks after the sentence was pronounced; and indeed behaved
himself modestly, and as became him.It was observed that all his own relations of his name and family
condemned him, except his nephew, the Earl of Arundel, son to the Duke
of Norfolk.And it must be acknowledged that the whole trial was carried
on with exceeding gravity: so stately and august an appearance I had
never seen before; for, besides the innumerable spectators of gentlemen
and foreign ministers, who saw and heard all the proceedings, the
prisoner had the consciences of all the Commons of England for his
accusers, and all the Peers to be his judges and jury.He had likewise
the assistance of what counsel he would, to direct him in his plea, who
stood by him.And yet I can hardly think that a person of his age and
experience should engage men whom he never saw before (and one of them
that came to visit him as a stranger at Paris) POINT BLANK to murder the
King: God only, who searches hearts, can discover the truth.Lord
Stafford was not a man beloved especially of his own family.This evening, looking out of my chamber window
toward the west, I saw a meteor of an obscure bright color, very much in
shape like the blade of a sword, the rest of the sky very serene and
clear.What this may portend, God only knows; but such another
phenomenon I remember to have seen in 1640, about the trial of the great
Earl of Strafford, preceding our bloody Rebellion.We have had of late several comets, which though I believe
appear from natural causes, and of themselves operate not, yet I cannot
despise them.They may be warnings from God, as they commonly are
forerunners of his animadversions.After many days and nights of snow,
cloudy and dark weather, the comet was very much wasted.My daughter-in-law was brought to bed of a son,
christened Richard.A solemn public Fast that God would prevent all
Popish plots, avert his judgments, and give a blessing to the
proceedings of Parliament now assembled, and which struck at the
succession of the Duke of York.The Viscount Stafford was beheaded on Towerhill.I was at the wedding of my nephew, John Evelyn
of Wotton, married by the Bishop of Rochester at Westminster, in Henry
VII.'s chapel, to the daughter and heir of Mr.Eversfield, of Sussex,
her portion L8,000.The solemnity was kept with a few friends only at
Lady Beckford's, the lady's mother.Visited and dined at the Earl of Essex's, with whom I
spent most of the afternoon alone.Thence to my (yet living) godmother
and kinswoman, Mrs.Keightley, sister to Sir Thomas Evelyn and niece to
my father, being now eighty-six years of age, sprightly, and in perfect
health, her eyes serving her as well as ever, and of a comely
countenance, that one would not suppose her above fifty.Great
expectation of his Royal Highness's case as to the succession, against
which the House was set.An extraordinary sharp, cold spring, not yet a leaf on the trees, frost
and snow lying: while the whole nation was in the greatest ferment.Asaph) at
his house in Leicester Fields, now going to reside in his diocese.Brisbane's, Secretary to the Admiralty,
a learned and industrious person, whither came Dr.Burnet, to thank me
for some papers I had contributed toward his excellent "History of the
Reformation."[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th April, 1681.I dined at Don Pietro Ronquillo's, the Spanish
Ambassador, at Wild House, who used me with extraordinary civility.The
dinner was plentiful, half after the Spanish, half after the English
way.After dinner, he led me into his bedchamber, where we fell into a
long discourse concerning religion.Though he was a learned man in
politics, and an advocate, he was very ignorant in religion, and unable
to defend any point of controversy; he was, however, far from being
fierce.At parting, he earnestly wished me to apply humbly to the
blessed virgin to direct me, assuring me that he had known divers who
had been averse from the Roman Catholic religion, wonderfully
enlightened and convinced by her intercession.He importuned me to come
and visit him often.Came to dine with me Sir William Fermor, of
Northamptonshire, and Sir Christopher Wren, his Majesty's architect and
surveyor, now building the Cathedral of St.Paul, and the column in
memory of the city's conflagration, and was in hand with the building of
fifty parish churches.Came my Lady Sunderland, to desire that I would propose
a match to Sir Stephen Fox for her son, Lord Spencer, to marry Mrs.I excused myself all I was able; for the
truth is, I was afraid he would prove an extravagant man: for, though a
youth of extraordinary parts, and had an excellent education to render
him a worthy man, yet his early inclinations to extravagance made me
apprehensive, that I should not serve Sir Stephen by proposing it, like
a friend; this being now his only daughter, well-bred, and likely to
receive a large share of her father's opulence.Lord Sunderland was much
sunk in his estate by gaming and other prodigalities, and was now no
longer Secretary of State, having fallen into displeasure of the King
for siding with the Commons about the succession; but which, I am
assured, he did not do out of his own inclination, or for the
preservation of the Protestant religion, but by mistaking the ability of
the party to carry it.However, so earnest and importunate was the
Countess, that I did mention it to Sir Stephen, who said it was too
great an honor, that his daughter was very young, as well as my Lord,
and he was resolved never to marry her without the parties' mutual
liking; with other objections which I neither would or could contradict.He desired me to express to the Countess the great sense he had of the
honor done him, that his daughter and her son were too young, that he
would do nothing without her liking, which he did not think her capable
of expressing judiciously, till she was sixteen or seventeen years of
age, of which she now wanted four years, and that I would put it off as
civilly as I could.Our new curate preached, a pretty hopeful young man, yet
somewhat raw, newly come from college, full of Latin sentences, which in
time will wear off.There came to visit me Sir William Walter and Sir John
Elowes: and the next day, the Earl of Kildare, a young gentleman related
to my wife, and other company.There had scarce fallen any rain since
Christmas.I went to Hampton Court, when the Surrey gentlemen
presented their addresses to his Majesty, whose hand I kissed,
introduced by the Duke of Albemarle.Being at the Privy Council, I took
another occasion of discoursing with Sir Stephen Fox about his daughter
and to revive that business, and at least brought it to this: That in
case the young people liked one the other, after four years, he first
desiring to see a particular of my Lord's present estate if I could
transmit it to him privately, he would make her portion L14,000, though
to all appearance he might likely make it L50,000 as easily, his eldest
son having no child and growing very corpulent.It still continued so great a drought as had never been
known in England, and it was said to be universal.No sermon this afternoon, which I think did not
happen twice in this parish these thirty years; so gracious has God been
to it, and indeed to the whole nation: God grant that we abuse not this
great privilege either by our wantonness, schism, or unfaithfulness,
under such means as he has not favored any other nation under Heaven
besides![Sidenote: WOTTON]

23d August, 1681.I went to Wotton, and, on the following day, was
invited to Mr.Denzil Onslow's at his seat at Purford, where was much
company, and such an extraordinary feast, as I had hardly seen at any
country gentleman's table.What made it more remarkable was, that there
was not anything save what his estate about it did afford; as venison,
rabbits, hares, pheasants, partridges, pigeons, quails, poultry, all
sorts of fowl in season from his own decoy near his house, and all sorts
of fresh fish.After dinner we went to see sport at the decoy, where I
never saw so many herons.The seat stands on a flat, the ground pasture, rarely watered, and
exceedingly improved since Mr.Onslow bought it of Sir Robert Parkhurst,
who spent a fair estate.The house is timber, but commodious, and with
one ample dining-room, the hall adorned with paintings of fowl and
huntings, etc., the work of Mr.Barlow, who is excellent in this kind
from the life.Hussey (at Sutton in
Shere), who has a very pretty seat well watered, near my brother's.He
is the neatest husband for curious ordering his domestic and field
accommodations, and what pertains to husbandry, that I have ever seen,
as to his granaries, tacklings, tools, and utensils, plows, carts,
stables, wood piles, wood houses, even to hen roosts and hog troughs.Methought, I saw old Cato, or Varro, in him; all substantial, all in
exact order.The sole inconvenience he lies under, is the great quantity
of sand which the stream brings along with it, and fills his canals and
receptacles for fish too soon.The rest of my time of stay at Wotton was
spent in walking about the grounds and goodly woods, where I have in my
youth so often entertained my solitude; and so, on the 2d of September,
I once more returned to my home.Died my pretty grandchild, and was interred on the
8th [at Deptford].Dined with Sir Stephen Fox, who proposed to me the
purchasing of Chelsea College, which his Majesty had sometime since
given to our Society, and would now purchase it again to build a
hospital; or infirmary for soldiers there, in which he desired my
assistance as one of the Council of the Royal Society.I had another opportunity of visiting his
Majesty's private library at Whitehall.To Sir Samuel Morland's, to see his house and mechanics.I went with Monsieur Faubert about taking the
Countess of Bristol's house for an academy, he being lately come from
Paris for his religion, and resolving to settle here.I went to see Sir Thomas Bond's fine house and
garden at Peckham.I went to Camberwell, where that good man Dr.Parr
(late chaplain to Archbishop Usher) preached on Acts xvi.To Fulham, to visit the Bishop of London, in whose
garden I first saw the _Sedum arborescens_ in flower, which was
exceedingly beautiful.16, 17, before the
King, of the usurpation of the Church of Rome.This is one of the first
rank of pulpit men in the nation.I dined with the Earl of Essex who, after dinner
in his study, where we were alone, related to me how much he had been
scandalized and injured in the report of his being privy to the marriage
of his Lady's niece, the rich young widow of the late Lord Ogle, sole
daughter of the Earl of Northumberland; showing me a letter of Mr.Thynn's, excusing himself for not communicating his marriage to his
Lordship.He acquainted me also with the whole story of that unfortunate
lady being betrayed by her grandmother, the Countess of Northumberland,
and Colonel Bret, for money; and that though, upon the importunity of
the Duke of Monmouth, he had delivered to the grandmother a particular
of the jointure which Mr.Thynn pretended he would settle on the lady,
yet he totally discouraged the proceeding as by no means a competent
match for one that both by birth and fortune might have pretended to the
greatest prince in Christendom; that he also proposed the Earl of
Kingston, or the Lord Cranburn, but was by no means for Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th November, 1681.I dined with my worthy friend, Mr.Erskine, Master
of the Charter House, uncle to the Duchess of Monmouth; a wise and
learned gentleman, fitter to have been a privy councillor and minister
of state than to have been laid aside.I was at the audience of the Russian Ambassador
before both their Majesties in the Banqueting House.The presents were
carried before him, held up by his followers in two ranks before the
King's State, and consisted of tapestry (one suite of which was
doubtlessly brought from France as being of that fabric, the Ambassador
having passed through that kingdom as he came out of Spain), a large
Persian carpet, furs of sable and ermine, etc.; but nothing was so
splendid and exotic as the Ambassador who came soon after the King's
restoration.This present Ambassador was exceedingly offended that his
coach was not permitted to come into the Court, till, being told that no
King's Ambassador did, he was pacified, yet requiring an attestation of
it under the hand of Sir Charles Cotterell, the Master of the
Ceremonies; being, it seems, afraid he should offend his Master, if he
omitted the least punctilio.It was reported he condemned his son to
lose his head for shaving off his beard, and putting himself in the
French mode at Paris, and that he would have executed it, had not the
French King interceded--but qy.Sir Christopher Wren chosen President [of the Royal
Society], Mr.Plot, the ingenious author of
the "History of Oxfordshire."I saw the audience of the Morocco Ambassador,
his retinue not numerous.He was received in the Banqueting House, both
their Majesties being present.He came up to the throne without making
any sort of reverence, not bowing his head, or body.He spoke by a
renegado Englishman, for whose safe return there was a promise.They
were all clad in the Moorish habit, cassocks of  cloth, or silk,
with buttons and loops, over this an _alhaga_, or white woolen mantle,
so large as to wrap both head and body, a sash, or small turban,
naked-legged and armed, but with leather socks like the Turks, rich
scymetar, and large calico sleeved shirts.The Ambassador had a string
of pearls oddly woven in his turban.I fancy the old Roman habit was
little different as to the mantle and naked limbs.He was a handsome
person, well featured, of a wise look, subtle, and extremely civil.Their presents were lions and ostriches; their errand about a peace at
Tangier.But the concourse and tumult of the people was intolerable, so
as the officers could keep no order, which these strangers were
astonished at first, there being nothing so regular, exact, and
performed with such silence, as is on all these public occasions of
their country, and indeed over all the Turkish dominions.Dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, at the Abbey, it
being his marriage day, after twenty-four years.He related to me how he
had been treated by Sir William Temple, foreseeing that he might be a
delegate in the concern of my Lady Ogle now likely come in controversy
upon her marriage with Mr.Thynn; also how earnestly the late Earl of
Danby, Lord Treasurer, sought his friendship, and what plain and sincere
advice he gave him from time to time about his miscarriages and
partialities; particularly his outing Sir John Duncomb from being
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir Stephen Fox, above all, from being
Paymaster of the Army.The Treasurer's excuse and reason was, that Fox's
credit was so over great with the bankers and monied men, that he could
procure none but by his means, "for that reason," replied the Bishop, "I
would have made him my friend, Sir Stephen being a person both honest
and of credit."He told him likewise of his stateliness and difficulty
of access, and several other miscarriages, and which indeed made him
hated.To the Royal Society, where at the Council we
passed a new law for the more accurate consideration of candidates, as
whether they would really be useful; also concerning the honorary
members, that none should be admitted but by diploma.[Sidenote: LONDON]

This evening I was at the entertainment of the Morocco Ambassador at the
Duchess of Portsmouth's glorious apartments at Whitehall, where was a
great banquet of sweetmeats and music; but at which both the Ambassador
and his retinue behaved themselves with extraordinary moderation and
modesty, though placed about a long table, a lady between two Moors, and
among these were the King's natural children, namely, Lady Lichfield and
Sussex, the Duchess of Portsmouth, Nelly, etc., concubines, and cattle
of that sort, as splendid as jewels and excess of bravery could make
them; the Moors neither admiring nor seeming to regard anything,
furniture or the like, with any earnestness, and but decently tasting of
the banquet.They drank a little milk and water, but not a drop of wine;
they also drank of a sorbet and jacolatt;[45] did not look about, or
stare on the ladies, or express the least surprise, but with a courtly
negligence in pace, countenance, and whole behavior, answering only to
such questions as were asked with a great deal of wit and gallantry, and
so gravely took leave with this compliment, that God would bless the
Duchess of Portsmouth and the Prince, her son meaning the little Duke of
Richmond.The King came in at the latter end, just as the Ambassador was
going away.In this manner was this slave (for he was no more at home)
entertained by most of the nobility in town, and went often to Hyde Park
on horseback, where he and his retinue showed their extraordinary
activity in horsemanship, and flinging and catching their lances at full
speed; they rode very short, and could stand upright at full speed,
managing their spears with incredible agility.He went sometimes to the
theaters, where, upon any foolish or fantastical action, he could not
forbear laughing, but he endeavored to hide it with extraordinary
modesty and gravity.In a word, the Russian Ambassador, still at Court
behaved himself like a clown compared to this civil heathen.This evening, Sir Stephen Fox acquainted me again
with his Majesty's resolution of proceeding in the erection of a Royal
Hospital for emerited soldiers on that spot of ground which the Royal
Society had sold to his Majesty for L1,300, and that he would settle
L5,000 per annum on it, and build to the value of L20,000 for the relief
and reception of four companies, namely, 400 men, to be as in a college,
or monastery.I was therefore desired by Sir Stephen (who had not only
the whole managing of this, but was, as I perceived, himself to be a
grand benefactor, as well it became him who had gotten so vast an estate
by the soldiers) to assist him, and consult what method to cast it in,
as to the government.So, in his study we arranged the governor,
chaplain, steward, housekeeper, chirurgeon, cook, butler, gardener,
porter, and other officers, with their several salaries and
entertainments.I would needs have a library, and mentioned several
books, since some soldiers might possibly be studious, when they were at
leisure to recollect.Thus we made the first calculations, and set down
our thoughts to be considered and digested better, to show his Majesty
and the Archbishop.He also engaged me to consider of what laws and
orders were fit for the government, which was to be in every respect as
strict as in any religious convent.After supper, came in the famous treble, Mr.Abel, newly returned from
Italy; I never heard a more excellent voice; one would have sworn it had
been a woman's, it was so high, and so well and skillfully managed,
being accompanied by Signor Francesco on the harpsichord.Pepys, late Secretary to the Admiralty, showed
me a large folio containing the whole mechanic part and art of building
royal ships and men-of-war, made by Sir Anthony Dean, being so accurate
a piece from the very keel to the lead block, rigging, guns, victualing,
manning, and even to every individual pin and nail, in a method so
astonishing and curious, with a draught, both geometrical and in
perspective, and several sections, that I do not think the world can
show the like.My daughter, Mary, began to learn music of Signor
Bartholomeo, and dancing of Monsieur Isaac, reputed the best masters.Having had several violent fits of an ague, recourse was had to bathing
my legs in milk up to the knees, made as hot as I could endure it: and
sitting so in it in a deep churn, or vessel, covered with blankets, and
drinking _carduus_ posset, then going to bed and sweating, I not only
missed that expected fit, but had no more, only continued weak, that I
could not go to church till Ash Wednesday, which I had not missed, I
think, so long in twenty years, so gracious had God been to me.After this warning and admonition, I now began to look over and
methodize all my writings, accounts, letters, papers; inventoried the
goods, and other articles of the house, and put things into the best
order I could, and made my will; that now, growing in years, I might
have none of these secular things and concerns to distract me, when it
should please Almighty God to call me from this transitory life.With
this, I prepared some special meditations and devotions for the time of
sickness.The Lord Jesus grant them to be salutary for my poor soul in
that day, that I may obtain mercy and acceptance!My second grandchild was born, and christened the next
day by our vicar at Sayes Court, by the name of John.[46] I beseech God
to bless him![Footnote 46: Who became his successor, and was created a baronet in
    1713.]I went to church: our vicar preached on
Proverbs, showing what care and vigilance was required for the keeping
of the heart upright.The Holy Communion followed, on which I gave God
thanks for his gracious dealing with me in my late sickness, and
affording me this blessed opportunity of praising him in the
congregation, and receiving the cup of salvation with new and serious
resolutions.Came to see and congratulate my recovery, Sir John Lowther, Mr.Pepys, Sir Anthony Deane, and Mr.This day was executed Colonel Vrats, and some of his
accomplices, for the execrable murder of Mr.Thynn, set on by the
principal Koningsmark.He went to execution like an undaunted hero, as
one that had done a friendly office for that base coward, Count
Koningsmark, who had hopes to marry his widow, the rich Lady Ogle, and
was acquitted by a corrupt jury, and so got away.Vrats told a friend of
mine who accompanied him to the gallows, and gave him some advice that
he did not value dying of a rush, and hoped and believed God would deal
with him like a gentleman.Never man went, so unconcerned for his sad
fate.I went to see the corpse of that obstinate creature,
Colonel Vrats, the King permitting that his body should be transported
to his own country, he being of a good family, and one of the first
embalmed by a particular art, invented by one William Russell, a
coffin-maker, which preserved the body without disboweling, or to
appearance using any bituminous matter.The flesh was florid, soft, and
full, as if the person were only sleeping.He had now been dead near
fifteen days, and lay exposed in a very rich coffin lined with lead, too
magnificent for so daring and horrid a murderer.[Sidenote: LONDON]

At the meeting of the Royal Society were exhibited some pieces of amber
sent by the Duke of Brandenburg, in one of which was a spider, in
another a gnat, both very entire.There was a discourse of the tingeing
of glass, especially with red, and the difficulty of finding any red
color effectual to penetrate glass, among the glass-painters; that the
most diaporous, as blue, yellow, etc., did not enter into the substance
of what was ordinarily painted, more than very shallow, unless
incorporated in the metal itself, other reds and whites not at all
beyond the superfices.To the Royal Society, where at a Council was regulated
what collections should be published monthly, as formerly the
transactions, which had of late been discontinued, but were now much
called for by the curious abroad and at home.I went this afternoon with several of the Royal
Society to a supper which was all dressed, both fish and flesh, in
Monsieur Papin's digestors, by which the hardest bones of beef itself,
and mutton, were made as soft as cheese, without water or other liquor,
and with less than eight ounces of coals, producing an incredible
quantity of gravy; and for close of all, a jelly made of the bones of
beef, the best for clearness and good relish, and the most delicious
that I had ever seen, or tasted.We ate pike and other fish, bones and
all, without impediment; but nothing exceeded the pigeons, which tasted
just as if baked in a pie, all these being stewed in their own juice,
without any addition of water save what swam about the digestor, as _in
balneo_; the natural juice of all these provisions acting on the grosser
substances, reduced the hardest bones to tenderness; but it is best
descanted with more particulars for extracting tinctures, preserving and
stewing fruit, and saving fuel, in Dr.Papin's book, published and
dedicated to our Society of which he is a member.He is since gone to
Venice with the late Resident here (and also a member of our Society),
who carried this excellent mechanic, philosopher, and physician, to set
up a philosophical meeting in that city.This philosophical supper
caused much mirth among us, and exceedingly pleased all the company.I
sent a glass of the jelly to my wife, to the reproach of all that the
ladies ever made of their best hartshorn.[47]

    [Footnote 47: Denys Papin, a French physician and mathematician, who
    possessed so remarkable a knowledge of mathematics, that he very
    nearly brought the invention of the steam engine into working order.Boyle in his pneumatic experiments, and was
    afterward mathematical professor at Marburg.The season was unusually wet, with rain and thunder.I was desired by Sir Stephen Fox and Sir Christopher
Wren to accompany them to Lambeth, with the plot and design of the
college to be built at Chelsea, to have the Archbishop's approbation.It
was a quadrangle of 200 feet square, after the dimensions of the larger
quadrangle at Christ church, Oxford, for the accommodation of 440
persons, with governor and officers.The Duke and Duchess of York were just now come to London, after his
escape and shipwreck, as he went by sea for Scotland.At the Rolls' chapel preached the famous Dr.10, describing excellently well what was meant by election;
viz, not the effect of any irreversible decree, but so called because
they embraced the Gospel readily, by which they became elect, or
precious to God.It would be very needless to make our calling and
election sure, were they irreversible and what the rigid Presbyterians
pretend.Lawrence's church, a new and cheerful
pile.I gave notice to the Bishop of Rochester of what
Maimburg had published about the motives of the late Duchess of York's
perversion, in his "History of Calvinism;" and did myself write to the
Bishop of Winchester about it, who being concerned in it, I urged him to
set forth his vindication.The Morocco Ambassador being admitted an honorary member
of the Royal Society, and subscribing his name and titles in Arabic, I
was deputed by the Council to go and compliment him.The Bantam, or East India Ambassadors (at this time we
had in London the Russian, Moroccan, and Indian Ambassadors), being
invited to dine at Lord George Berkeley's (now Earl), I went to the
entertainment to contemplate the exotic guests.They were both very
hard-favored, and much resembling in countenance some sort of monkeys.We ate at two tables, the Ambassadors and interpreter by themselves.Their garments were rich Indian silks, flowered with gold, viz, a close
waistcoat to their knees, drawers, naked legs, and on their heads caps
made like fruit baskets.They wore poisoned daggers at their bosoms, the
hafts carved with some ugly serpents' or devils' heads, exceedingly
keen, and of Damascus metal.The second Ambassador
(sent it seems to succeed in case the first should die by the way in so
tedious a journey), having been at Mecca, wore a Turkish or Arab sash, a
little part of the linen hanging down behind his neck, with some other
difference of habit, and was half a <DW64>, bare legged and naked feet,
and deemed a very holy man.They sat cross-legged like Turks, and
sometimes in the posture of apes and monkeys; their nails and teeth as
black as jet, and shining, which being the effect, as to their teeth, of
perpetually chewing betel to preserve them from the toothache, much
raging in their country, is esteemed beautiful.The first ambassador was of an olive hue, a flat face, narrow eyes,
squat nose, and Moorish lips, no hair appeared; they wore several rings
of silver, gold and copper on their fingers, which was a token of
knighthood, or nobility.They were of Java Major, whose princes have
been turned Mahometans not above fifty years since; the inhabitants are
still pagans and idolaters.They seemed of a dull and heavy
constitution, not wondering at any thing they saw; but exceedingly
astonished how our law gave us propriety in our estates, and so thinking
we were all kings, for they could not be made to comprehend how subjects
could possess anything but at the pleasure of their Prince, they being
all slaves; they were pleased with the notion, and admired our
happiness.They were very sober, and I believe subtle in their way.Their meat was cooked, carried up, and they attended by several fat
slaves, who had no covering save drawers, which appeared very uncouth
and loathsome.They ate their pilaw, and other spoon-meat, without
spoons, taking up their pottage in the hollow of their fingers, and very
dexterously flung it into their mouths without spilling a drop.Came to dine with me, the Duke of Grafton and the young
Earl of Ossory, son to my most dear deceased friend.Went to visit our good neighbor, Mr.Bohun, whose whole
house is a cabinet of all elegancies, especially Indian; in the hall are
contrivances of Japan screens, instead of wainscot; and there is an
excellent pendule clock inclosed in the curious flowerwork of Mr.Gibbons, in the middle of the vestibule.The landscapes of the screens
represent the manner of living, and country of the Chinese.But, above
all, his lady's cabinet is adorned on the fret, ceiling, and
chimney-piece, with Mr.There are also some of
Streeter's best paintings, and many rich curiosities of gold and silver
as growing in the mines.The gardens are exactly kept, and the whole
place very agreeable and well watered.The owners are good neighbors,
and Mr.Bohun has also built and endowed a hospital for eight poor
people, with a pretty chapel, and every necessary accommodation.To the Bishop of London at Fulham, to review the
additions which Mr.Marshall had made to his curious book of flowers in
miniature, and collection of insects.With Sir Stephen Fox, to survey the foundations of the
Royal Hospital begun at Chelsea.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th August, 1682.The Council of the Royal Society had it recommended
to them to be trustees and visitors, or supervisors, of the Academy
which Monsieur Faubert did hope to procure to be built by subscription
of worthy gentlemen and noblemen, for the education of youth, and to
lessen the vast expense the nation is at yearly by sending children into
France to be taught military exercises.We thought to give him all the
encouragement our recommendation could procure.Rogers, an acquaintance of mine
long since at Padua.He was then Consul of the English nation, and
student in that University, where he proceeded Doctor in Physic;
presenting me now with the Latin oration he lately made upon the famous
Dr.Harvey's anniversary in the College of Physicians, at London.This night I saw another comet, near Cancer, very
bright, but the stream not so long as the former.Supped at Lord Clarendon's, with Lord Hyde, his
brother, now the great favorite, who invited himself to dine at my house
the Tuesday following.Being my birthday, and I now entering my great
climacterical of 63, after serious recollections of the years past,
giving Almighty God thanks for all his merciful preservations and
forbearance, begging pardon for my sins and unworthiness, and his
blessing on me the year entering, I went with my Lady Fox to survey her
building, and give some directions for the garden at Chiswick; the
architect is Mr.May,--somewhat heavy and thick, and not so well
understood: the garden much too narrow, the place without water, near a
highway, and near another great house of my Lord Burlington, little land
about it, so that I wonder at the expense; but women will have their
will.I was invited to dine with Monsieur Lionberg, the
Swedish Resident, who made a magnificent entertainment, it being the
birthday of his King.There dined the Duke of Albemarle, Duke of
Hamilton, Earl of Bath, Earl of Aylesbury, Lord Arran, Lord Castlehaven,
the son of him who was executed fifty years before, and several great
persons.I was exceedingly afraid of drinking (it being a Dutch feast),
but the Duke of Albemarle being that night to wait on his Majesty,
excess was prohibited; and, to prevent all, I stole away and left the
company as soon as we rose from table.[Sidenote: LONDON]

28th November, 1682.I went to the Council of the Royal Society, for the
auditing the last year's account, where I was surprised with a fainting
fit that for a time took away my sight; but God being merciful to me, I
recovered it after a short repose.I was exceedingly endangered and importuned to
stand the election,[48] having so many voices, but by favor of my
friends, and regard of my remote dwelling, and now frequent infirmities,
I desired their suffrages might be transferred to Sir John Hoskins, one
of the Masters of Chancery; a most learned virtuoso as well as lawyer,
who accordingly was elected.[Footnote 48: For President of the Royal Society.]Went to congratulate Lord Hyde (the great favorite)
newly made Earl of Rochester, and lately marrying his eldest daughter to
the Earl of Ossory.I sold my East India adventure of L250 principal
for L750 to the Royal Society, after I had been in that company
twenty-five years, being extraordinarily advantageous, by the blessing
of God.Sir Francis North, son to the Lord North, and Lord
Chief Justice, being made Lord Keeper on the death of the Earl of
Nottingham, the Lord Chancellor, I went to congratulate him.He is a
most knowing, learned, and ingenious man, and, besides being an
excellent person, of an ingenious and sweet disposition, very skillful
in music, painting, the new philosophy, and politer studies.Supped at Sir Joseph Williamson's, where was a
select company of our Society, Sir William Petty, Dr.Gale (that learned
schoolmaster of St.The
conversation was philosophical and cheerful, on divers considerable
questions proposed; as of the hereditary succession of the Roman
Emperors; the Pica mentioned in the preface to our Common Prayer, which
signifies only the Greek _Kalendarium_.James's, when I saw the sea
charts of Captain Collins, which that industrious man now brought to
show the Duke, having taken all the coasting from the mouth of the
Thames, as far as Wales, and exactly measuring every creek, island,
rock, soundings, harbors, sands, and tides, intending next spring to
proceed till he had finished the whole island, and that measured by
chains and other instruments: a most exact and useful undertaking.He
affirmed, that of all the maps put out since, there are none extant so
true as those of Joseph Norden, who gave us the first in Queen
Elizabeth's time; all since him are erroneous.This morning I received the news of the death of my
father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, Knt.and Bart., who died at my house
at Sayes Court this day at ten in the morning, after he had labored
under the gout and dropsy for nearly six months, in the 78th year of his
age.The funeral was solemnized on the 19th at Deptford, with as much
decency as the dignity of the person, and our relation to him, required;
there being invited the Bishop of Rochester, several noblemen, knights,
and all the fraternity of the Trinity Company, of which he had been
Master, and others of the country.The vicar preached a short but proper
discourse on Psalm xxxix.10, on the frailty of our mortal condition,
concluding with an ample and well-deserved eulogy on the defunct,
relating to his honorable birth and ancestors, education, learning in
Greek and Latin, modern languages, travels, public employments, signal
loyalty, character abroad, and particularly the honor of supporting the
Church of England in its public worship during its persecution by the
late rebels' usurpation and regicide, by the suffrages of divers
Bishops, Doctors of the Church, and others, who found such an asylum in
his house and family at Paris, that in their disputes with the <DW7>s
(then triumphing over it as utterly lost) they used to argue for its
visibility and existence from Sir R. Browne's chapel and assembly there.Then he spoke of his great and loyal sufferings during thirteen years'
exile with his present Majesty, his return with him in the signal year
1660; his honorable employment at home, his timely recess to recollect
himself, his great age, infirmities, and death.He gave to the Trinity Corporation that land in Deptford on which are
built those almshouses for twenty-four widows of emerited seamen.He was
born the famous year of the Gunpowder Treason, in 1605, and being the
last [male] of his family, left my wife, his only daughter, heir.His
grandfather, Sir Richard Browne, was the great instrument under the
great Earl of Leicester (favorite to Queen Elizabeth) in his government
of the Netherland.He was Master of the Household to King James, and
Cofferer; I think was the first who regulated the compositions through
England for the King's household, provisions, progresses,[49] etc.,
which was so high a service, and so grateful to the whole nation, that
he had acknowledgments and public thanks sent him from all the counties;
he died by the rupture of a vein in a vehement speech he made about the
compositions in a Parliament of King James.By his mother's side he was
a Gunson, Treasurer of the Navy in the reigns of Henry VIII., Queen
Mary, and Queen Elizabeth, and, as by his large pedigree appears,
related to divers of the English nobility.Thus ended this honorable
person, after so many changes and tossings to and fro, in the same house
where he was born."Lord teach us so to number our days, that we may
apply our hearts unto wisdom!"[Footnote 49: Notice was taken of this in a previous passage of the
    "Diary."The different counties were bound to supply provisions of
    various kinds, and these were collected by officers called
    purveyors, whose extortions often excited the attention of
    Parliament.]By a special clause in his will, he ordered that his body should be
buried in the churchyard under the southeast window of the chancel,
adjoining to the burying places of his ancestors, since they came out of
Essex into Sayes Court, he being much offended at the novel custom of
burying everyone within the body of the church and chancel; that being a
favor heretofore granted to martyrs and great persons; this excess of
making churches charnel houses being of ill and irreverend example, and
prejudicial to the health of the living, besides the continual
disturbance of the pavement and seats, and several other indecencies.Hall, the pious Bishop of Norwich, would also be so interred, as may
be read in his testament.I went to see Sir Josiah Child's prodigious cost in
planting walnut trees about his seat, and making fish ponds, many miles
in circuit, in Epping Forest, in a barren spot, as oftentimes these
suddenly monied men for the most part seat themselves.He from a
merchant's apprentice, and management of the East India Company's stock,
being arrived to an estate (it is said) of L200,000; and lately married
his daughter to the eldest son of the Duke of Beaufort, late Marquis of
Worcester, with L50,000 portional present, and various expectations.Houblon's, a rich and gentle French merchant, who was
building a house in the Forest, near Sir J. Child's, in a place where
the late Earl of Norwich dwelt some time, and which came from his lady,
the widow of Mr.It will be a pretty villa, about five miles from
Whitechapel.Horneck preach at the Savoy Church,
on Phil.He was a German born, a most pathetic preacher, a person
of a saint-like life, and hath written an excellent treatise on
Consideration.Whistler's, at the Physicians' College,
with Sir Thomas Millington, both learned men; Dr.W. the most facetious
man in nature, and now Censor of the college.I was here consulted where
they should build their library; it is a pity this college is built so
near Newgate Prison, and in so obscure a hole, a fault in placing most
of our public buildings and churches in the city, through the avarice of
some few men, and his Majesty not overruling it, when it was in his
power after the dreadful conflagration.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st March, 1683.Tenison preached at Whitehall on 1 Cor.12; I
esteem him to be one of the most profitable preachers in the Church of
England, being also of a most holy conversation, very learned and
ingenious.The pains he takes and care of his parish will, I fear, wear
him out, which would be an inexpressible loss.Charleton's lecture on the heart in
the Anatomy Theater at the Physicians' College.To London, in order to my passing the following week,
for the celebration of the Easter now approaching, there being in the
Holy Week so many eminent preachers officiating at the Court and other
places.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1683.There was in the afternoon, according to
custom, a sermon before the King, at Whitehall; Dr.Sprat preached for
the Bishop of Rochester.I was at the launching of the last of the thirty ships
ordered to be newly built by Act of Parliament, named the "Neptune," a
second rate, one of the goodliest vessels of the whole navy, built by my
kind neighbor, young Mr.Shish, his Majesty's master shipwright of this
dock.I went to Blackheath, to see the new fair, being the
first procured by the Lord Dartmouth.This was the first day, pretended
for the sale of cattle, but I think in truth to enrich the new tavern at
the bowling-green, erected by Snape, his Majesty's farrier, a man full
of projects.There appeared nothing but an innumerable assembly of
drinking people from London, peddlars, etc., and I suppose it too near
London to be of any great use to the country.March was unusually hot and dry, and all April excessively wet.I planted all the out limits of the garden and long walks with
holly.[50]

    [Footnote 50: Evelyn adds a note: "400 feet in length, 9 feet high,
    5 in diameter, in my now ruined garden, thanks to the Czar of
    Muscovy."--"_Sylva_," book ii.Dined at Sir Gabriel Sylvius's and thence to visit the
Duke of Norfolk, to ask whether he would part with any of his cartoons
and other drawings of Raphael, and the great masters; he told me if he
might sell them all together he would, but that the late Sir Peter Lely
(our famous painter) had gotten some of his best.The person who desired
me to treat for them was Vander Douse, grandson to that great scholar,
contemporary and friend of Joseph Scaliger.Came to dinner and visited me Sir Richard Anderson, of
Pendley, and his lady, with whom I went to London.On my return home from the Royal Society, I found Mr.Wilbraham, a young gentleman of Cheshire.The Lord Dartmouth was elected Master of the Trinity
House; son to George Legge, late Master of the Ordnance, and one of the
grooms of the bedchamber; a great favorite of the Duke's, an active and
understanding gentleman in sea affairs.To our Society, where we received the Count de
Zinzendorp, Ambassador from the Duke of Saxony, a fine young man; we
showed him divers experiments on the magnet, on which subject the
Society were upon.I went to Windsor, dining by the way at Chiswick, at
Sir Stephen Fox's, where I found Sir Robert Howard (that universal
pretender), and Signor Verrio, who brought his draught and designs for
the painting of the staircase of Sir Stephen's new house.That which was new at Windsor since I was last there, and was surprising
to me, was the incomparable fresco painting in St.George's Hall,
representing the legend of St.George, and triumph of the Black Prince,
and his reception by Edward III.; the volto, or roof, not totally
finished; then the Resurrection in the Chapel, where the figure of the
Ascension is, in my opinion, comparable to any paintings of the most
famous Roman masters; the Last Supper, also over the altar.I liked the
contrivance of the unseen organ behind the altar, nor less the
stupendous and beyond all description the incomparable carving of our
Gibbons, who is, without controversy, the greatest master both for
invention and rareness of work, that the world ever had in any age; nor
doubt I at all that he will prove as great a master in the statuary art.Verrio's invention is admirable, his ordnance full and flowing, antique
and heroical; his figures move; and, if the walls hold (which is the
only doubt by reason of the salts which in time and in this moist
climate prejudice), the work will preserve his name to ages.There was now the terrace brought almost round the old castle; the
grass made clean, even, and curiously turfed; the avenues to the new
park, and other walks, planted with elms and limes, and a pretty canal,
and receptacle for fowl; nor less observable and famous is the throwing
so huge a quantity of excellent water to the enormous height of the
castle, for the use of the whole house, by an extraordinary invention of
Sir Samuel Morland.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with the Earls of
Bath, Castlehaven, Lords Viscounts Falconberg, Falkland, Bishop of
London, the Grand Master of Malta, brother to the Duke de Vendome (a
young wild spark), and Mr.After evening prayer, I
walked in the park with my Lord Clarendon, where we fell into discourse
of the Bishop of Salisbury (Dr.Seth Ward), his subtlety, etc.Durell, late Dean of Windsor, being dead, Dr.Turner, one of the Duke's
chaplains was made dean.I visited my Lady Arlington, groom of the stole to her Majesty, who
being hardly set down to supper, word was brought her that the Queen was
going into the park to walk, it being now near eleven at night; the
alarm caused the Countess to rise in all haste, and leave her supper to
us.By this one may take an estimate of the extreme slavery and subjection
that courtiers live in, who had not time to eat and drink at their
pleasure.It put me in mind of Horace's "Mouse," and to bless God for my
own private condition.Here was Monsieur de l'Angle, the famous minister of Charenton, lately
fled from the persecution in France, concerning the deplorable condition
of the Protestants there.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th June, 1683.I was present, and saw and heard the humble submission
and petition of the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen, on behalf of the
city of London, on the _quo warranto_ against their charter which they
delivered to his Majesty in the presence chamber.It was delivered
kneeling, and then the King and Council went into the council chamber,
the mayor and his brethren attending still in the presence chamber.After a short space they were called in, and my Lord Keeper made a
speech to them, exaggerating the disorderly and riotous behavior in the
late election, and polling for Papillon and Du Bois after the Common
hall had been formally dissolved: with other misdemeanors, libels on the
government, etc., by which they had incurred his Majesty's high
displeasure: and that but for this submission, and under such articles
as the King should require their obedience to, he would certainly enter
judgment against them, which hitherto he had suspended.The things
required were as follows: that they should neither elect mayor,
sheriffs, aldermen, recorder, common Serjeant town clerk, coroner, nor
steward of Southwark, without his Majesty's approbation; and that if
they presented any his Majesty did not like, they should proceed in
wonted manner to a second choice; if that was disapproved, his Majesty
to nominate them; and if within five days they thought good to assent to
this, all former miscarriages should be forgotten.And so they tamely
parted with their so ancient privileges after they had dined and been
treated by the King.What
the consequences will prove, time will show.Divers of the old and most
learned lawyers and judges were of opinion that they could not forfeit
their charter, but might be personally punished for their misdemeanors;
but the plurality of the younger judges and rising men judged it
otherwise.The Popish Plot also, which had hitherto made such a noise, began now
sensibly to dwindle, through the folly, knavery, impudence, and
giddiness of Oates, so as the <DW7>s began to hold up their heads
higher than ever, and those who had fled, flocked to London from abroad.Such sudden changes and eager doings there had been without anything
steady or prudent, for these last seven years.I returned to town in a coach with the Earl of
Clarendon, when passing by the glorious palace of his father, built but
a few years before, which they were now demolishing, being sold to
certain undertakers, I turned my head the contrary way till the coach
had gone past it, lest I might minister occasion of speaking of it;
which must needs have grieved him, that in so short a time their pomp
was fallen.After the Popish Plot, there was now a new and (as
they called it) a Protestant Plot discovered, that certain Lords and
others should design the assassination of the King and the Duke as they
were to come from Newmarket, with a general rising of the nation, and
especially of the city of London, disaffected to the present Government.Upon which were committed to the Tower, the Lord Russell, eldest son of
the Earl of Bedford, the Earl of Essex, Mr.Algernon Sidney, son to the
old Earl of Leicester, Mr.Trenchard, Hampden, Lord Howard of Escrick,
and others.A proclamation was issued against my Lord Grey, the Duke of
Monmouth, Sir Thomas Armstrong, and one Ferguson, who had escaped beyond
sea; of these some were said to be for killing the King, others for only
seizing on him, and persuading him to new counsels, on the pretense of
the danger of Popery, should the Duke live to succeed, who was now again
admitted to the councils and cabinet secrets.The Lords Essex and
Russell were much deplored, for believing they had any evil intention
against the King, or the Church; some thought they were cunningly drawn
in by their enemies for not approving some late counsels and management
relating to France, to Popery, to the persecution of the Dissenters,
etc.They were discovered by the Lord Howard of Escrick and some false
brethren of the club, and the design happily broken; had it taken
effect, it would, to all appearance, have exposed the Government to
unknown and dangerous events; which God avert!Was born my granddaughter at Sayes Court, and christened by the name of
Martha Maria, our Vicar officiating.I pray God bless her, and may she
choose the better part![Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1683.As I was visiting Sir Thomas Yarborough and his Lady,
in Covent Garden, the astonishing news was brought to us of the Earl of
Essex having cut his throat, having been but three days a prisoner in
the Tower, and this happened on the very day and instant that Lord
Russell was on his trial, and had sentence of death.This accident
exceedingly amazed me, my Lord Essex being so well known by me to be a
person of such sober and religious deportment, so well at his ease, and
so much obliged to the King.It is certain the King and Duke were at the
Tower, and passed by his window about the same time this morning, when
my Lord asking for a razor, shut himself into a closet, and perpetrated
the horrid act.Yet it was wondered by some how it was possible he
should do it in the manner he was found, for the wound was so deep and
wide, that being cut through the gullet, windpipe, and both the
jugulars, it reached to the very vertebrae of the neck, so that the head
held to it by a very little skin as it were; the gapping too of the
razor, and cutting his own fingers, was a little strange; but more, that
having passed the jugulars he should have strength to proceed so far,
that an executioner could hardly have done more with an ax.The fatal news coming to Hicks's Hall upon the article of my Lord
Russell's trial, was said to have had no little influence on the Jury
and all the Bench to his prejudice.Others said that he had himself on
some occasions hinted that in case he should be in danger of having his
life taken from him by any public misfortune, those who thirsted for his
estate should miss of their aim; and that he should speak favorably of
that Earl of Northumberland,[51] and some others, who made away with
themselves; but these are discourses so unlike his sober and prudent
conversation that I have no inclination to credit them.What might
instigate him to this devilish act, I am not able to conjecture.My Lord
Clarendon, his brother-in-law, who was with him but the day before,
assured me he was then very cheerful, and declared it to be the effect
of his innocence and loyalty; and most believe that his Majesty had no
severe intentions against him, though he was altogether inexorable as to
Lord Russell and some of the rest.For my part, I believe the crafty and
ambitious Earl of Shaftesbury had brought them into some dislike of the
present carriage of matters at Court, not with any design of destroying
the monarchy (which Shaftesbury had in confidence and for unanswerable
reasons told me he would support to his last breath, as having seen and
felt the misery of being under mechanic tyranny), but perhaps of setting
up some other whom he might govern, and frame to his own platonic fancy,
without much regard to the religion established under the hierarchy, for
which he had no esteem; but when he perceived those whom he had engaged
to rise, fail of his expectations, and the day past, reproaching his
accomplices that a second day for an exploit of this nature was never
successful, he gave them the slip, and got into Holland, where the fox
died, three months before these unhappy Lords and others were discovered
or suspected.Every one deplored Essex and Russell, especially the last,
as being thought to have been drawn in on pretense only of endeavoring
to rescue the King from his present councilors, and secure religion from
Popery, and the nation from arbitrary government, now so much
apprehended; while the rest of those who were fled, especially Ferguson
and his gang, had doubtless some bloody design to get up a Commonwealth,
and turn all things topsy-turvy.Of the same tragical principles is
Sydney.[Footnote 51: Henry Percy, eighth Earl of Northumberland, shot
    himself in the Tower, to which he had been committed on a charge of
    high treason in June, 1585.]I had this day much discourse with Monsieur Pontaq, son to the famous
and wise prime President of Bordeaux.This gentleman was owner of that
excellent _vignoble_ of Pontaq and O'Brien, from whence come the
choicest of our Bordeaux wines; and I think I may truly say of him, what
was not so truly said of St.Paul, that much learning had made him mad.He had studied well in philosophy, but chiefly the Rabbins, and was
exceedingly addicted to cabalistical fancies, an eternal hablador
[romancer], and half distracted by reading abundance of the extravagant
Eastern Jews.He spoke all languages, was very rich, had a handsome
person, and was well bred, about forty-five years of age.Fraser, a learned Scotch gentleman, whom
I had formerly recommended to Lord Berkeley for the instruction and
government of his son, since dead at sea.He had now been in Holland at
the sale of the learned Heinsius's library, and showed me some very rare
and curious books, and some MSS., which he had purchased to good value.There were three or four Herbals in miniature, accurately done, divers
Roman antiquities of Verona, and very many books of Aldus's impression.A stranger, an old man, preached on Jerem.8, the
not hearkening to instruction, portentous of desolation to a people;
much after Bishop Andrew's method, full of logical divisions, in short
and broken periods, and Latin sentences, now quite out of fashion in the
pulpit, which is grown into a far more profitable way, of plain and
practical discourses, of which sort this nation, or any other, never had
greater plenty or more profitable (I am confident); so much has it to
answer for thriving no better on it.The public was now in great consternation on the late plot and
conspiracy; his Majesty very melancholy, and not stirring without double
guards; all the avenues and private doors about Whitehall and the Park
shut up, few admitted to walk in it.The <DW7>s, in the meantime, very
jocund; and indeed with reason, seeing their own plot brought to
nothing, and turned to ridicule, and now a conspiracy of Protestants, as
they called them.The Turks were likewise in hostility against the German Emperor, almost
masters of the Upper Hungary, and drawing toward Vienna.On the other
side, the French King (who it is believed brought in the infidels)
disturbing his Spanish and Dutch neighbors, having swallowed up almost
all Flanders, pursuing his ambition of a fifth universal monarchy; and
all this blood and disorder in Christendom had evidently its rise from
our defections at home, in a wanton peace, minding nothing but luxury,
ambition, and to procure money for our vices.To this add our irreligion
and atheism, great ingratitude, and self-interest; the apostacy of some,
and the suffering the French to grow so great, and the Hollanders so
weak.In a word, we were wanton, mad, and surfeiting with prosperity;
every moment unsettling the old foundations, and never constant to
anything.The Lord in mercy avert the sad omen, and that we do not
provoke him till he bear it no longer!This summer did we suffer twenty French men-of-war to pass our Channel
toward the Sound, to help the Danes against the Swedes, who had
abandoned the French interest, we not having ready sufficient to guard
our coasts, or take cognizance of what they did; though the nation never
had more, or a better navy, yet the sea had never so slender a fleet.George, Prince of Denmark, who had landed this day,
came to marry the Lady Anne, daughter to the Duke; so I returned home,
having seen the young gallant at dinner at Whitehall.Several of the conspirators of the lower form were
executed at Tyburn; and the next day,

[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st July, 1683.Lord Russell was beheaded in Lincoln's Inn Fields, the
executioner giving him three butcherly strokes.The speech he made, and
the paper which he gave the Sheriff declaring his innocence, the
nobleness of the family, the piety and worthiness of the unhappy
gentleman, wrought much pity, and occasioned various discourses on the
plot.I again saw Prince George of Denmark: he had the Danish
countenance, blonde, of few words, spoke French but ill, seemed somewhat
heavy, but reported to be valiant, and indeed he had bravely rescued and
brought off his brother, the King of Denmark, in a battle against the
Swedes, when both these Kings were engaged very smartly.He was married to the Lady Anne at Whitehall.Her Court
and household to be modeled as the Duke's, her father, had been, and
they to continue in England.Flamsted, the famous astronomer,
from his Observatory at Greenwich, to draw the meridian from my pendule,
etc.The Countesses of Bristol and Sunderland, aunt and
cousin-german of the late Lord Russell, came to visit me, and condole
his sad fate.The next day, came Colonel Russell, uncle to the late Lord
Russell, and brother to the Earl of Bedford, and with him Mrs.Middleton, that famous and indeed incomparable beauty, daughter to my
relation, Sir Robert Needham.I went to Bromley to visit our Bishop, and excellent
neighbor, and to congratulate his now being made Archbishop of York.On
the 28th, he came to take his leave of us, now preparing for his journey
and residence in his province.My sweet little grandchild, Martha Maria, died, and
on the 29th was buried in the parish church.This morning, was read in the church, after the
office was done, the Declaration setting forth the late conspiracy
against the King's person.I went to see what had been done by the Duke of
Beaufort on his lately purchased house at Chelsea, which I once had the
selling of for the Countess of Bristol, he had made great alterations,
but might have built a better house with the materials and the cost he
had been at.Saw the Countess of Monte Feltre, whose husband I had formerly known,
he was a subject of the Pope's, but becoming a Protestant he resided in
England, and married into the family of the Savilles, of Yorkshire.The
Count, her late husband, was a very learned gentleman, a great
politician, and a goodly man.She was accompanied by her sister,
exceedingly skilled in painting, nor did they spare for color on their
own faces.It being the day of public thanksgiving for his
Majesty's late preservation, the former Declaration was again read, and
there was an office used, composed for the occasion.A loyal sermon was
preached on the divine right of Kings, from Psalm cxliv."Thou hast
preserved David from the peril of the sword."Came to visit me the learned anatomist, Dr.Tyson,[52] with some other Fellows of our Society.[Footnote 52: Doctor Edward Tyson, a learned physician, born at
    Clevedon, Somersetshire, in 1649, who became reader of the
    anatomical lecture in Surgeons' Hall, and physician to the hospitals
    of Bethlehem and Bridewell, which offices he held at his death, Aug.He was an ingenious writer, and has left various Essays in
    the Philosophical Transactions and Hook's Collections.He published
    also "The Anatomy of a Porpoise Dissected at Gresham College," and
    "The Anatomy of a Pigmy Compared with a Monkey, an Ape, and a Man,"
    4to., 1698-99.]At the elegant villa and garden of Mr.He showed me the zinnar tree, or platanus, and told me that since
they had planted this kind of tree about the city of Ispahan, in Persia,
the plague, which formerly much infested the place, had exceedingly
abated of its mortal effects, and rendered it very healthy.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th September, 1683.I went to London to visit the Duchess of Grafton,
now great with child, a most virtuous and beautiful lady.Dining with
her at my Lord Chamberlain's, met my Lord of St.Alban's, now grown so
blind, that he could not see to take his meat.He has lived a most easy
life, in plenty even abroad, while his Majesty was a sufferer; he has
lost immense sums at play, which yet, at about eighty years old, he
continues, having one that sits by him to name the spots on the cards.He is a prudent old
courtier, and much enriched since his Majesty's return.After dinner, I walked to survey the sad demolition of Clarendon House,
that costly and only sumptuous palace of the late Lord Chancellor Hyde,
where I have often been so cheerful with him, and sometimes so sad:
happening to make him a visit but the day before he fled from the angry
Parliament, accusing him of maladministration, and being envious at his
grandeur, who from a private lawyer came to be father-in-law to the Duke
of York, and as some would suggest, designing his Majesty's marriage
with the Infanta of Portugal, not apt to breed.To this they imputed
much of our unhappiness; and that he, being sole minister and favorite
at his Majesty's restoration, neglected to gratify the King's suffering
party, preferring those who were the cause of our troubles.But perhaps
as many of these things were injuriously laid to his charge, so he kept
the government far steadier than it has proved since.I could name some
who I think contributed greatly to his ruin,--the buffoons and the
MISSIS, to whom he was an eye-sore.It is true he was of a jolly temper,
after the old English fashion; but France had now the ascendant, and we
were become quite another nation.The Chancellor gone, and dying in
exile, the Earl his successor sold that which cost L50,000 building, to
the young Duke of Albemarle for L25,000, to pay debts which how
contracted remains yet a mystery, his son being no way a prodigal.Some
imagine the Duchess his daughter had been chargeable to him.However it
were, this stately palace is decreed to ruin, to support the prodigious
waste the Duke of Albemarle had made of his estate, since the old man
died.He sold it to the highest bidder, and it fell to certain rich
bankers and mechanics, who gave for it and the ground about it, L35,000;
they design a new town, as it were, and a most magnificent piazza
[square].It is said they have already materials toward it with what
they sold of the house alone, more worth than what they paid for it.See
the vicissitudes of earthly things!I was astonished at this demolition,
nor less at the little army of laborers and artificers leveling the
ground, laying foundations, and contriving great buildings at an expense
of L200,000, if they perfect their design.In my walks I stepped into a goldbeater's
workhouse, where he showed me the wonderful ductility of that spreading
and oily metal.He said it must be finer than the standard, such as was
old angel-gold, and that of such he had once to the value of L100
stamped with the _agnus dei_, and coined at the time of the holy war;
which had been found in a ruined wall somewhere in the North, near to
Scotland, some of which he beat into leaves, and the rest sold to the
curiosi in antiquities and medals.We had now the welcome tidings of the King of
Poland raising the siege of Vienna, which had given terror to all
Europe, and utmost reproach to the French, who it is believed brought in
the Turks for diversion, that the French King might the more easily
swallow Flanders, and pursue his unjust conquest on the empire, while we
sat unconcerned and under a deadly charm from somebody.There was this day a collection for rebuilding Newmarket, consumed by an
accidental fire, which removing his Majesty thence sooner than was
intended, put by the assassins, who were disappointed of their
rendezvous and expectation by a wonderful providence.This made the King
more earnest to render Winchester the seat of his autumnal field
diversions for the future, designing a palace there, where the ancient
castle stood; infinitely indeed preferable to Newmarket for prospects,
air, pleasure, and provisions.The surveyor has already begun the
foundation for a palace, estimated to cost L35,000, and his Majesty is
purchasing ground about it to make a park, etc.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th October, 1683.I went to London, on receiving a note from the
Countess of Arlington, of some considerable charge or advantage I might
obtain by applying myself to his Majesty on this signal conjuncture of
his Majesty entering up judgment against the city charter; the proposal
made me I wholly declined, not being well satisfied with these violent
transactions, and not a little sorry that his Majesty was so often put
upon things of this nature against so great a city, the consequence
whereof may be so much to his prejudice; so I returned home.At this
time, the Lord Chief-Justice Pemberton was displaced.He was held to be
the most learned of the judges, and an honest man.Sir George Jeffreys
was advanced, reputed to be most ignorant, but most daring.Sir George
Treby, Recorder of London, was also put by, and one Genner, an obscure
lawyer, set in his place.Eight of the richest and chief aldermen were
removed and all the rest made only justices of the peace, and no more
wearing of gowns, or chains of gold; the Lord Mayor and two sheriffs
holding their places by new grants as _custodes_, at the King's
pleasure.The pomp and grandeur of the most august city in the world
thus changed face in a moment; which gave great occasion of discourse
and thoughts of hearts, what all this would end in.Prudent men were for
the old foundations.Following his Majesty this morning through the gallery, I went with the
few who attended him, into the Duchess of Portmouth's DRESSING ROOM
within her bedchamber, where she was in her morning loose garment, her
maids combing her, newly out of her bed, his Majesty and the gallants
standing about her; but that which engaged my curiosity, was the rich
and splendid furniture of this woman's apartment, now twice or thrice
pulled down and rebuilt to satisfy her prodigal and expensive pleasures,
while her Majesty's does not exceed some gentlemen's ladies in furniture
and accommodation.Here I saw the new fabric of French tapestry, for
design, tenderness of work, and incomparable imitation of the best
paintings, beyond anything I had ever beheld.Some pieces had
Versailles, St.Germains, and other palaces of the French King, with
huntings, figures, and landscapes, exotic fowls, and all to the life
rarely done.Then for Japan cabinets, screens, pendule clocks, great
vases of wrought plate, tables, stands, chimney-furniture, sconces,
branches, braseras, etc., all of massy silver and out of number, besides
some of her Majesty's best paintings.Surfeiting of this, I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's and went contented home
to my poor, but quiet villa.What contentment can there be in the riches
and splendor of this world, purchased with vice and dishonor?Visited the Duchess of Grafton, not yet brought to
bed, and dining with my Lord Chamberlain (her father), went with them to
see Montague House, a palace lately built by Lord Montague, who had
married the most beautiful Countess of Northumberland.It is a stately
and ample palace.Signor Verrio's fresco paintings, especially the
funeral pile of Dido, on the staircase, the labors of Hercules, fight
with the Centaurs, his effeminacy with Dejanira, and Apotheosis or
reception among the gods, on the walls and roof of the great room
above,--I think exceeds anything he has yet done, both for design,
coloring, and exuberance of invention, comparable to the greatest of the
old masters, or what they so celebrate at Rome.In the rest of the
chamber are some excellent paintings of Holbein, and other masters.The
garden is large, and in good air, but the fronts of the house not
answerable to the inside.The court at entry, and wings for offices seem
too near the street, and that so very narrow and meanly built, that the
corridor is not in proportion to the rest, to hide the court from being
overlooked by neighbors; all which might have been prevented, had they
placed the house further into the ground, of which there was enough to
spare.But on the whole it is a fine palace, built after the French
pavilion-way, by Mr.Hooke, the Curator of the Royal Society.There were
with us my Lady Scroope, the great wit, and Monsieur Chardine, the
celebrated traveler.Came to visit me my old and worthy friend, Mr.Packer, bringing with him his nephew Berkeley, grandson to the honest
judge.A most ingenious, virtuous, and religious gentleman, seated near
Worcester, and very curious in gardening.I was at the court-leet of this manor, my Lord
Arlington his Majesty's High Steward.Came to visit and dine with me, Mr.Brisbane,
Secretary to the Admiralty, a learned and agreeable man.I went to Kew to visit Sir Henry Capell, brother to
the late Earl of Essex; but he being gone to Cashiobury, after I had
seen his garden and the alterations therein, I returned home.He had
repaired his house, roofed his hall with a kind of cupola, and in a
niche was an artificial fountain; but the room seems to me
over-melancholy, yet might be much improved by having the walls well
painted _a fresco_.The two green houses for oranges and myrtles,
communicating with the rooms below, are very well contrived.There is a
cupola made with pole-work between two elms at the end of a walk, which
being covered by plashing the trees to them, is very pretty; for the
rest there are too many fir trees in the garden.[Sidenote: LONDON]

17th November, 1683.I took a house in Villiers Street, York Buildings,
for the winter, having many important concerns to dispatch, and for the
education of my daughters.The Duke of Monmouth, till now proclaimed traitor on
the pretended plot for which Lord Russell was lately beheaded, came this
evening to Whitehall and rendered himself, on which were various
discourses.I went to compliment the Duchess of Grafton, now
lying-in of her first child, a son, which she called for, that I might
see it.She was become more beautiful, if it were possible, than before,
and full of virtue and sweetness.She discoursed with me of many
particulars, with great prudence and gravity beyond her years.Forbes showed me the plot of the garden making
at Burleigh, at my Lord Exeter's, which I looked on as one of the most
noble that I had seen.The whole court and town in solemn mourning for the death of the King of
Portugal, her Majesty's brother.At the anniversary dinner of the Royal Society the
King sent us two does.I was this day invited to a wedding of one Mrs.Castle, to whom I had some obligation, and it was to her fifth husband,
a lieutenant-colonel of the city.She was the daughter of one Burton, a
broom-man, by his wife, who sold kitchen stuff in Kent Street, whom God
so blessed that the father became a very rich, and was a very honest
man; he was sheriff of Surrey, where I have sat on the bench with him.Another of his daughters was married to Sir John Bowles; and this
daughter was a jolly friendly woman.There was at the wedding the Lord
Mayor, the Sheriff, several Aldermen and persons of quality; above all,
Sir George Jeffreys, newly made Lord Chief Justice of England, with Mr.Justice Withings, danced with the bride, and were exceedingly merry.These great men spent the rest of the afternoon, till eleven at night,
in drinking healths, taking tobacco, and talking much beneath the
gravity of judges, who had but a day or two before condemned Mr.Algernon Sidney, who was executed the 7th on Tower Hill, on the single
witness of that monster of a man, Lord Howard of Escrick, and some
sheets of paper taken in Mr.Sidney's study, pretended to be written by
him, but not fully proved, nor the time when, but appearing to have been
written before his Majesty's Restoration, and then pardoned by the Act
of Oblivion; so that though Mr.Sidney was known to be a person
obstinately averse to government by a monarch (the subject of the paper
was in answer to one by Sir E. Filmer), yet it was thought he had very
hard measure.There is this yet observable, that he had been an
inveterate enemy to the last king, and in actual rebellion against him;
a man of great courage, great sense, great parts, which he showed both
at his trial and death; for, when he came on the scaffold, instead of a
speech, he told them only that he had made his peace with God, that he
came not thither to talk, but to die; put a paper into the sheriff's
hand, and another into a friend's; said one prayer as short as a grace,
laid down his neck, and bid the executioner do his office.The Duke of Monmouth, now having his pardon, refuses to acknowledge
there was any treasonable plot; for which he is banished Whitehall.This
is a great disappointment to some who had prosecuted Trenchard, Hampden,
etc., that for want of a second witness were come out of the Tower upon
their _habeas corpus_.The King had now augmented his guards with a new sort of dragoons, who
carried also grenades, and were habited after the Polish manner, with
long peaked caps, very fierce and fantastical.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th December, 1683.I went to the Tower, and visited the Earl of Danby,
the late Lord High Treasurer, who had been imprisoned four years: he
received me with great kindness.I dined with him, and stayed till
night.We had discourse of many things, his Lady railing sufficiently at
the keeping her husband so long in prison.Here I saluted the Lord
Dumblaine's wife, who before had been married to Emerton, and about whom
there was that scandalous business before the delegates.The smallpox very prevalent and mortal; the Thames
frozen.I dined at Lord Clarendon's, where I was to meet
that ingenious and learned gentleman, Sir George Wheeler, who has
published the excellent description of Africa and Greece, and who, being
a knight of a very fair estate and young, had now newly entered into
holy orders.I went to visit Sir John Chardin, a French
gentleman, who traveled three times by land into Persia, and had made
many curious researches in his travels, of which he was now setting
forth a relation.It being in England this year one of the severest
frosts that has happened of many years, he told me the cold in Persia
was much greater, the ice of an incredible thickness; that they had
little use of iron in all that country, it being so moist (though the
air admirably clear and healthy) that oil would not preserve it from
rusting, so that they had neither clocks nor watches; some padlocks they
had for doors and boxes.Sprat, now made Dean of Westminster, preached
to the King at Whitehall, on Matt.Recollecting the passages of
the past year, I gave God thanks for his mercies, praying his blessing
for the future.The weather continuing intolerably severe, streets
of booths were set up on the Thames; the air was so very cold and thick,
as of many years there had not been the like.I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's: after dinner came a
fellow who ate live charcoal, glowingly ignited, quenching them in his
mouth, and then champing and swallowing them down.There was a dog also
which seemed to do many rational actions.I went across the Thames on the ice, now become so
thick as to bear not only streets of booths, in which they roasted meat,
and had divers shops of wares, quite across as in a town, but coaches,
carts, and horses passed over.So I went from Westminster stairs to
Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop: where I met my Lord Bruce, Sir
George Wheeler, Colonel Cooke, and several divines.After dinner and
discourse with his Grace till evening prayers, Sir George Wheeler and I
walked over the ice from Lambeth stairs to the Horse-ferry.I visited Sir Robert Reading, where after supper we
had music, but not comparable to that which Mrs.Bridgeman made us on
the guitar with such extraordinary skill and dexterity.The Thames was filled with people and tents selling
all sorts of wares as in the city.The frost continues more and more severe, the Thames
before London was still planted with booths in formal streets, all sorts
of trades and shops furnished, and full of commodities, even to a
printing press, where the people and ladies took a fancy to have their
names printed, and the day and year set down when printed on the Thames:
this humor took so universally, that it was estimated that the printer
gained L5 a day, for printing a line only, at sixpence a name, besides
what he got by ballads, etc.Coaches plied from Westminster to the
Temple, and from several other stairs to and fro, as in the streets,
sleds, sliding with skates, a bull-baiting, horse and coach-races,
puppet-plays and interludes, cooks, tippling, and other lewd places, so
that it seemed to be a bacchanalian triumph, or carnival on the water,
while it was a severe judgment on the land, the trees not only splitting
as if the lightning struck, but men and cattle perishing in divers
places, and the very seas so locked up with ice, that no vessels could
stir out or come in.The fowls, fish, and birds, and all our exotic
plants and greens, universally perishing.Many parks of deer were
destroyed, and all sorts of fuel so dear, that there were great
contributions to preserve the poor alive.Nor was this severe weather
much less intense in most parts of Europe, even as far as Spain and the
most southern tracts.London, by reason of the excessive coldness of the
air hindering the ascent of the smoke, was so filled with the fuliginous
steam of the sea-coal, that hardly could one see across the street, and
this filling the lungs with its gross particles, exceedingly obstructed
the breast, so as one could scarcely breathe.Here was no water to be
had from the pipes and engines, nor could the brewers and divers other
tradesmen work, and every moment was full of disastrous accidents.I went to Sayes Court to see how the frost had
dealt with my garden, where I found many of the greens and rare plants
utterly destroyed.The oranges and myrtles very sick, the rosemary and
laurels dead to all appearance, but the cypress likely to endure it.It began to thaw, but froze again.My coach crossed
from Lambeth, to the Horse-ferry at Milbank, Westminster.The booths
were almost all taken down; but there was first a map or landscape cut
in copper representing all the manner of the camp, and the several
actions, sports, and pastimes thereon, in memory of so signal a frost.I dined with my Lord Keeper, [North], and walking
alone with him some time in his gallery, we had discourse of music.He
told me he had been brought up to it from a child, so as to sing his
part at first sight.Then speaking of painting, of which he was also a
great lover, and other ingenious matters, he desired me to come oftener
to him.I went this evening to visit that great and knowing
virtuoso, Monsieur Justell.The weather was set in to an absolute thaw
and rain; but the Thames still frozen.After eight weeks missing the foreign posts, there
came abundance of intelligence from abroad.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th February, 1684.The Earl of Danby, late Lord-Treasurer, together
with the Roman Catholic Lords impeached of high treason in the Popish
Plot, had now their _habeas corpus_, and came out upon bail, after five
years' imprisonment in the Tower.Then were also tried and deeply fined
Mr.Hampden and others, for being supposed of the late plot, for which
Lord Russell and Colonel Sidney suffered; as also the person who went
about to prove that the Earl of Essex had his throat cut in the Tower by
others; likewise Mr.Johnson, the author of that famous piece called
Julian.News of the Prince of Orange having accused the
Deputies of Amsterdam of _crimen laesae Majestatis_, and being pensioners
to France.Tenison communicated to me his intention of erecting a library in
St.Martin's parish, for the public use, and desired my assistance, with
Sir Christopher Wren, about the placing and structure thereof, a worthy
and laudable design.He told me there were thirty or forty young men in
Orders in his parish, either governors to young gentlemen or chaplains
to noblemen, who being reproved by him on occasion for frequenting
taverns or coffeehouses, told him they would study or employ their time
better, if they had books.This put the pious Doctor on this design; and
indeed a great reproach it is that so great a city as London should not
have a public library becoming it.Paul's;
the west end of that church (if ever finished) would be a convenient
place.I went to Sir John Chardin, who desired my
assistance for the engraving the plates, the translation, and printing
his History of that wonderful Persian Monument near Persepolis, and
other rare antiquities, which he had caused to be drawn from the
originals in his second journey into Persia, which we now concluded
upon.Afterward, I went with Sir Christopher Wren to Dr.Tenison, where
we made the drawing and estimate of the expense of the library, to be
begun this next spring near the Mews.Great expectation of the Prince of Orange's attempts in Holland to bring
those of Amsterdam to consent to the new levies, to which we were no
friends, by a pseudo-politic adherence to the French interest.Turner, our new Bishop of
Rochester.I dined at Lady Tuke's, where I heard Dr.Walgrave
(physician to the Duke and Duchess) play excellently on the lute.Meggot, Dean of Winchester, preached an
incomparable sermon (the King being now gone to Newmarket), on Heb.15, showing and pathetically pressing the care we ought to have lest we
come short of the grace of God.Tenison
at Kensington, whither he was retired to refresh, after he had been sick
of the smallpox.Henry Godolphin, a prebend
of St.Paul's, and brother to my dear friend Sydney, on Isaiah 1v.I
dined at the Lord Keeper's, and brought him to Sir John Chardin, who
showed him his accurate drafts of his travels in Persia.There was so great a concourse of people with their
children to be touched for the Evil, that six or seven were crushed to
death by pressing at the chirurgeon's door for tickets.The weather
began to be more mild and tolerable; but there was not the least
appearance of any spring.The Bishop of Rochester preached before
the King; after which his Majesty, accompanied with three of his natural
sons, the Dukes of Northumberland, Richmond, and St.Alban (sons of
Portsmouth, Cleveland, and Nelly), went up to the altar; the three boys
entering before the King within the rails, at the right hand, and three
bishops on the left: London (who officiated), Durham, and Rochester,
with the subdean, Dr.The King, kneeling before the altar,
making his offering, the Bishops first received, and then his Majesty;
after which he retired to a canopied seat on the right hand.Note, there
was perfume burned before the office began.I had received the Sacrament
at Whitehall early with the Lords and household, the Bishop of London
officiating.Tenison preached
(recovered from the smallpox); then went again to Whitehall as above.I returned home with my family to my house at Sayes
Court, after five months' residence in London; hardly the least
appearance of any spring.A letter of mine to the Royal Society concerning the
terrible effects of the past winter being read, they desired it might be
printed in the next part of their "Transactions."[Sidenote: SURREY]

10th May, 1684.Called by the way
at Ashted, where Sir Robert Howard (Auditor of the Exchequer)
entertained me very civilly at his newly-built house, which stands in a
park on the Down, the avenue south; though down hill to the house, which
is not great, but with the outhouses very convenient.The staircase is
painted by Verrio with the story of Astrea; among other figures is the
picture of the painter himself, and not unlike him; the rest is well
done, only the columns did not at all please me; there is also Sir
Robert's own picture in an oval; the whole in _fresco_.The place has
this great defect, that there is no water but what is drawn up by horses
from a very deep well.Higham, who was ill, and died three days
after.His grandfather and father (who christened me), with himself, had
now been rectors of this parish 101 years, viz, from May, 1583.I returned to London, where I found the Commissioners of
the Admiralty abolished, and the office of Admiral restored to the Duke,
as to the disposing and ordering all sea business; but his Majesty
signed all petitions, papers, warrants, and commissions, that the Duke,
not acting as admiral by commission or office, might not incur the
penalty of the late Act against <DW7>s and Dissenters holding offices,
and refusing the oath and test.Every one was glad of this change, those
in the late Commission being utterly ignorant in their duty, to the
great damage of the Navy.The utter ruin of the Low Country was threatened by the siege of
Luxemburg, if not timely relieved, and by the obstinacy of the
Hollanders, who refused to assist the Prince of Orange, being corrupted
by the French.I received L600 of Sir Charles Bickerstaff for the fee
farm of Pilton, in Devon.Lord Dartmouth was chosen Master of the Trinity Company,
newly returned with the fleet from blowing up and demolishing Tangier.In the sermon preached on this occasion, Dr.Can observed that, in the
27th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, the casting anchor out of the
fore ship had been caviled at as betraying total ignorance: that it is
very true our seamen do not do so; but in the Mediterranean their ships
were built differently from ours, and to this day it was the practice to
do so there.Luxemburg was surrendered to the French, which makes them master of all
the Netherlands, gives them entrance into Germany, and a fair game for
universal monarchy; which that we should suffer, who only and easily
might have hindered, astonished all the world.Thus is the poor Prince
of Orange ruined, and this nation and all the Protestant interest in
Europe following, unless God in his infinite mercy, as by a miracle,
interpose, and our great ones alter their counsels.The French fleet
were now besieging Genoa, but after burning much of that beautiful city
with their bombs, went off with disgrace.My cousin, Verney, to whom a very great fortune was
fallen, came to take leave of us, going into the country; a very worthy
and virtuous young gentleman.I went to advise and give directions about the building
of two streets in Berkeley Garden, reserving the house and as much of
the garden as the breadth of the house.In the meantime, I could not but
deplore that sweet place (by far the most noble gardens, courts, and
accommodations, stately porticos, etc., anywhere about the town) should
be so much straitened and turned into tenements.But that magnificent
pile and gardens contiguous to it, built by the late Lord Chancellor
Clarendon, being all demolished, and designed for piazzas and buildings,
was some excuse for my Lady Berkeley's resolution of letting out her
ground also for so excessive a price as was offered, advancing near
L1,000 per annum in mere ground rents; to such a mad intemperance was
the age come of building about a city, by far too disproportionate
already to the nation:[53] I having in my time seen it almost as large
again as it was within my memory.[Footnote 53: What would Evelyn think if he could see what is now
    called London?]Last Friday, Sir Thomas Armstrong was executed at Tyburn
for treason, without trial, having been outlawed and apprehended in
Holland, on the conspiracy of the Duke of Monmouth, Lord Russell, etc.,
which gave occasion of discourse to people and lawyers, in regard it was
on an outlawry that judgment was given and execution.[54]

    [Footnote 54: When brought up for judgment, Armstrong insisted on
    his right to a trial, the act giving that right to those who came in
    within a year, and the year not having expired.Jefferies refused
    it; and when Armstrong insisted that he asked nothing but law,
    Jefferies told him he should have it to the full, and ordered his
    execution in six days.When Jefferies went to the King at Windsor
    soon after, the King took a ring from his finger and gave it to
    Jefferies.[Sidenote: GREENWICH]

2d July, 1684.I went to the Observatory at Greenwich, where Mr.Flamsted took his observations of the eclipse of the sun, now almost
three parts obscured.There had been an excessively hot and dry spring, and such a drought
still continued as never was in my memory.Some small sprinkling of rain; the leaves dropping
from the trees as in autumn.I dined at Lord Falkland's, Treasurer of the Navy,
where after dinner we had rare music, there being among others, Signor
Pietro Reggio, and Signor John Baptist, both famous, one for his voice,
the other for playing on the harpsichord, few if any in Europe exceeding
him.There was also a Frenchman who sung an admirable bass.I returned home, where I found my Lord Chief Justice
[Jefferies], the Countess of Clarendon, and Lady Catherine Fitzgerald,
who dined with me.We had now rain after such a drought as no man in
England had known.We had not had above one or two
considerable showers, and those storms, these eight or nine months.Many
trees died for the want of refreshment.Sidney Godolphin was made Baron Godolphin.The King being returned from Winchester, there was
a numerous Court at Whitehall.At this time the Earl of Rochester was removed from the Treasury to the
Presidentship of the Council; Lord Godolphin was made first Commissioner
of the Treasury in his place, Lord Middleton (a Scot) made Secretary of
State, in the room of Lord Godolphin.These alterations being very
unexpected and mysterious, gave great occasion of discourse.There was now an Ambassador from the King of Siam, in the East Indies,
to his Majesty.I went with Sir William Godolphin to see the
rhinoceros, or unicorn, being the first that I suppose was ever brought
into England.She belonged to some East India merchants, and was sold
(as I remember) for above L2,000.At the same time, I went to see a
crocodile, brought from some of the West India Islands, resembling the
Egyptian crocodile.I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's with the Duke of
Northumberland.He seemed to be a young gentleman of good capacity, well
bred, civil and modest: newly come from travel, and had made his
campaign at the siege of Luxemburg.Of all his Majesty's children (of
which he had now six Dukes) this seemed the most accomplished and worth
the owning.What the
Dukes of Richmond and St.Alban's will prove, their youth does not yet
discover; they are very pretty boys.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1684.Goodman preached before the King on James ii.12, concerning the law of liberty: an excellent discourse and in good
method.He is author of "The Prodigal Son," a treatise worth reading,
and another of the old religion.I visited the Lord Chamberlain, where dined the
BLACK BARON and Monsieur Flamerin, who had so long been banished from
France for a duel.I carried Lord Clarendon through the city amid all
the squibs and bacchanalia of the Lord Mayor's show, to the Royal
Society, where he was proposed a member; and then treated him at dinner.Clement's, that prettily built and contrived church where
a young divine gave us an eloquent sermon on 1 Cor.20, inciting to
gratitude and glorifying God for the fabric of our bodies and the
dignity of our nature.A sudden change from temperate warm weather to an
excessive cold rain, frost, snow, and storm, such as had seldom been
known.This winter weather began as early and fierce as the past did
late; till about Christmas there then had been hardly any winter.Turner, now translated from Rochester to Ely
upon the death of Dr.Peter Gunning, preached before the King at
Whitehall on Romans iii.8, a very excellent sermon, vindicating the
Church of England against the pernicious doctrines of the Church of
Rome.He challenged the producing but of five clergymen who forsook our
Church and went over to that of Rome, during all the troubles and
rebellion in England, which lasted near twenty years; and this was to my
certain observation a great truth.Being the Queen's birthday, there were fireworks
on the Thames before Whitehall, with pageants of castles, forts, and
other devices of girandolas, serpents, the King and Queen's arms and
mottoes, all represented in fire, such as had not been seen here.But
the most remarkable was the several fires and skirmishes in the very
water, which actually moved a long way, burning under the water, now and
then appearing above it, giving reports like muskets and cannon, with
grenades and innumerable other devices.It is said it cost L1,500.It
was concluded with a ball, where all the young ladies and gallants
danced in the great hall.The court had not been seen so brave and rich
in apparel since his Majesty's Restoration.Fiennes, son of the Lord Say
and Seale, preached before the King on Joshua xxi.Slingsby (Master of the
Mint), to see Mr.The series of Popes
was rare, and so were several among the moderns, especially that of John
Huss's martyrdom at Constance; of the Roman Emperors, Consulars some
Greek, etc., in copper, gold, and silver; not many truly antique; a
medallion of Otho Paulus Aemilius, etc., ancient.They were held at a
price of L1,000; but not worth, I judge, above L200.I went to see the new church at St.James's,
elegantly built; the altar was especially adorned, the white marble
inclosure curiously and richly carved, the flowers and garlands about
the walls by Mr.Gibbons, in wood: a pelican with her young at her
breast; just over the altar in the carved compartment and border
environing the purple velvet fringed with I. H. S. richly embroidered,
and most noble plate, were given by Sir R. Geere, to the value (as was
said) of L200.There was no altar anywhere in England, nor has there
been any abroad, more handsomely adorned.James's Park
to see three Turkish, or Asian horses, newly brought over, and now first
shown to his Majesty.There were four, but one of them died at sea,
being three weeks coming from Hamburg.They were taken from a Bashaw at
the siege of Vienna, at the late famous raising that leaguer.I never
beheld so delicate a creature as one of them was, of somewhat a bright
bay, two white feet, a blaze; such a head, eyes, ears, neck, breast,
belly, haunches, legs, pasterns, and feet, in all regards, beautiful,
and proportioned to admiration; spirited, proud, nimble, making halt,
turning with that swiftness, and in so small a compass, as was
admirable.With all this so gentle and tractable as called to mind what
I remember Busbequius, speaks of them, to the reproach of our grooms in
Europe, who bring up their horses so churlishly, as makes most of them
retain their ill habits.They trotted like does, as if they did not feel
the ground.Five hundred guineas was demanded for the first; 300 for the
second; and 200 for the third, which was brown.All of them were
choicely shaped, but the two last not altogether so perfect as the
first.It was judged by the spectators, among whom was the King, Prince of
Denmark, Duke of York, and several of the Court, noble persons skilled
in horses, especially Monsieur Faubert and his son (provost masters of
the Academy, and esteemed of the best in Europe), that there were never
seen any horses in these parts to be compared with them.Add to all
this, the furniture consisting of embroidery on the saddle, housings,
quiver, bow, arrows, scymitar, sword, mace, or battle-ax, _a la
Turcisq_; the Bashaw's velvet mantle furred with the most perfect ermine
I ever beheld; all which, ironwork in common furniture being here of
silver, curiously wrought and double gilt to an incredible value.Such
and so extraordinary was the embroidery, that I never saw anything
approaching it.The reins and headstall were of crimson silk, covered
with chains of silver gilt.There was also a Turkish royal standard of a
horse's tail, together with all sorts of other caparisons belonging to a
general's horse, by which one may estimate how gallantly and
magnificently those infidels appear in the field; for nothing could be
seen more glorious.The gentleman (a German) who rode the horse, was in
all this garb.They were shod with iron made round and closed at the
heel, with a hole in the middle about as wide as a shilling.I went with Lord Cornwallis to see the young
gallants do their exercise.Faubert having newly railed in a manage,
and fitted it for the academy.There were the Dukes of Norfolk and
Northumberland, Lord Newburgh, and a nephew of (Duras) Earl of
Feversham.The exercises were, 1, running at the ring; 2, flinging a
javelin at a Moor's head; 3, discharging a pistol at a mark; lastly
taking up a gauntlet with the point of a sword; all these performed in
full speed.The Duke of Northumberland hardly missed of succeeding in
every one, a dozen times, as I think.The Duke of Norfolk did exceeding
bravely.Lords Newburgh and Duras seemed nothing so dexterous.Here I
saw the difference of what the French call "_bel homme a cheval_," and
"_bon homme a cheval_"; the Duke of Norfolk being the first, that is
rather a fine person on a horse, the Duke of Northumberland being both
in perfection, namely, a graceful person and an excellent rider.But the
Duke of Norfolk told me he had not been at this exercise these twelve
years before.There were in the field the Prince of Denmark, and the
Lord Lansdowne, son of the Earl of Bath, who had been made a Count of
the Empire last summer for his service before Vienna.John, a worthy gentleman, on a knight
of quality, in a tavern.So
many horrid murders and duels were committed about this time as were
never before heard of in England; which gave much cause of complaint and
murmurings.It proved so sharp weather, and so long and cruel
a frost, that the Thames was frozen across, but the frost was often
dissolved, and then froze again.5, after
the Presbyterian tedious method and repetition.I dined at Lord Newport's, who had some excellent
pictures, especially that of Sir Thomas Hanmer, by Vandyke, one of the
best he ever painted; another of our English Dobson's painting; but,
above all, Christ in the Virgin's lap, by Poussin, an admirable piece;
with something of most other famous hands.I saw this
evening such a scene of profuse gaming, and the King in the midst of his
three concubines, as I have never before seen--luxurious dallying and
profaneness.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, being invited to hear
that celebrated voice of Mr.Pordage, newly come from Rome; his singing
was after the Venetian recitative, as masterly as could be, and with an
excellent voice both treble and bass; Dr.Walgrave accompanied it with
his THEORBO LUTE, on which he performed beyond imagination, and is
doubtless one of the greatest masters in Europe on that charming
instrument.Pordage is a priest, as Mr.There was in the room where we dined, and in his bedchamber, those
incomparable pieces of Columbus, a Flagellation, the Grammar school, the
Venus and Adonis of Titian; and of Vandyke's that picture of the late
Earl of Digby (father of the Countess of Sunderland), and Earl of
Bedford, Sir Kenelm Digby, and two ladies of incomparable performance;
besides that of Moses and the burning bush of Bassano, and several other
pieces of the best masters.A marble head of M. Brutus, etc.I was invited to my Lord Arundel's, of Wardour (now
newly released of his six years' confinement in the Tower on suspicion
of the plot called Oates's Plot), where after dinner the same Mr.Pordage entertained us with his voice, that excellent and stupendous
artist, Signor John Baptist, playing to it on the harpsichord.My
daughter Mary being with us, she also sang to the great satisfaction of
both the masters, and a world of people of quality present.She did so also at my Lord Rochester's the evening following, where we
had the French boy so famed for his singing, and indeed he had a
delicate voice, and had been well taught.Packer
(daughter to my old friend) sing before his Majesty and the Duke,
privately, that stupendous bass, Gosling, accompanying her, but hers was
so loud as took away much of the sweetness.Certainly never woman had a
stronger or better ear, could she possibly have governed it.She would
do rarely in a large church among the nuns.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th February, 1685.I went to London, hearing his Majesty had been the
Monday before (2d February) surprised in his bedchamber with an
apoplectic fit, so that if, by God's providence, Dr.King (that
excellent chirurgeon as well as physician) had not been accidentally
present to let him bleed (having his lancet in his pocket), his Majesty
had certainly died that moment; which might have been of direful
consequence, there being nobody else present with the King save this
Doctor and one more, as I am assured.It was a mark of the extraordinary
dexterity, resolution, and presence of mind in the Doctor, to let him
bleed in the very paroxysm, without staying the coming of other
physicians, which regularly should have been done, and for want of which
he must have a regular pardon, as they tell me.This rescued his Majesty
for the instant, but it was only a short reprieve.He still complained,
and was relapsing, often fainting, with sometimes epileptic symptoms,
till Wednesday, for which he was cupped, let bleed in both jugulars, and
both vomit and purges, which so relieved him, that on Thursday hopes of
recovery were signified in the public "Gazette," but that day about
noon, the physicians thought him feverish.This they seemed glad of, as
being more easily allayed and methodically dealt with than his former
fits; so as they prescribed the famous Jesuit's powder; but it made him
worse, and some very able doctors who were present did not think it a
fever, but the effect of his frequent bleeding and other sharp
operations used by them about his head, so that probably the powder
might stop the circulation, and renew his former fits, which now made
him very weak.Thus he passed Thursday night with great difficulty, when
complaining of a pain in his side, they drew twelve ounces more of blood
from him; this was by six in the morning on Friday, and it gave him
relief, but it did not continue, for being now in much pain, and
struggling for breath, he lay dozing, and, after some conflicts, the
physicians despairing of him, he gave up the ghost at half an hour after
eleven in the morning, being the sixth of February, 1685, in the 36th
year of his reign, and 54th of his age.Prayers were solemnly made in all the churches, especially in both the
Court Chapels, where the chaplains relieved one another every half
quarter of an hour from the time he began to be in danger till he
expired, according to the form prescribed in the Church offices.Those
who assisted his Majesty's devotions were, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Bishops of London, Durham, and Ely, but more especially Dr.Ken, the
Bishop of Bath and Wells.[55] It is said they exceedingly urged the
receiving Holy Sacrament, but his Majesty told them he would consider of
it, which he did so long till it was too late.Others whispered that the
Bishops and Lords, except the Earls of Bath and Feversham, being ordered
to withdraw the night before, Huddleston, the priest, had presumed to
administer the Popish offices.He gave his breeches and keys to the Duke
who was almost continually kneeling by his bedside, and in tears.He
also recommended to him the care of his natural children, all except the
Duke of Monmouth, now in Holland, and in his displeasure.He entreated
the Queen to pardon him (not without cause); who a little before had
sent a Bishop to excuse her not more frequently visiting him, in regard
of her excessive grief, and withal that his Majesty would forgive it if
at any time she had offended him.He spoke to the Duke to be kind to the
Duchess of Cleveland, and especially Portsmouth, and that Nelly might
not starve.[Footnote 55: The account given of this by Charles's brother and
    successor, is, that when the King's life was wholly despaired of,
    and it was time to prepare for another world, two Bishops came to do
    their function, who reading the prayers appointed in the Common
    Prayer Book on that occasion, when they came to the place where
    usually they exhort a sick person to make a confession of his sins,
    the Bishop of Bath and Wells, who was one of them, advertised him,
    IT WAS NOT OF OBLIGATION; and after a short exhortation, asked him
    if he was sorry for his sins?which the King saying he was, the
    Bishop pronounced the absolution, and then, asked him if he pleased
    to receive the Sacrament?to which the King made no reply; and being
    pressed by the Bishop several times, gave no other answer but that
    it was time enough, or that he would think of it.King James adds, that he stood all the while by the bedside, and
    seeing the King would not receive the Sacrament from them, and
    knowing his sentiments, he desired the company to stand a little
    from the bed, and then asked the King whether he should send for a
    priest, to which the King replied: "For God's sake, brother, do, and
    lose no time."The Duke said he would bring one to him; but none
    could be found except Father Huddleston, who had been so assistant
    in the King's escape from Worcester; he was brought up a back
    staircase, and the company were desired to withdraw, but he (the
    Duke of York) not thinking fit that he should be left alone with the
    King, desired the Earl of Bath, a Lord of the Bedchamber, and the
    Earl of Feversham, Captain of the Guard, should stay; the rest being
    gone, Father Huddleston was introduced, and administered the
    Sacrament.--"Life of James II."]Thus died King Charles II., of a vigorous and robust constitution, and
in all appearance promising a long life.He was a prince of many
virtues, and many great imperfections; debonair, easy of access, not
bloody nor cruel; his countenance fierce, his voice great, proper of
person, every motion became him; a lover of the sea, and skillful in
shipping; not affecting other studies, yet he had a laboratory, and knew
of many empirical medicines, and the easier mechanical mathematics; he
loved planting and building, and brought in a politer way of living,
which passed to luxury and intolerable expense.He had a particular
talent in telling a story, and facetious passages, of which he had
innumerable; this made some buffoons and vicious wretches too
presumptuous and familiar, not worthy the favor they abused.He took
delight in having a number of little spaniels follow him and lie in his
bedchamber, where he often suffered the bitches to puppy and give suck,
which rendered it very offensive, and indeed made the whole court nasty
and stinking.He would doubtless have been an excellent prince, had he
been less addicted to women, who made him uneasy, and always in want to
supply their immeasurable profusion, to the detriment of many indigent
persons who had signally served both him and his father.He frequently
and easily changed favorites to his great prejudice.As to other public transactions, and unhappy miscarriages, 'tis not
here I intend to number them; but certainly never had King more glorious
opportunities to have made himself, his people, and all Europe happy,
and prevented innumerable mischiefs, had not his too easy nature
resigned him to be managed by crafty men, and some abandoned and profane
wretches who corrupted his otherwise sufficient parts, disciplined as he
had been by many afflictions during his banishment, which gave him much
experience and knowledge of men and things; but those wicked creatures
took him from off all application becoming so great a King.The history
of his reign will certainly be the most wonderful for the variety of
matter and accidents, above any extant in former ages: the sad tragical
death of his father, his banishment and hardships, his miraculous
restoration, conspiracies against him, parliaments, wars, plagues,
fires, comets, revolutions abroad happening in his time, with a thousand
other particulars.He was ever kind to me, and very gracious upon all
occasions, and therefore I cannot without ingratitude but deplore his
loss, which for many respects, as well as duty, I do with all my soul.His Majesty being dead, the Duke, now King James II., went immediately
to Council, and before entering into any business, passionately
declaring his sorrow, told their Lordships, that since the succession
had fallen to him, he would endeavor to follow the example of his
predecessor in his clemency and tenderness to his people; that, however
he had been misrepresented as affecting arbitrary power, they should
find the contrary; for that the laws of England had made the King as
great a monarch as he could desire; that he would endeavor to maintain
the Government both in Church and State, as by law established, its
principles being so firm for monarchy, and the members of it showing
themselves so good and loyal subjects;[56] and that, as he would never
depart from the just rights and prerogatives of the Crown, so he would
never invade any man's property; but as he had often adventured his life
in defense of the nation, so he would still proceed, and preserve it in
all its lawful rights and liberties.[Footnote 56: This is the substance (and very nearly the words
    employed) of what is stated by King James II.printed in
    his life; but in that MS.For example, after speaking of the members of the Church of England
    as good and loyal subjects, the King adds, "AND THEREFORE I SHALL
    ALWAYS TAKE CARE TO DEFEND AND SUPPORT IT."James then goes on to
    say, that being desired by some present to allow copies to be taken,
    he said he had not committed it to writing; on which Mr.Finch (then
    Solicitor-General and afterward Earl of Aylesford) replied, that
    what his Majesty had said had made so deep an impression on him,
    that he believed he could repeat the very words, and if his Majesty
    would permit him, he would write them down, which the King agreeing
    to, he went to a table and wrote them down, and this being shown to
    the King, he approved of it, and it was immediately published.The
    King afterward proceeds to say: "No one can wonder that Mr.Finch
    should word the speech as strong as he could in favor of the
    Established Religion, nor that the King in such a hurry should pass
    it over without reflection; for though his Majesty intended to
    promise both security to their religion and protection to their
    persons, he was afterward convinced it had been better expressed by
    assuring them he never would endeavor to alter the Established
    Religion, than that he would endeavor to preserve it, and that he
    would rather support and defend the professors of it, than the
    religion itself; they could not expect he should make a conscience
    of supporting what in his conscience he thought erroneous: his
    engaging not to molest the professors of it, nor to deprive them or
    their successors of any spiritual dignity, revenue, or employment,
    but to suffer the ecclesiastical affairs to go on in the track they
    were in, was all they could wish or desire from a Prince of a
    different persuasion; but having once approved that way of
    expressing it which Mr.Finch had made choice of, he thought it
    necessary not to vary from it in the declarations or speeches he
    made afterward, not doubting but the world would understand it in
    the meaning he intended.----'Tis true, afterward IT WAS pretended
    he kept not up to this engagement; but had they deviated no further
    from the duty and allegience which both nature and repeated oath
    obliged them to, THAN HE DID FROM HIS WORD, they had still remained
    as happy a people as they really were during his short reign in
    England."The words printed in small
    caps in this extract are from the interlineations of the son of King
    James II.]This being the substance of what he said, the Lords desired it might be
published, as containing matter of great satisfaction to a jealous
people upon this change, which his Majesty consented to.Then were the
Council sworn, and a Proclamation ordered to be published that all
officers should continue in their stations, that there might be no
failure of public justice, till his further pleasure should be known.Then the King rose, the Lords accompanying him to his bedchamber, where,
while he reposed himself, tired indeed as he was with grief and
watching, they returned again into the Council chamber to take order for
the PROCLAIMING his Majesty, which (after some debate) they consented
should be in the very form his grandfather, King James I., was, after
the death of Queen Elizabeth; as likewise that the Lords, etc., should
proceed in their coaches through the city for the more solemnity of it.Upon this was I, and several other gentlemen waiting in the Privy
gallery, admitted into the Council chamber to be witness of what was
resolved on.Thence with the Lords, Lord Marshal and Heralds, and other
Crown officers being ready, we first went to Whitehall gate, where the
Lords stood on foot bareheaded, while the Herald proclaimed his
Majesty's title to the Imperial Crown and succession according to the
form, the trumpets and kettledrums having first sounded three times,
which ended with the people's acclamations.Then a herald called the
Lords' coaches according to rank, myself accompanying the solemnity in
my Lord Cornwallis's coach, first to Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor
and his brethren met us on horseback, in all their formalities, and
proclaimed the King; hence to the Exchange in Cornhill, and so we
returned in the order we set forth.Being come to Whitehall, we all went
and kissed the King and Queen's hands.He had been on the bed, but was
now risen and in his undress.The Queen was in bed in her apartment, but
put forth her hand, seeming to be much afflicted, as I believe she was,
having deported herself so decently upon all occasions since she came
into England, which made her universally beloved.I can never forget the inexpressible luxury and profaneness, gaming, and
all dissoluteness, and as it were total forgetfulness of God (it being
Sunday evening), which this day se'nnight I was witness of, the King
sitting and toying with his concubines, Portsmouth, Cleveland, and
Mazarin, etc., a French boy singing love songs[57] in that glorious
gallery, while about twenty of the great courtiers and other dissolute
persons were at Basset round a large table, a bank of at least 2,000 in
gold before them; upon which two gentlemen, who were with me, made
reflections with astonishment.Six days after, was all in the dust.[Footnote 57: _Ante_, p.It was enjoined that those who put on mourning should wear it as for a
father, in the most solemn manner.Being sent to by the Sheriff of the County to
appear and assist in proclaiming the King, I went the next day to
Bromley, where I met the Sheriff and the Commander of the Kentish Troop,
with an appearance, I suppose, of about 500 horse, and innumerable
people, two of his Majesty's trumpets, and a Sergeant with other
officers, who having drawn up the horse in a large field near the town,
marched thence, with swords drawn, to the market place, where, making a
ring, after sound of trumpets and silence made, the High Sheriff read
the proclaiming titles to his bailiff, who repeated them aloud, and
then, after many shouts of the people, his Majesty's health being drunk
in a flint glass of a yard long, by the Sheriff, Commander, Officers,
and chief gentlemen, they all dispersed, and I returned.I passed a fine on selling of Honson Grange in
Staffordshire, being about L20 per annum, which lying so great a
distance, I thought fit to part with it to one Burton, a farmer there.It came to me as part of my daughter-in-law's portion, this being but a
fourth part of what was divided between the mother and three sisters.The King was this night very obscurely buried in a
vault under Henry VII.'s Chapel at Westminster, without any manner of
pomp, and soon forgotten after all this vanity, and the face of the
whole Court was exceedingly changed into a more solemn and moral
behavior; the new King affecting neither profaneness nor buffoonery.All
the great officers broke their staves over the grave, according to form.The second
sermon should have been before the King; but he, to the great grief of
his subjects, did now, for the first time, go to mass publicly in the
little Oratory at the Duke's lodgings, the doors being set wide open.I dined at Sir Robert Howard's, auditor of the
exchequer, a gentleman pretending to all manner of arts and sciences,
for which he had been the subject of comedy, under the name of Sir
Positive; not ill-natured, but insufferably boasting.He was son to the
late Earl of Berkshire.This morning his Majesty restored the staff and key
to Lord Arlington, Chamberlain; to Mr.Savell, Vice-chamberlain; to
Lords Newport and Maynard, Treasurer and Comptroller of the household.Lord Godolphin made Chamberlain to the Queen; Lord Peterborough groom of
the stole, in place of the Earl of Bath; the Treasurer's staff to the
Earl of Rochester; and his brother, the Earl of Clarendon, Lord Privy
Seal, in the place of the Marquis of Halifax, who was made President of
the Council; the Secretaries of State remaining as before.The Lord Treasurer and the other new officers were
sworn at the Chancery Bar and the exchequer.The late King having the revenue of excise, customs, and other late
duties granted for his life only, they were now farmed and let to
several persons, upon an opinion that the late King might let them for
three years after his decease; some of the old commissioners refused to
act.The lease was made but the day before the King died;[58] the major
part of the Judges (but, as some think, not the best lawyers),
pronounced it legal, but four dissented.[Footnote 58: James, in his Life, makes no mention of this lease,
    but only says HE continued to collect them, which conduct was not
    blamed; but, on the contrary, he was thanked for it, in an address
    from the Middle Temple, penned by Sir Bartholomew Shore, and
    presented by Sir Humphrey Mackworth, carrying great authority with
    it; nor did the Parliament find fault.]The clerk of the closet had shut up the late King's private oratory next
the Privy-chamber above, but the King caused it to be opened again, and
that prayers should be said as formerly.Several most useful tracts against Dissenters,
<DW7>s and Fanatics, and resolutions of cases were now published by the
London divines.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th March, 1685.To my grief, I saw the new pulpit set up in the Popish
Oratory at Whitehall for the Lent preaching, mass being publicly said,
and the Romanists swarming at Court with greater confidence than had
ever been seen in England since the Reformation, so that everybody grew
jealous as to what this would tend.A Parliament was now summoned, and great industry used to obtain
elections which might promote the Court interest, most of the
corporations being now, by their new charters, empowered to make what
returns of members they pleased.There came over divers envoys and great persons to condole the death of
the late King, who were received by the Queen-Dowager on a bed of
mourning, the whole chamber, ceiling and floor, hung with black, and
tapers were lighted, so as nothing could be more lugubrious and solemn.The Queen-Consort sat under a state on a black foot-cloth, to entertain
the circle (as the Queen used to do), and that very decently.Lent preachers continued as formerly in the Royal
Chapel.My daughter, Mary, was taken with smallpox, and there
soon was found no hope of her recovery.A great affliction to me: but
God's holy will be done!She received the blessed sacrament; after which,
disposing herself to suffer what God should determine to inflict, she
bore the remainder of her sickness with extraordinary patience and
piety, and more than ordinary resignation and blessed frame of mind.She
died the 14th, to our unspeakable sorrow and affliction, and not to
our's only, but that of all who knew her, who were many of the best
quality, greatest and most virtuous persons.The justness of her
stature, person, comeliness of countenance, gracefulness of motion,
unaffected, though more than ordinarily beautiful, were the least of her
ornaments compared with those of her mind.Of early piety, singularly
religious, spending a part of every day in private devotion, reading,
and other virtuous exercises; she had collected and written out many of
the most useful and judicious periods of the books she read in a kind of
common-place, as out of Dr.Hammond on the New Testament, and most of
the best practical treatises.She had read and digested a considerable
deal of history, and of places.The French tongue was as familiar to her
as English; she understood Italian, and was able to render a laudable
account of what she read and observed, to which assisted a most faithful
memory and discernment; and she did make very prudent and discreet
reflections upon what she had observed of the conversations among which
she had at any time been, which being continually of persons of the best
quality, she thereby improved.She had an excellent voice, to which she
played a thorough-bass on the harpsichord, in both which she arrived to
that perfection, that of the scholars of those two famous masters,
Signors Pietro and Bartholomeo, she was esteemed the best; for the
sweetness of her voice and management of it added such an agreeableness
to her countenance, without any constraint or concern, that when she
sung, it was as charming to the eye as to the ear; this I rather note,
because it was a universal remark, and for which so many noble and
judicious persons in music desired to hear her, the last being at Lord
Arundel's, at Wardour.What shall I say, or rather not say, of the cheerfulness and
agreeableness of her humor?condescending to the meanest servant in the
family, or others, she still kept up respect, without the least pride.She would often read to them, examine, instruct, and pray with them if
they were sick, so as she was exceedingly beloved of everybody.Piety
was so prevalent an ingredient in her constitution (as I may say), that
even among equals and superiors she no sooner became intimately
acquainted, but she would endeavor to improve them, by insinuating
something religious, and that tended to bring them to a love of
devotion; she had one or two confidants with whom she used to pass whole
days in fasting, reading, and prayers, especially before the monthly
communion, and other solemn occasions.She abhorred flattery, and,
though she had abundance of wit, the raillery was so innocent and
ingenious that it was most agreeable; she sometimes would see a play,
but since the stage grew licentious, expressed herself weary of them,
and the time spent at the theater was an unaccountable vanity.She never
played at cards without extreme importunity and for the company; but
this was so very seldom, that I cannot number it among anything she
could name a fault.No one could read prose or verse better or with more judgment; and as
she read, so she wrote, not only most correct orthography, with that
maturity of judgment and exactness of the periods, choice of
expressions, and familiarity of style, that some letters of hers have
astonished me and others, to whom she has occasionally written.She had
a talent of rehearsing any comical part or poem, as to them she might be
decently free with; was more pleasing than heard on the theater; she
danced with the greatest grace I had ever seen, and so would her master
say, who was Monsieur Isaac; but she seldom showed that perfection, save
in the gracefulness of her carriage, which was with an air of sprightly
modesty not easily to be described.Nothing affected, but natural and
easy as well in her deportment as in her discourse, which was always
material, not trifling, and to which the extraordinary sweetness of her
tone, even in familiar speaking, was very charming.Nothing was so
pretty as her descending to play with little children, whom she would
caress and humor with great delight.But she most affected to be with
grave and sober men, of whom she might learn something, and improve
herself.I have been assisted by her in reading and praying by me;
comprehensive of uncommon notions, curious of knowing everything to some
excess, had I not sometimes repressed it.Nothing was so delightful to her as to go into my Study, where she would
willingly have spent whole days, for as I said she had read abundance of
history, and all the best poets, even Terence, Plautus, Homer, Virgil,
Horace, Ovid; all the best romancers and modern poems; she could compose
happily and put in pretty symbols, as in the "_Mundus Muliebris_,"
wherein is an enumeration of the immense variety of the modes and
ornaments belonging to the sex.But all these are vain trifles to the
virtues which adorned her soul; she was sincerely religious, most
dutiful to her parents, whom she loved with an affection tempered with
great esteem, so as we were easy and free, and never were so well
pleased as when she was with us, nor needed we other conversation; she
was kind to her sisters, and was still improving them by her constant
course of piety.Oh, dear, sweet, and desirable child, how shall I part
with all this goodness and virtue without the bitterness of sorrow and
reluctancy of a tender parent!Thy affection, duty and love to me was
that of a friend as well as a child.Nor less dear to thy mother, whose
example and tender care of thee was unparalleled, nor was thy return to
her less conspicuous.To the grave shall we both carry thy memory!God alone (in
whose bosom thou art at rest and happy!)give us to resign thee and all
our contentments (for thou indeed wert all in this world) to his blessed
pleasure!Let him be glorified by our submission, and give us grace to
bless him for the graces he implanted in thee, thy virtuous life, pious
and holy death, which is indeed the only comfort of our souls, hastening
through the infinite love and mercy of the Lord Jesus to be shortly with
thee, dear child, and with thee and those blessed saints like thee,
glorify the Redeemer of the world to all eternity!It was in the 19th year of her age that this sickness happened to her.An accident contributed to this disease; she had an apprehension of it
in particular, which struck her but two days before she came home, by an
imprudent gentlewoman whom she went with Lady Falkland to visit, who,
after they had been a good while in the house, told them she has a
servant sick of the smallpox (who indeed died the next day): this my
poor child acknowledged made an impression on her spirits.There were
four gentlemen of quality offering to treat with me about marriage, and
I freely gave her her own choice, knowing her discretion.She showed
great indifference to marrying at all, for truly, says she to her mother
(the other day), were I assured of your life and my dear father's, never
would I part from you; I love you and this home, where we serve God,
above all things, nor ever shall I be so happy; I know and consider the
vicissitudes of the world, I have some experience of its vanities, and
but for decency more than inclination, and that you judge it expedient
for me, I would not change my condition, but rather add the fortune you
design me to my sisters, and keep up the reputation of our family.This
was so discreetly and sincerely uttered that it could not but proceed
from an extraordinary child, and one who loved her parents beyond
example.At London, she took this fatal disease, and the occasion of her being
there was this: my Lord Viscount Falkland's Lady having been our
neighbor (as he was Treasurer of the Navy), she took so great an
affection to my daughter, that when they went back in the autumn to the
city, nothing would satisfy their incessant importunity but letting her
accompany my Lady, and staying some time with her; it was with the
greatest reluctance I complied.While she was there, my Lord being
musical, when I saw my Lady would not part with her till Christmas, I
was not unwilling she should improve the opportunity of learning of
Signor Pietro, who had an admirable way both of composure and teaching.It was the end of February before I could prevail with my Lady to part
with her; but my Lord going into Oxfordshire to stand for Knight of the
Shire there, she expressed her wish to come home, being tired of the
vain and empty conversation of the town, the theaters, the court, and
trifling visits which consumed so much precious time, and made her
sometimes miss of that regular course of piety that gave her the
greatest satisfaction.She was weary of this life, and I think went not
thrice to Court all this time, except when her mother or I carried her.She did not affect showing herself, she knew the Court well, and passed
one summer in it at Windsor with Lady Tuke, one of the Queen's women of
the bedchamber (a most virtuous relation of hers); she was not fond of
that glittering scene, now become abominably licentious, though there
was a design of Lady Rochester and Lady Clarendon to have made her a
maid of honor to the Queen as soon as there was a vacancy.But this she
did not set her heart upon, nor indeed on anything so much as the
service of God, a quiet and regular life, and how she might improve
herself in the most necessary accomplishments, and to which she was
arrived at so great a measure.This is the little history and imperfect character of my dear child,
whose piety, virtue, and incomparable endowments deserve a monument more
durable than brass and marble.Much I could enlarge on every period of this hasty account, but that I
ease and discharge my overcoming passion for the present, so many things
worthy an excellent Christian and dutiful child crowding upon me.Never
can I say enough, oh dear, my dear child, whose memory is so precious to
me!This dear child was born at Wotton, in the same house and chamber in
which I first drew my breath, my wife having retired to my brother there
in the great sickness that year upon the first of that month, and the
very hour that I was born, upon the last: viz, October.[Sidenote: SAYES COURT]

16th March, 1685.She was interred in the southeast end of the church at
Deptford, near her grandmother and several of my younger children and
relations.My desire was she should have been carried and laid among my
own parents and relations at Wotton, where I desire to be interred
myself, when God shall call me out of this uncertain transitory life,
but some circumstances did not permit it.Holden,
preached her funeral sermon on Phil."For to me to live is
Christ, and to die is gain," upon which he made an apposite discourse,
as those who heard it assured me (for grief suffered me not to be
present), concluding with a modest recital of her many virtues and
signal piety, so as to draw both tears and admiration from the hearers.I was not altogether unwilling that something of this sort should be
spoken, for the edification and encouragement of other young people.Divers noble persons honored her funeral, some in person, others
sending their coaches, of which there were six or seven with six horses,
viz, the Countess of Sunderland, Earl of Clarendon, Lord Godolphin, Sir
Stephen Fox, Sir William Godolphin, Viscount Falkland, and others.There
were distributed among her friends about sixty rings.Thus lived, died, and was buried the joy of my life, and ornament of her
sex and of my poor family!God Almighty of his infinite mercy grant me
the grace thankfully to resign myself and all I have, or had, to his
divine pleasure, and in his good time, restoring health and comfort to
my family: "teach me so to number my days, that I may apply my heart to
wisdom," be prepared for my dissolution, and that into the hands of my
blessed Savior I may recommend my spirit!On looking into her closet, it is incredible what a number of
collections she had made from historians, poets, travelers, etc., but,
above all, devotions, contemplations, and resolutions on these
contemplations, found under her hand in a book most methodically
disposed; prayers, meditations, and devotions on particular occasions,
with many pretty letters to her confidants; one to a divine (not named)
to whom she writes that he would be her ghostly father, and would not
despise her for her many errors and the imperfections of her youth, but
beg of God to give her courage to acquaint him with all her faults,
imploring his assistance and spiritual directions.I well remember she
had often desired me to recommend her to such a person; but I did not
think fit to do it as yet, seeing her apt to be scrupulous, and knowing
the great innocency and integrity of her life.It is astonishing how one who had acquired such substantial and
practical knowledge in other ornamental parts of education, especially
music, both vocal and instrumental, in dancing, paying and receiving
visits, and necessary conversation, could accomplish half of what she
has left; but, as she never affected play or cards, which consume a
world of precious time, so she was in continual exercise, which yet
abated nothing of her most agreeable conversation.But she was a little
miracle while she lived, and so she died!I was invited to the funeral of Captain Gunman, that
excellent pilot and seaman, who had behaved himself so gallantly in the
Dutch war.He died of a gangrene, occasioned by his fall from the pier
of Calais.This was the Captain of the yacht carrying the Duke (now
King) to Scotland, and was accused for not giving timely warning when
she split on the sands, where so many perished; but I am most confident
he was no ways guilty, either of negligence, or design, as he made
appear not only at the examination of the matter of fact, but in the
vindication he showed me, and which must needs give any man of reason
satisfaction.He was a sober, frugal, cheerful, and temperate man; we
have few such seamen left.Being now somewhat composed after my great affliction,
I went to London to hear Dr.Tenison (it being on a Wednesday in Lent)
at Whitehall.I observed that though the King was not in his seat above
in the chapel, the Doctor made his three congees, which they were not
used to do when the late King was absent, making then one bowing only.I
asked the reason; it was said he had a special order so to do.The
Princess of Denmark was in the King's closet, but sat on the left hand
of the chair, the Clerk of the Closet standing by his Majesty's chair,
as if he had been present.I met the Queen Dowager going now first from Whitehall to dwell at
Somerset House.This day my brother of Wotton and Mr.Onslow were candidates for Surrey
against Sir Adam Brown and my cousin, Sir Edward Evelyn, and were
circumvented in their election by a trick of the Sheriff's, taking
advantage of my brother's party going out of the small village of
Leatherhead to seek shelter and lodging, the afternoon being
tempestuous, proceeding to the election when they were gone; they
expecting the next morning; whereas before and then they exceeded the
other party by many hundreds, as I am assured.The Duke of Norfolk led
Sir Edward Evelyn's and Sir Adam Brown's party.For this Parliament,
very mean and slight persons (some of them gentlemen's servants, clerks,
and persons neither of reputation nor interest) were set up; but the
country would choose my brother whether he would or no, and he missed it
by the trick above mentioned.Sir Adam Brown was so deaf, that he could
not hear one word.Sir Edward Evelyn was an honest gentleman, much in
favor with his Majesty.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1685.I went early to Whitehall to hear Dr.Tillotson, Dean
of Canterbury, preaching on Eccles.I returned in the evening,
and visited Lady Tuke, and found with her Sir George Wakeman, the
physician, whom I had seen tried and acquitted, among the plotters for
poisoning the late King, on the accusation of the famous Oates; and
surely I believed him guiltless.According to my custom, I went to London to pass the
holy week.Tenison preached at the new church at
St.22, upon the infinite love of God to us, which
he illustrated in many instances.The Holy Sacrament followed, at which
I participated.Sprat,
Bishop of Rochester, preached in Whitehall chapel, the auditory very
full of Lords, the two Archbishops, and many others, now drawn to town
upon occasion of the coronation and ensuing Parliament.I supped with
the Countess of Sunderland and Lord Godolphin, and returned home.Was the coronation of the King and Queen.The solemnity
was magnificent as is set forth in print.The Bishop of Ely preached;
but, to the sorrow of the people, no Sacrament, as ought to have been.However, the King begins his reign with great expectations, and hopes of
much reformation as to the late vices and profaneness of both Court and
country.Having been present at the late King's coronation, I was not
ambitious of seeing this ceremony.A young man preached, going chaplain with Sir J. Wiburn,
Governor of Bombay, in the East Indies.I was in Westminster Hall when Oates, who had made such
a stir in the kingdom, on his revealing a plot of the <DW7>s, and
alarmed several Parliaments, and had occasioned the execution of divers
priests, noblemen, etc., was tried for perjury at the King's bench; but,
being very tedious, I did not endeavor to see the issue, considering
that it would be published.Abundance of Roman Catholics were in the
hall in expectation of the most grateful conviction and ruin of a person
who had been so obnoxious to them, and as I verily believe, had done
much mischief and great injury to several by his violent and
ill-grounded proceedings; while he was at first so unreasonably blown up
and encouraged, that his insolence was no longer sufferable.Roger L'Estrange (a gentleman whom I had long known, and a person of
excellent parts, abating some affectations) appearing first against the
Dissenters in several tracts, had now for some years turned his style
against those whom (by way of hateful distinction) they called Whigs and
Trimmers, under the title of "Observator," which came out three or four
days every week, in which sheets, under pretense to serve the Church of
England, he gave suspicion of gratifying another party, by several
passages which rather kept up animosities than appeased them, especially
now that nobody gave the least occasion.[59]

    [Footnote 59: In the first Dutch war, while Evelyn was one of the
    Commissioners for sick and wounded, L'Estrange in his "Gazette"
    mentioned the barbarous usage of the Dutch prisoners of war:
    whereupon Evelyn wrote him a very spirited letter, desiring that the
    Dutch Ambassador (who was then in England) and his friends would
    visit the prisoners, and examine their provisions; and he required
    L'Estrange to publish that vindication in his next number.]The Scots valuing themselves exceedingly to have been
the first Parliament called by his Majesty, gave the excise and customs
to him and his successors forever; the Duke of Queensberry making
eloquent speeches, and especially minding them of a speedy suppression
of those late desperate Field-Conventiclers who had done such unheard of
assassinations.In the meantime, elections for the ensuing Parliament in
England were thought to be very indirectly carried on in most places.God grant a better issue of it than some expect!Oates was sentenced to be whipped and pilloried with the
utmost severity.I dined at my Lord Privy Seal's with Sir William
Dugdale, Garter King-at-Arms, author of the "MONASTICON" and other
learned works; he told me he was 82 years of age, and had his sight and
memory perfect.There was shown a draft of the exact shape and
dimensions of the crown the Queen had been crowned withal, together with
the jewels and pearls, their weight and value, which amounted to
L100,658 sterling, attested at the foot of the paper by the jeweler and
goldsmith who set them.In the morning, I went with a French gentleman, and my
Lord Privy Seal to the House of Lords, where we were placed by his
Lordship next the bar, just below the bishops, very commodiously both
for hearing and seeing.After a short space, came in the Queen and
Princess of Denmark, and stood next above the archbishops, at the side
of the House on the right hand of the throne.In the interim, divers of
the Lords, who had not finished before, took the test and usual oaths,
so that her Majesty, the Spanish and other Ambassadors, who stood behind
the throne, heard the Pope and the worship of the Virgin Mary, etc.,
renounced very decently, as likewise the prayers which followed,
standing all the while.Then came in the King, the crown on his head,
and being seated, the Commons were introduced, and the House being full,
he drew forth a paper containing his speech, which he read distinctly
enough, to this effect: "That he resolved to call a Parliament from the
moment of his brother's decease, as the best means to settle all the
concerns of the nation, so as to be most easy and happy to himself and
his subjects; that he would confirm whatever he had said in his
declaration at the first Council concerning his opinion of the
principles of the Church of England, for their loyalty, and would defend
and support it, and preserve its government as by law now established;
that, as he would invade no man's property, so he would never depart
from his own prerogative; and, as he had ventured his life in defense of
the nation, so he would proceed to do still; that, having given this
assurance of his care of our religion (his word was YOUR religion) and
property (which he had not said by chance, but solemnly), so he doubted
not of suitable returns of his subjects' duty and kindness, especially
as to settling his revenue for life, for the many weighty necessities of
government, which he would not suffer to be precarious; that some might
possibly suggest that it were better to feed and supply him from time to
time only, out of their inclination to frequent Parliaments; but that
that would be a very improper method to take with him, since the best
way to engage him to meet oftener would be always to use him well, and
therefore he expected their compliance speedily, that this session being
but short, they might meet again to satisfaction."At every period of this, the House gave loud shouts.Then he acquainted
them with that morning's news of Argyle's being landed in the West
Highlands of Scotland from Holland, and the treasonous declaration he
had published, which he would communicate to them, and that he should
take the best care he could it should meet with the reward it deserved,
not questioning the Parliament's zeal and readiness to assist him as he
desired; at which there followed another "_Vive le Roi_," and so his
Majesty retired.So soon as the Commons were returned and had put themselves into a grand
committee, they immediately put the question, and unanimously voted the
revenue to his Majesty for life.Seymour made a bold speech against
many elections, and would have had those members who (he pretended) were
obnoxious, to withdraw, till they had cleared the matter of their being
legally returned; but no one seconded him.The truth is, there were many
of the new members whose elections and returns were universally
censured, many of them being persons of no condition, or interest, in
the nation, or places for which they served, especially in Devon,
Cornwall, Norfolk, etc., said to have been recommended by the Court, and
from the effect of the new charters changing the electors.It was
reported that Lord Bath carried down with him [into Cornwall] no fewer
than fifteen charters, so that some called him the Prince Elector:
whence Seymour told the House in his speech that if this was digested,
they might introduce what religion and laws they pleased, and that
though he never gave heed to the fears and jealousies of the people
before, he was now really apprehensive of Popery.By the printed list of
members of 505, there did not appear to be above 135 who had been in
former Parliaments, especially that lately held at Oxford.In the Lords' House, Lord Newport made an exception against two or three
young Peers, who wanted some months, and some only four or five days, of
being of age.The Popish Lords, who had been sometime before released from their
confinement about the plot, were now discharged of their impeachment, of
which I gave Lord Arundel of Wardour joy.Oates, who had but two days before been pilloried at several places and
whipped at the cart's tail from Newgate to Aldgate, was this day placed
on a sledge, being not able to go by reason of so late scourging, and
dragged from prison to Tyburn, and whipped again all the way, which some
thought to be severe and extraordinary; but, if he was guilty of the
perjuries, and so of the death of many innocents (as I fear he was), his
punishment was but what he deserved.I chanced to pass just as execution
was doing on him.Note: there was no speech made by the Lord Keeper [Bridgman] after his
Majesty, as usual.It was whispered he would not be long in that situation, and many
believe the bold Chief Justice Jefferies, who was made Baron of Wem, in
Shropshire, and who went thorough stitch in that tribunal, stands fair
for that office.I gave him joy the morning before of his new honor, he
having always been very civil to me.We had hitherto not any rain for many months, so as the
caterpillars had already devoured all the winter fruit through the whole
land, and even killed several greater old trees.Such two winters and
summers I had never known.Came to visit and take leave of me Sir Gabriel Sylvius,
now going Envoy-extraordinary into Denmark, with his secretary and
chaplain, a Frenchman, who related the miserable persecution of the
Protestants in France; not above ten churches left them, and those also
threatened to be demolished; they were commanded to christen their
children within twenty-four hours after birth, or else a Popish priest
was to be called, and then the infant brought up in Popery.In some
places, they were thirty leagues from any minister, or opportunity of
worship.This persecution had displeased the most industrious part of
the nation, and dispersed those into Switzerland, Burgundy, Holland,
Germany, Denmark, England, and the Plantations.There were with Sir
Gabriel, his lady, Sir William Godolphin and sisters, and my Lord
Godolphin's little son, my charge.I brought them to the water side
where Sir Gabriel embarked, and the rest returned to London.There was now certain intelligence of the Duke of
Monmouth landing at Lyme, in Dorsetshire, and of his having set up his
standard as King of England.I pray God deliver us from the confusion
which these beginnings threaten!Such a dearth for want of rain was never in my memory.The Duke landed with but 150 men; but the whole kingdom
was alarmed, fearing that the disaffected would join them, many of the
trained bands flocking to him.At his landing, he published a
Declaration, charging his Majesty with usurpation and several horrid
crimes, on pretense of his own title, and offering to call a free
Parliament.This declaration was ordered to be burnt by the hangman, the
Duke proclaimed a traitor, and a reward of L5,000 to any who should kill
him.At this time, the words engraved on the monument in London, intimating
that the <DW7>s fired the city, were erased and cut out.I received a warrant to send out a horse with twelve
days' provisions, etc.We had now plentiful rain after two years' excessive
drought and severe winters.Argyle taken in Scotland, and executed, and his party dispersed.No considerable account of the troops sent against the
Duke, though great forces sent.There was a smart skirmish; but he would
not be provoked to come to an encounter, but still kept in the
fastnesses.Dangerfield whipped, like Oates, for perjury.Came news of Monmouth's utter defeat, and the next day
of his being taken by Sir William Portman and Lord Lumley with the
militia of their counties.It seems the Horse, commanded by Lord Grey,
being newly raised and undisciplined, were not to be brought in so short
a time to endure the fire, which exposed the Foot to the King's, so as
when Monmouth had led the Foot in great silence and order, thinking to
surprise Lieutenant-General Lord Feversham newly encamped, and given him
a smart charge, interchanging both great and small shot, the Horse,
breaking their own ranks, Monmouth gave it over, and fled with Grey,
leaving their party to be cut in pieces to the number of 2,000.The
whole number reported to be above 8,000; the King's but 2,700.The slain
were most of them MENDIP-MINERS, who did great execution with their
tools, and sold their lives very dearly, while their leaders flying were
pursued and taken the next morning, not far from one another.Monmouth
had gone sixteen miles on foot, changing his habit for a poor coat, and
was found by Lord Lumley in a dry ditch covered with fern-brakes, but
without sword, pistol, or any weapon, and so might have passed for some
countryman, his beard being grown so long and so gray as hardly to be
known, had not his George discovered him, which was found in his pocket.It is said he trembled exceedingly all over, not able to speak.Grey was
taken not far from him.Most of his party were Anabaptists and poor
cloth workers of the country, no gentlemen of account being come in to
him.The arch-_boutefeu_, Ferguson, Matthews, etc., were not yet found.The L5,000 to be given to whoever should bring Monmouth in, was to be
distributed among the militia by agreement between Sir William Portman
and Lord Lumley.The battle ended, some words, first in jest, then in
passion, passed between Sherrington Talbot (a worthy gentleman, son to
Sir John Talbot, and who had behaved himself very handsomely) and one
Captain Love, both commanders of the militia, as to whose soldiers
fought best, both drawing their swords and passing at one another.Sherrington was wounded to death on the spot, to the great regret of
those who knew him.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th July, 1685.Just as I was coming into the lodgings at Whitehall, a
little before dinner, my Lord of Devonshire standing very near his
Majesty's bedchamber door in the lobby, came Colonel Culpeper, and in a
rude manner looking at my Lord in the face, asked whether this was a
time and place for excluders to appear; my Lord at first took little
notice of what he said, knowing him to be a hotheaded fellow, but he
reiterating it, my Lord asked Culpeper whether he meant him; he said
yes, he meant his Lordship.My Lord told him he was no excluder (as
indeed he was not); the other affirming it again, my Lord told him he
lied; on which Culpeper struck him a box on the ear, which my Lord
returned, and felled him.They were soon parted, Culpeper was seized,
and his Majesty, who was all the while in his bedchamber, ordered him to
be carried to the Greencloth officer, who sent him to the Marshalsea, as
he deserved.I supped this night at Lambeth at my old friend's Mr.Elias Ashmole's,
with my Lady Clarendon, the Bishop of St.Tenison, when
we were treated at a great feast.The Count of Castel Mellor, that great favorite and
prime minister of Alphonso, late King of Portugal, after several years'
banishment, being now received to grace and called home by Don Pedro,
the present King, as having been found a person of the greatest
integrity after all his sufferings, desired me to spend part of this day
with him, and assist him in a collection of books and other curiosities,
which he would carry with him into Portugal.Hussey, a young gentleman who made love to my late dear child, but
whom she could not bring herself to answer in affection, died now of the
same cruel disease, for which I was extremely sorry, because he never
enjoyed himself after my daughter's decease, nor was I averse to the
match, could she have overcome her disinclination.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th July, 1685.Monmouth was this day brought to London and examined before the King,
to whom he made great submission, acknowledged his seduction by
Ferguson, the Scot, whom he named the bloody villain.He was sent to the
Tower, had an interview with his late Duchess, whom he received coldly,
having lived dishonestly with the Lady Henrietta Wentworth for two
years.He obstinately asserted his conversation with that debauched
woman to be no sin; whereupon, seeing he could not be persuaded to his
last breath, the divines who were sent to assist him thought not fit to
administer the Holy Communion to him.For the rest of his faults he
professed great sorrow, and so died without any apparent fear.He would
not make use of a cap or other circumstance, but lying down, bid the
fellow to do his office better than to the late Lord Russell, and gave
him gold; but the wretch made five chops before he had his head off;
which so incensed the people, that had he not been guarded and got away,
they would have torn him to pieces.The Duke made no speech on the scaffold (which was on Tower Hill), but
gave a paper containing not above five or six lines, for the King, in
which he disclaims all title to the Crown, acknowledges that the late
King, his father, had indeed told him he was but his base son, and so
desired his Majesty to be kind to his wife and children.Martin's), who, with the Bishops of
Ely and Bath and Wells, were sent to him by his Majesty, and were at the
execution.Thus ended this quondam Duke, darling of his father and the ladies,
being extremely handsome and adroit, an excellent soldier and dancer, a
favorite of the people, of an easy nature, debauched by lust; seduced by
crafty knaves, who would have set him up only to make a property, and
taken the opportunity of the King being of another religion, to gather a
party of discontented men.He was a lovely person, had a virtuous and excellent lady that brought
him great riches, and a second dukedom in Scotland.He was Master of the
Horse, General of the King his father's army, Gentleman of the
Bedchamber, Knight of the Garter, Chancellor of Cambridge, in a word,
had accumulations without end.See what ambition and want of principles
brought him to!He was beheaded on Tuesday, 14th of July.His mother,
whose name was Barlow, daughter of some very mean creatures, was a
beautiful strumpet, whom I had often seen at Paris; she died miserably
without anything to bury her; yet this Perkin had been made to believe
that the King had married her, a monstrous and ridiculous forgery!And
to satisfy the world of the iniquity of the report, the King his father
(if his father he really was, for he most resembled one Sidney who was
familiar with his mother) publicly and most solemnly renounced it, to be
so entered in the Council Book some years since, with all the Privy
Councillors' attestation.[60]

    [Footnote 60: The "Life of James II."contains an account of the
    circumstances of the Duke of Monmouth's birth, which may be given in
    illustration of the statements of the text.Ross, tutor to the Duke
    of Monmouth, is there said to have proposed to Bishop Cosins to sign
    a certificate of the King's marriage to Mrs.Barlow, though her own
    name was Walters: but this the Bishop refused.She was born of a
    gentleman's family in Wales, but having little means and less grace,
    came to London to make her fortune.Algernon Sydney, then a Colonel
    in Cromwell's army, had agreed to give her fifty broad pieces (as he
    told the Duke of York); but being ordered hastily away with his
    regiment, he missed his bargain.She went into Holland, where she
    fell into the hands of his brother, Colonel Robert Sydney, who kept
    her for some time, till the King hearing of her, got her from him.On which the Colonel was heard to say, Let who will have her, she is
    already sped; and, after being with the King, she was so soon with
    child, that the world had no cause to doubt whose child it was, and
    the rather that when he grew to be a man, he very much resembled the
    Colonel both in stature and countenance, even to a wart on his face.In the King's absence she behaved
    so loosely, that on his return from his escape at Worcester he would
    have no further commerce with her, and she became a common
    prostitute at Paris.]Had it not pleased God to dissipate this attempt in the beginning, there
would in all appearance have gathered an irresistible force which would
have desperately proceeded to the ruin of the Church and Government; so
general was the discontent and expectation of the opportunity.For my
own part, I looked upon this deliverance as most signal.Such an
inundation of fanatics and men of impious principles must needs have
caused universal disorder, cruelty, injustice, rapine, sacrilege, and
confusion, an unavoidable civil war, and misery without end.Blessed be
God, the knot was happily broken, and a fair prospect of tranquillity
for the future, if we reform, be thankful, and make a right use of this
mercy!I went to see the muster of the six Scotch and English
regiments whom the Prince of Orange had lately sent to his Majesty out
of Holland upon this rebellion, but which were now returning, there
having been no occasion for their use.They were all excellently clad
and well disciplined, and were encamped on Blackheath with their tents:
the King and Queen came to see them exercise, and the manner of their
encampment, which was very neat and magnificent.By a gross mistake of the Secretary of his Majesty's Forces, it had
been ordered that they should be quartered in private houses, contrary
to an Act of Parliament, but, on my informing his Majesty timely of it,
it was prevented.The two horsemen which my son and myself sent into the county troops,
were now come home, after a month's being out to our great charge.The Trinity Company met this day, which should have
been on the Monday after Trinity, but was put off by reason of the Royal
Charter being so large, that it could not be ready before.Pepys, Secretary to the Admiralty, was a
second time chosen Master.There were present the Duke of Grafton, Lord
Dartmouth, Master of the Ordnance, the Commissioners of the Navy, and
Brethren of the Corporation.We went to church, according to custom, and
then took barge to the Trinity House, in London, where we had a great
dinner, above eighty at one table.[Sidenote: CHELSEA]

7th August, 1685.Watts, keeper of the Apothecaries'
garden of simples at Chelsea, where there is a collection of innumerable
rarities of that sort particularly, besides many rare annuals, the tree
bearing Jesuit's bark, which had done such wonders in quartan agues.What was very ingenious was the subterranean heat, conveyed by a stove
under the conservatory, all vaulted with brick, so as he has the doors
and windows open in the hardest frosts, secluding only the snow.Boscawen, with my Lord
Godolphin's little son, with whose education hitherto his father had
intrusted me.My daughter Elizabeth died of the smallpox, soon
after having married a young man, nephew of Sir John Tippett, Surveyor
of the Navy, and one of the Commissioners.The 30th, she was buried in
the church at Deptford.Thus, in less than six months were we deprived
of two children for our unworthiness and causes best known to God, whom
I beseech from the bottom of my heart that he will give us grace to make
that right use of all these chastisements, that we may become better,
and entirely submit in all things to his infinitely wise disposal.Lord Clarendon (Lord Privy Seal) wrote to let me
know that the King being pleased to send him Lord-Lieutenant into
Ireland, was also pleased to nominate me one of the Commissioners to
execute the office of Privy Seal during his Lieutenancy there, it
behoving me to wait upon his Majesty to give him thanks for this great
honor.I accompanied his Lordship to Windsor (dining by
the way of Sir Henry Capel's at Kew), where his Majesty receiving me
with extraordinary kindness, I kissed his hand, I told him how sensible
I was of his Majesty's gracious favor to me, that I would endeavor to
serve him with all sincerity, diligence, and loyalty, not more out of my
duty than inclination.He said he doubted not of it, and was glad he had
the opportunity to show me the kindness he had for me.After this, came
abundance of great men to give me joy.I went to prayer in the chapel, and heard
Dr.11, persuading to unity and peace, and to be mindful of our
own business, according to the advice of the apostle.Then I went to
hear a Frenchman who preached before the King and Queen in that splendid
chapel next St.Their Majesties going to mass, I withdrew
to consider the stupendous painting of the Hall, which, both for the art
and invention, deserve the inscription in honor of the painter, Signor
Verrio.receiving the Black Prince, coming
toward him in a Roman triumph.The throne, the carvings, etc., are incomparable, and I think
equal to any, and in many circumstances exceeding any, I have seen
abroad.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, with (among others) Sir William Soames,
designed Ambassador to Constantinople.About 6 o'clock came Sir Dudley and his brother Roger North, and
brought the Great Seal from my Lord Keeper, who died the day before at
his house in Oxfordshire.The King went immediately to council;
everybody guessing who was most likely to succeed this great officer;
most believing it could be no other than my Lord Chief Justice
Jefferies, who had so vigorously prosecuted the late rebels, and was now
gone the Western Circuit, to punish the rest that were secured in
several counties, and was now near upon his return.I took my leave of
his Majesty, who spoke very graciously to me, and supping that night at
Sir Stephen Fox's, I promised to dine there the next day.Pepys to Portsmouth, whither his
Majesty was going the first time since his coming to the Crown, to see
in what state the fortifications were.We took coach and six horses,
late after dinner, yet got to Bagshot that night.While supper was
making ready I went and made a visit to Mrs.Graham, some time maid of
honor to the Queen Dowager, now wife to James Graham, Esq., of the privy
purse to the King; her house being a walk in the forest, within a little
quarter of a mile from Bagshot town.Very importunate she was that I
would sup, and abide there that night; but, being obliged by my
companion, I returned to our inn, after she had shown me her house,
which was very commodious, and well furnished, as she was an excellent
housewife, a prudent and virtuous lady.There is a park full of red deer
about it.Her eldest son was now sick there of the smallpox, but in a
likely way of recovery, and other of her children run about, and among
the infected, which she said she let them do on purpose that they might
while young pass that fatal disease she fancied they were to undergo one
time or other, and that this would be the best: the severity of this
cruel distemper so lately in my poor family confirming much of what she
affirmed.[Sidenote: WINCHESTER]

16th September, 1685.The next morning, setting out early, we arrived
soon enough at Winchester to wait on the King, who was lodged at the
Dean's (Dr.I found very few with him besides my Lords
Feversham, Arran, Newport, and the Bishop of Bath and Wells.His Majesty
was discoursing with the bishops concerning miracles, and what strange
things the Saludadors[61] would do in Spain, as by creeping into heated
ovens without hurt, and that they had a black cross in the roof of their
mouths, but yet were commonly notorious and profane wretches; upon which
his Majesty further said, that he was so extremely difficult of
miracles, for fear of being imposed upon, that if he should chance to
see one himself, without some other witness, he should apprehend it a
delusion of his senses.Then they spoke of the boy who was pretended to
have a wanting leg restored him, so confidently asserted by Fr.To all of which the Bishop added a great miracle
happening in Winchester to his certain knowledge, of a poor, miserably
sick and decrepit child (as I remember long kept unbaptized) who
immediately on his baptism, recovered; as also of the salutary effect of
King Charles his Majesty's father's blood, in healing one that was
blind.[Footnote 61: Evelyn subjoins this note:--"As to that of the
    Saludador (of which likewise I remember Sir Arthur Hopton, formerly
    as Ambassador at Madrid, had told me many like wonders), Mr.Pepys
    passing through Spain, and being extremely inquisitive of the truth
    of these pretended miracles of the Saludadors, found a very famous
    one at last, to whom he offered a considerable reward if he would
    make a trial of the oven, or any other thing of that kind, before
    him; the fellow ingenuously told him, that finding he was a more
    than ordinary curious person, he would not deceive him, and so
    acknowledged that he could do none of the feats really, but that
    what they pretended was all a cheat, which he would easily discover,
    though the poor superstitious people were easily imposed upon; yet
    have these impostors an allowance of the Bishops to practice their
    jugglings.Pepys affirmed to me; but said he, I did not
    conceive it fit to interrupt his Majesty, who so solemnly told what
    they pretended to do.There was something said of the second sight happening to some persons,
especially Scotch; upon which his Majesty, and I think Lord Arran, told
us that Monsieur... a French nobleman, lately here in England, seeing
the late Duke of Monmouth come into the playhouse at London, suddenly
cried out to somebody sitting in the same box, "_Voila Monsieur comme il
entre sans tete!_" Afterward his Majesty spoke of some relics that had
effected strange cures, particularly a piece of our blessed Savior's
cross, that healed a gentleman's rotten nose by only touching.And
speaking of the golden cross and chain taken out of the coffin of St.Edward the Confessor at Westminster, by one of the singing-men, who, as
the scaffolds were taken down after his Majesty's coronation, espying a
hole in the tomb, and something glisten, put his hand in, and brought it
to the dean, and he to the King; his Majesty began to put the Bishop in
mind how earnestly the late King (his brother) called upon him during
his agony, to take out what he had in his pocket."I had thought," said
the King, "it had been for some keys, which might lead to some cabinet
that his Majesty would have me secure"; but, says he, "you will remember
that I found nothing in any of his pockets but a cross of gold, and a
few insignificant papers"; and thereupon he showed us the cross, and was
pleased to put it into my hand.It was of gold, about three inches long,
having on one side a crucifix enameled and embossed, the rest was graved
and garnished with goldsmiths' work, and two pretty broad table
amethysts (as I conceived), and at the bottom a pendant pearl; within
was enchased a little fragment, as was thought, of the true cross, and a
Latin inscription in gold and Roman letters.More company coming in,
this discourse ended.I may not forget a resolution which his Majesty
made, and had a little before entered upon it at the Council Board at
Windsor or Whitehall, that the <DW64>s in the plantations should all be
baptized, exceedingly declaiming against that impiety of their masters
prohibiting it, out of a mistaken opinion that they would be _ipso
facto_ free; but his Majesty persists in his resolution to have them
christened, which piety the Bishop blessed him for.I went out to see the new palace the late King had begun, and brought
almost to the covering.It is placed on the side of the hill, where
formerly stood the old castle.It is a stately fabric, of three sides
and a corridor, all built of brick, and cornished, windows and columns
at the break and entrance of free-stone.It was intended for a
hunting-house when his Majesty should come to these parts, and has an
incomparable prospect.I believe there had already been L20,000 and more
expended; but his now Majesty did not seem to encourage the finishing it
at least for a while.Hence to see the Cathedral, a reverend pile, and in good repair.There
are still the coffins of the six Saxon Kings, whose bones had been
scattered by the sacrilegious rebels of 1641, in expectation, I suppose,
of finding some valuable relics, and afterward gathered up again and put
into new chests, which stand above the stalls of the choir.[Sidenote: PORTSMOUTH]

17th September, 1685.Early next morning, we went to Portsmouth,
something before his Majesty arrived.We found all the road full of
people, the women in their best dress, in expectation of seeing the King
pass by, which he did, riding on horseback a good part of the way.The
Mayor and Aldermen with their mace, and in their formalities, were
standing at the entrance of the fort, a mile on this side of the town,
where the Mayor made a speech to the King, and then the guns of the fort
were fired, as were those of the garrison, as soon as the King was come
into Portsmouth.All the soldiers (near 3,000) were drawn up, and lining
the streets and platform to God's House (the name of the Governor's
residence), where, after he had viewed the new fortifications and
shipyard, his Majesty was entertained at a magnificent dinner by Sir...
Slingsby, the Lieutenant Governor, all the gentlemen in his train
sitting down at table with him, which I also had done, had I not been
before engaged to Sir Robert Holmes, Governor of the Isle of Wight, to
dine with him at a private house, where likewise we had a very sumptuous
and plentiful repast of excellent venison, fowl, fish, and fruit.After dinner, I went to wait on his Majesty again, who was pulling on
his boots in the Town Hall adjoining the house where he dined, and then
having saluted some ladies, who came to kiss his hand, he took horse for
Winchester, whither he returned that night.This hall is artificially
hung round with arms of all sorts, like the hall and keep at Windsor.Hence, to see the shipyard and dock, the fortifications, and other
things.Portsmouth, when finished, will be very strong, and a noble quay.There
were now thirty-two men-of-war in the harbor.I was invited by Sir R.
Beach, the Commissioner, where, after a great supper, Mr.Secretary and
myself lay that night, and the next morning set out for Guildford, where
we arrived in good hour, and so the day after to London.I had twice before been at Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight, etc., many
years since.I found this part of Hampshire bravely wooded, especially
about the house and estate of Colonel Norton, who though now in being,
having formerly made his peace by means of Colonel Legg, was formerly a
very fierce commander in the first Rebellion.His house is large, and
standing low, on the road from Winchester to Portsmouth.By what I observed in this journey, is that infinite industry,
sedulity, gravity, and great understanding and experience of affairs, in
his Majesty, that I cannot but predict much happiness to the nation, as
to its political government; and, if he so persist, there could be
nothing more desired to accomplish our prosperity, but that he was of
the national religion.Lord Clarendon's commission for Lieutenant of
Ireland was sealed this day.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d October, 1685.Pepys with this
expression at the foot of it, "I have something to show you that I may
not have another time," and that I would not fail to dine with him.Houblon (a rich and
considerable merchant, whose father had fled out of Flanders on the
persecution of the Duke of Alva) into a private room, and told us that
being lately alone with his Majesty, and upon some occasion of speaking
concerning my late Lord Arlington dying a Roman Catholic, who had all
along seemed to profess himself a Protestant, taken all the tests, etc.,
till the day (I think) of his death, his Majesty said that as to his
inclinations he had known them long wavering, but from fear of losing
his places, he did not think it convenient to declare himself.There
are, says the King, those who believe the Church of Rome gives
dispensations for going to church, and many like things, but that is not
so; for if that might have been had, he himself had most reason to make
use of it.INDEED, he said, as to SOME MATRIMONIAL CASES, THERE ARE NOW
AND THEN DISPENSATIONS, but hardly in any cases else.Pepys to beg of his Majesty, if
he might ask it without offense, and for that his Majesty could not but
observe how it was whispered among many whether his late Majesty had
been reconciled to the Church of Rome; he again humbly besought his
Majesty to pardon his presumption, if he had touched upon a thing which
did not befit him to look into.The King ingenuously told him that he
both was and died a Roman Catholic, and that he had not long since
declared that it was upon some politic and state reasons, best known to
himself (meaning the King his brother), but that he was of that
persuasion: he bid him follow him into his closet, where opening a
cabinet, he showed him two papers, containing about a quarter of a
sheet, on both sides written, in the late King's own hand, several
arguments opposite to the doctrine of the Church of England, charging
her with heresy, novelty, and the fanaticism of other Protestants, the
chief whereof was, as I remember, our refusing to acknowledge the
primacy and infallibility of the Church of Rome; how impossible it was
that so many ages should never dispute it, till of late; how unlikely
our Savior would leave his Church without a visible Head and guide to
resort to, during his absence; with the like usual topic; so well penned
as to the discourse as did by no means seem to me to have been put
together by the late King yet written all with his own hand, blotted and
interlined, so as, if indeed it was not given him by some priest, they
might be such arguments and reasons as had been inculcated from time to
time, and here recollected; and, in the conclusion, showing his looking
on the Protestant religion (and by name the Church of England) to be
without foundation, and consequently false and unsafe.When his Majesty
had shown him these originals, he was pleased to lend him the copies of
these two papers, attested at the bottom in four or five lines under his
own hand.This nice and curious passage I
thought fit to set down.Though all the arguments and objections were
altogether weak, and have a thousand times been answered by our divines;
they are such as their priests insinuate among their proselytes, as if
nothing were Catholic but the Church of Rome, no salvation out of that,
no reformation sufferable, bottoming all their errors on St.Peter's
successors' unerring dictatorship, but proving nothing with any reason,
or taking notice of any objection which could be made against it.Here
all was taken for granted, and upon it a resolution and preference
implied.I was heartily sorry to see all this, though it was no other than was
to be suspected, by his late Majesty's too great indifference, neglect,
and course of life, that he had been perverted, and for secular respects
only professed to be of another belief, and thereby giving great
advantage to our adversaries, both the Court and generally the youth and
great persons of the nation becoming dissolute and highly profane.God
was incensed to make his reign very troublesome and unprosperous, by
wars, plagues, fires, loss of reputation by an universal neglect of the
public for the love of a voluptuous and sensual life, which a vicious
Court had brought into credit.I think of it with sorrow and pity, when
I consider how good and debonair a nature that unhappy Prince was; what
opportunities he had to have made himself the most renowned King that
ever swayed the British scepter, had he been firm to that Church for
which his martyred and blessed father suffered; and had he been grateful
to Almighty God, who so miraculously restored him, with so excellent a
religion; had he endeavored to own and propagate it as he should have
done, not only for the good of his kingdom, but of all the Reformed
Churches in christendom, now weakened and near ruined through our
remissness and suffering them to be supplanted, persecuted, and
destroyed, as in France, which we took no notice of.The consequence of
this, time will show, and I wish it may proceed no further.The
emissaries and instruments of the Church of Rome will never rest till
they have crushed the Church of England, as knowing that alone to be
able to cope with them, and that they can never answer her fairly, but
lie abundantly open to the irresistible force of her arguments,
antiquity and purity of her doctrine, so that albeit it may move God,
for the punishment of a nation so unworthy, to eclipse again the
profession of her here, and darkness and superstition prevail, I am most
confident the doctrine of the Church of England will never be
extinguished, but remain visible, if not eminent, to the consummation of
the world.I have innumerable reasons that confirm me in this opinion,
which I forbear to mention here.In the meantime, as to the discourse of his Majesty with Mr.Pepys, and
those papers, as I do exceedingly prefer his Majesty's free and
ingenuous profession of what his own religion is, beyond concealment
upon any politic accounts, so I think him of a most sincere and honest
nature, one on whose word one may rely, and that he makes a conscience
of what he promises, to perform it.In this confidence, I hope that the
Church of England may yet subsist, and when it shall please God to open
his eyes and turn his heart (for that is peculiarly in the Lord's hands)
to flourish also.In all events, whatever does become of the Church of
England, it is certainly, of all the Christian professions on the earth,
the most primitive, apostolical, and excellent.I had my picture drawn this week by the famous
Kneller.[Sidenote: LONDON]

14th October, 1685.I went to London about finishing my lodgings at
Whitehall.Being the King's birthday, there was a solemn ball
at Court, and before it music of instruments and voices.I happened by
accident to stand the very next to the Queen and the King, who talked
with me about the music.The King was now building all that range from east
to west by the court and garden to the street, and making a new chapel
for the Queen, whose lodgings were to be in this new building, as also a
new Council chamber and offices next the south end of the banqueting
house.I returned home, next morning, to London.I accompanied my Lady Clarendon to her house at
Swallowfield, in Berks, dining by the way at Mr.Graham's lodge at
Bagshot; the house, newly repaired and capacious enough for a good
family, stands in a park.Hence, we went to Swallowfield; this house is after the ancient
building of honorable gentlemen's houses, when they kept up ancient
hospitality, but the gardens and waters as elegant as it is possible to
make a flat by art and industry, and no mean expense, my lady being so
extraordinarily skilled in the flowery part, and my lord in diligence of
planting; so that I have hardly seen a seat which shows more tokens of
it than what is to be found here, not only in the delicious and rarest
fruits of a garden, but in those innumerable timber trees in the ground
about the seat, to the greatest ornament and benefit of the place.There
is one orchard of 1,000 golden, and other cider pippins; walks and
groves of elms, limes, oaks, and other trees.The garden is so beset
with all manner of sweet shrubs, that it perfumes the air.The
distribution also of the quarters, walks, and parterres, is excellent.The nurseries, kitchen-garden full of the most desirable plants; two
very noble orangeries well furnished: but, above all, the canal and fish
ponds, the one fed with a white, the other with a black running water,
fed by a quick and swift river, so well and plentifully stored with
fish, that for pike, carp, bream, and tench, I never saw anything
approaching it.We had at every meal carp and pike of a size fit for the
table of a Prince, and what added to the delight was, to see the
hundreds taken by the drag, out of which, the cook standing by, we
pointed out what we had most mind to, and had carp that would have been
worth at London twenty shillings a piece.The waters are flagged about
with _Calamus aromaticus_, with which my lady has hung a closet, that
retains the smell very perfectly.There is also a certain sweet willow
and other exotics: also a very fine bowling-green, meadow, pasture, and
wood; in a word, all that can render a country seat delightful.There is
besides a well-furnished library in the house.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1685.We returned to London, having been treated with all
sorts of cheer and noble freedom by that most religious and virtuous
lady.She was now preparing to go for Ireland with her husband, made
Lord Deputy, and went to this country house and ancient seat of her
father and family, to set things in order during her absence; but never
were good people and neighbors more concerned than all the country (the
poor especially) for the departure of this charitable woman; everyone
was in tears, and she as unwilling to part from them.There was among
them a maiden of primitive life, the daughter of a poor laboring man,
who had sustained her parents (some time since dead) by her labor, and
has for many years refused marriage, or to receive any assistance from
the parish, besides the little hermitage my lady gives her rent-free;
she lives on four pence a day, which she gets by spinning; says she
abounds and can give alms to others, living in great humility and
content, without any apparent affectation, or singularity; she is
continually working, praying, or reading, gives a good account of her
knowledge in religion, visits the sick; is not in the least given to
talk; very modest, of a simple not unseemingly behavior; of a comely
countenance, clad very plain, but clean and tight.In sum, she appears a
saint of an extraordinary sort, in so religious a life, as is seldom met
with in villages now-a-days.I was invited to dine at Sir Stephen Fox's with my
Lord Lieutenant, where was such a dinner for variety of all things as I
had seldom seen, and it was so for the trial of a master-cook whom Sir
Stephen had recommended to go with his Lordship into Ireland; there were
all the dainties not only of the season, but of what art could add,
venison, plain solid meat, fowl, baked and boiled meats, banquet
[dessert], in exceeding plenty, and exquisitely dressed.There also
dined my Lord Ossory and Lady (the Duke of Beaufort's daughter), my Lady
Treasurer, Lord Cornbury, and other visitors.At the Royal Society, an urn full of bones was
presented, dug up in a highway, while repairing it, in a field in
Camberwell, in Surrey; it was found entire with its cover, among many
others, believed to be truly Roman and ancient.Sir Richard Bulkeley described to us a model of a chariot he had
invented, which it was not possible to overthrow in whatever uneven way
it was drawn, giving us a wonderful relation of what it had performed in
that kind, for ease, expedition, and safety; there were some
inconveniences yet to be remedied--it would not contain more than one
person; was ready to take fire every ten miles; and being placed and
playing on no fewer than ten rollers, it made a most prodigious noise,
almost intolerable.A remedy was to be sought for these inconveniences.I dined at our great Lord Chancellor Jefferies', who
used me with much respect.This was the late Chief-Justice who had newly
been the Western Circuit to try the Monmouth conspirators, and had
formerly done such severe justice among the obnoxious in Westminster
Hall, for which his Majesty dignified him by creating him first a Baron,
and now Lord Chancellor.He had some years past been conversant in
Deptford; is of an assured and undaunted spirit, and has served the
Court interest on all the hardiest occasions; is of nature cruel, and a
slave of the Court.The French persecution of the Protestants raging
with the utmost barbarity, exceeded even what the very heathens used:
innumerable persons of the greatest birth and riches leaving all their
earthly substance, and hardly escaping with their lives, dispersed
through all the countries of Europe.The French tyrant abrogated the
Edict of Nantes which had been made in favor of them, and without any
cause; on a sudden demolishing all their churches, banishing,
imprisoning, and sending to the galleys all the ministers; plundering
the common people, and exposing them to all sorts of barbarous usage by
soldiers sent to ruin and prey on them; taking away their children;
forcing people to the Mass, and then executing them as relapsers; they
burnt their libraries, pillaged their goods, ate up their fields and
substance, banished or sent the people to the galleys, and seized on
their estates.There had now been numbered to pass through Geneva only
(and that by stealth, for all the usual passages were strictly guarded
by sea and land) 40,000 toward Switzerland.In Holland, Denmark, and all
about Germany, were dispersed some hundred thousands; besides those in
England, where, though multitudes of all degree sought for shelter and
welcome as distressed Christians and confessors, they found least
encouragement, by a fatality of the times we were fallen into, and the
uncharitable indifference of such as should have embraced them; and I
prey it be not laid to our charge.The famous Claude fled to Holland;
Allix and several more came to London, and persons of great estates came
over, who had forsaken all.France was almost dispeopled, the bankers so
broken, that the tyrant's revenue was exceedingly diminished,
manufactures ceased, and everybody there, save the Jesuits, abhorred
what was done, nor did the <DW7>s themselves approve it.What the
further intention is, time will show; but doubtless portending some
revolution.I was shown the harangue which the Bishop of Valentia on Rhone made in
the name of the Clergy, celebrating the French King, as if he was a God,
for persecuting the poor Protestants, with this expression in it, "That
as his victory over heresy was greater than all the conquests of
Alexander and Caesar, it was but what was wished in England; and that God
seemed to raise the French King to this power and magnanimous action,
that he might be in capacity to assist in doing the same here."This
paragraph is very bold and remarkable; several reflecting on Archbishop
Usher's prophecy as now begun in France, and approaching the orthodox in
all other reformed churches.One thing was much taken notice of, that
the "Gazettes" which were still constantly printed twice a week,
informing us what was done all over Europe, never spoke of this
wonderful proceeding in France; nor was any relation of it published by
any, save what private letters and the persecuted fugitives brought.Whence this silence, I list not to conjecture; but it appeared very
extraordinary in a Protestant country that we should know nothing of
what Protestants suffered, while great collections were made for them in
foreign places, more hospitable and Christian to appearance.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1685.It being an extraordinarily wet morning, and myself
indisposed by a very great rheum, I did not go to church, to my very
great sorrow, it being the first Gunpowder Conspiracy anniversary that
had been kept now these eighty years under a prince of the Roman
religion.Bonfires were forbidden on this day; what does this portend!The King in his speech
required continuance of a standing force instead of a militia, and
indemnity and dispensation to Popish officers from the Test; demands
very unexpected and unpleasing to the Commons.He also required a supply
of revenue, which they granted; but returned no thanks to the King for
his speech, till farther consideration.The Commons postponed finishing the bill for the
Supply, to consider the Test, and Popish officers; this was carried but
by one voice.I dined at Lambeth, my Lord Archbishop carrying me
with him in his barge; there were my Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Bishops
of Ely and St.Sherlock, and other divines; Sir William
Hayward, Sir Paul Rycaut, etc.The Parliament was adjourned to February, several
both of Lords and Commons excepting against some passage of his
Majesty's speech relating to the Test, and continuance of Popish
officers in command.This was a great surprise in a Parliament which
people believed would have complied in all things.Popish pamphlets and pictures sold publicly; no books nor answers to
them appearing till long after.I resigned my trust for composing a difference
between Mr.Hitherto was a very wet, warm season.Lord Sunderland was declared President of the
Council, and yet to hold his Secretary's place.The forces disposed into
several quarters through the kingdom are very insolent, on which are
great complaints.Lord Brandon, tried for the late conspiracy, was condemned and pardoned;
so was Lord Grey, his accuser and witness.Persecution in France raging, the French insolently visit our vessels,
and take away the fugitive Protestants; some escape in barrels.[Sidenote: GREENWICH]

10th December, 1685.To Greenwich, being put into the new Commission of
Sewers.Patrick, Dean of Peterborough, preached at
Whitehall, before the Princess of Denmark, who, since his Majesty came
to the Crown, always sat in the King's closet, and had the same bowings
and ceremonies applied to the place where she was, as his Majesty had
when there in person.Slayer showed us an experiment of a wonderful
nature, pouring first a very cold liquor into a glass, and superfusing
on it another, to appearance cold and clear liquor also; it first
produced a white cloud, then boiling, divers coruscations and actual
flames of fire mingled with the liquor, which being a little shaken
together, fixed divers suns and stars of real fire, perfectly globular,
on the sides of the glass, and which there stuck like so many
constellations, burning most vehemently, and resembling stars and
heavenly bodies, and that for a long space.It seemed to exhibit a
theory of the eduction of light out of the chaos, and the fixing or
gathering of the universal light into luminous bodies.This matter, or
phosphorus, was made out of human blood and urine, elucidating the vital
flame, or heat in animal bodies.I accompanied my Lord-Lieutenant as far as St.Alban's, there going out of town with him near 200 coaches of all the
great officers and nobility.The next morning taking leave, I returned
to London.I dined at the great entertainment his Majesty gave
the Venetian Ambassadors, Signors Zenno and Justiniani, accompanied with
ten more noble Venetians of their most illustrious families, Cornaro,
Maccenigo, etc., who came to congratulate their Majesties coming to the
Crown.The dinner was most magnificent and plentiful, at four tables,
with music, kettledrums, and trumpets, which sounded upon a whistle at
every health.The banquet [dessert] was twelve vast chargers piled up so
high that those who sat one against another could hardly see each other.Of these sweetmeats, which doubtless were some days piling up in that
exquisite manner, the Ambassadors touched not, but leaving them to the
spectators who came out of curiosity to see the dinner, were exceedingly
pleased to see in what a moment of time all that curious work was
demolished, the comfitures voided, and the tables cleared.Thus his
Majesty entertained them three days, which (for the table only) cost him
L600, as the Clerk of the Greencloth (Sir William Boreman) assured me.Dinner ended, I saw their procession, or cavalcade, to Whitehall,
innumerable coaches attending.The two Ambassadors had four coaches of
their own, and fifty footmen (as I remember), besides other equipage as
splendid as the occasion would permit, the Court being still in
mourning.Thence, I went to the audience which they had in the Queen's
presence chamber, the Banqueting House being full of goods and furniture
till the galleries on the garden-side, council chamber, and new chapel,
now in the building, were finished.They went to their audience in those
plain black gowns and caps which they constantly wear in the city of
Venice.I was invited to have accompanied the two Ambassadors in their
coach to supper that night, returning now to their own lodgings, as no
longer at the King's expense; but, being weary, I excused myself.My Lord Treasurer made me dine with him, where I
became acquainted with Monsieur Barillon, the French Ambassador, a
learned and crafty advocate.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th December, 1685.Turner, brother to the Bishop of Ely, and
sometime tutor to my son, preached at Whitehall on Mark viii.38,
concerning the submission of Christians to their persecutors, in which
were some passages indiscreet enough, considering the time, and the rage
of the inhuman French tyrant against the poor Protestants.Our patent for executing the office of Privy Seal
during the absence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, being this day
sealed by the Lord Chancellor, we went afterward to St.James, where the
Court then was on occasion of building at Whitehall; his Majesty
delivered the seal to my Lord Tiviot and myself, the other Commissioners
not being come, and then gave us his hand to kiss.There were the two
Venetian Ambassadors and a world of company; among the rest the first
Popish Nuncio that had been in England since the Reformation; so
wonderfully were things changed, to the universal jealousy.We were all three Commissioners sworn on our knees
by the Clerk of the Crown, before my Lord Chancellor, three several
oaths: allegiance, supremacy, and the oath belonging to the Lord Privy
Seal, which last we took standing.After this, the Lord Chancellor
invited us all to dinner, but it being Christmas eve we desired to be
excused, intending at three in the afternoon to seal divers things which
lay ready at the office; so attended by three of the Clerks of the
Signet, we met and sealed.Among other things was a pardon to West, who
being privy to the late conspiracy, had revealed the accomplices to save
his own neck.There were also another pardon and two indenizations; and
so agreeing to a fortnight's vacation, I returned home.Recollecting the passages of the year past, and
having made up accounts, humbly besought Almighty God to pardon those my
sins which had provoked him to discompose my sorrowful family; that he
would accept of our humiliation, and in his good time restore comfort to
it.I also blessed God for all his undeserved mercies and preservations,
begging the continuance of his grace and preservation.The winter had
hitherto been extraordinarily wet and mild.Imploring the continuance of God's providential
care for the year now entered, I went to the public devotions.The Dean
of the Chapel and Clerk of the Closet put out, viz, Bishop of London and
..., and Rochester and Durham put in their places; the former had
opposed the toleration intended, and shown a worthy zeal for the
reformed religion as established.I dined with the Archbishop of York, where was Peter
Walsh, that Romish priest so well known for his moderation, professing
the Church of England to be a true member of the Catholic Church.He is
used to go to our public prayers without scruple, and did not
acknowledge the Pope's infallibility, only primacy of order.Passed the Privy Seal, among others, the creation of
Mrs.Sedley (concubine to ----) Countess of Dorchester, which the Queen
took very grievously, so as for two dinners, standing near her, I
observed she hardly ate one morsel, nor spoke one word to the King, or
to any about her, though at other times she used to be extremely
pleasant, full of discourse and good humor.The Roman Catholics were
also very angry: because they had so long valued the sanctity of their
religion and proselytes.Dryden, the famous playwriter, and his two sons, and Mrs.Nelly (miss to
the late ----), were said to go to mass; such proselytes were no great
loss to the Church.This night was burnt to the ground my Lord Montague's palace in
Bloomsbury, than which for painting and furniture there was nothing more
glorious in England.This happened by the negligence of a servant
airing, as they call it, some of the goods by the fire in a moist
season; indeed, so wet and mild a season had scarce been seen in man's
memory.At this Seal there also passed the creation of Sir Henry Waldegrave to
be a Peer.He had married one of the King's natural daughters by Mrs.These two Seals my brother Commissioners passed in the
morning before I came to town, at which I was not displeased.We
likewise passed Privy Seals for L276,000 upon several accounts,
pensions, guards, wardrobes, privy purse, etc., besides divers pardons,
and one more which I must not forget (and which by Providence I was not
present at) one Mr.Lytcott to be Secretary to the Ambassador to Rome.We being three Commissioners, any two were a quorum.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1686.I dined at my Lady Arlington's, Groom of the Stole
to the Queen Dowager, at Somerset House, where dined the Countesses of
Devonshire, Dover, etc.; in all eleven ladies of quality, no man but
myself being there.Unheard-of cruelties to the persecuted Protestants
of France, such as hardly any age has seen the like, even among the
Pagans.Being the day on which his Majesty began his reign,
by order of Council it was to be solemnized with a particular office and
sermon, which the Bishop of Ely preached at Whitehall on Numb.12; a
Court oration upon the regal office.It was much wondered at, that this
day, which was that of his late Majesty's death, should be kept as a
festival, and not the day of the present King's coronation.It is said
to have been formerly the custom, though not till now since the reign of
King James I.

The Duchess of Monmouth, being in the same seat with me at church,
appeared with a very sad and afflicted countenance.I took the test in Westminster Hall, before the Lord
Chief Justice.I now came to lodge at Whitehall, in the Lord Privy
Seal's lodgings.My great cause was heard by my Lord Chancellor, who
granted me a rehearing.I had six eminent lawyers, my antagonist three,
whereof one was the smooth-tongued solicitor, whom my Lord Chancellor
reproved in great passion for a very small occasion.Blessed be God for
his great goodness to me this day!Many bloody and notorious duels were fought about
this time.Stanley, brother to the Earl
of [Derby], indeed upon an almost insufferable provocation.It is to be
hoped that his Majesty will at last severely remedy this unchristian
custom.Lord Sunderland was now Secretary of State, President of the Council,
and Premier Minister.Came Sir Gilbert Gerrard to treat with me about his
son's marrying my daughter, Susanna.The father being obnoxious, and in
some suspicion and displeasure of the King, I would receive no proposal
till his Majesty had given me leave; which he was pleased to do; but,
after several meetings we broke off, on his not being willing to secure
anything competent for my daughter's children; besides that I found most
of his estate was in the coal-pits as far off as Newcastle, and on
leases from the Bishop of Durham, who had power to make concurrent
leases, with other difficulties.Frampton, Bishop of Gloucester, preached on Psalm
xliv.17, 18, 19, showing the several afflictions of the Church of
Christ from the primitive to this day, applying exceedingly to the
present conjuncture, when many were wavering in their minds, and great
temptations appearing through the favor now found by the <DW7>s, so as
the people were full of jealousies and discouragement.The Bishop
magnified the Church of England, exhorting to constancy and
perseverance.A Council of the Royal Society about disposing of Dr.Ray's book of Fishes, which was printed at the expense of the Society.A docket was to be sealed, importing a lease of
twenty-one years to one Hall, who styled himself his Majesty's printer
(he lately turned <DW7>) for the printing missals, offices, lives of
saints, portals, primers, etc., books expressly forbidden to be printed
or sold, by divers Acts of Parliament; I refused to put my seal to it,
making my exceptions, so it was laid by.The Bishop of Bath and Wells preached on John vi.17,
a most excellent and pathetic discourse: after he had recommended the
duty of fasting and other penitential duties, he exhorted to constancy
in the Protestant religion, detestation of the unheard-of cruelties of
the French, and stirring up to a liberal contribution.This sermon was
the more acceptable, as it was unexpected from a Bishop who had
undergone the censure of being inclined to Popery, the contrary whereof
no man could show more.This indeed did all our Bishops, to the
disabusing and reproach of all their delators: for none were more
zealous against Popery than they were.I was at a review of the army about London in Hyde
Park, about 6,000 horse and foot, in excellent order; his Majesty and
infinity of people being present.I went to my house in the country, refusing to be
present at what was to pass at the Privy Seal the next day.Tenison preached an incomparable discourse at Whitehall, on
Timothy ii.Cradock (Provost of Eaton) preached at the same
place, on Psalm xlix.13, showing the vanity of earthly enjoyments.White, Bishop of Peterborough, preached in a very
eloquent style, on Matthew xxvi.29, submission to the will of God on
all accidents, and at all times.The Duke of Northumberland (a natural son of the late
King by the Duchess of Cleveland) marrying very meanly, with the help of
his brother Grafton, attempted in vain to spirit away his wife.A Brief was read in all churches for relieving the French Protestants,
who came here for protection from the unheard-of cruelties of the King.Sir Edward Hales, a <DW7>, made Governor of Dover
Castle.The Archbishop of York now died of the smallpox, aged
62, a corpulent man.He was my special loving friend, and while Bishop
of Rochester (from whence he was translated) my excellent neighbor.He
was an inexpressible loss to the whole church, and that Province
especially, being a learned, wise, stout, and most worthy prelate; I
look on this as a great stroke to the poor Church of England, now in
this defecting period.In the afternoon I went to Camberwell, to visit Dr.After sermon, I accompanied him to his house, where he showed me
the Life and Letters of the late learned Primate of Armagh (Usher), and
among them that letter of Bishop Bramhall's to the Primate, giving
notice of the Popish practices to pervert this nation, by sending a
hundred priests into England, who were to conform themselves to all
sectaries and conditions for the more easily dispersing their doctrine
among us.This letter was the cause of the whole impression being
seized, upon pretense that it was a political or historical account of
things not relating to theology, though it had been licensed by the
Bishop; which plainly showed what an interest the <DW7>s now had,--that
a Protestant book, containing the life and letters of so eminent a man,
was not to be published.There were also many letters to and from most
of the learned persons his correspondents in Europe.The book will, I
doubt not, struggle through this unjust impediment.Several Judges were put out, and new complying ones put in.This day was read in our church the Brief for a
collection for relief of the Protestant French so cruelly, barbarously,
and inhumanly oppressed without any thing being laid to their charge.It
had been long expected, and at last with difficulty procured to be
published, the interest of the French Ambassador obstructing it.There being a Seal, it was feared we should be required
to pass a docket dispensing with Dr.Obadiah Walker and four more,
whereof one was an apostate curate of Putney, the others officers of
University College, Oxford, who hold their masterships, fellowships, and
cures, and keep public schools, and enjoy all former emoluments,
notwithstanding they no more frequented or used the public forms of
prayers, or communion, with the Church of England, or took the Test or
oaths of allegiance and supremacy, contrary to twenty Acts of
Parliament; which dispensation being also contrary to his Majesty's own
gracious declaration at the beginning of his reign, gave umbrage (as
well it might) to every good Protestant; nor could we safely have passed
it under the Privy Seal, wherefore it was done by immediate warrant,
signed by Mr.This Walker was a learned person, of a monkish life, to whose tuition I
had more than thirty years since recommended the sons of my worthy
friend, Mr.Hyldyard, of Horsley in Surrey, believing him to be far from
what he proved--a hypocritical concealed <DW7>--by which he perverted
the eldest son of Mr.Hyldyard, Sir Edward Hale's eldest son, and
several more, to the great disturbance of the whole nation, as well as
of the University, as by his now public defection appeared.All engines
being now at work to bring in Popery, which God in mercy prevent![Sidenote: LONDON]

This day was burned in the old Exchange, by the common hangman, a
translation of a book written by the famous Monsieur Claude, relating
only matters of fact concerning the horrid massacres and barbarous
proceedings of the French King against his Protestant subjects, without
any refutation of any facts therein; so mighty a power and ascendant
here had the French Ambassador, who was doubtless in great indignation
at the pious and truly generous charity of all the nation, for the
relief of those miserable sufferers who came over for shelter.About this time also, the Duke of Savoy, instigated by the French King
to extirpate the Protestants of Piedmont, slew many thousands of those
innocent people, so that there seemed to be an universal design to
destroy all that would not go to mass, throughout Europe._Quod Avertat
D. O.M.!_ No faith in Princes!I refused to put the Privy Seal to Doctor Walker's
license for printing and publishing divers Popish books, of which I
complained both to my Lord of Canterbury (with whom I went to advise in
the Council Chamber), and to my Lord Treasurer that evening at his
lodgings.My Lord of Canterbury's advice was, that I should follow my
own conscience therein; Mr.Treasurer's, that if in conscience I could
dispense with it, for any other hazard he believed there was none.Notwithstanding this, I persisted in my refusal.There was no sermon on this anniversary, as there
usually had been ever since the reign of the present King.Such storms, rain, and foul weather, seldom known at this
time of the year.The camp at Hounslow Heath, from sickness and other
inconveniences of weather, forced to retire to quarters; the storms
being succeeded by excessive hot weather, many grew sick.Great feasting
there, especially in Lord Dunbarton's quarters.There were many
jealousies and discourses of what was the meaning of this encampment.A seal this day; mostly pardons and discharges of Knight Baronets'
fees, which having been passed over for so many years, did greatly
disoblige several families who had served his Majesty.Lord Tyrconnel
gone to Ireland, with great powers and commissions, giving as much cause
of talk as the camp, especially nineteen new Privy-Councillors and
Judges being now made, among which but three Protestants, and Tyrconnel
made General.New judges also here, among which was Milton, a <DW7> (brother to that
Milton who wrote for the Regicides), who presumed to take his place
without passing the Test.Scotland refused to grant liberty of mass to
the <DW7>s there.The Protestants in Savoy
successfully resist the French dragoons sent to murder them.The King's chief physician in Scotland apostatizing from the Protestant
religion, does of his own accord publish his recantation at Edinburg.I went to see Middleton's receptacle of water at the
New River, and the New Spa Wells near.My Lord Treasurer settled my great business with Mr.Pretyman, to which I hope God will at last give a prosperous issue.Sharp and Tully,
proceeded to silence and suspend divers excellent divines for preaching
against Popery.I had this day been married thirty-nine years--blessed
be God for all his mercies!The new very young Lord Chief-Justice Herbert declared on the bench,
that the government of England was entirely in the King; that the Crown
was absolute; that penal laws were powers lodged in the Crown to enable
the King to force the execution of the law, but were not bars to bind
the King's power; that he could pardon all offenses against the law, and
forgive the penalties, and why could he not dispense with them; by which
the Test was abolished?Great jealousies as to
what would be the end of these proceedings.I supped with the Countess of Rochester, where was also
the Duchess of Buckingham and Madame de Governe, whose daughter was
married to the Marquis of Halifax's son.She made me a character of the
French King and Dauphin, and of the persecution; that they kept much of
the cruelties from the King's knowledge; that the Dauphin was so afraid
of his father, that he dared not let anything appear of his sentiments;
that he hated letters and priests, spent all his time in hunting, and
seemed to take no notice of what was passing.This lady was of a great family and fortune, and had fled hither for
refuge.I waited on the Archbishop at Lambeth, where I dined and
met the famous preacher and writer, Dr.Allix, doubtless a most
excellent and learned person.The Archbishop and he spoke Latin
together, and that very readily.Meggot, Dean of Winchester preached before the
household in St.George's Chapel at Windsor, the late King's glorious
chapel now seized on by the mass priests.Cartwright, Dean of Ripon,
preached before the great men of the Court in the same place.We had now the sad news of the Bishop of Oxford's death, an
extraordinary loss to the poor Church at this time.Many candidates for
his Bishopric and Deanery, Dr.Parker, South, Aldrich, etc.Walker
(now apostatizing) came to Court, and was doubtless very busy.Note, that standing by the Queen at basset (cards), I
observed that she was exceedingly concerned for the loss of L80; her
outward affability much changed to stateliness, since she has been
exalted.The season very rainy and inconvenient for the camps.Was sealed at our office the constitution of certain
commissioners to take upon them full power of all Ecclesiastical
affairs, in as unlimited a manner, or rather greater, than the late High
Commission-Court, abrogated by Parliament; for it had not only faculty
to inspect and visit all Bishops' dioceses, but to change what laws and
statutes they should think fit to alter among the colleges, though
founded by private men; to punish, suspend, fine, etc., give oaths and
call witnesses.The main drift was to suppress zealous preachers.In
sum, it was the whole power of a Vicar-General--note the consequence!Of
the clergy the commissioners were the Archbishop of Canterbury
[Sancroft], Bishop of Durham [Crewe], and Rochester [Sprat]; of the
Temporals, the Lord Treasurer, the Lord Chancellor [Jefferies] (who
alone was ever to be of the quorum), the Chief justice [Herbert], and
Lord President [Earl of Sunderland].I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Greenwich.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th August, 1686.I dined at Signor Verrio's, the famous Italian
painter, now settled in his Majesty's garden at St.James's, which he
had made a very delicious paradise.Our vicar gone to dispose of his country living in
Rutlandshire, having St.Dunstan in the east given him by the Archbishop
of Canterbury.I went to visit the Marquis Ravigne, now my neighbor at Greenwich,
retired from the persecution in France.He was the deputy of all the
Protestants of that kingdom in the parliament of Paris, and several
times Ambassador in this and other Courts; a person of great learning
and experience.Compton, Bishop of London, was on Monday
suspended, on pretense of not silencing Dr.Giles's, for
something of a sermon in which he zealously reproved the doctrine of the
Roman Catholics.The Bishop having consulted the civilians, they told
him he could not by any law proceed against Dr.Sharp without producing
witnesses, and impleaded according to form; but it was overruled by my
Lord Chancellor, and the Bishop sentenced without so much as being heard
to any purpose.This was thought a very extraordinary way of proceeding,
and was universally resented, and so much the rather for that two
Bishops, Durham and Rochester, sitting in the commission and giving
their suffrages the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to sit among them.He was only suspended _ab officio_, and that was soon after taken off.He was brother to the Earl of Northampton, had once been a soldier, had
traveled in Italy, but became a sober, grave, and excellent prelate.Buda now taken from the Turks; a form of
thanksgiving was ordered to be used in the (as yet remaining) Protestant
chapels and church of Whitehall and Windsor.The King of Denmark was besieging Hamburg, no doubt by the French
contrivance, to embroil the Protestant Princes in a new war, that
Holland, etc., being engaged, matter for new quarrel might arise: the
unheard-of persecution of the poor Protestants still raging more than
ever.The Danes retire from Hamburg, the Protestant
Princes appearing for their succor, and the Emperor sending his
minatories to the King of Denmark, and also requiring the restoration of
the Duke of Saxe Gotha.Thus it pleased God to defeat the French
designs, which were evidently to kindle a new war.His Majesty's birthday; I was at his rising in his
bedchamber, afterward in the park, where four companies of guards were
drawn up.The officers, etc., wonderfully rich and gallant; they did not
head their troops, but their next officers, the colonels being on
horseback by the King while they marched.The ladies not less splendid
at Court, where there was a ball at night; but small appearance of
quality.All the shops both in the city and suburbs were shut up, and
kept as solemnly as any holiday.Bonfires at night in Westminster, but
forbidden in the city.Patrick, Dean of Peterborough, preached at
Covent Garden Church on Ephes.18, 19, showing the custom of the
primitive saints in serving God with hymns, and their frequent use of
them upon all occasions: touching the profane way of mirth and
intemperance of this ungodly age.Afterward I visited my Lord Chief
Justice of Ireland, with whom I had long and private discourse
concerning the miserable condition that kingdom was like to be in, if
Tyrconnel's counsel should prevail at Court.Went with the Countess of Sunderland to Cranbourne,
a lodge and walk of my Lord Godolphin's in Windsor park.There was one
room in the house spared in the pulling down the old one, because the
late Duchess of York was born in it; the rest was built and added to it
by Sir George Carteret, Treasurer of the Navy; and since, the whole was
purchased by my Lord Godolphin, who spoke to me to go see it, and advise
what trees were fit to be cut down to improve the dwelling, being
environed with old rotten pollards, which corrupt the air.It stands on
a knoll which though insensibly rising, gives it a prospect over the
Keep of Windsor, about three miles N. E. of it.The ground is clayey and
moist; the water stark naught; the park is pretty; the house tolerable,
and gardens convenient.After dinner, we came back to London, having two
coaches both going and coming, of six horses apiece, which we changed at
Hounslow.Warren preached before the Princess at
Whitehall, on 5th Matthew, of the blessedness of the pure in heart, most
elegantly describing the bliss of the beatifical vision.In the
afternoon, Sir George Wheeler, knight and baronet, preached on the 4th
Matt.Margaret's, an honest and
devout discourse, and pretty tolerably performed.This gentleman coming
from his travels out of Greece, fell in love with the daughter of Sir
Thomas Higgins, his Majesty's resident at Venice, niece to the Earl of
Bath, and married her.When they returned into England, being honored
with knighthood, he would needs turn preacher, and took orders.He
published a learned and ingenious book of his travels, and is a very
worthy person, a little formal and particular, but exceedingly devout.There was a triumphant show of the Lord Mayor both
by land and water, with much solemnity, when yet his power has been so
much diminished, by the loss of the city's former charter.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1686.Birch preached very boldly against the <DW7>s, from John xvi.Tillotson in Lincoln's Inn chapel, on the same
text, but more cautiously.I went with part of my family to pass the
melancholy winter in London at my son's house in Arundel Buildings.I dined at my Lady Arlington's, Groom of the Stole
to the Queen Dowager at Somerset House, where dined divers French
noblemen, driven out of their country by the persecution.I carried the Countess of Sunderland to see the
rarities of one Mr.Charlton in the Middle Temple, who showed us such a
collection as I had never seen in all my travels abroad either of
private gentlemen, or princes.It consisted of miniatures, drawings,
shells, insects, medals, natural things, animals (of which divers, I
think 100, were kept in glasses of spirits of wine), minerals, precious
stones, vessels, curiosities in amber, crystal, agate, etc.; all being
very perfect and rare of their kind, especially his books of birds,
fish, flowers, and shells, drawn and miniatured to the life.He told us
that one book stood him in L300; it was painted by that excellent
workman, whom the late Gaston, Duke of Orleans, employed.This
gentleman's whole collection, gathered by himself, traveling over most
parts of Europe, is estimated at L8,000.He appeared to be a modest and
obliging person.[62]

    [Footnote 62: This collection was afterward purchased by Sir Hans
    Sloane, and now forms part oL the British Museum.][Sidenote: LONDON]

29th December, 1686.I went to hear the music of the Italians in the
new chapel, now first opened publicly at Whitehall for the Popish
Service.Nothing can be finer than the magnificent marble work and
architecture at the end, where are four statues, representing St.Paul, and the Church, in white marble, the work of Mr.Gibbons, with all the carving and pillars of exquisite art and great
cost.The altar piece is the Salutation; the volto in _fresco_, the
Assumption of the blessed Virgin, according to their tradition, with our
blessed Savior, and a world of figures painted by Verrio.The throne
where the King and Queen sit is very glorious, in a closet above, just
opposite to the altar.Here we saw the Bishop in his mitre and rich
copes, with six or seven Jesuits and others in rich copes, sumptuously
habited, often taking off and putting on the Bishop's mitre, who sat in
a chair with arms pontifically, was adored and censed by three Jesuits
in their copes; then he went to the altar and made divers cringes, then
censing the images and glorious tabernacle placed on the altar, and now
and then changing place: the crosier, which was of silver, was put into
his hand with a world of mysterious ceremony, the music playing, with
singing.I could not have believed I should ever have seen such things
in the King of England's palace, after it had pleased God to enlighten
this nation; but our great sin has, for the present, eclipsed the
blessing, which I hope he will in mercy and his good time restore to its
purity.He wrote excellently, in answer
to the Bishop of Meaux.A Seal to confirm a gift of L4,000 per annum for 99
years to the Lord Treasurer out of the Post Office, and L1,700 per annum
for ever out of Lord Grey's estate.There was now another change of the great officers.The Treasury was put
into commission, two professed <DW7>s among them, viz, Lords Bellasis
and Dover, joined with the old ones, Lord Godolphin, Sir Stephen Fox,
and Sir John Ernley.Much expectation of several great men declaring
themselves <DW7>s.Lord Tyrconnel gone to succeed the Lord-Lieutenant
[Clarendon] in Ireland, to the astonishment of all sober men, and to the
evident ruin of the Protestants in that kingdom, as well as of its great
improvement going on.Much discourse that all the White Staff officers
and others should be dismissed for adhering to their religion.Popish
Justices of the Peace established in all counties, of the meanest of the
people; Judges ignorant of the law, and perverting it--so furiously do
the Jesuits drive, and even compel Princes to violent courses, and
destruction of an excellent government both in Church and State.God of
his infinite mercy open our eyes, and turn our hearts, and establish his
truth with peace!The Lord Jesus defend his little flock, and preserve
this threatened church and nation!I saw the Queen's new apartment at Whitehall, with
her new bed, the embroidery of which cost L3,000.The carving about the
chimney piece, by Gibbons, is incomparable.I heard the famous eunuch, Cifaccio, sing in the new
Popish chapel this afternoon; it was indeed very rare, and with great
skill.He came over from Rome, esteemed one of the best voices in Italy.Chetwin preached at Whitehall on Rom.18, a
very quaint, neat discourse of Moral righteousness.Came out a proclamation for universal liberty of
conscience in Scotland, and depensation from all tests and laws to the
contrary, as also capacitating <DW7>s to be chosen into all offices of
trust.Meggott, Dean of Winchester, preached before the
Princess of Denmark, on Matt.In the afternoon, I went out of
town to meet my Lord Clarendon, returning from Ireland.His Majesty sent for the Commissioners of the Privy
Seal this morning into his bedchamber, and told us that though he had
thought fit to dispose of the Seal into a single hand, yet he would so
provide for us, as it should appear how well he accepted our faithful
and loyal service with many gracious expressions to this effect; upon
which we delivered the Seal into his hands.It was by all the world both
hoped and expected, that he would have restored it to my Lord Clarendon;
but they were astonished to see it given to Lord Arundel, of Wardour, a
zealous Roman Catholic.Indeed it was very hard, and looked very
unkindly, his Majesty (as my Lord Clarendon protested to me, on my going
to visit him and long discoursing with him about the affairs of Ireland)
finding not the least failure of duty in him during his government of
that kingdom, so that his recall plainly appeared to be from the
stronger influence of the <DW7>s, who now got all the preferments.Most of the great officers, both in the Court and country, Lords and
others, were dismissed, as they would not promise his Majesty their
consent to the repeal of the test and penal statutes against Popish
Recusants.To this end, most of the Parliament men were spoken to in his
Majesty's closet, and such as refused, if in any place of office or
trust, civil or military, were put out of their employments.This was a
time of great trial; but hardly one of them assented, which put the
Popish interest much backward.The English clergy everywhere preached
boldly against their superstition and errors, and were wonderfully
followed by the people.Not one considerable proselyte was made in all
this time.The party were exceedingly put to the worst by the preaching
and writing of the Protestants in many excellent treatises, evincing the
doctrine and discipline of the reformed religion, to the manifest
disadvantage of their adversaries.To this did not a little contribute
the sermon preached at Whitehall before the Princess of Denmark and a
great crowd of people, and at least thirty of the greatest nobility, by
Dr.Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells, on John viii.46 (the Gospel of the
day), describing through his whole discourse the blasphemies, perfidy,
wresting of Scripture, preference of tradition before it, spirit of
persecution, superstition, legends, and fables of the Scribes and
Pharisees, so that all the auditory understood his meaning of a parallel
between them and the Romish priests, and their new Trent religion.He
exhorted his audience to adhere to the written Word, and to persevere in
the Faith taught in the Church of England, whose doctrine for Catholic
and soundness he preferred to all the communities and churches of
Christians in the world; concluding with a kind of prophecy, that
whatever it suffered, it should after a short trial emerge to the
confusion of her adversaries and the glory of God.I went this evening to see the order of the boys and children at
Christ's Hospital.There were near 800 boys and girls so decently clad,
cleanly lodged, so wholesomely fed, so admirably taught, some the
mathematics, especially the forty of the late King's foundation, that I
was delighted to see the progress some little youths of thirteen or
fourteen years of age had made.I saw them at supper, visited their
dormitories, and much admired the order, economy, and excellent
government of this most charitable seminary.Some are taught for the
Universities, others designed for seamen, all for trades and callings.The girls are instructed in all such work as becomes their sex and may
fit them for good wives, mistresses, and to be a blessing to their
generation.They sang a psalm before they sat down to supper in the
great Hall, to an organ which played all the time, with such cheerful
harmony, that it seemed to me a vision of angels.I came from the place
with infinite satisfaction, having never seen a more noble, pious, and
admirable charity.[63] The
foundation was of that pious Prince King Edward VI., whose picture (held
to be an original of Holbein) is in the court where the Governors meet
to consult on the affairs of the Hospital, and his statue in white
marble stands in a niche of the wall below, as you go to the church,
which is a modern, noble, and ample fabric.This foundation has had, and
still has, many benefactors.[Footnote 63: This is by no means the case now.]I saw a trial of those devilish, murdering, mischief
doing engines called bombs, shot out of the mortar piece on Blackheath.The distance that they are cast, the destruction they make where they
fall, is prodigious.Martin's to a crowd of people not to be expressed, nor the wonderful
eloquence of this admirable preacher; the text was Matt.36 to
verse 40, describing the bitterness of our Blessed Savior's agony, the
ardor of his love, the infinite obligations we have to imitate his
patience and resignation; the means by watching against temptations, and
over ourselves with fervent prayer to attain it, and the exceeding
reward in the end.Upon all which he made most pathetical discourses.The Communion followed, at which I was participant.Tenison's with the Bishop and that young, most learned, pious, and
excellent preacher, Mr.In the afternoon, I went to hear Mr.Wake
at the newly built church of St.34, upon the
subject of taking up the cross, and strenuously behaving ourselves in
time of persecution, as this now threatened to be.His Majesty again prorogued the Parliament, foreseeing it would not
remit the laws against <DW7>s, by the extraordinary zeal and bravery of
its members, and the free renunciation of the great officers both in
Court and state, who would not be prevailed with for any temporal
concern.During the service, a man came into near the middle of the
church, with his sword drawn, with several others in that posture; in
this jealous time it put the congregation into great confusion, but it
appeared to be one who fled for sanctuary, being pursued by bailiffs.I had a rehearing of my great cause at the Chancery in
Westminster Hall, having seven of the most learned Counsel, my adversary
five, among which were the Attorney General and late Solicitor Finch,
son to the Lord Chancellor Nottingham.The account was at last brought
to one article of the surcharge, and referred to a Master.The cause
lasted two hours and more.In the last week there was issued a Dispensation from
all obligations and tests, by which Dissenters and <DW7>s especially
had public liberty of exercising their several ways of worship, without
incurring the penalty of the many Laws and Acts of Parliament to the
contrary.This was purely obtained by the <DW7>s, thinking thereby to
ruin the Church of England, being now the only church which so admirably
and strenuously opposed their superstition.There was a wonderful
concourse of people at the Dissenters' meeting house in this parish, and
the parish church [Deptford] left exceedingly thin.What this will end
in, God Almighty only knows; but it looks like confusion, which I pray
God avert.[Sidenote: LONDON]

11th April, 1687.To London about my suit, some terms of accommodation
being proposed.I heard the famous singer, Cifaccio, esteemed the best
in Europe.Indeed, his holding out and delicateness in extending and
loosing a note with incomparable softness and sweetness, was admirable;
for the rest I found him a mere wanton, effeminate child, very coy, and
proudly conceited, to my apprehension.He touched the harpsichord to his
voice rarely well.This was before a select number of particular persons
whom Mr.Pepys invited to his house; and this was obtained by particular
favor and much difficulty, the Signor much disdaining to show his talent
to any but princes.At Greenwich, at the conclusion of the Church service,
there was a French sermon preached after the use of the English Liturgy
translated into French, to a congregation of about 100 French refugees,
of whom Monsieur Ruvigny was the chief, and had obtained the use of the
church, after the parish service was ended.The preacher pathetically
exhorted to patience, constancy, and reliance on God amidst all their
sufferings, and the infinite rewards to come.I dined with Mynheer Diskvelts, the Holland Ambassador, a
prudent and worthy person.There dined Lord Middleton, principal
Secretary of State, Lord Pembroke, Lord Lumley, Lord Preston, Colonel
Fitzpatrick, and Sir John Chardin.After dinner, the Ambassador
discoursed of and deplored the stupid folly of our politics, in
suffering the French to take Luxemburg, it being a place of the most
concern to have been defended, for the interest not only of the
Netherlands, but of England.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th May, 1687.Lord Sunderland being Lord President and
Secretary of State, was made Knight of the Garter and Prime favorite.This day there was such a storm of wind as had seldom happened, being a
sort of hurricane.It kept the flood out of the Thames, so that people
went on foot over several places above bridge.Also an earthquake in
several places in England about the time of the storm.Pretyman, after
my tedious suit.I went to London, it having pleased his Majesty to grant
me a Privy Seal for L6,000, for discharge of the debt I had been so many
years persecuted for, it being indeed for money drawn over by my
father-in-law, Sir R. Browne, during his residence in the Court of
France, and so with a much greater sum due to Sir Richard from his
Majesty; and now this part of the arrear being paid, there remains yet
due to me, as executor of Sir Richard, above L6,500 more; but this
determining an expensive Chancery suit has been so great a mercy and
providence to me (through the kindness and friendship to me of Lord
Godolphin, one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury,) that I do
acknowledge it with all imaginable thanks to my gracious God.I visited my Lady Pierpoint, daughter to Sir John
Evelyn, of Deane [in Wilts], now widow of Mr.Pierpoint, and mother of
the Earl of Kingston.She was now engaged in the marriage of my cousin,
Evelyn Pierpoint, her second son.There was about this time brought into the Downs a vast treasure, which
was sunk in a Spanish galleon about forty-five years ago, somewhere near
Hispaniola, or the Bahama islands, and was now weighed up by some
gentlemen, who were at the charge of divers, etc., to the enriching them
beyond all expectation.The Duke of Albemarle's share [Governor of
Jamaica] came to, I believe, L50,000.Some private gentlemen who
adventured L100, gained from L8,000 to L10,000.His Majesty's tenth was
L10,000.The Camp was now again pitched at Hounslow, the Commanders profusely
vying in the expense and magnificence of tents.21, upon the danger
of relapsing into sin.After this, I went and heard M. Lamot, an
eloquent French preacher at Greenwich, on Prov.8, 9, a consolatory
discourse to the poor and religious refugees who escaped out of France
in the cruel persecution.I went to Hampton Court to give his Majesty thanks for
his late gracious favor, though it was but granting what was due.While
I was in the Council Chamber, came in some persons, at the head of whom
was a formal man with a large roll of parchment in his hand, being an
ADDRESS (as he said, for he introduced it with a speech) of the people
of Coventry, giving his Majesty their great acknowledgments for his
granting a liberty of conscience; he added that this was not the
application of one party only, but the unanimous address of Church of
England men, Presbyterians, Independents, and Anabaptists, to show how
extensive his Majesty's grace was, as taking in all parties to his
indulgence and protection, which had removed all dissensions and
animosities, which would not only unite them in bonds of Christian
charity, but exceedingly encourage their future industry, to the
improvement of trade, and spreading his Majesty's glory throughout the
world; and that now he had given to God his empire, God would establish
his; with expressions of great loyalty and submission; and so he gave
the roll to the King, which being returned to him again, his Majesty
caused him to read.The address was short, but much to the substance of
the speech of their foreman, to whom the King, pulling off his hat, said
that what he had done in giving liberty of conscience, was, what was
ever his judgment ought to be done; and that, as he would preserve them
in their enjoyment of it during his reign, so he would endeavor to
settle it by law, that it should never be altered by his successors.After this, he gave them his hand to kiss.It was reported the
subscribers were above 1,000.But this is not so remarkable as an address of the week before (as I was
assured by one present), of some of the FAMILY OF LOVE, His Majesty
asked them what this worship consisted in, and how many their party
might consist of; they told him their custom was to read the Scripture,
and then to preach; but did not give any further account, only said that
for the rest they were a sort of refined Quakers, but their number very
small, not consisting, as they said, of above threescore in all, and
those chiefly belonging to the Isle of Ely.Blathwaite's (two miles from Hampton).This gentleman is Secretary of War, Clerk of the Council, etc., having
raised himself by his industry from very moderate circumstances.He is a
very proper, handsome person, very dexterous in business, and besides
all this, has married a great fortune.His income by the Army, Council,
and Secretary to the Committee of Foreign Plantations, brings him in
above L2,000 per annum.The Privy Seal for L6,000 was passed to me, so that this
tedious affair was dispatched.Hitherto, a very windy and tempestuous
summer.The French sermons to the refugees were continued at Greenwich
Church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1687.In the way, I dined at Ashted, with
my Lady Mordaunt.I went to see Albury, now purchased by Mr.Finch (the
King's Solicitor and son to the late Lord Chancellor); I found the
garden which I first designed for the Duke of Norfolk, nothing improved.I went to visit Lord Clarendon at Swallowfield, where
was my Lord Cornbury just arrived from Denmark, whither he had
accompanied the Prince of Denmark two months before, and now come back.The miserable tyranny under which that nation lives, he related to us;
the King keeps them under an army of 40,000 men, all Germans, he not
daring to trust his own subjects.Notwithstanding this, the Danes are
exceedingly proud, the country very poor and miserable.Returned home to Sayes Court from Wotton, having been
five weeks absent with my brother and friends, who entertained us very
nobly.God be praised for his goodness, and this refreshment after my
many troubles, and let his mercy and providence ever preserve me.The Lord Mayor sent me an Officer with a staff, to
be one of the Governors of St.PERSECUTION RAGING IN FRANCE; divers churches there fired by lightning,
priests struck, consecrated hosts, etc., burnt and destroyed, both at
St.Malos and Paris, at the grand procession on Corpus Christi day.I went to Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop.After dinner, I retired into the library, which I found exceedingly
improved; there are also divers rare manuscripts in a room apart.I was godfather to Sir John Chardin's son, christened
at Greenwich Church, named John.The Earl of Bath and Countess of
Carlisle, the other sponsors.An Anabaptist, a very odd ignorant person, a
mechanic, I think, was Lord Mayor.The King and Queen, and Dadi, the
Pope's Nuncio, invited to a feast at Guildhall.A strange turn of
affairs, that those who scandalized the Church of England as favorers of
Popery, should publicly invite an emissary from Rome, one who
represented the very person of their Antichrist!My son was returned out of Devon, where he had been
on a commission from the Lords of the Treasury about a concealment of
land.I went with my Lord Chief-Justice Herbert, to see
his house at Walton-on-Thames: it is a barren place.To a very ordinary
house he had built a very handsome library, designing more building to
it than the place deserves, in my opinion.He desired my advice about
laying out his gardens, etc.The next day, we went to Weybridge, to see
some pictures of the Duchess of Norfolk's, particularly the statue, or
child in gremio, said to be of Michael Angelo; but there are reasons to
think it rather a copy, from some proportion in the figures ill taken.Slingsby, Master of the Mint, being under
very deplorable circumstances on account of his creditors, and
especially the King, I did my endeavor with the Lords of the Treasury to
be favorable to him.My Lord Arran, eldest son to the Duke of Hamilton, being now married to
Lady Ann Spencer, eldest daughter of the Earl of Sunderland, Lord
President of the Council, I and my family had most glorious favors sent
us, the wedding being celebrated with extraordinary splendor.There was a solemn and particular office used at
our, and all the churches of London and ten miles round, for a
thanksgiving to God, for her Majesty being with child.This afternoon I went not to church, being employed
on a religious treatise I had undertaken._Post annum 1588--1660--1688, Annus Mirabilis Tertius._[64]

    [Footnote 64: This seems to have been added after the page was
    written.]Being the Martyrdom day of King Charles I., our
curate made a florid oration against the murder of that excellent
Prince, with an exhortation to obedience from the example of David; 1
Samuel xxvi.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th February, 1688.My daughter Evelyn going in the coach to visit in
the city, a jolt (the door being not fast shut) flung her quite out in
such manner, as the hind wheels passed over her a little above her
knees.Yet it pleased God, besides the bruises of the wheels, she had no
other harm.In two days she was able to walk, and soon after perfectly
well; through God Almighty's great mercy to an excellent wife and a most
dutiful and discreet daughter-in-law.I received the sad news of my niece Montague's
death at Woodcot on the 15th.I gave in my account about the sick and wounded, in
order to have my quietus.Parker, Bishop of Oxford, who so lately published
his extravagant treatise about transubstantiation, and for abrogating
the test and penal laws, died.He was esteemed a violent, passionate,
haughty man, but yet being pressed to declare for the Church of Rome, he
utterly refused it.The French TYRANT now finding he could make no proselytes among those
Protestants of quality, and others, whom he had caused to be shut up in
dungeons, and confined to nunneries and monasteries, gave them, after so
long trial, a general releasement, and leave to go out of the kingdom,
but utterly taking their estates and their children; so that great
numbers came daily into England and other places, where they were
received and relieved with very considerate Christian charity.This
Providence and goodness of God to those who thus constantly held out,
did so work upon those miserable poor souls who, to avoid the
persecution, signed their renunciation, and to save their estates went
to mass, that reflecting on what they had done, they grew so affected in
their conscience, that not being able to support it, they in great
numbers through all the French provinces, acquainted the magistrates and
lieutenants that being sorry for their apostacy, they were resolved to
return to their old religion; that they would go no more to mass, but
peaceably assemble when they could, to beg pardon and worship God, but
so without weapons as not to give the least umbrage of rebellion or
sedition, imploring their pity and commiseration; and, accordingly,
meeting so from time to time, the dragoon-missioners, Popish officers
and priests, fell upon them, murdered and put them to death, whoever
they could lay hold on; they without the least resistance embraced
death, torture, or hanging, with singing psalms and praying for their
persecutors to the last breath, yet still continuing the former
assembling of themselves in desolate places, suffering with incredible
constancy, that through God's mercy they might obtain pardon for this
lapse.Such examples of Christian behavior have not been seen since the
primitive persecutions; and doubtless God will do some signal work in
the end, if we can with patience and resignation hold out, and depend on
his Providence.I went with Sir Charles Littleton to Sheen, a house
and estate given him by Lord Brounker; one who was ever noted for a
hard, covetous, vicious man; but for his worldly craft and skill in
gaming few exceeded him.Coming to die, he bequeathed all his land,
house, furniture, etc., to Sir Charles, to whom he had no manner of
relation, but an ancient friendship contracted at the famous siege of
Colchester, forty years before.It is a pretty place, with fine gardens,
and well planted, and given to one worthy of them, Sir Charles being an
honest gentleman and soldier.He is brother to Sir Henry Littleton of
Worcestershire, whose great estate he is likely to inherit, his brother
being without children.They are descendants of the great lawyer of that
name, and give the same arms and motto.Temple, formerly maid of honor to the late Queen, a beautiful lady, and
he has many fine children, so that none envy his good fortune.After dinner, we went to see Sir William Temple's near to it; the
most remarkable things are his orangery and gardens, where the
wall-fruit-trees are most exquisitely nailed and trained, far better
than I ever noted.There are many good pictures, especially of Vandyke's, in both these
houses, and some few statues and small busts in the latter.From thence to Kew, to visit Sir Henry Capel's, whose orangery and
_myrtetum_ are most beautiful and perfectly well kept.He was contriving
very high palisadoes of reeds to shade his oranges during the summer,
and painting those reeds in oil.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st April, 1688.In the morning, the first sermon was by Dr.Paul's (at Whitehall), on Luke x.The
Holy Communion followed, but was so interrupted by the rude breaking in
of multitudes zealous to hear the second sermon, to be preached by the
Bishop of Bath and Wells, that the latter part of that holy office could
hardly be heard, or the sacred elements be distributed without great
trouble.The Princess being come, he preached on Mich.8, 9, 10,
describing the calamity of the Reformed Church of Judah under the
Babylonian persecution, for her sins, and God's delivery of her on her
repentance; that as Judah emerged, so should the now Reformed Church,
whenever insulted and persecuted.He preached with his accustomed
action, zeal, and energy, so that people flocked from all quarters to
hear him.A dry, cold, backward spring; easterly winds.The persecution still raging in France, multitudes of Protestants, and
many very considerable and great persons flying hither, produced a
second general contribution, the <DW7>s, by God's Providence, as yet
making small progress among us.The weather was, till now, so cold and sharp, by an
almost perpetual east wind, which had continued many months, that there
was little appearance of any spring, and yet the winter was very
favorable as to frost and snow.To London, about my petition for allowances upon the
account of Commissioner for Sick and Wounded in the former war with
Holland.His Majesty, alarmed by the great fleet of the Dutch
(while we had a very inconsiderable one), went down to Chatham; their
fleet was well prepared, and out, before we were in any readiness, or
had any considerable number to have encountered them, had there been
occasion, to the great reproach of the nation; while being in profound
peace, there was a mighty land army, which there was no need of, and no
force at sea, where only was the apprehension; but the army was
doubtless kept and increased, in order to bring in and countenance
Popery, the King beginning to discover his intention, by many instances
pursued by the Jesuits, against his first resolution to alter nothing in
the Church Establishment, so that it appeared there can be no reliance
on Popish promises.The King enjoining the ministers to read his
Declaration for giving liberty of conscience (as it was styled) in all
churches of England, this evening, six Bishops, Bath and Wells,[65]
Peterborough,[66] Ely,[67] Chichester,[68] St.Asaph,[69] and
Bristol,[70] in the name of all the rest of the Bishops, came to his
Majesty to petition him, that he would not impose the reading of it to
the several congregations within their dioceses; not that they were
averse to the publishing it for want of due tenderness toward
dissenters, in relation to whom they should be willing to come to such a
temper as should be thought fit, when that matter might be considered
and settled in Parliament and Convocation; but that, the Declaration
being founded on such a dispensing power as might at pleasure set aside
all laws ecclesiastical and civil, it appeared to them illegal, as it
had done to the Parliament in 1661 and 1672, and that it was a point of
such consequence, that they could not so far make themselves parties to
it, as the reading of it in church in time of divine service amounted
to.[Footnote 70: Sir John Trelawny, Bart.]The King was so far incensed at this address, that he with threatening
expressions commanded them to obey him in reading it at their perils,
and so dismissed them.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th May, 1688.I went to Whitehall Chapel, where, after the morning
lessons, the Declaration was read by one of the choir who used to read
the chapters.I hear it was in the Abbey Church, Westminster, but almost
universally forborne throughout all London: the consequences of which a
little time will show.All the discourse now was about the Bishops refusing to
read the injunction for the abolition of the Test, etc.It seems the
injunction came so crudely from the Secretary's office, that it was
neither sealed nor signed in form, nor had any lawyer been consulted, so
as the Bishops who took all imaginable advice, put the Court to great
difficulties how to proceed against them.Great were the consults, and a
proclamation was expected all this day; but nothing was done.The action
of the Bishops was universally applauded, and reconciled many adverse
parties, <DW7>s only excepted, who were now exceedingly perplexed, and
violent courses were every moment expected.Report was, that the
Protestant secular Lords and Nobility would abet the Clergy.The Queen Dowager, hitherto bent on her return into Portugal, now on the
sudden, on allegation of a great debt owing her by his Majesty disabling
her, declares her resolution to stay.News arrived of the most prodigious earthquake that was almost ever
heard of, subverting the city of Lima and country in Peru, with a
dreadful inundation following it.This day, the Archbishop of Canterbury, with the
Bishops of Ely, Chichester, St.Asaph, Bristol, Peterborough, and Bath
and Wells, were sent from the Privy Council prisoners to the Tower, for
refusing to give bail for their appearance, on their not reading the
Declaration for liberty of conscience; they refused to give bail, as it
would have prejudiced their peerage.The concern of the people for them
was wonderful, infinite crowds on their knees begging their blessing,
and praying for them, as they passed out of the barge along the Tower
wharf.A YOUNG PRINCE born, which will cause disputes.About two o'clock, we heard the Tower ordnance discharged, and the bells
ring for the birth of a Prince of Wales.This was very surprising, it
having been universally given out that her Majesty did not look till the
next month.I went to the Tower to see the Bishops, visited the
Archbishop and the Bishops of Ely, St.Being the first day of term, the Bishops were brought
to Westminster on habeas corpus, when the indictment was read, and they
were called on to plead; their counsel objected that the warrant was
illegal; but, after long debate, it was overruled, and they pleaded.The
Court then offered to take bail for their appearance; but this they
refused, and at last were dismissed on their own recognizances to appear
that day fortnight; the Archbishop in L200, the Bishops in L100 each.Was a day of thanksgiving in London and ten miles about
for the young Prince's birth; a form of prayer made for the purpose by
the Bishop of Rochester.They appeared; the trial lasted from nine in the
morning to past six in the evening, when the jury retired to consider of
their verdict, and the Court adjourned to nine the next morning.The
jury were locked up till that time, eleven of them being for an
acquittal; but one (Arnold, a brewer) would not consent.At length he
agreed with the others.The Chief Justice, Wright, behaved with great
moderation and civility to the Bishops.Alibone, a <DW7>, was strongly
against them; but Holloway and Powell being of opinion in their favor,
they were acquitted.When this was heard, there was great rejoicing; and
there was a lane of people from the King's Bench to the water side, on
their knees, as the Bishops passed and repassed, to beg their blessing.Bonfires were made that night, and bells rung, which was taken very ill
at Court, and an appearance of nearly sixty Earls and Lords, etc., on
the bench, did not a little comfort them; but indeed they were all along
full of comfort and cheerful.Note, they denied to pay the Lieutenant of the Tower (Hales, who used
them very surlily), any fees, alleging that none were due.The night was solemnized with bonfires, and other fireworks, etc.The two judges, Holloway and Powell, were displaced.Godolphin and his brother Sir William to
St.Alban's, to see a library he would have bought of the widow of Dr.Cartwright, late Archdeacon of St.Alban's, a very good collection of
books, especially in divinity; he was to give L300 for them.Having seen
the GREAT CHURCH, now newly repaired by a public contribution, we
returned home.One of the King's chaplains preached before the Princess
on Exodus xiv.13, "Stand still, and behold the salvation of the Lord,"
which he applied so boldly to the present conjuncture of the Church of
England, that more could scarce be said to encourage desponders.The
Popish priests were not able to carry their cause against their learned
adversaries, who confounded them both by their disputes and writings.The camp now began at Hounslow, but the nation was in
high discontent.Colonel Titus, Sir Henry Vane (son of him who was executed for his
treason), and some other of the Presbyterians and Independent party,
were sworn of the Privy Council, from hopes of thereby diverting that
party from going over to the Bishops and Church of England, which now
they began to do, foreseeing the design of the <DW7>s to descend and
take in their most hateful of heretics (as they at other times expressed
them to be) to effect their own ends, now evident; the utter extirpation
of the Church of England first, and then the rest would follow.This night the fireworks were played off, that had been
prepared for the Queen's upsitting.We saw them to great advantage; they
were very fine, and cost some thousands of pounds, in the pyramids,
statues, etc., but were spent too soon for so long a preparation.I went to Lambeth to visit the Archbishop, whom I
found very cheerful.Tenison now told me there would suddenly be some
great thing discovered.This was the Prince of Orange intending to come
over.I went to Althorpe, in Northamptonshire, seventy
miles.A coach and four horses took up me and my son at Whitehall, and
carried us to Dunstable, where we arrived and dined at noon, and from
thence another coach and six horses carried us to Althorpe, four miles
beyond Northampton, where we arrived by seven o'clock that evening.Both
these coaches were hired for me by that noble Countess of Sunderland,
who invited me to her house at Althorpe, where she entertained me and my
son with very extraordinary kindness; I stayed till the Thursday.Jeffryes, the minister of Althorpe, who was my
Lord's chaplain when ambassador in France, preached the shortest
discourse I ever heard; but what was defective in the amplitude of his
sermon, he had supplied in the largeness and convenience of the
parsonage house, which the doctor (who had at least L600 a year in
spiritual advancement) had newly built, and made fit for a person of
quality to live in, with gardens and all accommodation according
therewith.My lady carried us to see Lord Northampton's Seat, a very strong, large
house, built with stone, not altogether modern.They were enlarging the
garden, in which was nothing extraordinary, except the iron gate opening
into the park, which indeed was very good work, wrought in flowers
painted with blue and gilded.There is a noble walk of elms toward the
front of the house by the bowling green.I was not in any room of the
house besides a lobby looking into the garden, where my Lord and his new
Countess (Sir Stephen Fox's daughter, whom I had known from a child)
entertained the Countess and her daughter the Countess of Arran (newly
married to the son of the Duke of Hamilton), with so little good grace,
and so dully, that our visit was very short, and so we returned to
Althorpe, twelve miles distant.[Sidenote: ALTHORPE]

The house, or rather palace, at Althorpe, is a noble uniform pile in
form of a half H, built of brick and freestone, balustered and _a la
moderne_; the hall is well, the staircase excellent; the rooms of state,
galleries, offices and furniture, such as may become a great prince.It
is situated in the midst of a garden, exquisitely planted and kept, and
all this in a park walled in with hewn stone, planted with rows and
walks of trees, canals and fish ponds, and stored with game.And, what
is above all this, governed by a lady, who without any show of
solicitude, keeps everything in such admirable order, both within and
without, from the garret to the cellar, that I do not believe there is
any in this nation, or in any other, that exceeds her in such exact
order, without ostentation, but substantially great and noble.The
meanest servant is lodged so neat and cleanly; the service at the
several tables, the good order and decency--in a word, the entire
economy is perfectly becoming a wise and noble person.She is one who
for her distinguished esteem of me from a long and worthy friendship, I
must ever honor and celebrate.I wish from my soul the Lord, her husband
(whose parts and abilities are otherwise conspicuous), was as worthy of
her, as by a fatal apostasy and court-ambition he has made himself
unworthy!This is what she deplores, and it renders her as much
affliction as a lady of great soul and much prudence is capable of.The
Countess of Bristol, her mother, a grave and honorable lady, has the
comfort of seeing her daughter and grandchildren under the same economy,
especially Mr.Charles Spencer, a youth of extraordinary hopes, very
learned for his age, and ingenious, and under a governor of great worth.Happy were it, could as much be said of the elder brother, the Lord
Spencer, who, rambling about the world, dishonors both his name and his
family, adding sorrow to sorrow to a mother, who has taken all
imaginable care of his education.There is a daughter very young married
to the Earl of Clancarty, who has a great and fair estate in Ireland,
but who yet gives no great presage of worth,--so universally
contaminated is the youth of this corrupt and abandoned age!But this is
again recompensed by my Lord Arran, a sober and worthy gentleman, who
has espoused the Lady Ann Spencer, a young lady of admirable
accomplishments and virtue.I left this noble place and conversation, my lady
having provided carriages to convey us back in the same manner as we
went, and a dinner being prepared at Dunstable against our arrival.Northampton, having been lately burned and re-edified, is now become a
town that for the beauty of the buildings, especially the church and
townhouse, may compare with the neatest in Italy itself.Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, wrote a very honest and handsome letter
to the Commissioners Ecclesiastical, excusing himself from sitting any
longer among them, he by no means approving of their prosecuting the
Clergy who refused to read the Declaration for liberty of conscience, in
prejudice of the Church of England.The Dutch make extraordinary preparations both at sea and land, which
with no small progress Popery makes among us, puts us to many
difficulties.The Popish Irish soldiers commit many murders and insults;
the whole nation disaffected, and in apprehensions.After long trials of the doctors to bring up the little Prince of Wales
by hand (so many of her Majesty's children having died infants) not
succeeding, a country nurse, the wife of a tile maker, is taken to give
it suck.I went to London, where I found the Court in the
utmost consternation on report of the Prince of Orange's landing; which
put Whitehall into so panic a fear, that I could hardly believe it
possible to find such a change.Writs were issued in order to a Parliament, and a declaration to back
the good order of elections, with great professions of maintaining the
Church of England, but without giving any sort of satisfaction to the
people, who showed their high discontent at several things in the
Government.Earthquakes had utterly demolished the ancient Smyrna, and several other
places in Greece, Italy, and even in the Spanish Indies, forerunners of
greater calamities.God Almighty preserve his Church and all who put
themselves under the shadow of his wings, till these things be
overpassed.The Court in so extraordinary a consternation, on
assurance of the Prince of Orange's intention to land, that the writs
sent forth for a Parliament were recalled.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th October, 1688.16, showing the Scriptures to be our only rule of faith, and its
perfection above all traditions.After which, near 1,000 devout persons
partook of the Communion.The sermon was chiefly occasioned by a Jesuit,
who in the Masshouse on the Sunday before had disparaged the Scripture
and railed at our translation, which some present contradicting, they
pulled him out of the pulpit, and treated him very coarsely, insomuch
that it was like to create a great disturbance in the city.Hourly expectation of the Prince of Orange's invasion heightened to that
degree, that his Majesty thought fit to abrogate the Commission for the
dispensing Power (but retaining his own right still to dispense with all
laws) and restore the ejected Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford.In
the meantime, he called over 5,000 Irish, and 4,000 Scots, and continued
to remove Protestants and put in <DW7>s at Portsmouth and other places
of trust, and retained the Jesuits about him, increasing the universal
discontent.It brought people to so desperate a pass, that they seemed
passionately to long for and desire the landing of that Prince, whom
they looked on to be their deliverer from Popish tyranny, praying
incessantly for an east wind, which was said to be the only hindrance of
his expedition with a numerous army ready to make a descent.To such a
strange temper, and unheard of in former times, was this poor nation
reduced, and of which I was an eyewitness.The apprehension was (and
with reason) that his Majesty's forces would neither at land nor sea
oppose them with that vigor requisite to repel invaders.The late imprisoned Bishops were now called to reconcile matters, and
the Jesuits hard at work to foment confusion among the Protestants by
their usual tricks.A letter was sent to the Archbishop of
Canterbury,[71] informing him, from good hands, of what was contriving
by them.A paper of what the Bishops advised his Majesty was published.The Bishops were enjoined to prepare a form of prayer against the feared
invasion.The letter was as follows:--

    "My Lord, The honor and reputation which your Grace's piety,
    prudence, and signal courage, have justly merited and obtained, not
    only from the sons of the Church of England, but even universally
    from those Protestants among us who are Dissenters from her
    discipline; God Almighty's Providence and blessing upon your Grace's
    vigilancy and extraordinary endeavors will not suffer to be
    diminished in this conjuncture.The conversation I now and then have
    with some in place who have the opportunity of knowing what is doing
    in the most secret recesses and cabals of our Church's adversaries,
    obliges me to acquaint you, that the calling of your Grace and the
    rest of the Lords Bishops to Court, and what has there of late been
    required of you, is only to create a jealousy and suspicion among
    well-meaning people of such compliances, as it is certain they have
    no cause to apprehend.The plan of this and of all that which is to
    follow of seeming favor thence, is wholly drawn by the Jesuits, who
    are at this time more than ever busy to make divisions among us, all
    other arts and mechanisms having hitherto failed them.They have,
    with other things contrived that your Lordships the Bishops should
    give his Majesty advice separately, without calling any of the rest
    of the Peers, which, though maliciously suggested, spreads generally
    about the town.I do not at all question but your Grace will
    speedily prevent the operation of this venom, and that you will
    think it highly necessary so to do, that your Grace is also enjoined
    to compose a form of prayer, wherein the Prince of Orange is
    expressly to be named the Invader: of this I presume not to say
    anything; but for as much as in all the Declarations, etc., which
    have hitherto been published in pretended favor of the Church of
    England, there is not once the least mention of the REFORMED or
    PROTESTANT RELIGION, but only of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND AS BY LAW
    ESTABLISHED, which Church the <DW7>s tell us is the CHURCH OF ROME,
    which is (say they) the Catholic Church of England--that only is
    established by Law; the Church of England in the REFORMED sense so
    established, is but by an usurped authority.The antiquity of THAT
    would by these words be explained, and utterly defeat this false and
    subdolous construction, and take off all exceptions whatsoever; if,
    in all extraordinary offices, upon these occasions, the words
    REFORMED and PROTESTANT were added to that of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND
    BY LAW ESTABLISHED.And whosoever threatens to invade or come
    against us, to the prejudice of that Church, in God's name, be they
    Dutch or Irish, let us heartily pray and fight against them.My
    Lord, this is, I confess, a bold, but honest period; and, though I
    am well assured that your Grace is perfectly acquainted with all
    this before, and therefore may blame my impertinence, as that does
    [Greek: allotrioepiskopein]; yet I am confident you will not reprove
    the zeal of one who most humbly begs your Grace's pardon, with your
    blessing.(From a copy in Evelyn's
    handwriting.)This day signal for the victory
of William the Conqueror against Harold, near Battel, in Sussex.The
wind, which had been hitherto west, was east all this day.Wonderful
expectation of the Dutch fleet.Public prayers ordered to be read in the
churches against invasion.A tumult in London on the rabble demolishing a
Popish chapel that had been set up in the city.Lady Sunderland acquainted me with his Majesty's
taking away the Seals from Lord Sunderland, and of her being with the
Queen to intercede for him.It is conceived that he had of late grown
remiss in pursuing the interest of the Jesuitical counsels; some
reported one thing, some another; but there was doubtless some secret
betrayed, which time may discover.There was a Council called, to which were summoned the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Judges, the Lord Mayor, etc.The Queen Dowager, and all
the ladies and lords who were present at the Queen Consort's labor, were
to give their testimony upon oath of the Prince of Wales's birth,
recorded both at the Council Board and at the Chancery a day or two
after.This procedure was censured by some as below his Majesty to
condescend to, on the talk of the people.It was remarkable that on this
occasion the Archbishop, Marquis of Halifax, the Earls of Clarendon and
Nottingham, refused to sit at the Council table among <DW7>s, and their
bold telling his Majesty that whatever was done while such sat among
them was unlawful and incurred _praemunire_;--at least, if what I heard
be true.I dined with Lord Preston, made Secretary of State,
in the place of the Earl of Sunderland.Boyle, when came in the Duke of Hamilton and Earl of
Burlington.The Duke told us many particulars of Mary Queen of Scots,
and her amours with the Italian favorite, etc.My birthday, being the 68th year of my age.O
blessed Lord, grant that as I grow in years, so may I improve in grace!Be thou my protector this following year, and preserve me and mine from
those dangers and great confusions that threaten a sad revolution to
this sinful nation!Defend thy church, our holy religion, and just laws,
disposing his Majesty to listen to sober and healing counsels, that if
it be thy blessed will, we may still enjoy that happy tranquility which
hitherto thou hast continued to us!Dined with Lord Preston, with other company, at Sir
Stephen Fox's.Continual alarms of the Prince of Orange, but no
certainty.Reports of his great losses of horse in the storm, but
without any assurance.A man was taken with divers papers and printed
manifestoes, and carried to Newgate, after examination at the Cabinet
Council.There was likewise a declaration of the States for satisfaction
of all public ministers at The Hague, except to the English and the
French.There was in that of the Prince's an expression, as if the Lords
both spiritual and temporal had invited him over, with a deduction of
the causes of his enterprise.This made his Majesty convene my Lord of
Canterbury and the other Bishops now in town, to give an account of what
was in the manifesto, and to enjoin them to clear themselves by some
public writing of this disloyal charge.It was now certainly reported by some who saw the
fleet, and the Prince embark, that they sailed from the Brill on
Wednesday morning, and that the Princess of Orange was there to take
leave of her husband.Fresh reports of the Prince being landed somewhere
about Portsmouth, or the Isle of Wight, whereas it was thought it would
have been northward.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1688.I went to London; heard the news of the Prince
having landed at Torbay, coming with a fleet of near 700 sail, passing
through the Channel with so favorable a wind, that our navy could not
intercept, or molest them.This put the King and Court into great
consternation, they were now employed in forming an army to stop their
further progress, for they were got into Exeter, and the season and ways
very improper for his Majesty's forces to march so great a distance.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some few of the other Bishops and
Lords in London, were sent for to Whitehall, and required to set forth
their abhorrence of this invasion.They assured his Majesty that they
had never invited any of the Prince's party, or were in the least privy
to it, and would be ready to show all testimony of their loyalty; but,
as to a public declaration, being so few, they desired that his Majesty
would call the rest of their brethren and Peers, that they might consult
what was fit to be done on this occasion, not thinking it right to
publish anything without them, and till they had themselves seen the
Prince's manifesto, in which it was pretended he was invited in by the
Lords, spiritual and temporal.This did not please the King; so they
departed.A declaration was published, prohibiting all persons to see or read the
Prince's manifesto, in which was set forth at large the cause of his
expedition, as there had been one before from the States.These are the beginnings of sorrow, unless God in his mercy prevent it
by some happy reconciliation of all dissensions among us.This, in all
likelihood, nothing can effect except a free Parliament; but this we
cannot hope to see, while there are any forces on either side.I pray
God to protect and direct the King for the best and truest interest of
his people!--I saw his Majesty touch for the evil, Piten the Jesuit, and
Warner officiating.Lord Cornbury carries some regiments, and marches to
Honiton, the Prince's headquarters.The city of London in disorder; the
rabble pulled down the nunnery newly bought by the <DW7>s of Lord
Berkeley, at St.The Queen prepares to go to Portsmouth for
safety, to attend the issue of this commotion, which has a dreadful
aspect.The King goes to
Salisbury to rendezvous the army, and return to London.Lord Delamere
appears for the Prince in Cheshire.The
Archbishop of Canterbury and some Bishops, and such Peers as were in
London, address his Majesty to call a Parliament.The King invites all
foreign nations to come over.The French take all the Palatinate, and
alarm the Germans more than ever.We adjourned the
election of a President to 23d of April, by reason of the public
commotions, yet dined together as of custom this day.Afterward, visited my Lord Godolphin, then going with the Marquis of
Halifax and Earl of Nottingham as Commissioners to the Prince of Orange;
he told me they had little power.Bath, York, Hull, Bristol, and all the eminent nobility and persons of
quality through England, declare for the Protestant religion and laws,
and go to meet the Prince, who every day sets forth new Declarations
against the <DW7>s.The great favorites at Court, Priests and Jesuits,
fly or abscond.Everything, till now concealed, flies abroad in public
print, and is cried about the streets.Expectation of the Prince coming
to Oxford.The Prince of Wales and great treasure sent privily to
Portsmouth, the Earl of Dover being Governor.Address from the Fleet not
grateful to his Majesty.The <DW7>s in offices lay down their
commissions, and fly.Universal consternation among them; it looks like
a revolution.The rabble
demolished all Popish chapels, and several <DW7> lords and gentlemen's
houses, especially that of the Spanish Ambassador, which they pillaged,
and burned his library.The King flies to sea, puts in at Faversham for
ballast; is rudely treated by the people; comes back to Whitehall.The Prince of Orange is advanced to Windsor, is invited by the King to
St.James's, the messenger sent was the Earl of Faversham, the General
of the Forces, who going without trumpet, or passport, is detained
prisoner by the Prince, who accepts the invitation, but requires his
Majesty to retire to some distant place, that his own guards may be
quartered about the palace and city.This is taken heinously and the
King goes privately to Rochester; is persuaded to come back; comes on
the Sunday; goes to mass, and dines in public, a Jesuit saying grace (I
was present).That night was a Council; his Majesty refuses to
assent to all the proposals; goes away again to Rochester.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th December, 1688.I saw the King take barge to Gravesend at twelve
o'clock--a sad sight!James's, and fills
Whitehall with Dutch guards.A Council of Peers meet about an expedient
to call a Parliament; adjourn to the House of Lords.The Chancellor,
Earl of Peterborough, and divers others taken.The Earl of Sunderland
flies; Sir Edward Hale, Walker, and others, taken and secured.All the world go to see the Prince at St.James's, where there is a
great Court.There I saw him, and several of my acquaintance who came
over with him.He is very stately, serious and reserved.The English
soldiers sent out of town to disband them; not well pleased.The King passes into France, whither the Queen and
child were gone a few days before.The Peers and such Commoners as were members of the
Parliament at Oxford, being the last of Charles II.meeting, desire the
Prince of Orange to take on him the disposal of the public revenue till
a convention of Lords and Commons should meet in full body, appointed by
his circular letters to the shires and boroughs, 22d of January.I had
now quartered upon me a Lieutenant-Colonel and eight horses.This day prayers for the Prince of Wales were first
left off in our Church.A long frost and deep snow; the Thames almost
frozen over.I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, where I
found the Bishops of St.Asaph, Ely, Bath and Wells, Peterborough, and
Chichester, the Earls of Aylesbury and Clarendon, Sir George Mackenzie,
Lord-Advocate of Scotland, and then came in a Scotch Archbishop, etc.After prayers and dinner, divers serious matters were discoursed,
concerning the present state of the Public, and sorry I was to find
there was as yet no accord in the judgments of those of the Lords and
Commons who were to convene; some would have the Princess made Queen
without any more dispute, others were for a Regency; there was a Tory
party (then so called), who were for inviting his Majesty again upon
conditions; and there were Republicans who would make the Prince of
Orange like a Stadtholder.The Romanists were busy among these several
parties to bring them into confusion: most for ambition or other
interest, few for conscience and moderate resolutions.I found nothing
of all this in this assembly of Bishops, who were pleased to admit me
into their discourses; they were all for a Regency, thereby to salve
their oaths, and so all public matters to proceed in his Majesty's name,
by that to facilitate the calling of Parliament, according to the laws
in being.My Lord of Canterbury gave me great thanks for the advertisement I sent
him in October, and assured me they took my counsel in that particular,
and that it came very seasonably.I found by the Lord-Advocate that the Bishops of Scotland (who were
indeed little worthy of that character, and had done much mischief in
that Church) were now coming about to the true interest, in this
conjuncture which threatened to abolish the whole hierarchy in that
kingdom; and therefore the Scottish Archbishop and Lord-Advocate
requested the Archbishop of Canterbury to use his best endeavors with
the Prince to maintain the Church there in the same state, as by law at
present settled.It now growing late, after some private discourse with his Grace, I took
my leave, most of the Lords being gone.The great convention being assembled the day before, falling upon the
question about the government, resolved that King James having by the
advice of the Jesuits and other wicked persons endeavored to subvert the
laws of the Church and State, and deserted the kingdom, carrying away
the seals, etc., without any care for the management of the government,
had by demise abdicated himself and wholly vacated his right; they did
therefore desire the Lords' concurrence to their vote, to place the
crown on the next heir, the Prince of Orange, for his life, then to the
Princess, his wife, and if she died without issue, to the Princess of
Denmark, and she failing, to the heirs of the Prince, excluding forever
all possibility of admitting a Roman Catholic.[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th January, 1689.I dined at the Admiralty, where was brought in a
child not twelve years old, the son of one Dr.Clench, of the most
prodigious maturity of knowledge, for I cannot call it altogether
memory, but something more extraordinary.Pepys and myself examined
him, not in any method, but with promiscuous questions, which required
judgment and discernment to answer so readily and pertinently.There was
not anything in chronology, history, geography, the several systems of
astronomy, courses of the stars, longitude, latitude, doctrine of the
spheres, courses and sources of rivers, creeks, harbors, eminent cities,
boundaries and bearings of countries, not only in Europe, but in any
other part of the earth, which he did not readily resolve and
demonstrate his knowledge of, readily drawing out with a pen anything he
would describe.He was able not only to repeat the most famous things
which are left us in any of the Greek or Roman histories, monarchies,
republics, wars, colonies, exploits by sea and land, but all the sacred
stories of the Old and New Testament; the succession of all the
monarchies, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Roman, with all the lower
Emperors, Popes, Heresiarchs, and Councils, what they were called about,
what they determined, or in the controversy about Easter, the tenets of
the Gnostics, Sabellians, Arians, Nestorians; the difference between St.Cyprian and Stephen about re-baptism, the schisms.We leaped from that
to other things totally different, to Olympic years, and synchronisms;
we asked him questions which could not be resolved without considerable
meditation and judgment, nay of some particulars of the Civil Laws, of
the Digest and Code.He gave a stupendous account of both natural and
moral philosophy, and even in metaphysics.Having thus exhausted ourselves rather than this wonderful child, or
angel rather, for he was as beautiful and lovely in countenance as in
knowledge, we concluded with asking him if, in all he had read or heard
of, he had ever met with anything which was like this expedition of the
Prince of Orange, with so small a force to obtain three great kingdoms
without any contest.After a little thought, he told us that he knew of
nothing which did more resemble it than the coming of Constantine the
Great out of Britain, through France and Italy, so tedious a march, to
meet Maxentius, whom he overthrew at Pons Milvius with very little
conflict, and at the very gates of Rome, which he entered and was
received with triumph, and obtained the empire, not of three kingdoms
only, but of all the then known world.He was perfect in the Latin
authors, spoke French naturally, and gave us a description of France,
Italy, Savoy, Spain, ancient and modernly divided; as also of ancient
Greece, Scythia, and northern countries and tracts: we left questioning
further.He did this without any set or formal repetitions, as one who
had learned things without book, but as if he minded other things, going
about the room, and toying with a parrot there, and as he was at dinner
(_tanquam aliua agens_, as it were) seeming to be full of play, of a
lively, sprightly temper, always smiling, and exceedingly pleasant,
without the least levity, rudeness, or childishness.His father assured us he never imposed anything to charge his memory by
causing him to get things by heart, not even the rules of grammar; but
his tutor (who was a Frenchman) read to him, first in French, then in
Latin; that he usually played among other boys four or five hours every
day, and that he was as earnest at his play as at his study.He was
perfect in arithmetic, and now newly entered into Greek.In sum
(_horresco referens_), I had read of divers forward and precocious
youths, and some I have known, but I never did either hear or read of
anything like to this sweet child, if it be right to call him child who
has more knowledge than most men in the world.I counseled his father
not to set his heart too much on this jewel,

    "_Immodicis brevis est aetas, et rara senectus,_"

as I myself learned by sad experience in my most dear child Richard,
many years since, who, dying before he was six years old, was both in
shape and countenance and pregnancy of learning, next to a prodigy.The votes of the House of Commons being carried up
by Mr.Hampden, their chairman, to the Lords, I got a station by the
Prince's lodgings at the door of the lobby to the House, and heard much
of the debate, which lasted very long.Lord Derby was in the chair (for
the House was resolved into a grand committee of the whole House); after
all had spoken, it came to the question, which was carried by three
voices against a Regency, which 51 were for, 54 against; the minority
alleging the danger of dethroning Kings, and scrupling many passages and
expressions in the vote of the Commons, too long to set down
particularly.Some were for sending to his Majesty with conditions:
others that the King could do no wrong, and that the maladministration
was chargeable on his ministers.There were not more than eight or nine
bishops, and but two against the Regency; the archbishop was absent, and
the clergy now began to change their note, both in pulpit and discourse,
on their old passive obedience, so as people began to talk of the
bishops being cast out of the House.In short, things tended to
dissatisfaction on both sides; add to this, the morose temper of the
Prince of Orange, who showed little countenance to the noblemen and
others, who expected a more gracious and cheerful reception when they
made their court.The English army also was not so in order, and firm to
his interest, nor so weakened but that it might give interruption.Ireland was in an ill posture as well as Scotland.Nothing was yet done
toward a settlement.God of his infinite mercy compose these things,
that we may be at last a Nation and a Church under some fixed and sober
establishment!'s MARTYRDOM; but
in all the public offices and pulpit prayers, the collects, and litany
for the King and Queen were curtailed and mutilated.Sharp preached
before the Commons, but was disliked, and not thanked for his sermon.At our church (the next day being appointed a
thanksgiving for deliverance by the Prince of Orange, with prayers
purposely composed), our lecturer preached in the afternoon a very
honest sermon, showing our duty to God for the many signal deliverances
of our Church, without touching on politics.The King's coronation day was ordered not to be
observed, as hitherto it had been.The Convention of the Lords and Commons now declare the Prince and
Princess of Orange King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland
(Scotland being an independent kingdom), the Prince and Princess being
to enjoy it jointly during their lives; but the executive authority to
be vested in the Prince during life, though all proceedings to run in
both names, and that it should descend to their issue, and for want of
such, to the Princess Anne of Denmark and her issue, and in want of
such, to the heirs of the body of the Prince, if he survive, and that
failing, to devolve to the Parliament, as they should think fit.These
produced a conference with the Lords, when also there was presented
heads of such new laws as were to be enacted.It is thought on these
conditions they will be proclaimed.There was much contest about the King's abdication, and whether he had
vacated the government.The Earl of Nottingham and about twenty Lords,
and many Bishops, entered their protests, but the concurrence was great
against them.Forces sending to Ireland, that kingdom
being in great danger by the Earl of Tyrconnel's army, and expectations
from France coming to assist them, but that King was busy in invading
Flanders, and encountering the German Princes.It is likely that this
will be the most remarkable summer for action, which has happened in
many years.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st February, 1689.James's on the
obligation to walk worthy of God's particular and signal deliverance of
the nation and church.I saw the NEW QUEEN and KING proclaimed the very next day after her
coming to Whitehall, Wednesday, 13th February, with great acclamation
and general good reception.It was believed
that both, especially the Princess, would have shown some (seeming)
reluctance at least, of assuming her father's crown, and made some
apology, testifying by her regret that he should by his mismanagement
necessitate the nation to so extraordinary a proceeding, which would
have shown very handsomely to the world, and according to the character
given of her piety; consonant also to her husband's first declaration,
that there was no intention of deposing the King, but of succoring the
nation; but nothing of all this appeared; she came into Whitehall
laughing and jolly, as to a wedding, so as to seem quite transported.She rose early the next morning, and in her undress, as it was reported,
before her women were up, went about from room to room to see the
convenience of Whitehall; lay in the same bed and apartment where the
late Queen lay, and within a night or two sat down to play at basset, as
the Queen, her predecessor used to do.She smiled upon and talked to
everybody, so that no change seemed to have taken place at Court since
her last going away, save that infinite crowds of people thronged to see
her, and that she went to our prayers.She seems to be of a good nature, and that she takes nothing to
heart: while the Prince, her husband, has a thoughtful countenance, is
wonderfully serious and silent, and seems to treat all persons alike
gravely, and to be very intent on affairs: Holland, Ireland, and France
calling for his care.Divers Bishops and Noblemen are not at all satisfied with this so sudden
assumption of the Crown, without any previous sending, and offering some
conditions to the absent King; or on his not returning, or not assenting
to those conditions, to have proclaimed him Regent; but the major part
of both Houses prevailed to make them King and Queen immediately, and a
crown was tempting.This was opposed and spoken against with such
vehemence by Lord Clarendon (her own uncle), that it put him by all
preferment, which must doubtless have been as great as could have been
given him.My Lord of Rochester, his brother, overshot himself, by the
same carriage and stiffness, which their friends thought they might have
well spared when they saw how it was like to be overruled, and that it
had been sufficient to have declared their dissent with less passion,
acquiescing in due time.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some of the rest, on scruple of
conscience and to salve the oaths they had taken, entered their protests
and hung off, especially the Archbishop, who had not all this while so
much as appeared out of Lambeth.This occasioned the wonder of many who
observed with what zeal they contributed to the Prince's expedition, and
all the while also rejecting any proposals of sending again to the
absent King; that they should now raise scruples, and such as created
much division among the people, greatly rejoicing the old courtiers, and
especially the <DW7>s.Another objection was, the invalidity of what was done by a convention
only, and the as yet unabrogated laws; this drew them to make themselves
on the 22d [February] a Parliament, the new King passing the act with
the crown on his head.The lawyers disputed, but necessity prevailed,
the government requiring a speedy settlement.Innumerable were the crowds, who solicited for, and expected offices;
most of the old ones were turned out.Two or three white staves were
disposed of some days before, as Lord Steward, to the Earl of
Devonshire; Treasurer of the household, to Lord Newport; Lord
Chamberlain to the King, to my Lord of Dorset; but there were as yet
none in offices of the civil government save the Marquis of Halifax as
Privy Seal.A council of thirty was chosen, Lord Derby president, but
neither Chancellor nor Judges were yet declared, the new Great Seal not
yet finished.Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury, made an excellent
discourse on Matt.44, exhorting to charity and forgiveness of
enemies; I suppose purposely, the new Parliament being furious about
impeaching those who were obnoxious, and as their custom has ever been,
going on violently, without reserve, or modification, while wise men
were of opinion the most notorious offenders being named and excepted,
an Act of Amnesty would be more seasonable, to pacify the minds of men
in so general a discontent of the nation, especially of those who did
not expect to see the government assumed without any regard to the
absent King, or proving a spontaneous abdication, or that the birth of
the Prince of Wales was an imposture; five of the Bishops also still
refusing to take the new oath.In the meantime, to gratify the people, the hearth-tax was remitted
forever; but what was intended to supply it, besides present great taxes
on land, is not named.The King abroad was now furnished by the French King with money and
officers for an expedition to Ireland.The great neglect in not more
timely preventing that from hence, and the disturbances in Scotland,
give apprehensions of great difficulties, before any settlement can be
perfected here, while the Parliament dispose of the great offices among
themselves.The Great Seal, Treasury and Admiralty put into commission
of many unexpected persons, to gratify the more; so that by the present
appearance of things (unless God Almighty graciously interpose and give
success in Ireland and settle Scotland) more trouble seems to threaten
the nation than could be expected.In the interim, the new King refers
all to the Parliament in the most popular manner, but is very slow in
providing against all these menaces, besides finding difficulties in
raising men to send abroad; the former army, which had never seen any
service hitherto, receiving their pay and passing their summer in an
idle scene of a camp at Hounslow, unwilling to engage, and many
disaffected, and scarce to be trusted.[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th March, 1689.The new King much blamed for neglecting Ireland, now
likely to be ruined by the Lord Tyrconnel and his Popish party, too
strong for the Protestants.Wonderful uncertainty where King James was,
whether in France or Ireland.The Scots seem as yet to favor King
William, rejecting King James's letter to them, yet declaring nothing
positively.Parliament preparing the
coronation oath.Presbyterians and Dissenters displeased at the vote for
preserving the Protestant religion as established by law, without
mentioning what they were to have as to indulgence.The Archbishop of Canterbury and four other Bishops refusing to come to
Parliament, it was deliberated whether they should incur _Praemunire_;
but it was thought fit to let this fall, and be connived at, for fear of
the people, to whom these Prelates were very dear, for the opposition
they had given to Popery.Things far from settled as was expected, by reason of
the slothful, sickly temper of the new King, and the Parliament's
unmindfulness of Ireland, which is likely to prove a sad omission.The Confederates beat the French out of the Palatinate, which they had
most barbarously ruined.I saw the procession to and from the Abbey Church of
Westminster, with the great feast in Westminster Hall, at the coronation
of King William and Queen Mary.What was different from former
coronations, was some alteration in the coronation oath.Burnet, now
made Bishop of Sarum, preached with great applause.The Parliament men
had scaffolds and places which took up the one whole side of the Hall.When the King and Queen had dined, the ceremony of the Champion, and
other services by tenure were performed.The Parliament men were feasted
in the Exchequer chamber, and had each of them a gold medal given them,
worth five-and-forty shillings.On the one side were the effigies of the
King and Queen inclining one to the other; on the reverse was Jupiter
throwing a bolt at Phaeton the words, "_Ne totus absumatur_": which was
but dull, seeing they might have had out of the poet something as
apposite.Much of the splendor of the proceeding was abated by the absence of
divers who should have contributed to it, there being but five Bishops,
four Judges (no more being yet sworn), and several noblemen and great
ladies wanting; the feast, however, was magnificent.The next day the
House of Commons went and kissed their new Majesties' hands in the
Banqueting House.Asaph to visit my Lord
of Canterbury at Lambeth, who had excused himself from officiating at
the coronation, which was performed by the Bishop of London, assisted by
the Archbishop of York.We had much private and free discourse with his
Grace concerning several things relating to the Church, there being now
a bill of comprehension to be brought from the Lords to the Commons.I
urged that when they went about to reform some particulars in the
Liturgy, Church discipline, Canons, etc., the baptizing in private
houses without necessity might be reformed, as likewise so frequent
burials in churches; the one proceeding much from the pride of women,
bringing that into custom which was only indulged in case of imminent
danger, and out of necessity during the rebellion, and persecution of
the clergy in our late civil wars; the other from the avarice of
ministers, who, in some opulent parishes, made almost as much of
permission to bury in the chancel and the church, as of their livings,
and were paid with considerable advantage and gifts for baptizing in
chambers.To this they heartily assented, and promised their endeavor to
get it reformed, utterly disliking both practices as novel and indecent.We discoursed likewise of the great disturbance and prejudice it might
cause, should the new oath, now on the anvil, be imposed on any, save
such as were in new office, without any retrospect to such as either had
no office, or had been long in office, who it was likely would have some
scruples about taking a new oath, having already sworn fidelity to the
government as established by law.This we all knew to be the case of my
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, and some other persons who were not so
fully satisfied with the Convention making it an abdication of King
James, to whom they had sworn allegiance.King James was now certainly in Ireland with the Marshal d'Estrades,
whom he made a Privy Councillor; and who caused the King to remove the
Protestant Councillors, some whereof, it seems, had continued to sit,
telling him that the King of France, his master, would never assist him
if he did not immediately do it; by which it is apparent how the poor
Prince is managed by the French.Scotland declares for King William and Queen Mary, with the reasons of
their setting aside King James, not as abdicating, but forfeiting his
right by maladministration; they proceeded with much more caution and
prudence than we did, who precipitated all things to the great reproach
of the nation, all which had been managed by some crafty, ill-principled
men.The new Privy Council have a Republican spirit, manifestly
undermining all future succession of the Crown and prosperity of the
Church of England, which yet I hope they will not be able to accomplish
so soon as they expect, though they get into all places of trust and
profit.This was one of the most seasonable springs, free from
the usual sharp east winds that I have observed since the year 1660 (the
year of the Restoration), which was much such an one.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th April, 1689.I heard the lawyers plead before the Lords the writ
of error in the judgment of Oates, as to the charge against him of
perjury, which after debate they referred to the answer of Holloway,
etc., who were his judges.Asaph to
the Archbishop at Lambeth, where they entered into discourse concerning
the final destruction of Antichrist, both concluding that the third
trumpet and vial were now pouring out.Asaph considered the
killing of the two witnesses, to be the utter destruction of the
Cevennes Protestants by the French and Duke of Savoy, and the other the
Waldenses and Pyrenean Christians, who by all appearance from good
history had kept the primitive faith from the very Apostles' time till
now.The doubt his Grace suggested was, whether it could be made evident
that the present persecution had made so great a havoc of those faithful
people as of the other, and whether there were not yet some among them
in being who met together, it being stated from the text, Apoc.xi.,
that they should both be slain together.Mede's way of interpretation, and that he only failed in resolving too
hastily on the King of Sweden's (Gustavus Adolphus) success in Germany.They agreed that it would be good to employ some intelligent French
minister to travel as far as the Pyrenees to understand the present
state of the Church there, it being a country where hardly anyone
travels.There now came certain news that King James had not only landed in
Ireland, but that he had surprised Londonderry, and was become master of
that kingdom, to the great shame of our government, who had been so
often solicited to provide against it by timely succor, and which they
might so easily have done.This is a terrible beginning of more
troubles, especially should an army come thence into Scotland, people
being generally disaffected here and everywhere else, so that the seamen
and landmen would scarce serve without compulsion.A new oath was now fabricating for all the clergy to take, of obedience
to the present Government, in abrogation of the former oaths of
allegiance, which it is foreseen many of the bishops and others of the
clergy will not take.The penalty is to be the loss of their dignity and
spiritual preferment.This is thought to have been driven on by the
Presbyterians, our new governors.God in mercy send us help, and direct
the counsels to his glory and good of his Church!Public matters went very ill in Ireland: confusion and dissensions among
ourselves, stupidity, inconstancy, emulation, the governors employing
unskillful men in greatest offices, no person of public spirit and
ability appearing,--threaten us with a very sad prospect of what may be
the conclusion, without God's infinite mercy.A fight by Admiral Herbert with the French, he imprudently setting on
them in a creek as they were landing men in Ireland, by which we came
off with great slaughter and little honor--so strangely negligent and
remiss were we in preparing a timely and sufficient fleet.The Scots
Commissioners offer the crown to the NEW KING AND QUEEN on
conditions.--Act of Poll-money came forth, sparing none.--Now appeared
the Act of Indulgence for the Dissenters, but not exempting them from
paying dues to the Church of England clergy, or serving in office
according to law, with several other clauses.--A most splendid embassy
from Holland to congratulate the King and Queen on their accession to
the crown.A solemn fast for success of the fleet, etc.I dined with the Bishop of Asaph; Monsieur Capellus, the
learned son of the most learned Ludovicus, presented to him his father's
works, not published till now.I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, and stayed with
him till about seven o'clock.He read to me the Pope's excommunication
of the French King.Burnet, now Bishop of Sarum; got him to let
Mr.King James's declaration was now dispersed, offering
pardon to all, if on his landing, or within twenty days after, they
should return to their obedience.Our fleet not yet at sea, through some prodigious sloth, and men minding
only their present interest; the French riding masters at sea, taking
many great prizes to our wonderful reproach.No certain news from
Ireland; various reports of Scotland; discontents at home.The King of
Denmark at last joins with the Confederates, and the two Northern Powers
are reconciled.The East India Company likely to be dissolved by
Parliament for many arbitrary actions.Oates acquitted of perjury, to
all honest men's admiration.News of A PLOT discovered, on which divers were sent to
the Tower and secured.An extraordinary drought, to the threatening of great
wants as to the fruits of the earth.Pepys,
late Secretary to the Admiralty, holding my "Sylva" in my right hand.It
was on his long and earnest request, and is placed in his library.Kneller never painted in a more masterly manner.I dined at Lord Clarendon's, it being his lady's
wedding day, when about three in the afternoon there was an unusual and
violent storm of thunder, rain, and wind; many boats on the Thames were
overwhelmed, and such was the impetuosity of the wind as to carry up the
waves in pillars and spouts most dreadful to behold, rooting up trees
and ruining some houses.The Countess of Sunderland afterward told me
that it extended as far as Althorpe at the very time, which is seventy
miles from London.It did no harm at Deptford, but at Greenwich it did
much mischief.I went to Hampton Court about business, the Council
being there.A great apartment and spacious garden with fountains was
beginning in the park at the head of the canal.The Marshal de Schomberg went now as General toward
Ireland, to the relief of Londonderry.The
Confederates passing the Rhine, besiege Bonn and Mayence, to obtain a
passage into France.A great victory gotten by the Muscovites, taking
and burning Perecop.A new rebel against the Turks threatens the
destruction of that tyranny.All Europe in arms against France, and
hardly to be found in history so universal a face of war.The Convention (or Parliament as some called it) sitting, exempt the
Duke of Hanover from the succession to the crown, which they seem to
confine to the present new King, his wife, and Princess Anne of Denmark,
who is so monstrously swollen, that it is doubted whether her being
thought with child may prove a TYMPANY only, so that the unhappy family
of the Stuarts seems to be extinguishing; and then what government is
likely to be next set up is unknown, whether regal and by election, or
otherwise, the Republicans and Dissenters from the Church of England
evidently looking that way.The Scots have now again voted down Episcopacy there.Great discontents
through this nation at the slow proceedings of the King, and the
incompetent instruments and officers he advances to the greatest and
most necessary charges.Hitherto it has been a most seasonable summer.Londonderry relieved after a brave and wonderful holding out.I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury since
his suspension, and was received with great kindness.A dreadful fire
happened in Southwark.Came to visit us the Marquis de Ruvigne, and one
Monsieur le Coque, a French refugee, who left great riches for his
religion; a very learned, civil person; he married the sister of the
Duchess de la Force.Ottobone, a Venetian Cardinal, eighty years old,
made Pope.[72]

    [Footnote 72: Peter Otthobonus succeeded Innocent XI.as Pope in
    1689, by the title of Alexander VIII.]My birthday, being now sixty-nine years old.Blessed
Father, who hast prolonged my years to this great age, and given me to
see so great and wonderful revolutions, and preserved me amid them to
this moment, accept, I beseech thee, the continuance of my prayers and
thankful acknowledgments, and grant me grace to be working out my
salvation and redeeming the time, that thou mayst be glorified by me
here, and my immortal soul saved whenever thou shalt call for it, to
perpetuate thy praises to all eternity, in that heavenly kingdom where
there are no more changes or vicissitudes, but rest, and peace, and joy,
and consummate felicity, forever.Grant this, O heavenly Father, for the
sake of Jesus thine only Son and our Savior.Asaph, Lord Almoner, preached
before the King and Queen, the whole discourse being an historical
narrative of the Church of England's several deliverances, especially
that of this anniversary, signalized by being also the birthday of the
Prince of Orange, his marriage (which was on the 4th), and his landing
at Torbay this day.There was a splendid ball and other rejoicings.After a very wet season, the winter came on
severely.Much wet, without frost, yet the wind north and
easterly.A Convocation of the Clergy meet about a reformation of our
Liturgy, Canons, etc., obstructed by others of the clergy.[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th November, 1689.I went to London with my family, to winter at Soho,
in the great square.This night there was a most extraordinary storm
of wind, accompanied with snow and sharp weather; it did great harm in
many places, blowing down houses, trees, etc., killing many people.It
began about two in the morning, and lasted till five, being a kind of
hurricane, which mariners observe have begun of late years to come
northward.This winter has been hitherto extremely wet, warm, and windy.Ann's Church an exhortatory
letter to the clergy of London from the Bishop, together with a Brief
for relieving the distressed Protestants, and Vaudois, who fled from the
persecution of the French and Duke of Savoy, to the Protestant Cantons
of Switzerland.The Parliament was unexpectedly prorogued to 2d of April to the
discontent and surprise of many members who, being exceedingly averse to
the settling of anything, proceeding with animosities, multiplying
exceptions against those whom they pronounced obnoxious, and producing
as universal a discontent against King William and themselves, as there
was before against King James.The new King resolved on an expedition
into Ireland in person.About 150 of the members who were of the more
royal party, meeting at a feast at the Apollo Tavern near St.Dunstan's,
sent some of their company to the King, to assure him of their service;
he returned his thanks, advising them to repair to their several
counties and preserve the peace during his absence, and assuring them
that he would be steady to his resolution of defending the Laws and
Religion established.The great Lord suspected to have counselled this
prorogation, universally denied it.However, it was believed the chief
adviser was the Marquis of Carmarthen, who now seemed to be most in
favor.The Parliament was dissolved by proclamation, and
another called to meet the 20th of March.This was a second surprise to
the former members; and now the Court party, or, as they call
themselves, Church of England, are making their interests in the
country.The Marquis of Halifax lays down his office of Privy Seal, and
pretends to retire.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th February, 1690.The Duchess of Monmouth's chaplain preached at St.Martin's an excellent discourse exhorting to peace and sanctity, it
being now the time of very great division and dissension in the nation;
first, among the Churchmen, of whom the moderate and sober part were for
a speedy reformation of divers things, which it was thought might be
made in our Liturgy, for the inviting of Dissenters; others more stiff
and rigid, were for no condescension at all.Books and pamphlets were
published every day pro and con; the Convocation were forced for the
present to suspend any further progress.There was fierce and great
carousing about being elected in the new Parliament.The King persists
in his intention of going in person for Ireland, whither the French are
sending supplies to King James, and we, the Danish horse to Schomberg.I dined with the Marquis of Carmarthen (late Lord
Danby), where was Lieutenant-General Douglas, a very considerate and
sober commander, going for Ireland.He related to us the exceeding
neglect of the English soldiers, suffering severely for want of clothes
and necessaries this winter, exceedingly magnifying their courage and
bravery during all their hardships.There dined also Lord Lucas,
Lieutenant of the Tower, and the Bishop of St.The Privy Seal was
again put in commission, Mr.Cheny (who married my kinswoman, Mrs.Pierrepoint), Sir Thomas Knatchbull, and Sir P. W. Pultney.The
imprudence of both sexes was now become so great and universal, persons
of all ranks keeping their courtesans publicly, that the King had lately
directed a letter to the Bishops to order their clergy to preach against
that sin, swearing, etc., and to put the ecclesiastical laws in
execution without any indulgence.I went to Kensington, which King William had bought
of Lord Nottingham, and altered, but was yet a patched building, but
with the garden, however, it is a very sweet villa, having to it the
park and a straight new way through this park.Pepys, late Secretary to the
Admiralty, where was that excellent shipwright and seaman (for so he had
been, and also a Commission of the Navy), Sir Anthony Deane.Among other
discourse, and deploring the sad condition of our navy, as now governed
by inexperienced men since this Revolution, he mentioned what exceeding
advantage we of this nation had by being the first who built frigates,
the first of which ever built was that vessel which was afterward called
"The Constant Warwick," and was the work of Pett of Chatham, for a trial
of making a vessel that would sail swiftly; it was built with low decks,
the guns lying near the water, and was so light and swift of sailing,
that in a short time he told us she had, ere the Dutch war was ended,
taken as much money from privateers as would have laden her; and that
more such being built, did in a year or two scour the Channel from those
of Dunkirk and others which had exceedingly infested it.He added that
it would be the best and only infallible expedient to be masters of the
sea, and able to destroy the greatest navy of any enemy if, instead of
building huge great ships and second and third rates, they would leave
off building such high decks, which were for nothing but to gratify
gentlemen-commanders, who must have all their effeminate accommodations,
and for pomp; that it would be the ruin of our fleets, if such persons
were continued in command, they neither having experience nor being
capable of learning, because they would not submit to the fatigue and
inconvenience which those who were bred seamen would undergo, in those
so otherwise useful swift frigates.These being to encounter the
greatest ships would be able to protect, set on, and bring off, those
who should manage the fire ships, and the Prince who should first store
himself with numbers of such fire ships, would, through the help and
countenance of such frigates, be able to ruin the greatest force of such
vast ships as could be sent to sea, by the dexterity of working those
light, swift ships to guard the fire ships.He concluded there would
shortly be no other method of seafight; and that great ships and
men-of-war, however stored with guns and men, must submit to those who
should encounter them with far less number.He represented to us the
dreadful effect of these fire ships; that he continually observed in our
late maritime war with the Dutch that, when an enemy's fire ship
approached, the most valiant commander and common sailors were in such
consternation, that though then, of all times, there was most need of
the guns, bombs, etc., to keep the mischief off, they grew pale and
astonished, as if of a quite other mean soul, that they slunk about,
forsook their guns and work as if in despair, every one looking about to
see which way they might get out of their ship, though sure to be
drowned if they did so.This he said was likely to prove hereafter the
method of seafight, likely to be the misfortune of England if they
continued to put gentlemen-commanders over experienced seamen, on
account of their ignorance, effeminacy, and insolence.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th March, 1690.Burnet, late Bishop of Sarum,
on Heb.13, anatomically describing the texture of the eye; and
that, as it received such innumerable sorts of spies through so very
small a passage to the brain, and that without the least confusion or
trouble, and accordingly judged and reflected on them; so God who made
this sensory, did with the greatest ease and at once see all that was
done through the vast universe, even to the very thought as well as
action.This similitude he continued with much perspicuity and aptness;
and applied it accordingly, for the admonishing us how uprightly we
ought to live and behave ourselves before such an all-seeing Deity; and
how we were to conceive of other his attributes, which we could have no
idea of than by comparing them by what we were able to conceive of the
nature and power of things, which were the objects of our senses; and
therefore it was that in Scripture we attribute those actions and
affections of God by the same of man, not as adequately or in any
proportion like them, but as the only expedient to make some resemblance
of his divine perfections; as when the Scripture says, "God will
remember the sins of the penitent no more:" not as if God could forget
anything, but as intimating he would pass by such penitents and receive
them to mercy.Asaph's, Almoner to the new Queen, with
the famous lawyer Sir George Mackenzie (late Lord Advocate of Scotland),
against whom both the Bishop and myself had written and published books,
but now most friendly reconciled.[73] He related to us many particulars
of Scotland, the present sad condition of it, the inveterate hatred
which the Presbyterians show to the family of the Stuarts, and the
exceeding tyranny of those bigots who acknowledge no superior on earth,
in civil or divine matters, maintaining that the people only have the
right of government; their implacable hatred to the Episcopal Order and
Church of England.He observed that the first Presbyterian dissents from
our discipline were introduced by the Jesuits' order, about the 20 of
Queen Elizabeth, a famous Jesuit among them feigning himself a
Protestant, and who was the first who began to pray extempore, and
brought in that which they since called, and are still so fond of,
praying by the Spirit.This Jesuit remained many years before he was
discovered, afterward died in Scotland, where he was buried at...
having yet on his monument, "_Rosa inter spinas_."[Footnote 73: Sir George, as we have seen, had written in praise of
    a Private Life, which Mr.Evelyn answered by a book in praise of
    Public Life and Active Employment.]Charlton's curiosities, both
of art and nature, and his full and rare collection of medals, which
taken altogether, in all kinds, is doubtless one of the most perfect
assemblages of rarities that can be any where seen.I much admired the
contortions of the Thea root, which was so perplexed, large, and
intricate, and withal hard as box, that it was wonderful to consider.King William set forth on his Irish expedition, leaving
the Queen Regent.Pepys read to me his Remonstrance, showing with
what malice and injustice he was suspected with Sir Anthony Deane about
the timber, of which the thirty ships were built by a late Act of
Parliament, with the exceeding danger which the fleet would shortly be
in, by reason of the tyranny and incompetency of those who now managed
the Admiralty and affairs of the Navy, of which he gave an accurate
state, and showed his great ability.Asaph; his
conversation was on the Vaudois in Savoy, who had been thought so near
destruction and final extirpation by the French, being totally given up
to slaughter, so that there were no hopes for them; but now it pleased
God that the Duke of Savoy, who had hitherto joined with the French in
their persecution, being now pressed by them to deliver up Saluzzo and
Turin as cautionary towns, on suspicion that he might at last come into
the Confederacy of the German Princes, did secretly concert measures
with, and afterward declared for, them.He then invited these poor
people from their dispersion among the mountains whither they had fled,
and restored them to their country, their dwellings, and the exercise of
their religion, and begged pardon for the ill usage they had received,
charging it on the cruelty of the French who forced him to it.These
being the remainder of those persecuted Christians which the Bishop of
St.Asaph had so long affirmed to be the two witnesses spoken of in the
Revelation, who should be killed and brought to life again, it was
looked on as an extraordinary thing that this prophesying Bishop should
persuade two fugitive ministers of the Vaudois to return to their
country, and furnish them with L20 toward their journey, at that very
time when nothing but universal destruction was to be expected, assuring
them and showing them from the Apocalypse, that their countrymen should
be returned safely to their country before they arrived.This happening
contrary to all expectation and appearance, did exceedingly credit the
Bishop's confidence how that prophecy of the witnesses should come to
pass, just at the time, and the very month, he had spoken of some years
before.Boyle and Lady Ranelagh his sister, to
whom he explained the necessity of it so fully, and so learnedly made
out, with what events were immediately to follow, viz, the French King's
ruin, the calling of the Jews to be near at hand, but that the Kingdom
of Antichrist would not yet be utterly destroyed till thirty years, when
Christ should begin the Millenium, not as personally and visibly
reigning on earth, but that the true religion and universal peace should
obtain through all the world.Mede, and
other interpreters of these events failed, by mistaking and reckoning
the year as the Latins and others did, to consist of the present
calculation, so many days to the year, whereas the Apocalypse reckons
after the Persian account, as Daniel did, whose visions St.John all
along explains as meaning only the Christian Church.Pepys, who the next day was sent to the
Gatehouse,[74] and several great persons to the Tower, on suspicion of
being affected to King James; among them was the Earl of Clarendon, the
Queen's uncle.King William having vanquished King James in Ireland,
there was much public rejoicing.It seems the Irish in King James's army
would not stand, but the English-Irish and French made great resistance.Walker, who so bravely defended
Londonderry.King William received a slight wound by the grazing of a
cannon bullet on his shoulder, which he endured with very little
interruption of his pursuit.Hamilton, who broke his word about
Tyrconnel, was taken.It is reported that King James is gone back to
France.Drogheda and Dublin surrendered, and if King William be
returning, we may say of him as Caesar said, "_Veni, vidi, vici_."But to
alloy much of this, the French fleet rides in our channel, ours not
daring to interpose, and the enemy threatening to land.[Footnote 74: Poor Pepys, as the reader knows, had already undergone
    an imprisonment, with perhaps just as much reason as the present, on
    the absurd accusation of having sent information to the French Court
    of the state of the English Navy.][Sidenote: LONDON]

27th June, 1690.I went to visit some friends in the Tower, when asking
for Lord Clarendon, they by mistake directed me to the Earl of
Torrington, who about three days before had been sent for from the
fleet, and put into the Tower for cowardice and not fighting the French
fleet, which having beaten a squadron of the Hollanders, while
Torrington did nothing, did now ride masters of the sea, threatening a
descent.This afternoon a camp of about 4,000 men was begun to
be formed on Blackheath.Pepys, now suffered to return to his
house, on account of indisposition.The Duke of Grafton came to visit me, going to his
ship at the mouth of the river, in his way to Ireland (where he was
slain).The French landed some soldiers at Teignmouth, in
Devon, and burned some poor houses.The French fleet still hovering
about the western coast, and we having 300 sail of rich merchant-ships
in the bay of Plymouth, our fleet began to move toward them, under three
admirals.The country in the west all on their guard.A very
extraordinary fine season; but on the 12th was a very great storm of
thunder and lightning, and on the 15th the season much changed to wet
and cold.The militia and trained bands, horse and foot, which were up
through England, were dismissed.The French King having news that King
William was slain, and his army defeated in Ireland, caused such a
triumph at Paris, and all over France, as was never heard of; when, in
the midst of it, the unhappy King James being vanquished, by a speedy
flight and escape, himself brought the news of his own defeat.I was desired to be one of the bail of the Earl of
Clarendon, for his release from the Tower, with divers noblemen.Asaph expounds his prophecies to me and Mr.The troops from Blackheath march to Portsmouth.That sweet and hopeful
youth, Sir Charles Tuke, died of the wounds he received in the fight of
the Boyne, to the great sorrow of all his friends, being (I think) the
last male of that family, to which my wife is related.A more virtuous
young gentleman I never knew; he was learned for his age, having had the
advantage of the choicest breeding abroad, both as to arts and arms; he
had traveled much, but was so unhappy as to fall in the side of his
unfortunate King.The unseasonable and most tempestuous weather happening, the naval
expedition is hindered, and the extremity of wet causes the siege of
Limerick to be raised, King William returned to England.Lord Sidney
left Governor of what is conquered in Ireland, which is near three parts
[in four].An extraordinary sharp, cold, east
wind.The French General, with Tyrconnel and their
forces, gone back to France, beaten out by King William.The Duke of Grafton was there mortally wounded and dies.The 8th of this month Lord Spencer wrote me
word from Althorpe, that there happened an earthquake the day before in
the morning, which, though short, sensibly shook the house.The
"Gazette" acquainted us that the like happened at the same time,
half-past seven, at Barnstaple, Holyhead, and Dublin.We were not
sensible of it here.Kinsale at last surrendered, meantime King James's
party burn all the houses they have in their power, and among them that
stately palace of Lord Ossory's, which lately cost, as reported,
L40,000.By a disastrous accident, a third-rate ship, the Breda, blew up
and destroyed all on board; in it were twenty-five prisoners of war.She
was to have sailed for England the next day.Went to the Countess of Clancarty, to condole with
her concerning her debauched and dissolute son, who had done so much
mischief in Ireland, now taken and brought prisoner to the Tower.Exceeding great storms, yet a warm season.Pepys's memorials to Lord Godolphin, now
resuming the commission of the Treasury, to the wonder of all his
friends.Having been chosen President of the Royal Society, I
desired to decline it, and with great difficulty devolved the election
on Sir Robert Southwell, Secretary of State to King William in Ireland.Hough, President of Magdalen College, Oxford,
who was displaced with several of the Fellows for not taking the oath
imposed by King James, now made a Bishop.Most of this month cold and
frost.One Johnson, a Knight, was executed at Tyburn for being an
accomplice with Campbell, brother to Lord Argyle, in stealing a young
heiress.This week a PLOT was discovered for a general
rising against the new Government, for which (Henry) Lord Clarendon and
others were sent to the Tower.The next day, I went to see Lord
Clarendon.Trial of Lord Preston, as not
being an English Peer, hastened at the Old Bailey.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th January, 1691.Lord Preston condemned about a design to bring in
King James by the French.I went to visit Monsieur Justell and the Library at
St.James's, in which that learned man had put the MSS.(which were in
good number) into excellent order, they having lain neglected for many
years.Divers medals had been stolen and embezzled.Dined at Sir William Fermor's, who showed me many good
pictures.After dinner, a French servant played rarely on the lute.Sir
William had now bought all the remaining statues collected with so much
expense by the famous Thomas, Earl of Arundel, and sent them to his seat
at Easton, near Towcester.[75]

    [Footnote 75: They are now at Oxford, having been presented to the
    University in 1755 by Henrietta, Countess Dowager of Pomfret, widow
    of Thomas, the first Earl.]Lord Sidney, principal Secretary of State, gave me a
letter to Lord Lucas, Lieutenant of the Tower, to permit me to visit
Lord Clarendon; which this day I did, and dined with him.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1691.This night, a sudden and terrible fire burned down all
the buildings over the stone gallery at Whitehall to the water side,
beginning at the apartment of the late Duchess of Portsmouth (which had
been pulled down and rebuilt no less than three times to please her),
and consuming other lodgings of such lewd creatures, who debauched both
King Charles II.The King returned out of Holland just as this accident
happened--Proclamation against the <DW7>s, etc.Sloane's curiosities, being an
universal collection of the natural productions of Jamaica, consisting
of plants, fruits, corals, minerals, stones, earth, shells, animals, and
insects, collected with great judgment; several folios of dried plants,
and one which had about 80 several sorts of ferns, and another of
grasses; the Jamaica pepper, in branch, leaves, flower, fruit, etc.This
collection,[76] with his Journal and other philosophical and natural
discourses and observations, indeed very copious and extraordinary,
sufficient to furnish a history of that island, to which I encouraged
him.[Footnote 76: It now forms part of the collection in the British
    Museum.]The Archbishop of Canterbury, and Bishops of Ely, Bath
and Wells, Peterborough, Gloucester, and the rest who would not take the
oaths to King William, were now displaced; and in their rooms, Dr.Paul's, was made Archbishop: Patrick removed from
Chichester to Ely; Cumberland to Gloucester.I dined with Lord Clarendon in the Tower.I visited the Earl and Countess of Sunderland, now
come to kiss the King's hand after his return from Holland.I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury [Sancroft]
yet at Lambeth.I found him alone, and discoursing of the times,
especially of the newly designed Bishops; he told me that by no canon or
divine law they could justify the removing of the present incumbents;
that Dr.Beveridge, designed Bishop of Bath and Wells, came to ask his
advice; that the Archbishop told him, though he should give it, he
believed he would not take it; the Doctor said he would; why then, says
the Archbishop, when they come to ask, say "_Nolo_," and say it from the
heart; there is nothing easier than to resolve yourself what is to be
done in the case: the Doctor seemed to deliberate.What he will do I
know not, but Bishop Ken, who is to be put out, is exceedingly beloved
in his diocese; and, if he and the rest should insist on it, and plead
their interest as freeholders, it is believed there would be difficulty
in their case, and it may endanger a schism and much disturbance, so as
wise men think it had been better to have let them alone, than to have
proceeded with this rigor to turn them out for refusing to swear against
their consciences.I asked at parting, when his Grace removed; he said
that he had not yet received any summons, but I found the house
altogether disfurnished and his books packed up.I went with my son, and brother-in-law, Glanville, and
his son, to Wotton, to solemnize the funeral of my nephew, which was
performed the next day very decently and orderly by the herald in the
afternoon, a very great appearance of the country being there.I was the
chief mourner; the pall was held by Sir Francis Vincent, Sir Richard
Onslow, Mr.Thomas Howard (son to Sir Robert, and Captain of the King's
Guard), Mr.Herbert, nephew to Lord Herbert of
Cherbury, and cousin-german to my deceased nephew.He was laid in the
vault at Wotton Church, in the burying place of the family.A great
concourse of coaches and people accompanied the solemnity.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th June, 1691.I went to visit Lord Clarendon, still prisoner in the
Tower, though Lord Preston being pardoned was released.Cumberland, the
new Bishop of Norwich,[77] Dr.Lloyd having been put out for not
acknowledging the Government.Cumberland is a very learned, excellent
man.Tillotson, at Lambeth, by the
Sheriff; Archbishop Sancroft was gone, but had left his nephew to keep
possession; and he refusing to deliver it up on the Queen's message, was
dispossessed by the Sheriff, and imprisoned.This stout demeanor of the
few Bishops who refused to take the oaths to King William, animated a
great party to forsake the churches, so as to threaten a schism; though
those who looked further into the ancient practice, found that when (as
formerly) there were Bishops displaced on secular accounts, the people
never refused to acknowledge the new Bishops, provided they were not
heretics.The truth is, the whole clergy had till now stretched the duty
of passive obedience, so that the proceedings against these Bishops gave
no little occasion of exceptions; but this not amounting to heresy,
there was a necessity of receiving the new Bishops, to prevent a failure
of that order in the Church.I went to visit Lord Clarendon in the
Tower, but he was gone into the country for air by the Queen's
permission, under the care of his warden.Cumberland was made Bishop of
    Peterborough and Dr.Lloyd in the see of
    Norwich.]Stringfellow preach his first
sermon in the newly erected Church of Trinity, in Conduit Street; to
which I did recommend him to Dr.Tenison for the constant preacher and
lecturer.This Church, formerly built of timber on Hounslow-Heath by
King James for the mass priests, being begged by Dr.Martin's, was set up by that public-minded, charitable, and pious
man near my son's dwelling in Dover Street, chiefly at the charge of the
Doctor.I know him to be an excellent preacher and a fit person.Martin's, which is the Doctor's parish, he
was not only content, but was the sole industrious mover, that it should
be made a separate parish, in regard of the neighborhood having become
so populous.Wherefore to countenance and introduce the new minister,
and take possession of a gallery designed for my son's family, I went to
London, where,

19th July, 1691.Tenison preached the first sermon,
taking his text from Psalm xxvi."Lord, I have loved the habitation
of thy house, and the place where thine honor dwelleth."In concluding,
he gave that this should be made a parish church so soon as the
Parliament sat, and was to be dedicated to the Holy Trinity, in honor of
the three undivided persons in the Deity; and he minded them to attend
to that faith of the church, now especially that Arianism, Socinianism,
and atheism began to spread among us.Stringfellow
preached on Luke vii."The centurion who had built a synagogue."He
proceeded to the due praise of persons of such public spirit, and thence
to such a character of pious benefactors in the person of the generous
centurion, as was comprehensive of all the virtues of an accomplished
Christian, in a style so full, eloquent, and moving, that I never heard
a sermon more apposite to the occasion.He modestly insinuated the
obligation they had to that person who should be the author and promoter
of such public works for the benefit of mankind, especially to the
advantage of religion, such as building and endowing churches,
hospitals, libraries, schools, procuring the best editions of useful
books, by which he handsomely intimated who it was that had been so
exemplary for his benefaction to that place.Tenison, had also erected and furnished a public library [in
St.Martin's]; and set up two or three free schools at his own charges.Besides this, he was of an exemplary, holy life, took great pains in
constantly preaching, and incessantly employing himself to promote the
service of God both in public and private.I never knew a man of a more
universal and generous spirit, with so much modesty, prudence, and
piety.The great victory of King William's army in Ireland was looked on as
decisive of that war.Ruth, who had been so
cruel to the poor Protestants in France, was slain, with divers of the
best commanders; nor was it cheap to us, having 1,000 killed, but of the
enemy 4,000 or 5,000.An extraordinary hot season, yet refreshed by some
thundershowers.No sermon in the church in the afternoon, and the
curacy ill-served.A sermon by the curate; an honest discourse, but read
without any spirit, or seeming concern; a great fault in the education
of young preachers.Great thunder and lightning on Thursday, but the
rain and wind very violent.Our fleet come in to lay up the great ships;
nothing done at sea, pretending that we cannot meet the French.A great storm at sea; we lost the "Coronation" and
"Harwich," above 600 men perishing.Our navy come in without
having performed anything, yet there has been great loss of ships by
negligence, and unskillful men governing the fleet and Navy board.I visited the Earl of Dover, who having made his
peace with the King, was now come home.The relation he gave of the
strength of the French King, and the difficulty of our forcing him to
fight, and any way making impression into France, was very wide from
what we fancied.8th to 30th November, 1691.An extraordinary dry and warm season,
without frost, and like a new spring; such as had not been known for
many years.Part of the King's house at Kensington was burned.Discourse of another PLOT, in which several great
persons were named, but believed to be a sham.--A proposal in the House
of Commons that every officer in the whole nation who received a salary
above L500 or otherwise by virtue of his office, should contribute it
wholly to the support of the war with France, and this upon their oath.My daughter-in-law was brought to bed of a
daughter.An exceedingly dry and calm winter; no rain for
many past months.Dined at Lambeth with the new Archbishop.Saw the
effect of my greenhouse furnace, set up by the Archbishop's son-in-law.Charlton's collection of spiders,
birds, scorpions, and other serpents, etc.This last week died that pious, admirable
Christian, excellent philosopher, and my worthy friend, Mr.Boyle, aged
about 65,--a great loss to all that knew him, and to the public.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th January, 1692.Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, preached on Eccles.He concluded
with an eulogy due to the deceased, who made God and religion the scope
of all his excellent talents in the knowledge of nature, and who had
arrived to so high a degree in it, accompanied with such zeal and
extraordinary piety, which he showed in the whole course of his life,
particularly in his exemplary charity on all occasions,--that he gave
L1,000 yearly to the distressed refugees of France and Ireland; was at
the charge of translating the Scriptures into the Irish and Indian
tongues, and was now promoting a Turkish translation, as he had formerly
done of Grotius "on the Truth of the Christian Religion" into Arabic,
which he caused to be dispersed in the eastern countries; that he had
settled a fund for preachers who should preach expressly against
Atheists, Libertines, Socinians, and Jews; that he had in his will given
L8,000 to charitable uses; but that his private charities were
extraordinary.He dilated on his learning in Hebrew and Greek, his
reading of the fathers, and solid knowledge in theology, once
deliberating about taking Holy Orders, and that at the time of
restoration of King Charles II., when he might have made a great figure
in the nation as to secular honor and titles, his fear of not being able
to discharge so weighty a duty as the first, made him decline that, and
his humility the other.He spoke of his civility to strangers, the great
good which he did by his experience in medicine and chemistry, and to
what noble ends he applied himself to his darling studies; the works,
both pious and useful, which he published; the exact life he led, and
the happy end he made.Something was touched of his sister, the Lady
Ranelagh, who died but a few days before him.And truly all this was but
his due, without any grain of flattery.This week a most execrable murder was committed on Dr.Clench, father of
that extraordinary learned child whom I have before noticed.Under
pretense of carrying him in a coach to see a patient, they strangled him
in it; and, sending away the coachman under some pretense, they left his
dead body in the coach, and escaped in the dusk of the evening.Tenison, now
Bishop of Lincoln, in Trinity Church, being the first that was
christened there.A frosty and dry season continued; many persons die
of apoplexy, more than usual.Lord Marlborough, Lieutenant-General of
the King's army in England, gentleman of the bedchamber, etc., dismissed
from all his charges, military and other, for his excessive taking of
bribes, covetousness, and extortion on all occasions from his inferior
officers.Note, this was the Lord who was entirely advanced by King
James, and was the first who betrayed and forsook his master.He was son
of Sir Winston Churchill of the Greencloth.Boyle having made me one of the trustees for
his charitable bequests, I went to a meeting of the Bishop of Lincoln,
Sir Rob.... wood, and serjeant, Rotheram, to settle that clause in the
will which related to charitable uses, and especially the appointing and
electing a minister to preach one sermon the first Sunday in the month,
during the four summer months, expressly against Atheists, Deists,
Libertines, Jews, etc., without descending to any other controversy
whatever, for which L50 per annum is to be paid quarterly to the
preacher; and, at the end of three years, to proceed to a new election
of some other able divine, or to continue the same, as the trustees
should judge convenient.Bentley, chaplain to
the Bishop of Worcester (Dr.The first sermon was
appointed for the first Sunday in March, at St.Martin's; the second
Sunday in April, at Bow Church, and so alternately.Lord Marlborough having used words against the
King, and been discharged from all his great places, his wife was
forbidden the Court, and the Princess of Denmark was desired by the
Queen to dismiss her from her service; but she refusing to do so, goes
away from Court to Sion house.Divers new Lords made: Sir Henry Capel,
Sir William Fermor, etc.The
Parliament adjourned, not well satisfied with affairs.The business of
the East India Company, which they would have reformed, let fall.The
Duke of Norfolk does not succeed in his endeavor to be divorced.[78]

    [Footnote 78: See _post_ pp.My son was made one of the Commissioners of the
Revenue and Treasury of Ireland, to which employment he had a mind, far
from my wishes.I visited the Earl of Peterborough, who showed me the
picture of the Prince of Wales, newly brought out of France, seeming in
my opinion very much to resemble the Queen his mother, and of a most
vivacious countenance.The Queen Dowager went out of
England toward Portugal, as pretended, against the advice of all her
friends.So excellent a discourse against the Epicurean system is
not to be recapitulated in a few words.He came to me to ask whether I
thought it should be printed, or that there was anything in it which I
desired to be altered.I took this as a civility, and earnestly desired
it should be printed, as one of the most learned and convincing
discourses I had ever heard.King James sends a letter written and directed
by his own hand to several of the Privy Council, and one to his
daughter, the Queen Regent, informing them of the Queen being ready to
be brought to bed, and summoning them to be at the birth by the middle
of May, promising as from the French King, permission to come and return
in safety.Much apprehension of a French invasion, and of an
universal rising.Unkindness
between the Queen and her sister.Very cold and unseasonable weather,
scarce a leaf on the trees.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th May, 1692.Reports of an invasion were very hot, and alarmed the
city, Court, and people; nothing but securing suspected persons, sending
forces to the seaside, and hastening out the fleet.Continued discourse
of the French invasion, and of ours in France.The eastern wind so
constantly blowing, gave our fleet time to unite, which had been so
tardy in preparation, that, had not God thus wonderfully favored, the
enemy would in all probability have fallen upon us.Many daily secured,
and proclamations out for more conspirators.My kinsman, Sir Edward Evelyn, of Long Ditton, died
suddenly.I dined at my cousin Cheny's, son to my Lord Cheny, who
married my cousin Pierpoint.My niece, M. Evelyn, was now married to Sir Cyril Wyche,
Secretary of State for Ireland.After all our apprehensions of being
invaded, and doubts of our success by sea, it pleased God to give us a
great naval victory, to the utter ruin of the French fleet, their
admiral and all their best men-of-war, transport-ships, etc.Though this day was set apart expressly for celebrating
the memorable birth, return, and restoration of the late King Charles
II., there was no notice taken of it, nor any part of the office annexed
to the Common Prayer Book made use of, which I think was ill done, in
regard his restoration not only redeemed us from anarchy and confusion,
but restored the Church of England as it were miraculously.I went to Windsor to carry my grandson to Eton School,
where I met my Lady Stonehouse and other of my daughter-in-law's
relations, who came on purpose to see her before her journey into
Ireland.We went to see the castle, which we found furnished and very
neatly kept, as formerly, only that the arms in the guard chamber and
keep were removed and carried away.An exceeding great storm of wind and
rain, in some places stripping the trees of their fruit and leaves as if
it had been winter; and an extraordinary wet season, with great floods.I went with my wife, son, and daughter, to Eton, to see
my grandson, and thence to my Lord Godolphin's, at Cranburn, where we
lay, and were most honorably entertained.George's
Chapel, and returned to London late in the evening.Hewer's at Clapham, where he has an excellent,
useful, and capacious house on the Common, built by Sir Den.Gauden, and
by him sold to Mr.Hewer, who got a very considerable estate in the
Navy, in which, from being Mr.Pepys's clerk, he came to be one of the
principal officers, but was put out of all employment on the Revolution,
as were all the best officers, on suspicion of being no friends to the
change; such were put in their places, as were most shamefully ignorant
and unfit.Hewer lives very handsomely and friendly to everybody.Our fleet was now sailing on their long pretense of a descent on the
French coast; but, after having sailed one hundred leagues, returned,
the admiral and officers disagreeing as to the place where they were to
land, and the time of year being so far spent,--to the great dishonor of
those at the helm, who concerted their matters so indiscreetly, or, as
some thought, designedly.This whole summer was exceedingly wet and rainy, the like had not been
known since the year 1648; while in Ireland they had not known so great
a drought.I went to visit the Bishop of Lincoln, when, among
other things, he told me that one Dr.Chaplin, of University College in
Oxford, was the person who wrote the "Whole Duty of Man"; that he used
to read it to his pupil, and communicated it to Dr.Sterne, afterward
Archbishop of York, but would never suffer any of his pupils to have a
copy of it.Came the sad news of the hurricane and
earthquake, which has destroyed almost the whole Island of Jamaica, many
thousands having perished.My son, his wife, and little daughter, went for
Ireland, there to reside as one of the Commissioners of the Revenue.There happened an earthquake, which, though not so
great as to do any harm in England, was universal in all these parts of
Europe.It shook the house at Wotton, but was not perceived by any save
a servant or two, who were making my bed, and another in a garret.I and
the rest being at dinner below in the parlor, were not sensible of it.The dreadful one in Jamaica this summer was profanely and ludicrously
represented in a puppet play, or some such lewd pastime, in the fair of
Southwark, which caused the Queen to put down that idle and vicious mock
show.This season was so exceedingly cold, by reason of a
long and tempestuous northeast wind, that this usually pleasant month
was very uncomfortable.Harbord dies at
Belgrade; Lord Paget sent Ambassador in his room.There was a vestry called about repairing or new
building of the church [at Deptford], which I thought unseasonable in
regard of heavy taxes, and other improper circumstances, which I there
declared.A solemn Thanksgiving for our victory at sea, safe
return of the King, etc.Lancaster, the new Vicar of St.A signal robbery in Hertfordshire of the tax money bringing out of the
north toward London.They were set upon by several desperate persons,
who dismounted and stopped all travelers on the road, and guarding them
in a field, when the exploit was done, and the treasure taken, they
killed all the horses of those whom they stayed, to hinder pursuit,
being sixteen horses.They then dismissed those that they had
dismounted.With much reluctance we gratified Sir J.
Rotherham, one of Mr.Boyle's trustees, by admitting the Bishop of Bath
and Wells to be lecturer for the next year, instead of Mr.Bentley, who
had so worthily acquitted himself.We intended to take him in again the
next year.[Sidenote: LONDON]

January, 1692-93.Contest in Parliament about a self-denying Act, that
no Parliament man should have any office; it wanted only two or three
voices to have been carried.The Duke of Norfolk's bill for a divorce
thrown out, he having managed it very indiscreetly.The quarrel between
Admiral Russell and Lord Nottingham yet undetermined.After five days' trial and extraordinary contest,
the Lord Mohun was acquitted by the Lords of the murder of Montford, the
player, notwithstanding the judges, from the pregnant witnesses of the
fact, had declared him guilty; but whether in commiseration of his
youth, being not eighteen years old, though exceedingly dissolute, or
upon whatever other reason, the King himself present some part of the
trial, and satisfied, as they report, that he was culpable.69 acquitted
him, only 14 condemned him.Unheard of stories of the universal increase of witches in New England;
men, women, and children, devoting themselves to the devil, so as to
threaten the subversion of the government.[79] At the same time there
was a conspiracy among the <DW64>s in Barbadoes to murder all their
masters, discovered by overhearing a discourse of two of the slaves, and
so preventing the execution of the design.France in the utmost misery and poverty for want of corn and
subsistence, while the ambitious King is intent to pursue his conquests
on the rest of his neighbors both by sea and land.Our Admiral, Russell,
laid aside for not pursuing the advantage he had obtained over the
French in the past summer; three others chosen in his place.Burnet,
Bishop of Salisbury's book burned by the hangman for an expression of
the King's title by conquest, on a complaint of Joseph How, a member of
Parliament, little better than a madman.[Footnote 79: Some account of these poor people is given in Bray and
    Manning's "History of Surrey," ii.Miller, Vicar of Effingham, in that county, who was chaplain to
    the King's forces in the colony from 1692 to 1695.Some of the
    accused were convicted and executed; but Sir William Phipps, the
    Governor, had the good sense to reprieve, and afterward pardon,
    several; and the Queen approved his conduct.]The Bishop of Lincoln preached in the afternoon at
the Tabernacle near Golden Square, set up by him.Proposals of a
marriage between Mr.Hitherto an
exceedingly warm winter, such as has seldom been known, and portending
an unprosperous spring as to the fruits of the earth; our climate
requires more cold and winterly weather.The dreadful and astonishing
earthquake swallowing up Catania, and other famous and ancient cities,
with more than 100,000 persons in Sicily, on 11th January last, came now
to be reported among us.An extraordinary deep snow, after almost no winter,
and a sudden gentle thaw.A deplorable earthquake at Malta, since that
of Sicily, nearly as great.A new Secretary of State, Sir John Trenchard; the
Attorney-General, Somers, made Lord-Keeper, a young lawyer of
extraordinary merit.King William goes toward Flanders; but returns, the
wind being contrary.I met the King going to Gravesend to embark in his
yacht for Holland.My daughter Susanna was married to William Draper,
Esq., in the chapel of Ely House, by Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln
(since Archbishop).I gave her in portion L4,000, her jointure is L500
per annum.I pray Almighty God to give his blessing to this marriage!She is a good child, religious, discreet, ingenious, and qualified with
all the ornaments of her sex.She has a peculiar talent in design, as
painting in oil and miniature, and an extraordinary genius for whatever
hands can do with a needle.She has the French tongue, has read most of
the Greek and Roman authors and poets, using her talents with great
modesty; exquisitely shaped, and of an agreeable countenance.This
character is due to her, though coming from her father.Much of this
week spent in ceremonies, receiving visits and entertaining relations,
and a great part of the next in returning visits.We accompanied my daughter to her husband's house,
where with many of his and our relations we were magnificently treated.There we left her in an apartment very richly adorned and furnished, and
I hope in as happy a condition as could be wished, and with the great
satisfaction of all our friends; for which God be praised!Muttering of a design
to bring forces under color of an expected descent, to be a standing
army for other purposes.Talk of a declaration of the French King,
offering mighty advantages to the confederates, exclusive of King
William; and another of King James, with an universal pardon, and
referring the composing of all differences to a Parliament.These were
yet but discourses; but something is certainly under it.A declaration
or manifesto from King James, so written, that many thought it
reasonable, and much more to the purpose than any of his former.I went to my Lord Griffith's chapel; the common
church office was used for the King without naming the person, with some
other, apposite to the necessity and circumstances of the time.I dined at Sir William Godolphin's; and, after evening
prayer, visited the Duchess of Grafton.I saw a great auction of pictures in the Banqueting
house, Whitehall.They had been my Lord Melford's, now Ambassador from
King James at Rome, and engaged to his creditors here.Lord Mulgrave and
Sir Edward Seymour came to my house, and desired me to go with them to
the sale.Divers more of the great lords, etc., were there, and bought
pictures dear enough.There were some very excellent of Vandyke, Rubens,
and Bassan.Lord Godolphin bought the picture of the Boys, by Murillo
the Spaniard, for 80 guineas, dear enough; my nephew Glanville, the old
Earl of Arundel's head by Rubens, for L20.Growing late, I did not stay
till all were sold.A very wet hay harvest, and little summer as yet.Parr at Camberwell,
preached an excellent sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1693.I saw the Queen's rare cabinets and collection of
china; which was wonderfully rich and plentiful, but especially a large
cabinet, looking-glass frame and stands, all of amber, much of it white,
with historical bas-reliefs and statues, with medals carved in them,
esteemed worth L4,000, sent by the Duke of Brandenburgh, whose country,
Prussia, abounds with amber, cast up by the sea; divers other China and
Indian cabinets, screens, and hangings.In her library were many books
in English, French, and Dutch, of all sorts; a cupboard of gold plate; a
cabinet of silver filagree, which I think was our Queen Mary's, and
which, in my opinion, should have been generously sent to her.I dined with Lord Mulgrave, with the Earl of
Devonshire, Mr.Hampden (a scholar and fine gentleman), Dr.Davenant,
Sir Henry Vane, and others, and saw and admired the Venus of Correggio,
which Lord Mulgrave had newly bought of Mr.Daun for L250; one of the
best paintings I ever saw.Lord Capel, Sir Cyril Wyche, and Mr.Duncomb, made
Lord Justices in Ireland; Lord Sydney recalled, and made Master of the
Ordnance.Very lovely harvest weather, and a wholesome season,
but no garden fruit.Lord Nottingham resigned as Secretary of State; the
Commissioners of the Admiralty ousted, and Russell restored to his
office.The season continued very wet, as it had nearly all the summer,
if one might call it summer, in which there was no fruit, but corn was
very plentiful.In the lottery set up after the Venetian manner by
Mr.Neale, Sir R. Haddock, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, had the
greatest lot, L3,000; my coachman L40.Was the funeral of Captain Young, who died of the
stone and great age.I think he was the first who in the first war with
Cromwell against Spain, took the Governor of Havanna, and another rich
prize, and struck the first stroke against the Dutch fleet in the first
war with Holland in the time of the Rebellion; a sober man and an
excellent seaman.Much importuned to take the office of President of
the Royal Society, but I again declined it.We all dined at Pontac's as usual.Bentley preached at the Tabernacle, near Golden
Square.I gave my voice for him to proceed on his former subject the
following year in Mr.Boyle's lecture, in which he had been interrupted
by the importunity of Sir J. Rotheram that the Bishop of Chichester[80]
might be chosen the year before, to the great dissatisfaction of the
Bishop of Lincoln and myself.The Duchess of
Grafton's appeal to the House of Lords for the Prothonotary's place
given to the late Duke and to her son by King Charles II., now
challenged by the Lord Chief Justice.The judges were severely reproved
on something they said.[Footnote 80: A mistake for Bath and Wells.Bishop Kidder is
    referred to.]Prince Lewis of Baden came to London, and was much
feasted.Danish ships arrested carrying corn and naval stores to France.Dryden, the poet, who now intended to write no more plays, being intent
on his translation of Virgil.He read to us his prologue and epilogue to
his valedictory play now shortly to be acted.Lord Macclesfield, Lord Warrington, and Lord
Westmorland, all died within about one week.Several persons shot,
hanged, and made away with themselves.Now was the great trial of the appeal of Lord Bath
and Lord Montagu before the Lords, for the estate of the late Duke of
Albemarle.Stringfellow preached at Trinity parish, being
restored to that place, after the contest between the Queen and the
Bishop of London who had displaced him.Came the dismal news of the disaster befallen our
Turkey fleet by tempest, to the almost utter ruin of that trade, the
convoy of three or four men-of-war, and divers merchant ships, with all
their men and lading, having perished.[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th March, 1694.Martin's, preached; he was
likewise put in by the Queen, on the issue of her process with the
Bishop of London.I went to the Duke of Norfolk, to desire him to make
cousin Evelyn of Nutfield one of the Deputy-Lieutenants of Surrey, and
entreat him to dismiss my brother, now unable to serve by reason of age
and infirmity.The Duke granted the one, but would not suffer my brother
to resign his commission, desiring he should keep the honor of it during
his life, though he could not act.He professed great kindness to our
family.Sharp, Archbishop of York, preached in the
afternoon at the Tabernacle, by Soho.Bentley, our Boyle Lecturer, Chaplain to the
Bishop of Worcester, came to see me.A fiery exhalation rising out of the sea, spread itself
in Montgomeryshire a furlong broad, and many miles in length, burning
all straw, hay, thatch, and grass, but doing no harm to trees, timber,
or any solid things, only firing barns, or thatched houses.It left such
a taint on the grass as to kill all the cattle that eat of it.I saw the
attestations in the hands of the sufferers."The
Berkeley Castle" sunk by the French coming from the East Indies, worth
L200,000.The French took our castle of Gamboo in Guinea, so that the
Africa Actions fell to L30, and the India to L80.Some regiments of
Highland Dragoons were on their march through England; they were of
large stature, well appointed and disciplined.One of them having
reproached a Dutchman for cowardice in our late fight, was attacked by
two Dutchmen, when with his sword he struck off the head of one, and
cleft the skull of the other down to his chin.A very young gentleman named Wilson, the younger son of one who had not
above L200 a year estate, lived in the garb and equipage of the richest
nobleman, for house, furniture, coaches, saddle horses, and kept a
table, and all things accordingly, redeemed his father's estate, and
gave portions to his sisters, being challenged by one Laws, a Scotchman,
was killed in a duel, not fairly.The quarrel arose from his taking away
his own sister from lodging in a house where this Laws had a mistress,
which the mistress of the house thinking a disparagement to it, and
losing by it, instigated Laws to this duel.The mystery is how this so young a gentleman, very sober and
of good fame, could live in such an expensive manner; it could not be
discovered by all possible industry, or entreaty of his friends to make
him reveal it.It did not appear that he was kept by women, play,
coining, padding, or dealing in chemistry; but he would sometimes say
that if he should live ever so long, he had wherewith to maintain
himself in the same manner.He was very civil and well-natured, but of
no great force of understanding.Waller, an extraordinary young
gentleman of great accomplishments, skilled in mathematics, anatomy,
music, painting both in oil and miniature to great perfection, an
excellent botanist, a rare engraver on brass, writer in Latin, and a
poet; and with all this exceedingly modest.His house is an academy of
itself.I carried him to see Brompton Park [by Knightsbridge], where he
was in admiration at the store of rare plants, and the method he found
in that noble nursery, and how well it was cultivated.A public Bank of
L140,000, set up by Act of Parliament among other Acts, and Lotteries
for money to carry on the war.A
great rising of people in Buckinghamshire, on the declaration of a
famous preacher, till now reputed a sober and religious man, that our
Lord Christ appearing to him on the 16th of this month, told him he was
now come down, and would appear publicly at Pentecost, and gather all
the saints, Jews and Gentiles, and lead them to Jerusalem, and begin the
Millennium, and destroying and judging the wicked, deliver the
government of the world to the saints.Great multitudes followed this
preacher, divers of the most zealous brought their goods and
considerable sums of money, and began to live in imitation of the
primitive saints, minding no private concerns, continually dancing and
singing Hallelujah night and day.This brings to mind what I lately
happened to find in Alstedius, that the thousand years should begin this
very year 1694; it is in his "Encyclopaedia Biblica."My copy of the book
printed near sixty years ago.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

4th May, 1694.I went this day with my wife and four servants from Sayes
Court, removing much furniture of all sorts, books, pictures, hangings,
bedding, etc., to furnish the apartment my brother assigned me, and now,
after more than forty years, to spend the rest of my days with him at
Wotton, where I was born; leaving my house at Deptford full furnished,
and three servants, to my son-in-law Draper, to pass the summer in, and
such longer time as he should think fit to make use of it.This being the first Sunday in the month, the blessed
sacrament of the Lord's Supper ought to have been celebrated at Wotton
church, but in this parish it is exceedingly neglected, so that, unless
at the four great feasts, there is no communion hereabouts; which is a
great fault both in ministers and people.I have spoken to my brother,
who is the patron, to discourse the minister about it.Scarcely one
shower has fallen since the beginning of April.This week we had news of my Lord Tiviot having cut his
own throat, through what discontent not yet said.He had been, not many
years past, my colleague in the commission of the Privy Seal, in old
acquaintance, very soberly and religiously inclined.Lord, what are we
without thy continual grace!Lord Falkland, grandson to the learned Lord Falkland, Secretary of State
to King Charles I., and slain in his service, died now of the smallpox.He was a pretty, brisk, understanding, industrious young gentleman; had
formerly been faulty, but now much reclaimed; had also the good luck to
marry a very great fortune, besides being entitled to a vast sum, his
share of the Spanish wreck, taken up at the expense of divers
adventurers.From a Scotch Viscount he was made an English Baron,
designed Ambassador for Holland; had been Treasurer of the Navy, and
advancing extremely in the new Court.All now gone in a moment, and I
think the title is extinct.I know not whether the estate devolves to my
cousin Carew.It was at my Lord Falkland's, whose lady importuned us to
let our daughter be with her some time, so that that dear child took the
same infection, which cost her valuable life.Edwards, minister of Denton, in Sussex, a living in
my brother's gift, came to see him.Wotton, that extraordinary learned
young man, preached excellently.Duncomb, minister of Albury, preached at Wotton, a
very religious and exact discourse.The first great bank for a fund of money being now established by Act of
Parliament, was filled and completed to the sum of L120,000, and put
under the government of the most able and wealthy citizens of London.All who adventured any sum had four per cent., so long as it lay in the
bank, and had power either to take it out at pleasure, or transfer it.Glorious steady weather; corn and all fruits in extraordinary plenty
generally.Lord Berkeley burnt Dieppe and Havre de Grace with
bombs, in revenge for the defeat at Brest.This manner of destructive
war was begun by the French, is exceedingly ruinous, especially falling
on the poorer people, and does not seem to tend to make a more speedy
end of the war; but rather to exasperate and incite to revenge.Many
executed at London for clipping money, now done to that intolerable
extent, that there was hardly any money that was worth above half the
nominal value.I went to visit my cousin, George Evelyn of Nutfield,
where I found a family of ten children, five sons and five
daughters--all beautiful women grown, and extremely well-fashioned.All
painted in one piece, very well, by Mr.Lutterell, in crayon on copper,
and seeming to be as finely painted as the best miniature.They are the
children of two extraordinary beautiful wives.Stormy and unseasonable wet weather this week.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th October, 1694.Paul's to see the choir, now finished
as to the stone work, and the scaffold struck both without and within,
in that part.Some exceptions might perhaps be taken as to the placing
columns on pilasters at the east tribunal.As to the rest it is a piece
of architecture without reproach.The pulling out the forms, like
drawers, from under the stalls, is ingenious.I went also to see the
building beginning near St.Giles's, where seven streets make a star
from a Doric pillar placed in the middle of a circular area; said to be
built by Mr.Neale, introducer of the late lotteries, in imitation of
those at Venice, now set up here, for himself twice, and now one for the
State.Visited the Bishop of Lincoln [Tenison] newly come
on the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who a few days before had
a paralytic stroke,--the same day and month that Archbishop Sancroft was
put out.A very sickly time, especially the smallpox, of which divers
considerable persons died.The State lottery[81] drawing, Mr.Cock, a
French refugee, and a President in the Parliament of Paris for the
Reformed, drew a lot of L1,000 per annum.[Footnote 81: State lotteries finally closed October 18, 1826.]I visited the Marquis of Normanby, and had much
discourse concerning King Charles II.Also concerning
the _quinquina_ which the physicians would not give to the King, at a
time when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that could cure
him (out of envy because it had been brought into vogue by Mr.Tudor, an
apothecary), till Dr.Short, to whom the King sent to know his opinion
of it privately, he being reputed a <DW7> (but who was in truth a very
honest, good Christian), sent word to the King that it was the only
thing which could save his life, and then the King enjoined his
physicians to give it to him, which they did and he recovered.Being
asked by this Lord why they would not prescribe it, Dr.Lower said it
would spoil their practice, or some such expression, and at last
confessed it was a remedy fit only for kings.Exception was taken that
the late Archbishop did not cause any of his Chaplains to use any office
for the sick during his illness.I had news that my dear and worthy friend, Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, for which
I thank God and rejoice, he being most worthy of it, for his learning,
piety, and prudence.He being my
proxy, gave my vote for Dr.The smallpox increased exceedingly, and was very
mortal.The Queen died of it on the 28th.The deaths by
smallpox increased to five hundred more than in the preceding week.The
King and Princess Anne reconciled, and she was invited to keep her Court
at Whitehall, having hitherto lived privately at Berkeley House; she was
desired to take into her family divers servants of the late Queen; to
maintain them the King has assigned her L5,000 a quarter.The frost and continual snow have now lasted five
weeks.Lord Spencer married the Duke of Newcastle's daughter,
and our neighbor, Mr.Hussey, married a daughter of my cousin, George
Evelyn, of Nutfield.The long frost intermitted, but not gone.Called to London by Lord Godolphin, one of the
Lords of the Treasury, offering me the treasurership of the hospital
designed to be built at Greenwich for worn-out seamen.The Marquis of Normanby told me King Charles had a
design to buy all King Street, and build it nobly, it being the street
leading to Westminster.This might have been done for the expense of the
Queen's funeral, which was L50,000, against her desire.Never was so universal a
mourning; all the Parliament men had cloaks given them, and four hundred
poor women; all the streets hung and the middle of the street boarded
and covered with black cloth.There were all the nobility, mayor,
aldermen, judges, etc.I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry's,
who related to me the pious behavior of the Queen in all her sickness,
which was admirable.She never inquired of what opinion persons were,
who were objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper was
found wherein she had desired that her body might not be opened, or any
extraordinary expense at her funeral, whenever she should die.This
paper was not found in time to be observed.There were other excellent
things under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were
very small, and everything in that exact method, as seldom is found in
any private person.In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for
taking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo
the renowned Queen Elizabeth.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord Spencer.My Lord showed me his library, now again improved by many books bought
at the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician, which was
the very best collection, especially of mathematical books, that was I
believe in Europe, once designed for the King's Library at St.James's;
but the Queen dying, who was the great patroness of that design, it was
let fall, and the books were miserably dissipated.The new edition of Camden's "Britannia" was now published (by Bishop
Gibson), with great additions; those to Surrey were mine, so that I had
one presented to me.of some parts of the New
Testament in vulgar Latin, that had belonged to a monastery in the North
of Scotland, which he esteemed to be about eight hundred years old;
there were some considerable various readings observable, as in John i.,
and genealogy of St.Duncomb, parson of this parish,
preached, which he hardly comes to above once a year though but seven or
eight miles off; a florid discourse, read out of his notes.The Holy
Sacrament followed, which he administered with very little reverence,
leaving out many prayers and exhortations; nor was there any oblation.This ought to be reformed, but my good brother did not well consider
when he gave away this living and the next [Abinger].The latter end of the month sharp and severely cold, with
much snow and hard frost; no appearance of spring.Lucas preached in the afternoon at Wotton.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th April, 1695.Lord Halifax died suddenly at London, the day his
daughter was married to the Earl of Nottingham's son at Burleigh.Lord
H. was a very rich man, very witty, and in his younger days somewhat
positive.After a most severe, cold, and snowy winter, without
almost any shower for many months, the wind continuing N. and E. and not
a leaf appearing; the weather and wind now changed, some showers fell,
and there was a remission of cold.The spring begins to appear, yet the trees hardly
leafed.Sir T. Cooke discovers what prodigious bribes have been given by
some of the East India Company out of the stock, which makes a great
clamor.Never were so many private bills passed for unsettling estates,
showing the wonderful prodigality and decay of families.I came to Deptford from Wotton, in order to the first
meeting of the Commissioners for endowing an hospital for seamen at
Greenwich; it was at the Guildhall, London.Present, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Lord Keeper, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Godolphin, Duke of
Shrewsbury, Duke of Leeds, Earls of Dorset and Monmouth, Commissioners
of the Admiralty and Navy, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Christopher Wren, and
several more.Lowndes, Secretary to the
Lords of the Treasury, Surveyor-General.Second meeting of the Commissioners, and a committee
appointed to go to Greenwich to survey the place, I being one of them.We went to survey Greenwich, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir
Christopher Wren, Mr.Travers, the King's Surveyor, Captain Sanders, and
myself.We made report of the state of Greenwich house, and how
the standing part might be made serviceable at present for L6,000, and
what ground would be requisite for the whole design.My Lord Keeper
ordered me to prepare a book for subscriptions, and a preamble to it.Vanbrugh was made secretary to the
commission, by my nomination of him to the Lords, which was all done
that day.The commissioners met at Guildhall, when there were
scruples and contests of the Lord Mayor, who would not meet, not being
named as one of the quorum, so that a new commission was required,
though the Lord Keeper and the rest thought it too nice a punctilio.Met at Guildhall, but could do nothing for want of a
quorum.At Guildhall; account of subscriptions, about L7,000 or
L8,000.I dined at Lambeth, making my first visit to the
Archbishop, where there was much company, and great cheer.After prayers
in the evening, my Lord made me stay to show me his house, furniture,
and garden, which were all very fine, and far beyond the usual
Archbishops, not as affected by this, but being bought ready furnished
by his predecessor.We discoursed of several public matters,
particularly of the Princess of Denmark, who made so little figure.Met at Guildhall; not a full committee, so nothing
done.No sermon at church; but, after prayers, the names of
all the parishioners were read, in order to gathering the tax of 4s.for
marriages, burials, etc.A very imprudent tax, especially this reading
the names, so that most went out of the church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1695.I dined at Sir Purbeck Temple's, near Croydon; his lady
is aunt to my son-in-law, Draper; the house exactly furnished.Went
thence with my son and daughter to Wotton.Duncomb,
parson of Albury, preached excellently.The weather now so cold, that greater frosts were not
always seen in the midst of winter; this succeeded much wet, and set
harvest extremely back.Offley preached at Abinger; too much
controversy on a point of no consequence, for the country people here.This was the first time I had heard him preach.Bombarding of Cadiz; a
cruel and brutish way of making war, first began by the French.The
season wet, great storms, unseasonable harvest weather.My good and
worthy friend, Captain Gifford, who that he might get some competence to
live decently, adventured all he had in a voyage of two years to the
East Indies, was, with another great ship, taken by some French
men-of-war, almost within sight of England, to the loss of near L70,000,
to my great sorrow, and pity of his wife, he being also a valiant and
industrious man.The losses of this sort to the nation have been
immense, and all through negligence, and little care to secure the same
near our own coasts; of infinitely more concern to the public than
spending their time in bombarding and ruining two or three paltry towns,
without any benefit, or weakening our enemies, who, though they began,
ought not to be imitated in an action totally averse to humanity, or
Christianity.Sir Purbeck Temple, uncle to my
son Draper, died suddenly.His lady being
own aunt to my son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no
heir.There had been a new meeting of the commissioners about Greenwich
hospital, on the new commission, where the Lord Mayor, etc.appeared,
but I was prevented by indisposition from attending.The weather very
sharp, winter approaching apace.The King went a progress into the
north, to show himself to the people against the elections, and was
everywhere complimented, except at Oxford, where it was not as he
expected, so that he hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the
theater, did not receive the banquet proposed.Paul's school, who showed me many curious passages out of some
ancient Platonists' MSS.concerning the Trinity, which this great and
learned person would publish, with many other rare things, if he was
encouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.The Archbishop and myself went to Hammersmith, to
visit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a very mortifying
sight.He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious;
also his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling; and other
pretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, etc., and the pump he had
erected that serves water to his garden, and to passengers, with an
inscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most
perfect and pure water.He had newly buried L200 worth of music books
six feet under ground, being, as he said, love songs and vanity.He
plays himself psalms and religious hymns on the theorbo.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th November, 1695.Stanhope, Vicar of Lewisham, preached at
Whitehall.He is one of the most accomplished preachers I ever heard,
for matter, eloquence, action, voice, and I am told, of excellent
conversation.Famous fireworks and very chargeable, the King
being returned from his progress.He stayed seven or eight days at Lord
Sunderland's at Althorpe, where he was mightily entertained.These
fireworks were shown before Lord Romney, master of the ordnance, in St.James's great square, where the King stood.I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury to interest
himself for restoring a room belonging to St.James's library, where the
books want place.Williams continued in Boyle's
lectures another year.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, now the great favorite
and underhand politician, but not adventuring on any character, being
obnoxious to the people for having twice changed his religion.The Parliament wondrously intent on ways to reform
the coin; setting out a Proclamation prohibiting the currency of
half-crowns, etc., which made much confusion among the people.Hitherto mild, dark, misty, weather.Great confusion and distraction by reason of the
clipped money, and the difficulty found in reforming it.An extraordinary wet season, though temperate as to
cold.The "Royal Sovereign" man-of-war burned at Chatham.It was built
in 1637, and having given occasion to the levy of ship money was perhaps
the cause of all the after troubles to this day.An earthquake in
Dorsetshire by Portland, or rather a sinking of the ground suddenly for
a large space, near the quarries of stone, hindering the conveyance of
that material for the finishing St.There was now a conspiracy of about thirty
knights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English <DW7>s,
and Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the
first opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or
to the chapel; and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to
Calais, an invasion was designed.In order to it there was a great army
in readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection
here, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,
King James attending at Calais with the French army.It was discovered
by some of their own party.L1,000 reward was offered to whoever could
apprehend any of the thirty named.Most of those who were engaged in it,
were taken and secured.The Parliament, city, and all the nation,
congratulate the discovery; and votes and resolutions were passed that,
if King William should ever be assassinated, it should be revenged on
the <DW7>s and party through the nation; an Act of Association drawing
up to empower the Parliament to sit on any such accident, till the Crown
should be disposed of according to the late settlement at the
Revolution.All <DW7>s, in the meantime, to be banished ten miles from
London.This put the nation into an incredible disturbance and general
animosity against the French King and King James.The militia of the
nation was raised, several regiments were sent for out of Flanders, and
all things put in a posture to encounter a descent.This was so timed by
the enemy, that while we were already much discontented by the greatness
of the taxes, and corruption of the money, etc., we had like to have had
very few men-of-war near our coasts; but so it pleased God that Admiral
Rooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,
with others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,
and were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could
be got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken.I look
on it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of
God.Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design
of assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many oL his
friends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King
William.The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so
many of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding
their design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and
Dunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they
were so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their
masts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels.French were to
have invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples.Three of the unhappy wretches,
whereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate
the King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of
inciting them to it, and died very penitent.Divers more in danger, and
some very considerable persons.[Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.][Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1696.The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John
Friend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at
Temple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied.I think there never was
such at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles
II., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]

    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into
    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684.Great offense taken at the three ministers who
absolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn.One of them (Snatt)
was a son of my old schoolmaster.This produced much altercation as to
the canonicalness of the action.We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee
about settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years
a more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson.I went to see the
King's House at Kensington.The
gallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of
Titian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,
Tintoretto, and others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty
private library.His prayer before
the sermon was one of the most excellent compositions I ever heard.The Venetian Ambassador made a stately entry with
fifty footmen, many on horseback, four rich coaches, and a numerous
train of gallants.Oates
dedicated a most villainous, reviling book against King James, which he
presumed to present to King William, who could not but abhor it,
speaking so infamously and untruly of his late beloved Queen's own
father.I dined at Lambeth, being summoned to meet my co-trustees,
the Archbishop, Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr.Serjeant Rotheram, to consult
about settling Mr.Boyle's lecture for a perpetuity; which we concluded
upon, by buying a rent charge of L50 per annum, with the stock in our
hands.I went to Lambeth, to meet at dinner the Countess of
Sunderland and divers ladies.We dined in the Archbishop's wife's
apartment with his Grace, and stayed late; yet I returned to Deptford at
night.I went to London to meet my son, newly come from
Ireland, indisposed.Money still continuing exceedingly scarce, so that
none was paid or received, but all was on trust, the mint not supplying
for common necessities.The Association with an oath required of all
lawyers and officers, on pain of _praemunire_, whereby men were obliged
to renounce King James as no rightful king, and to revenge King
William's death, if happening by assassination.This to be taken by all
the Counsel by a day limited, so that the Courts of Chancery and King's
Bench hardly heard any cause in Easter Term, so many crowded to take the
oath.This was censured as a very entangling contrivance of the
Parliament in expectation, that many in high office would lay down, and
others surrender.Many gentlemen taken up on suspicion of the late plot,
were now discharged out of prison.We settled divers offices, and other matters relating to
workmen, for the beginning of Greenwich hospital.[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]

1st June, 1696.I went to Deptford to dispose of our goods, in order to
letting the house for three years to Vice Admiral Benbow, with condition
to keep up the garden.A committee met at Whitehall about Greenwich Hospital,
at Sir Christopher Wren's, his Majesty's Surveyor-General.We made the
first agreement with divers workmen and for materials; and gave the
first order for proceeding on the foundation, and for weekly payments to
the workmen, and a general account to be monthly.Dined at Lord Pembroke's, Lord Privy Seal, a very
worthy gentleman.He showed me divers rare pictures of very many of the
old and best masters, especially one of M. Angelo of a man gathering
fruit to give to a woman, and a large book of the best drawings of the
old masters.Sir John Fenwick, one of the conspirators, was taken.Great
subscriptions in Scotland to their East India Company.Want of current
money to carry on the smallest concerns, even for daily provisions in
the markets.Guineas lowered to twenty-two shillings, and great sums
daily transported to Holland, where it yields more, with other treasure
sent to pay the armies, and nothing considerable coined of the new and
now only current stamp, cause such a scarcity that tumults are every day
feared, nobody paying or receiving money; so imprudent was the late
Parliament to condemn the old though clipped and corrupted, till they
had provided supplies.To this add the fraud of the bankers and
goldsmiths, who having gotten immense riches by extortion, keep up their
treasure in expectation of enhancing its value.Duncombe, not long since
a mean goldsmith, having made a purchase of the late Duke of
Buckingham's estate at nearly L90,000, and reputed to have nearly as
much in cash.Banks and lotteries every day set up.The famous trial between my Lord Bath and Lord Montague
for an estate of L11,000 a year, left by the Duke of Albemarle, wherein
on several trials had been spent,L20,000 between them.The Earl of Bath
was cast on evident forgery.I made my Lord Cheney a visit at Chelsea, and saw those
ingenious waterworks invented by Mr.Winstanley, wherein were some
things very surprising and extraordinary.An exceedingly rainy, cold, unseasonable summer, yet
the city was very healthy.A trial in the Common Pleas between the Lady Purbeck
Temple and Mr.Temple, a nephew of Sir Purbeck, concerning a deed set up
to take place of several wills.The
cause went on my lady's side.This concerning my son-in-law, Draper, I
stayed almost all day at Court.A great supper was given to the jury,
being persons of the best condition in Buckinghamshire.I went with a select committee of the Commissioners for
Greenwich Hospital, and with Sir Christopher Wren, where with him I laid
the first stone of the intended foundation, precisely at five o'clock in
the evening, after we had dined together.Flamstead, the King's
Astronomical Professor, observing the punctual time by instruments.Note that my Lord Godolphin was the first of the
subscribers who paid any money to this noble fabric.A northern wind altering the weather with a continual
and impetuous rain of three days and nights changed it into perfect
winter.So little money in the nation that Exchequer Tallies,
of which I had for L2,000 on the best fund in England, the Post Office,
nobody would take at 30 per cent discount.The Bank lending the L200,000 to pay the array in
Flanders, that had done nothing against the enemy, had so exhausted the
treasure of the nation, that one could not have borrowed money under 14
or 15 per cent on bills, or on Exchequer Tallies under 30 per cent.I went to Lambeth and dined with the
Archbishop, who had been at Court on the complaint against Dr.David's, who was suspended for simony.The
Archbishop told me how unsatisfied he was with the Canon law, and how
exceedingly unreasonable all their pleadings appeared to him.Fine seasonable weather, and a great harvest after a
cold, wet summer.I went to congratulate the marriage of a daughter
of Mr.Boscawen to the son of Sir Philip Meadows; she is niece to my
Lord Godolphin, married at Lambeth by the Archbishop, 30th of August.After above six months' stay in London about Greenwich Hospital, I
returned to Wotton.Unseasonable stormy weather, and an ill seedtime.Lord Godolphin retired from the Treasury, who was the
first Commissioner and most skillful manager of all.The first frost began fiercely, but lasted not long.15th-23d November, 1696.Very stormy weather, rain, and inundations.The severe frost and weather relented, but again
froze with snow.Sir John
Fenwick was beheaded.Soldiers in the
armies and garrison towns frozen to death on their posts.I came to Wotton after three months' absence.Very bright weather, but with sharp east wind.My son
came from London in his melancholy indisposition.Duncombe, the rector, came and preached after
an absence of two years, though only living seven or eight miles off [at
Ashted].So great were the storms all this week, that near a
thousand people were lost going into the Texel.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th November, 1697.The King's entry very pompous; but is nothing
approaching that of King Charles II.Thanksgiving Day for the Peace, the King and a great
Court at Whitehall.The Bishop of Salisbury preached, or rather made a
florid panegyric, on 2 Chron.The evening concluded with
fireworks and illuminations of great expense.Paul's had had service
performed in it since it was burned in 1666.I went to Kensington with the Sheriff, Knights, and
chief gentlemen of Surrey, to present their address to the King.The
Duke of Norfolk promised to introduce it, but came so late, that it was
presented before be came.This insignificant ceremony was brought in in
Cromwell's time, and has ever since continued with offers of life and
fortune to whoever happened to have the power.I dined at Sir Richard
Onslow's, who treated almost all the gentlemen of Surrey.When we had
half dined, the Duke of Norfolk came in to make his excuse.At the Temple Church; it was very long before the
service began, staying for the Comptroller of the Inner Temple, where
was to be kept a riotous and reveling Christmas, according to custom.Bentley, about the Library at
St.A great Christmas kept at Wotton, open house, much company.I
presented my book of Medals, etc., to divers noblemen, before I exposed
it to sale.Fulham, who lately married my niece, preached
against atheism, a very eloquent discourse, somewhat improper for most
of the audience at [Wotton], but fitted for some other place, and very
apposite to the profane temper of the age.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th January, 1698.Whitehall burned, nothing but walls and ruins left.The imprisonment of the great banker, Duncombe:
censured by Parliament; acquitted by the Lords; sent again to the Tower
by the Commons.The Czar of Muscovy being come to England, and having a mind to see the
building of ships, hired my house at Sayes Court, and made it his court
and palace, newly furnished for him by the King.[84]

    [Footnote 84: While the Czar was in his house.Evelyn's servant
    writes to him: "There is a house full of people, and right nasty.The Czar lies next your library, and dines in the parlor next your
    study.He dines at ten o'clock and at six at night; is very seldom
    at home a whole day; very often in the King's yard, or by water,
    dressed in several dresses.The King is expected here this day; the
    best parlor is pretty clean for him to be entertained in.The King
    pays for all he has."]The Czar went from my house to return home.An
exceedingly sharp and cold season.An extraordinary great snow and frost, nipping the corn
and other fruits.Corn at nine shillings a bushel [L18 a load].Pepys's, where I heard the rare voice of
Mr.Pule, who was lately come from Italy, reputed the most excellent
singer we had ever had.White, late Bishop of Norwich, who had been ejected
for not complying with Government, was buried in St.Gregory's
churchyard, or vault, at St.His hearse was accompanied by two
non-juror bishops, Dr.Lloyd, with forty other
non-juror clergymen, who would not stay the Office of the burial,
because the Dean of St.Paul's had appointed a conforming minister to
read the Office; at which all much wondered, there being nothing in that
Office which mentioned the present King.Godolphin
with the Earl of Marlborough's daughter.To Deptford, to see how miserably the Czar had left my
house, after three months making it his Court.I got Sir Christopher
Wren, the King's surveyor, and Mr.London, his gardener, to go and
estimate the repairs, for which they allowed L150 in their report to the
Lords of the Treasury.I then went to see the foundation of the Hall and
Chapel at Greenwich Hospital.I dined with Pepys, where was Captain Dampier,[85] who
had been a famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted Prince Job,
and printed a relation of his very strange adventure, and his
observations.He was now going abroad again by the King's encouragement,
who furnished a ship of 290 tons.He seemed a more modest man than one
would imagine by the relation of the crew he had assorted with.He
brought a map of his observations of the course of the winds in the
South Sea, and assured us that the maps hitherto extant were all false
as to the Pacific Sea, which he makes on the south of the line, that on
the north end running by the coast of Peru being extremely tempestuous.[Footnote 85: The celebrated navigator, born in 1652, the time of
    whose death is uncertain.His "Voyage Round the World" has gone
    through many editions, and the substance of it has been transferred
    to many collections of voyages.]Foy came to me to use my interest with Lord
Sunderland for his being made Professor of Physic at Oxford, in the
King's gift.I went also to the Archbishop in his behalf.Being one of the Council of the Royal Society, I was
named to be of the committee to wait on our new President, the Lord
Chancellor, our Secretary, Dr.Sloane, and Sir R. Southwell, last
Vice-President, carrying our book of statutes; the office of the
President being read, his Lordship subscribed his name, and took the
oaths according to our statutes as a Corporation for the improvement of
natural knowledge.Then his Lordship made a short compliment concerning
the honor the Society had done him, and how ready he would be to promote
so noble a design, and come himself among us, as often as the attendance
on the public would permit; and so we took our leave.She was daughter to Sir
John Evelyn, of Wilts, my father's nephew; she was widow to William
Pierrepoint, brother to the Marquis of Dorchester, and mother to Evelyn
Pierrepoint, Earl of Kingston; a most excellent and prudent lady.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The House of Commons persist in refusing more than 7,000 men to be a
standing army, and no strangers to be in the number.Our county member, Sir R. Onslow, opposed it also; which
might reconcile him to the people, who began to suspect him.Mander, the
Master of Baliol College, where he was entered a fellow-commoner.A most furious wind, such as has not happened for
many years, doing great damage to houses and trees, by the fall of which
several persons were killed.The old East India Company lost their business against
the new Company, by ten votes in Parliament, so many of their friends
being absent, going to see a tiger baited by dogs.The persecuted Vaudois, who were banished out of Savoy, were received by
the German Protestant Princes.My only remaining son died after a tedious languishing
sickness, contracted in Ireland, and increased here, to my exceeding
grief and affliction; leaving me one grandson, now at Oxford, whom I
pray God to prosper and be the support of the Wotton family.He was aged
forty-four years and about three months.He had been six years one of
the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland, with great ability and
reputation.After an extraordinary storm, there came up the Thames
a whale which was fifty-six feet long.Such, and a larger of the spout
kind, was killed there forty years ago (June 1658).My deceased son was buried in the vault at Wotton,
according to his desire.The Duke of Devon lost L1,900 at a horse race at Newmarket.The King preferring his young favorite Earl of Albemarle to be first
Commander of his Guard, the Duke of Ormond laid down his commission.This of the Dutch Lord passing over his head, was exceedingly resented
by everybody.Lord Spencer purchased an incomparable library[86] of...
wherein, among other rare books, were several that were printed at the
first invention of that wonderful art, as particularly "Tully's Offices,
etc."There was a Homer and a Suidas in a very good Greek character and
good paper, almost as ancient.This gentleman is a very fine scholar,
whom from a child I have known.[Footnote 86: The foundation of the noble library now at Blenheim.]I dined with the Archbishop; but my business was to
get him to persuade the King to purchase the late Bishop of Worcester's
library, and build a place for his own library at St.James's, in the
Park, the present one being too small.At a meeting of the Royal Society I was nominated to be of
the committee to wait on the Lord Chancellor to move the King to
purchase the Bishop of Worcester's library (Dr.The Court party have little influence in this Session.The Duke of Ormond restored to his commission.All
Lotteries, till now cheating the people, to be no longer permitted than
to Christmas, except that for the benefit of Greenwich Hospital.Bridgman, chairman of the committee for that charitable work, died; a
great loss to it.He was Clerk of the Council, a very industrious,
useful man.John Moore,[87] Bishop of Norwich,
one of the best and most ample collection of all sorts of good books in
England, and he, one of the most learned men.[Footnote 87: Afterward Bishop of Ely.He died 31st of July, 1714.King George I. purchased this library after the Bishop's death, for
    L6,000, and presented it to the University of Cambridge, where it
    now is.]After a long drought, we had a refreshing shower.The
day before, there was a dreadful fire at Rotherhithe, near the Thames
side, which burned divers ships, and consumed nearly three hundred
houses.Now died the famous Duchess of Mazarin; she had been the richest
lady in Europe.She was niece of Cardinal Mazarin, and was married to
the richest subject in Europe, as is said.She was born at Rome,
educated in France, and was an extraordinary beauty and wit but
dissolute and impatient of matrimonial restraint, so as to be abandoned
by her husband, and banished, when she came into England for shelter,
lived on a pension given her here, and is reported to have hastened her
death by intemperate drinking strong spirits.She has written her own
story and adventures, and so has her other extravagant sister, wife to
the noble family of Colonna.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th June, 1699.This week died Conyers Seymour, son of Sir Edward
Seymour, killed in a duel caused by a slight affront in St.James's
Park, given him by one who was envious of his gallantries; for he was a
vain, foppish young man, who made a great _eclat_ about town by his
splendid equipage and boundless expense.He was about twenty-three years
old; his brother, now at Oxford, inherited an estate of L7,000 a year,
which had fallen to him not two years before.My cousin, George Evelyn, of Nutfield, died suddenly.The heat has been so great, almost all this month, that
I do not remember to have felt much greater in Italy, and this after a
winter the wettest, though not the coldest, that I remember for fifty
years last past.Finding my occasions called me so often to London, I
took the remainder of the lease my son had in a house in Dover Street,
to which I now removed, not taking my goods from Wotton.Seasonable showers, after a continuance of excessive
drought and heat.At Deptford, they had
been building a pretty new church.David's [Watson]
deprived for simony.[88] The city of Moscow burnt by the throwing of
squibs.[Footnote 88: _Ante_, p.There was in this week an eclipse of the sun, at
which many were frightened by the predictions of the astrologers.I
remember fifty years ago that many were so terrified by Lilly, that they
dared not go out of their houses.A strange earthquake at New Batavia,
in the East Indies.My worthy brother died at Wotton, in the 83d year of
his age, of perfect memory and understanding.He was religious, sober,
and temperate, and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the
county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as it were, open house
the whole year in the same manner, or gave more noble or free
entertainment to the county on all occasions, so that his house was
never free.There were sometimes twenty persons more than his family,
and some that stayed there all the summer, to his no small expense; by
this he gained the universal love of the county.He was born at Wotton,
went from the free school at Guildford to Trinity College, Oxford,
thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of the best quality did, but
without intention to study the law as a profession.He married the
daughter of Colwall, of a worthy and ancient family in Leicestershire,
by whom he had one son; she dying in 1643, left George her son an
infant, who being educated liberally, after traveling abroad, returned
and married one Mrs.Gore, by whom he had several children, but only
three daughters survived.He was a young man of good understanding, but,
over-indulging his ease and pleasure, grew so very corpulent, contrary
to the constitution of the rest of his father's relations, that he died.My brother afterward married a noble and honorable lady, relict of Sir
John Cotton, she being an Offley, a worthy and ancient Staffordshire
family, by whom he had several children of both sexes.This lady died,
leaving only two daughters and a son.The younger daughter died before
marriage; the other afterward married Sir Cyril Wych, a noble and
learned gentleman (son of Sir ---- Wych), who had been Ambassador at
Constantinople, and was afterward made one of the Lords Justices of
Ireland.Before this marriage, her only brother married the daughter of
---- Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honorable family, but left a widow
without any child living; he died about 1691, and his wife not many
years after, and my brother resettled the whole estate on me.His
sister, Wych, had a portion of L6,000, to which was added L300 more; the
three other daughters, with what I added, had about L5,000 each.My
brother died on the 5th of October, in a good old age and great
reputation, making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix,
leaving me only his library and some pictures of my father, mother, etc.She buried him with extraordinary solemnity, rather as a nobleman than
as a private gentleman.There were, as I computed, above 2,000 persons
at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county doing him the last
honors.I returned to London, till my lady should dispose of herself and
family.After an unusual warm and pleasant season, we were
surprised with a very sharp frost.I presented my "_Acetaria_,"
dedicated to my Lord Chancellor, who returned me thanks in an
extraordinarily civil letter.There happened this week so thick a mist and fog,
that people lost their way in the streets, it being so intense that no
light of candles, or torches, yielded any (or but very little)
direction.Robberies were committed between
the very lights which were fixed between London and Kensington on both
sides, and while coaches and travelers were passing.It began about four
in the afternoon, and was quite gone by eight, without any wind to
disperse it.At the Thames, they beat drums to direct the watermen to
make the shore.At our chapel in the evening there was a sermon
preached by young Mr.Horneck, chaplain to Lord Guilford, whose lady's
funeral had been celebrated magnificently the Thursday before.A
panegyric was now pronounced, describing the extraordinary piety and
excellently employed life of this amiable young lady.She died in
childbed a few days before, to the excessive sorrow of her husband, who
ordered the preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life,
exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the course of his
life, which was before in great danger of being perverted; following the
mode of this dissolute age.Her devotion, early piety, charity,
fastings, economy, disposition of her time in reading, praying,
recollections in her own handwriting of what she heard and read, and her
conversation were most exemplary.Blackwell's election to be the next
year's Boyles Lecturer.Such horrible robberies and murders were committed, as had not been
known in this nation; atheism, profaneness, blasphemy, among all sorts,
portended some judgment if not amended; on which a society was set on
foot, who obliged themselves to endeavor the reforming of it, in London
and other places, and began to punish offenders and put the laws in more
strict execution; which God Almighty prosper!A gentle, calm, dry,
temperate weather all this season of the year, but now came sharp, hard
frost, and mist, but calm.Calm, bright, and warm as in the middle of April.So
continued on 21st of January.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The Parliament reverses the prodigious donations of the Irish
forfeitures, which were intended to be set apart for discharging the
vast national debt.They called some great persons in the highest
offices in question for setting the Great Seal to the pardon of an
arch-pirate,[89] who had turned pirate again, and brought prizes into
the West Indies, suspected to be connived at on sharing the prey; but
the prevailing part in the House called Courtiers, out-voted the
complaints, not by being more in number, but by the country party being
negligent in attendance.[Footnote 89: Captain Kidd; he was hanged about two years afterward
    with some of his accomplices.This was one of the charges brought by
    the Commons against Lord Somers.]14th January, 1699-1700.Stringfellow, who had been made the first preacher at our chapel by
the Bishop of Lincoln [Dr.Tenison, now Archbishop], while he held St.Martin's by dispensation, and put in one Mr.Sandys, much against the
inclination of those who frequented the chapel.The Scotch book about
Darien was burned by the hangman by vote of Parliament.[90]

    [Footnote 90: The volume alluded to was "An Enquiry into the Causes
    of the Miscarriage of the Scots Colony at Darien: Or an Answer to a
    Libel," entitled "A Defense of the Scots abdicating Darien."See
    Votes of the House of Commons, 15th January, 1699-1700.]Died the Duke of Beaufort, a person of great honor,
prudence, and estate.I went to Wotton, the first time after my brother's
funeral, to furnish the house with necessaries, Lady Wych and my nephew
Glanville, the executors having sold and disposed of what goods were
there of my brother's.The weather was now altering into sharp and hard
frost.[Sidenote: LONDON]

One Stephens, who preached before the House of Commons on King Charles's
Martyrdom, told them that the observation of that day was not intended
out of any detestation of his murder, but to be a lesson to other Kings
and Rulers, how they ought to behave themselves toward their subjects,
lest they should come to the same end.This was so resented that, though
it was usual to desire these anniversary sermons to be printed, they
refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no one should preach
before them, who was not either a Dean or a Doctor of Divinity.The Parliament voted against the Scots settling in
Darien as being prejudicial to our trade with Spain.They also voted
that the exorbitant number of attorneys be lessened (now indeed
swarming, and evidently causing lawsuits and disturbance, eating out the
estates of the people, provoking them to go to law).Mild and calm season, with gentle frost, and little
mizzling rain.Martin's frequently preached at Trinity
chapel in the afternoon.The season was like April for warmth and
mildness.--11th.On Wednesday, was a sermon at our chapel, to be
continued during Lent.I was at the funeral of my Lady Temple, who was buried
at Islington, brought from Addiscombe, near Croydon.She left my
son-in-law Draper (her nephew) the mansion house of Addiscombe, very
nobly and completely furnished, with the estate about it, with plate and
jewels, to the value in all of about L20,000.She was a very prudent
lady, gave many great legacies, with L500 to the poor of Islington,
where her husband, Sir Purbeck Temple, was buried, both dying without
issue.The season warm, gentle, and exceedingly pleasant.Divers persons of quality entered into the Society for Reformation[91]
of Manners; and some lectures were set up, particularly in the city of
London.The most eminent of the clergy preached at Bow Church, after
reading a declaration set forth by the King to suppress the growing
wickedness; this began already to take some effect as to common
swearing, and oaths in the mouths of people of all ranks.[Footnote 91: _Ante_, p.Burnet preached to-day before the Lord Mayor and a
very great congregation, on Proverbs xxvii.5, 6, "Open rebuke is better
than secret love; the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of
an enemy."He made a very pathetic discourse concerning the necessity
and advantage of friendly correction.The Duke of Norfolk now succeeded in obtaining a divorce
from his wife by the Parliament for adultery with Sir John Germaine, a
Dutch gamester, of mean extraction, who had got much by gaming; the Duke
had leave to marry again, so that if he should have children, the
Dukedom will go from the late Lord Thomas's children, <DW7>s indeed,
but very hopeful and virtuous gentlemen, as was their father.The now
Duke their uncle is a Protestant.The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into Ireland as
commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, toward payment
of the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great
measure given to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others
of little merit, and very unseasonably.That this might be done without
suspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member
of either House should be in the commission.The great contest between
the Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and
rejecting bills tacked to the money bill, carried for the Commons.However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King
Charles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass
rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance.This was
carried but by one voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the
Court, save one; so that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph
of the Commons and Country party, but high regret of the Court, and
those to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland.Pity it is,
that things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this
nation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are
satisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection on this side
heaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too
far.Among the rest, there passed a law as to <DW7>s' estates, that if
one turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass
to his next Protestant heir.This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only
the usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the
indiscreet insolence of the <DW7>s here, going in triumphant and public
processions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers
places (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their
party.This week there was a great change of State officers.The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of
Jersey, the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat.Vernon,
Secretary of State, was put out.The Seal was taken from the Lord
Chancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted by a great majority of
votes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons.This
being in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers
refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in
this fluctuating conjuncture.It is certain that this Chancellor was a
most excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior
pen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is
said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in
place in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known.But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and
liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their
jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which
protected the people from tyranny.A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of fruit of all kinds,
and a propitious year.The great trial between Sir Walter Clarges and Mr.Sherwin concerning the legitimacy of the late Duke of Albemarle, on
which depended an estate of L1,500 a year; the verdict was given for Sir
Walter, 19th.Serjeant Wright at last accepted the Great Seal.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

24th May, 1700.I went from Dover street to Wotton, for the rest of the
summer, and removed thither the rest of my goods from Sayes Court.A sweet season, with a mixture of refreshing showers.In the afternoon, our clergyman had a catechism,
which was continued for some time.I was visited with illness, but it pleased God that I
recovered, for which praise be ascribed to him by me, and that he has
again so graciously advertised me of my duty to prepare for my latter
end, which at my great age, cannot be far off.The Duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of Denmark, died of the
smallpox.I went to Harden, which was originally a barren warren
bought by Sir Robert Clayton, who built there a pretty house, and made
such alteration by planting not only an infinite store of the best
fruit; but so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys, and
solitary mountains about it, that it rather represented some foreign
country, which would produce spontaneously pines, firs, cypress, yew,
holly, and juniper; they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,
mazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the utmost care, so
that I who had seen it some years before in its naked and barren
condition, was in admiration of it.The land was bought of Sir John
Evelyn, of Godstone, and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement
by the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen.He and his lady
received us with great civility.The tombs in the church at Croydon of
Archbishops Grindal, Whitgift, and other Archbishops, are fine and
venerable; but none comparable to that of the late Archbishop Sheldon,
which, being all of white marble, and of a stately ordinance and
carvings, far surpassed the rest, and I judge could not cost less than
L700 or L800.I went to Beddington, the ancient seat of the
Carews, in my remembrance a noble old structure, capacious, and in form
of the buildings of the age of Henry VIII.and Queen Elizabeth, and
proper for the old English hospitality, but now decaying with the house
itself, heretofore adorned with ample gardens, and the first orange
trees[92] that had been seen in England, planted in the open ground, and
secured in winter only by a tabernacle of boards and stoves removable in
summer, that, standing 120 years, large and goodly trees, and laden with
fruit, were now in decay, as well as the grotto, fountains, cabinets,
and other curiosities in the house and abroad, it being now fallen to a
child under age, and only kept by a servant or two from utter
dilapidation.The estate and park about it also in decay.[Footnote 92: Oranges were eaten in this kingdom much earlier than
    the time of King James I.]Pepys at Clapham, where he has
a very noble and wonderfully well-furnished house, especially with
Indian and Chinese curiosities.The offices and gardens well
accommodated for pleasure and retirement.My birthday now completed the 80th year of my age.I
with my soul render thanks to God, who, of his infinite mercy, not only
brought me out of many troubles, but this year restored me to health,
after an ague and other infirmities of so great an age; my sight,
hearing, and other senses and faculties tolerable, which I implore him
to continue, with the pardon of my sins past, and grace to acknowledge
by my improvement of his goodness the ensuing year, if it be his
pleasure to protract my life, that I may be the better prepared for my
last day, through the infinite merits of my blessed Savior, the Lord
Jesus, Amen!Came the news of my dear grandson (the only male of
my family now remaining) being fallen ill of the smallpox at Oxford,
which after the dire effects of it in my family exceedingly afflicted
me; but so it pleased my most merciful God that being let blood at his
first complaint, and by the extraordinary care of Dr.Mander (Head of
the college and now Vice Chancellor), who caused him to be brought and
lodged in his own bed and bedchamber, with the advice of his physician
and care of his tutor, there were all fair hopes of his recovery, to our
infinite comfort.We had a letter every day either from the Vice
Chancellor himself, or his tutor.Assurance of his recovery by a letter from himself.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was a change of great officers at Court.Lord Godolphin returned
to his former station of first Commissioner of the Treasury; Sir Charles
Hedges, Secretary of State.At the Royal Society, Lord Somers, the late
Chancellor, was continued President.Great alterations of officers at Court, and
elsewhere,--Lord Chief Justice Treby died; he was a learned man in his
profession, of which we have now few, never fewer; the Chancery
requiring so little skill in deep law-learning, if the practicer can
talk eloquently in that Court; so that probably few care to study the
law to any purpose.Lord Marlborough Master of the Ordnance, in place of
Lord Romney made Groom of the Stole.The Earl of Rochester goes Lord
Lieutenant to Ireland.I finished the sale of North Stoake in Sussex to
Robert Michell, Esq., appointed by my brother to be sold for payment of
portions to my nieces, and other incumbrances on the estate.An exceeding deep snow, and melted away as suddenly.Severe frost, and such a tempest as threw down many
chimneys, and did great spoil at sea, and blew down above twenty trees
of mine at Wotton.Harley, an able
gentleman, chosen.Our countryman, Sir Richard Onslow, had a party for
him.By an order of the House of Commons, I laid before
the Speaker the state of what had been received and paid toward the
building of Greenwich Hospital.Wye, Rector of Wotton, died, a very worthy good man.Bohun, a learned person and excellent preacher, who had been my
son's tutor, and lived long in my family.I let Sayes Court to Lord Carmarthen, son to the Duke
of Leeds.I went to the funeral of my sister Draper, who was
buried at Edmonton in great state.Davenant displeased the clergy
now met in Convocation by a passage in his book, p.A Dutch boy of about eight or nine years old was carried
about by his parents to show, who had about the iris of one eye the
letters of _Deus meus_, and of the other _Elohim_, in the Hebrew
character.How this was done by artifice none could imagine; his parents
affirming that he was so born.It did not prejudice his sight, and he
seemed to be a lively playing boy.Everybody went to see him; physicians
and philosophers examined it with great accuracy; some considered it as
artificial, others as almost supernatural.The Duke of Norfolk died of an apoplexy, and Mr.Thomas
Howard of complicated disease since his being cut for the stone; he was
one of the Tellers of the Exchequer.Some Kentish men, delivering a petition to the House of
Commons, were imprisoned.[93]

    [Footnote 93: Justinian Champneys, Thomas Culpepper, William
    Culpepper, William Hamilton, and David Polhill, gentlemen of
    considerable property and family in the county.There is a very good
    print of them in five ovals on one plate, engraved by R. White, in
    1701.They desired the Parliament to mind the public more, and their
    private heats less.They were confined till the prorogation, and
    were much visited.A great dearth, no considerable rain having fallen for some months.Very plentiful showers, the wind coming west and south.The Bishops and Convocation at difference concerning the right of
calling the assembly and dissolving.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th June, 1701.The Commons demanded a conference with the Lords on the
trial of Lord Somers, which the Lords refused, and proceeding on the
trial, the Commons would not attend, and he was acquitted.I went to congratulate the arrival of that worthy and
excellent person my Lord Galway, newly come out of Ireland, where he had
behaved himself so honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the
people: but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman, though they had
not a more worthy, valiant, discreet, and trusty person in the two
kingdoms, on whom they could have relied for his conduct and fitness.He
was one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his father, for
being Protestants.My Lord Treasurer made my grandson one of the Commissioners
of the prizes, salary L500 per annum.My grandson went to Sir Simon Harcourt, the
Solicitor-General, to Windsor, to wait on my Lord Treasurer.There had
been for some time a proposal of marrying my grandson to a daughter of
Mrs.Boscawen, sister of my Lord Treasurer, which was now far advanced.I subscribed toward rebuilding Oakwood Chapel, now,
after 200 years, almost fallen down.The weather changed from heat not much less than in Italy
or Spain for some few days, to wet, dripping, and cold, with
intermissions of fair.I went to Kensington, and saw the house,
plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr.Wise, who was there to receive
me.The death of King James, happening on the 15th of this month, N. S.,
after two or three days' indisposition, put an end to that unhappy
Prince's troubles, after a short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly
attempting to bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the Jesuits; which the
nation would not endure.Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague about the Duke
of Albemarle's estate, claiming under a will supposed to have been
forged, is said to have been worth L10,000 to the lawyers.His eldest
son shot himself a few days after his father's death; for what cause is
not clear.He was a most hopeful young man, and had behaved so bravely
against the Turks at the siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a
Count of the Empire.It was falsely reported that Sir Edward Seymour was
dead, a great man; he had often been Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and
in many other lucrative offices.He was of a hasty spirit, not at all
sincere, but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.I kept my first courts in Surrey, which took up
the whole week.Hervey, a Counsellor, Justice of
Peace, and Member of Parliament, and my neighbor.I gave him six
guineas, which was a guinea a day, and to Mr.Martin, his clerk, three
guineas.I was this day 81 complete, in tolerable health,
considering my great age.I gave my vote and
interest to Sir R. Onslow and Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1701-02.At the Royal Society there was read and approved
the delineation and description of my Tables of Veins and Arteries, by
Mr.Cooper, the chirurgeon, in order to their being engraved.The King had a fall from his horse, and broke his
collar bone, and having been much indisposed before, and aguish, with a
long cough and other weakness, died this Sunday morning, about four
o'clock.I carried my accounts of Greenwich Hospital to the Committee.My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed this life this
morning after a long languishing illness, leaving a son by my sister,
and two granddaughters.Our relation and friendship had been long and
great.He died in the 84th year of his
age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and carried down to
Greenwich, put on board a ship, and buried in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, about the Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or
Wednesday after.This occasioned much discourse, he having no relation
at all to the sea.He was a gentleman of an ancient family in
Devonshire, and married my sister Jane.By his prudent parsimony he much
improved his fortune.He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might
have been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of what he had laid out
on repairs, amounting to L1,900.The report of the committee sent to examine the state of
Greenwich hospital was delivered to the House of Commons, much to their
satisfaction.Being elected a member of the Society lately incorporated for the
propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts, I subscribed L10 per annum
toward the carrying it on.We agreed that every missioner, besides the
L20 to set him forth, should have L50 per annum out of the stock of the
Corporation, till his settlement was worth to him L100 per annum.We
sent a young divine to New York.I dined at the Archbishop's with the newly made Bishop
of Carlisle, Dr.Nicolson, my worthy and learned correspondent.I went to Wotton with my family for the rest of the
summer, and my son-in-law, Draper, with his family, came to stay with
us, his house at Addiscombe being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty.Most of the new Parliament were chosen of Church of
England principles, against the peevish party.The Queen was
magnificently entertained at Oxford and all the towns she passed through
on her way to Bath.Arrived now to the 82d year of my age, having read
over all that passed since this day twelvemonth in these notes, I render
solemn thanks to the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring that he
will continue his assistance, and prepare me for my blessed Savior's
coming, that I may obtain a comfortable departure, after so long a term
as has been hitherto indulged me.I find by many infirmities this year
(especially nephritic pains) that I much decline; and yet of his
infinite mercy retain my intellect and senses in great measure above
most of my age.I have this year repaired much of the mansion house and
several tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements.My
wife, children, and family in health: for all which I most sincerely
beseech Almighty God to accept of these my acknowledgments, and that if
it be his holy will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul.My kinsman, John Evelyn, of Nutfield, a young and
very hopeful gentleman, and Member of Parliament, after having come to
Wotton to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and there died
of the smallpox.He left a brother, a commander in the army in Holland,
to inherit a fair estate.Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea and land, that
there has not been so great an union in Parliament, Court, and people,
in memory of man, which God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue!The Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both Houses of
Parliament at St.Paul's; they were wonderfully huzzaed in their
passage, and splendidly entertained in the city.The expectation now is, what treasure will be found on
breaking bulk of the galleon brought from Vigo by Sir George Rooke,
which being made up in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not
begun to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of the Privy
Council, two of the chief magistrates of the city, and the Lord
Treasurer.After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on the Earl of
Marlborough, by making him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke, for the
success of but one campaign, that he should desire L5,000 a year to be
settled on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought a bold
and unadvised request, as he had, besides his own considerable estate,
above L30,000 a year in places and employments, with L50,000 at
interest.He had married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third to the Earl of
Bridgewater.He is a very handsome person, well-spoken and affable, and
supports his want of acquired knowledge by keeping good company.News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict with the French
fleet in the West Indies, in which he gallantly behaved himself, and was
wounded, and would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance; for this,
two of their commanders were tried by a Council of War, and
executed;[94] a third was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, loss of
pay, and incapacity to serve in future.[Footnote 94: The Captains Kirby and Wade, having been tried and
    condemned to die by a court-martial held on them in the West Indies,
    were sent home in the "Bristol;" and, on its arrival at Portsmouth
    were both shot on board, not being suffered to land on English
    ground.]Oglethorpe (son of the late Sir Theo.fought on occasion of some words which passed at a committee of the
House.Oglethorpe was disarmed.The Bill against occasional
conformity was lost by one vote.Corn and provisions so cheap that the
farmers are unable to pay their rents.[Sidenote: LONDON]

February, 1703.A famous cause at the King's Bench between Mr.Fenwick
and his wife, which went for him with a great estate.The Duke of
Marlborough lost his only son at Cambridge by the smallpox.A great
earthquake at Rome, etc.A famous young woman, an Italian, was hired by
our comedians to sing on the stage, during so many plays, for which they
gave her L500; which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above all with such
skill, that there was never any who did anything comparable with their
voices.She was to go home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I
believe carried with her out of this vain nation above L1,000, everybody
coveting to hear her at their private houses.Samuel Pepys, a very worthy,
industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through all the most
considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity.went
out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but
withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with
his partner, Mr.Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and
sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of his labors in great
prosperity.He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in
many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men of
whom he had the conversation.His library and collection of other
curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships
especially.Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he
found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of
the Navy, or _Navalia_, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what
will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr.Pepys had educated in all sorts of
useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned
with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir.Pepys had
been for near forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr.Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at
his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing
him this last office.Rains have been great and continual, and now, near
midsummer, cold and wet.I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles from Wotton, to
see my son-in-law's new house, the outside, to the coving, being such
excellent brickwork, based with Portland stone, with the pilasters,
windows, and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good and
solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's houses in
Surrey, when finished.I returned to Wotton in the evening, though
weary.The last week in this month an uncommon long-continued
rain, and the Sunday following, thunder and lightning.The new Commission for Greenwich hospital was sealed
and opened, at which my son-in-law, Draper, was present, to whom I
resigned my office of Treasurer.From August 1696, there had been
expended in building L89,364 14s.This day, being eighty-three years of age, upon
examining what concerned me, more particularly the past year, with the
great mercies of God preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble thanks,
beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of my sins past, and to
prepare me for a better life by the virtue of his grace and mercy, for
the sake of my blessed Savior.The wet and uncomfortable weather staying us from
church this morning, our Doctor officiated in my family; at which were
present above twenty domestics.55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty of life, and
the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction of a holy life, with
pertinent inferences to prepare us for death and a future state.I gave
him thanks, and told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26-7th November, 1703.The effects of the hurricane and tempest of
wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London,
were very dismal.As to my
own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and
valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning
the garden mount, the growing along the park meadow, the damage to my
own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be
paralleled, with anything happening in our age.I am not able to
describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.I removed to Dover Street, where I found all well;
but houses, trees, garden, etc., at Sayes Court, suffered very much.I made up my accounts, paid wages, gave rewards and
New Year's gifts, according to custom.The King of Spain[95] landing at Portsmouth, came to
Windsor, where he was magnificently entertained by the Queen, and
behaved himself so nobly, that everybody was taken with his graceful
deportment.After two days, having presented the great ladies, and
others, with valuable jewels, he went back to Portsmouth, and
immediately embarked for Spain.[Footnote 95: Charles III., afterward Emperor of Germany, by the
    title of Charles VI.]The Lord Treasurer gave my grandson the office of
Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of L300 a year.The fast on the Martyrdom of King Charles I. was
observed with more than usual solemnity.Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford, now
died,[96] I think the oldest acquaintance now left me in the world.He
was eighty-six years of age, stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after
having been a person of admirable parts and learning.This is a serious
alarm to me.He built a very handsome
chapel to the college, and his own tomb.He gave a legacy of money, and
a third part of his library, to his nephew, Dr.Bohun, who went hence to
his funeral.[Footnote 96: There is a very good Life of him, with his portrait
    prefixed, by Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity College, and Poetry
    Professor at Oxford.][Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1704.This day was celebrated the thanksgiving for the
late great victory,[97] with the utmost pomp and splendor by the Queen,
Court, great Officers, Lords Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc.The
streets were scaffolded from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned.Every company was ranged
under its banners, the city militia without the rails, which were all
hung with cloth suitable to the color of the banner.The Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards; the Queen in a
rich coach with eight horses, none with her but the Duchess of
Marlborough in a very plain garment, the Queen full of jewels.Music and
trumpets at every city company.The great officers of the Crown,
Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six horses, besides
innumerable servants, went to St.After
this, the Queen went back in the same order to St.The city
companies feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night.Music for the church and anthems composed by the best masters.The day before was wet and stormy, but this was one of the most serene
and calm days that had been all the year.[Footnote 97: Over the French and Bavarians, at Blenheim, 13th
    August, 1704.]Being my birthday and the 84th year of my life,
after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I
set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine
my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing, and imploring his
protection for the year following.Lord Clarendon presented me with the three volumes of
his father's "History of the Rebellion."My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr.Clarke's
continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for
his excellent performance of this year.I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the
victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand
with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to
do, without any alteration of his good-nature.He had a most rich George
in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very
plain.I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.Agues and smallpox much in
every place.Great loss by fire,
burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at
Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the
carelessness of a servant.A little before, the same happened at Lord
Pembroke's, at Wilton.The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of
Algernon Percy, Admiral of the fleet to King Charles I., died in the 83d
year of her age.She was sister to the Earl of Suffolk, and left a great
estate, her jointure to descend to the Duke of Somerset.On the death of the Emperor, there was no mourning worn at Court,
because there was none at the Imperial Court on the death of King
William.I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Turnham Green, the
gardens being very fine, and exceedingly well planted with fruit.Most extravagant expense to debauch and corrupt votes
for Parliament members.I sent my grandson with his party of my
freeholders to vote for Mr.I dined at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr.King, a sharp and ready man in politics, as well as very learned.We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir,
which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by one who
went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came along among the
adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the doctor
had written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations.He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St.John's College,
Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but has now altogether given
it over, and lives retired, being very old and infirm, yet continuing
chemistry.I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began to take in wounded
and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for.The
buildings now going on are very magnificent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

October, 1705.Observing how uncertain
great officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not
accept it, unless L2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice.His predecessors, how
little time soever they had the Seal, usually got L100,000 and made
themselves Barons.Lord Abington, Lieutenant
of the Tower, displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in.An indication of great unsteadiness somewhere, but
thus the crafty Whig party (as called) begin to change the face of the
Court, in opposition to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen.There had never been so great an assembly of members
on the first day of sitting, being more than 450.The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen, contrary to
all expectation.I am this day arrived to the 85th year of my age.Lord teach me so to number my days to come, that I may apply them to
wisdom!Making up my accounts for the past year, paid
bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according to custom.Though much
indisposed and in so advanced a stage, I went to our chapel [in London]
to give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to assist me and my
family the ensuing year, if he should yet continue my pilgrimage here,
and bring me at last to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.My indisposition increasing, I was exceedingly ill
this whole week.Notes of the sermons at the chapel in the morning and
afternoon, written with his own hand, conclude this Diary.[98]

  - "etc," changed to "etc.""I know him," said Dan to himself.Well, I don't want him to," proceeded Dan, coloring
indignantly."He thinks himself above me, but he needn't.His father
failed, too, but he went on living just the same.My poor father gave up all he had, and sank into
poverty."The other boy--Tom Carver--had
recognized Dan, but did not choose to show it."I wonder whether Dan Mordaunt expected me to notice him," he said to
himself."I used to go to school with him, but now that he is a low
newsboy I can't stoop to speak to him.Tom Carver twirled his delicate cane and walked on complacently,
feeling no pity for the schoolfellow with whom he used to be so
intimate.He was intensely selfish--a more exceptional thing with boys
than men.It sometimes happens that a boy who passes for good-hearted
changes into a selfish man; but Tom required no change to become that.His heart was a very small one, and beat only for himself.Dan walked on, and finally paused before a large tenement-house.He went
in at the main entrance, and ascended two flights of stairs.He opened a
door, and found himself in the presence of the mother whom he so dearly
loved.While Dan was strong, sturdy, and the picture of health, his mother was
evidently an invalid.She was pale, thin, and of delicate appearance.She was sitting in a cane-seated rocking-chair, which Dan had bought
second-hand on one of his flush days at a small place on the Bowery.She
looked up with a glad smile when Dan entered."I am so glad to see you, my dear boy," she said."Yes, Dan, it is lonely sitting here hour after hour without you, but I
have my work to think of.""I wish you didn't have to work, mother," said Dan.I ought to earn enough to support us both.""Don't trouble yourself about that, my dear boy.I should feel more
lonely if I had nothing to do."I don't like to have you do that."In truth the mother was very tired, and her feeble fingers were cramped
with the stitch, stitch, stitch in endless repetition, but she put on a
cheerful countenance."Well, Dan, I'll stop now that you are at home."No, Dan, it will be a relief to me to stir around a little, as I have
been sitting so long.""Oh, I nearly forgot, mother--here's a nice pear I bought for you.""I don't feel hungry, but I can
eat that."Oh, I've eaten mine," answered Dan, hastily.It was not true, but God will forgive such falsehoods."No; I'll be----flummuxed if I do," said Dan, pausing a little for an
unobjectionable word.Mordaunt set the little table for two.On it she spread a neat
cloth, and laid the plain supper--a plate of bread, ditto of butter, and
a few slices of cold meat.Soon the tea was steeped, and mother and son
sat down for the evening meal."I say, mother, this is a jolly supper," said Dan."I get awfully hungry
by supper-time.""But you eat next to nothing, mother," said Dan, uneasily."I am _not_ a growing boy," said Mrs."I shall relish
my supper to-night on account of the pear you brought me.""Well, I'm glad I thought of it," said Dan, heartily."Pears ain't solid
enough for me; I want something hearty to give me strength."All I do is to
walk about the streets, or stand in front of the Astor House and ask
people to buy my papers.Oh, by the way, who do you think I saw to-day?"I should say not," answered Dan, disdainfully.He used to sit next you in school, didn't he?""Did he say whether his family was well?"Do you suppose Tom Carver would
notice me, now that I am a poor newsboy?"demanded the mother, her pale face flushing."Why
shouldn't he notice my boy?""Because he doesn't choose to," answered Dan, with a short laugh."Didn't you know it was disgraceful to be poor?"You
should have seen him turn his head to the other side as he walked by,
twirling his light cane.""What do you take me for, mother?Do you think I'd speak to a fellow
that doesn't want to know me?""I think you are proud, my boy.""Well, mother, I guess you're right.I'm too proud to force myself upon
the notice of Tom Carver, or any other purse-proud sneak."Dan spoke with a tinge of bitterness, and it was evident that he felt
Tom's slight more than he was willing to acknowledge."It's the way of the world, Dan," said his mother, sighing."Not one of
all my friends, or those whom I accounted such, in my prosperous days,
has come to see us, or shown any interest in our fate."We can do without them," said Dan, sturdily."We must; but it would be pleasant to see some of the old faces," said
his mother, plaintively."There is no one in this house that is company
for me.""No, mother; you are an educated and refined lady, and they are poor and
ignorant.""They are very good people, some of them.She was in this afternoon, and asked if she couldn't do
something for me."My dear Dan, you do use such extraordinary language sometimes.You
didn't talk so when we lived on Madison avenue.""No, mother, but I associate with a different class now.I can't help
catching the phrases I hear all the time.But don't mind, mother; I mean
no harm.I never swear--that is, almost never.I did catch myself at it
the other day, when another newsboy stole half a dozen of my papers.""Don't forget that you are a gentleman, Dan.""I won't if I can help it, mother, though I don't believe anybody else
would suspect it.I must take good care not to look into the
looking-glass, or I might be under the impression that I was a
street-boy instead of a gentleman.""Clothes don't make the gentleman, Dan.I want you to behave and feel
like a gentleman, even if your clothes are poor and patched.""I understand you, mother, and I shall try to follow your advice.I have
never done any mean thing yet that I can remember, and I don't intend
to.""I am sure of that, my dear boy.""Don't be too sure of anything, mother.I have plenty of bad examples
before me.""But you won't be guided by them?""Did you succeed well in your sales to-day, Dan?""I wish I could earn as much," said Mrs."I can only
earn twenty cents a day.""You _earn_ as much as I do, mother, but you don't get it.You see,
there's a difference in earning and being paid.Old Gripp is a mean
skinflint.I should like to force one of his twenty-cent vests down his
miserly throat.""Don't use such violent language, Dan.Perhaps he pays me all he can
afford.""Perhaps he does, but I wouldn't bet high on it.He is making a fortune
out of those who sew for him.There are some men that have no
conscience.I hope some time you will be free from him.""I hope so, too, Dan, but I am thankful to earn something.I don't want
all the burden of our maintenance to fall on you.""Don't call it a burden, mother.There's nothing I enjoy so much as
working for you."It can't be fun on rainy, disagreeable days, Dan.""It wouldn't be fun for you, mother, but you're not a boy.""I am so sorry that you can't keep on with your education, Dan.You were
getting on so well at school."It was a thought that had often come to Dan, but he wouldn't own it, for
he did not wish to add to his mother's sadness."Oh, well, mother," he said, "something may turn up for us, so we won't
look down in the mouth.""I have got my bundled work ready, Dan, if you can carry it round to Mr."Yes, mother, I'll carry it.I hope he'll
pay you to-night, for our rent comes due to-morrow."Shall
we have enough to pay it?"Even if old Gripp pays for the vests?"Dan whistled--a whistle of dismay and anxiety, for he well knew that the
landlord was a hard man.GRIPP'S CLOTHING STORE.Nathan Gripp's clothing store was located about a quarter of a mile from
the City Hall, on Chatham street.Not many customers from Fifth avenue
owned him as their tailor, and he had no reputation up town.His prices
were undeniably low, though his clothes were dear enough in the end.His patrons were in general from the rural districts, or city residents
of easy tastes and limited means.The interior of the store was ill-lighted, and looked like a dark
cavern.But nearly half the stock was displayed at the door, or on the
sidewalk, Mr.Gripp himself, or his leading salesman, standing in the
door-way with keen, black eyes, trying to select from the moving crowds
possible customers.He sold his clothes cheap, but they
cost him little.He paid the lowest prices for work, and whenever told
that his wages would not keep body and soul together, he simply
remarked:

"That's nothing to me, my good woman.If you don't like the pay, leave
the work for somebody else."Gripp could not afford to
leave the work for somebody else.Half wages were better than none, and
they patiently kept on wearing out their strength that Nathan might wax
rich, and live in good style up town.Gripp himself was standing in the door-way when Dan, with the bundle
of vests under his arm, stopped in front of the store.Gripp was a
little doubtful whether our hero wished to become a customer, but a
glance at the bundle dispelled his uncertainty, and revealed the nature
of his errand."I've brought home half a dozen vests," said Dan.asked Gripp, abruptly, for he never lavished any of the
suavity, which was a valuable part of his stock in trade, on his work
people.Here, Samuel, take the boy's bundle, and see
if the work is well done."It was on the tip of Dan's tongue to resent the doubt which these words
implied, but he prudently remained silent.The clerk, a callow youth, with long tow- locks, made sleek with
bear's grease, stopped picking his teeth, and motioned to Dan to come
forward."Here, young feller," he said, "hand over your bundle."The clerk surveyed the boy with a look of disapproval in his fishy
eyes."Didn't you call me a young feller?""You've called me one twice, but I ain't at all particular.I'd just as
lief call you an old feller," said Dan, affably."Look here, young chap, I don't like your manners," said the clerk, with
an irritating consciousness that he was getting the worst of the verbal
encounter."I'm sorry for that," answered Dan, "because they're the best I've got."asked the salesman, with a feeble
attempt at humor."Yes," was Dan's unexpected rejoinder."That's the way I amuse my
leisure hours."muttered the tallow-faced young man, "I'll take a look at
them."He opened the bundle, and examined the vests with an evident desire to
find something wrong.He couldn't find any defect, but that didn't prevent his saying:

"They ain't over-well made.""Well, they won't be over-well paid," retorted Dan."I don't know if we ought to pay for them at all.""Honesty is the best policy, young feller," said Dan."Wait here a
minute till I speak to Mr.He kept Dan before the counter, and approached the proprietor.Gripp, stroking his jet-black
whiskers."Pretty well, sir, but the boy is impudent.""He keeps calling me 'young feller.'""He don't seem to have any respect for me--or you," he added, shrewdly.He cared very little about his clerk, but he
resented any want of respect to himself.He felt that the balance at his
bankers was large enough to insure him a high degree of consideration
from his work-people at least."And the boy wants his pay, I suppose.""He hasn't asked for it, but he will."Tell him we only pay when a full dozen are finished and brought in.We'll credit him, or his mother, with these.""That'll pay them off," thought the astute clothing merchant.Samuel received this order with inward satisfaction, and went back
smiling."Well, young feller," said he, "it's all right.The vests ain't
over-well done, but we'll keep 'em."It seems to me you've forgotten something," he said."You haven't paid me for the work."We'll pay when the next half dozen are brought in.This was entirely out of the usual
course, and he knew very well that the delay would be a great
inconvenience."We've always been paid when we brought in work," he said."We've changed our rule," said the clerk, nonchalantly."We only pay
when a full dozen are brought in."We need the money, and can't
wait.""It's my orders, young feller."Then I'll speak to him," said Dan, promptly.Gripp," said he, "I've just brought in half a dozen vests, but your
clerk here won't pay me for them.""You will get your pay, young man, when you bring in another half
dozen.""Will you pay me to-night as a favor?"pleaded Dan, humbling himself for
his mother's sake."I can't break over my rule," said Nathan Gripp."Besides, Samuel says
the work isn't very well done."ejaculated the angry Samuel, his tallowy
complexion putting on a faint flush."Didn't I tell you he was
impudent?"Nathan Gripp's small black eyes snapped viciously."Boy," said he, "leave my store directly.How dare you address me in
such a way, you young tramp?""I'm no more a tramp than yourself," retorted Dan, now thoroughly angry."Samuel, come here, and put out this boy!"exclaimed Nathan, too
dignified to attempt the task himself.Samuel advanced, nothing loth, his fishy eyes gleaming with pleasure."You're a couple of swindlers!""You won't pay for honest
work."Samuel seized Dan by the shoulder, and attempted to obey orders, but our
hero doubled him up with a blow from his fist, and the luckless clerk,
faint and gasping, staggered and nearly fell.Dan stepped out on the sidewalk, and raising his hat, said, with mock
politeness, "Good-morning, gentlemen!"and walked away, leaving Gripp
and his assistant speechless with anger.[Illustration: "You're a couple of swindlers!""You won't
pay for honest work."When Dan's excitement was over, he felt that he had won a barren
victory.He had certainly been badly treated, and was justified in
yielding to his natural indignation; but for all that he had acted
unwisely.Nathan Gripp had not refused payment, he had only postponed it, and as
he had the decided advantage, which money always has when pitted against
labor, it would have been well to have been conciliatory.Now Gripp
would undoubtedly annoy him with further delay, and refuse to give Mrs."I suppose I've acted like a fool," said Dan to himself, with
compunction."My spunk is always getting the better of me, and I am
afraid poor mother will have to suffer.Well, there's no use crying for
spilt milk; I must see what I can do to mend matters."While these thoughts were passing through Dan's mind he found himself
passing the clothing establishment of Jackson & Co., who were special
rivals of Mr."Perhaps I can get some work for mother here," thought Dan."I'll try,
at any rate."He entered, and looking about him, attracted the attention of a clerk."Do you want something in our line to-day?""Yes, I do," said Dan, "if you're giving things away; but as I've got a
note of ten thousand dollars to meet to-morrow, I can't pay anything
out.""Your credit ought to be good," said the salesman, smiling, "but we
don't trust.""All right," said Dan; "I may as well proceed to business.One of our hands is sick, and if your
mother understands how to do the work, we may be able to give her some."The young man went to the rear of the store, and returned with the
proprietor.asked the proprietor, a big man, with
sandy whiskers.He was an Englishman, as any one might see, and a decided improvement on
Nathan Gripp, whom he cordially hated."Yes, sir; she has been making vests for the last two years.""No, sir; she has discharged him."He rather enjoyed this
allusion to his rival.He paid her starvation wages and made her wait for the money."I don't admire him much myself," said the Englishman."How much now did
he pay for vest-making?"There is so much competition that we
have to sell low.""Mother would rather make for you at eighteen cents than for Gripp for
twenty," said Dan.Jackson was pleased, but he said, by way of drawing out Dan:

"How do you know but I am a mean skinflint, too?""You don't look like one," said the boy."Joseph," said he, "have we any vests ready for making?"We have some bundles of half a dozen each.""Take this boy's name and address and give him one.My boy, we will pay
your mother twenty-five cents each, but we expect good work.""You will be satisfied, sir," said Dan, confidently, and he left the
store in excellent spirits."It's turned out right, after all," thought he; "but I am afraid we
shall miss the money old Gripp owed mother.I don't know how we are
going to pay the rent to-morrow.We shall be over two dollars short
unless something turns up."Dan carried the bundle of work home, and told his mother what had
happened.She was pleased with the increase of pay, but that was in the
future.It would be a week before she could collect any pay from Jackson
& Co., and the landlord would not wait."I wish I could think of some way of raising money," said Dan, putting
his face between his hands and looking thoughtful."If you only had some
jewels, mother, that we could raise money on now, we would be all
right.""I have nothing but my wedding-ring," said Mrs.Don't part with that unless you are obliged
to.""I would rather not, Dan, but if there is no other way----"

"There must be another way.Just don't think of
it any more, mother."Then we shall have all the forenoon to forage round in.It's only two
dollars and a half we want.I ought to be able to raise two dollars and
a half.""That is a great deal of money to us now, Dan.""I wonder whether Shorty wouldn't lend it to me?""He is a little hump-backed dwarf that keeps a cigar stand down on
Broadway, not far from Trinity Church.He has a good trade, and doesn't
waste his money."I hope he will be willing to grant your request, Dan."He's a good-natured fellow, Shorty is, and he'll do it,
if he can.I'll see him the first thing to-morrow morning."Somewhat cheered by Dan's confident tone, Mrs.Mordaunt went to sleep as
early as usual, forgetting the trouble possibly in store.The next morning, before selling his papers, Dan went round to Shorty's
stand."Good-morning, Dan," said the dwarf, in a singularly melodious voice."I am going to ask a favor of you," said Dan, abruptly."Our rent's due to-day, and we are two dollars and a half short.I can
make the fifty cents before noon.Can you lend me two dollars till I am
able to pay it?"To Dan's dismay Shorty shook his head."I wish I could, Dan, but there's something in the way.""If you're afraid I won't pay you back, you needn't think of that.I
never went back on a fellow that lent me money yet.""I am not afraid of trusting you, Dan, but I haven't got the money.""I understand," said Dan, coldly, for he suspected this to be a
subterfuge."No, you don't understand," said Shorty, eagerly."You think what I say
is a sham, but you wouldn't if you knew all.""If I knew all," repeated Dan, surprised."Yes, I shall have to tell you.I didn't mean to, but I don't want you
to misunderstand me.The fact is, Dan," Shorty added, sheepishly, "I've
got more than myself to provide for now.""I was married yesterday, Dan," said the cigar dealer, almost
apologetically, "and I've been buying furniture, and the fact is, I
haven't got a cent to spare.""Of course you haven't," said Dan."No, Dan, she's rather tall.Dan looked, and saw a tall woman, of twenty-five or thereabouts,
approaching the cigar stand.She was very plain, with a large mouth and
a long, aquiline nose."That's my wife," said the cigar dealer, regarding his tall partner with
evident pride."Julia, my dear, this is my friend, Dan Mordaunt.""Glad to see any friend of my husband," said the lady, in a deep, hoarse
voice, which might have been mistaken for a man's."So I will, thank you," answered Dan, surveying the female grenadier
with a wondering glance.-- Varick street, Dan, and I shall be very glad to see
you any evening."said Dan to himself, "that's the queerest match I ever
heard of.She might take Shorty up in her arms and carry him off.I
don't think he'll beat her very often," and Dan smiled at the thought.The morning wore away, and at eleven o'clock Dan had earned forty cents.There didn't seem to be much prospect of
raising the rent before twelve o'clock.CHAPTER V.

EFFECTING A LOAN.As Dan stood on the sidewalk with his bundle of papers, and only forty
cents toward the two dollars and a half required for the rent, he felt
like many a business man who has a note to meet and not enough money on
hand to pay it.Indeed, he was worse off, for generally business men
have friends who can help them with a temporary loan, but Dan's friends
were quite as poor as himself.One, however, Dick Stanton, a mere boy,
had the reputation of being more saving than his companions.It was
known that he had an account in the Bowery Savings Bank, and among the
street boys he was considered wealthy."Perhaps I can borrow two dollars of him," thought Dan, as Dick passed
him on his way to Canal street."I say, Dick," said Dan, "stop a minute."I want you to lend me two dollars.Our rent is due, and I can raise it
all but that."Dick shook his head, and was about to speak, when Dan said hurriedly,
for he felt that it was his last chance:

"You needn't be afraid of me, Dick; I'll pay you sure, and give you more
interest, too, than you get in the bank.""I haven't got any money in the bank, Dan.""You had last week," said Dan, suspiciously."So I had, but I haven't now.""You don't want to lend--that's what's the matter."I'm not a bit afraid of lending to you, but I
have lent my money already."asked Dan, ungrammatically, falling into a mistake made by
plenty of greater age and better experience than himself."Of course it
isn't any of my business," he added, "if you don't want to tell.""I don't mind telling you, Dan.She's got two
children, and a hard time to get along.Perhaps I shall never see it
again, but I couldn't refuse her.""Of course you couldn't," said Dan, heartily."You've done right, and
you won't be sorry for it.I wish I knew some way of making two dollars
before twelve o'clock.""Are you in urgent need of two dollars, my boy?"Dan turned, and met the face of the stranger introduced in the first
chapter."Have you been extravagant and run up bills, Dan?""No, sir; the only bill we have is the rent, and that comes due this
noon.""I thought you said you wanted to borrow _two_ dollars.""I've got four dollars toward it, sir.""Do you often fall behind when rent day comes, Dan?""No, sir; this is the first time in two years."Has business been duller than usual during
the last month?""Yes, sir, I think it has.There hasn't been as much news in the papers,
and my sales have fallen off."Mother has a dollar and twenty cents due her, and she can't collect
it."Gripp won't pay till she has made a full dozen.""I've a great mind to buy the debt of you.""I wish you would, sir," said Dan, eagerly."That would leave only sixty
cents short, for I shall make ten cents more before twelve o'clock, it's
likely."To put you quite at ease, I mean to lend
you five dollars, and help you collect your mother's bill.""You are very kind, sir," said Dan, surprised and grateful; "but I don't
need so much.""You may get short again when I am not here to assist you.""Are you not afraid I shall never pay you, sir?""That thought won't keep me awake nights," said the gentleman, laughing."You sha'n't lose anything by me, sir; I promise you that," said Dan,
earnestly."Then come into the hotel with me, and we will arrange the matter in a
business-like way."Dan followed his new friend into the Astor House, and up stairs into a
pleasant bedroom, which in its comfortable apartments reminded Dan of
the days before his father's failure."I wish I could live so again," he thought."I don't like a
tenement-house."Grant--for this was his name--took writing materials from his
valise, and seated himself at a table."I am going to draw up a note for you to sign," he said."I probably
understand better than you the necessary form."His pen ran rapidly over the paper, and in a minute or two he handed Dan
the following form of acknowledgment:


     "NEW YORK, Sept."For value received I promise to pay to Alexander Grant five
     dollars on demand with interest."Grant, "put your name at the bottom.""I added 'with interest,' but only as a form; I shall require none."interest make it
amount to in a year?""Five dollars and thirty cents," answered Dan, promptly.I see you have not forgotten what you learned in school.""I have ciphered through cube root," said Dan, with some pride."I am
not sure whether I remember that now, but I could do any sum in square
root.""It is a pity you could not have remained in school.""I should like to; but it's no use crying for spilt milk.""As long as you didn't spill it yourself," added Mr."No, sir; it was not my fault that I had to leave school."Grant folded up the note and carefully deposited it in his wallet."The next thing is to hand you the money," he said."Shall I give you a
five-dollar bill, or small bills?""Small bills, sir, if it is just as convenient."Grant placed in Dan's hands two two-dollar bills and a one.Gripp for the money
due your mother.It is as well to have it in your own handwriting.I
won't tell you how to write it."On the whole," said he, "I believe I will take you with me when I call
upon Mr.Can you call here at three o'clock this afternoon?"Gripp will be any more
polite to me than he was to you.""He will be surprised to see me in your company," said Dan, laughing."It is a good thing to surprise the enemy, Dan.said Dan to himself, as he emerged into the street."Who would have thought that a stranger would lend me so large a sum?Now, if I could only sell the four papers
I have left before twelve o'clock.I don't want to get stuck on them."In ten minutes he had sold his
papers, and turned his steps toward the humble home where his mother was
awaiting, not without anxiety, the visit of an unamiable landlord.Mordaunt looked up anxiously as Dan entered the room.She had
little expectation that he had been able in one morning to make up the
large deficiency in the sum reserved for the rent, but there was a
possibility, and she clung to that.Dan thought of postponing the
relation of his good news, but when he saw his mother's anxious face, he
felt that it would be cruel.So when she said, "Well, Dan?""I've got it, mother," he said."You see He hasn't forgotten us," said Dan, gleefully."No, my boy, it is a rebuke to my momentary want of faith.How could you
raise so large a sum?Surely you did not earn it in one forenoon?"I'm not smart enough to earn two dollars
before twelve o'clock.""But you've got the money, Dan?""Look at this, mother," and Dan displayed the bills."I didn't know we had a friend left, able or willing to lend us that
sum.""I borrowed them of Alexander Grant, of St.Louis, and gave my note for
them," answered Dan, in a tone of some importance."He's a new friend of mine, mother.I haven't known him over twenty-four
hours.As the old friends have treated us so badly, I'm goin' in for new
ones.""He's very kind to a stranger, Dan.Heaven will reward him, I am sure."I should enjoy helping
those who needed it.If I ever get rich--though it doesn't look much
like it now--I will do all the good I can.I wonder rich men don't do it
oftener.""It springs from thoughtlessness sometimes, Dan.""And from selfishness pretty often," added Dan, whose views of human
nature were considerably less favorable than they had been in his more
prosperous days."A good many men are like Tom Carver, as he is now and
will be when he is grown up.""Perhaps there are more good and generous men than we suppose, Dan,"
urged his mother, who liked to think well of her fellow-beings.Just you step into
the bedroom, mother."Mordaunt had no desire to meet Mr.Grab, but she was a little
afraid of Dan's impetuous temper."You will treat him respectfully, won't you, Dan?"she urged, as she
turned to go into the adjoining room."I'll treat him with all the respect he deserves, mother," he answered.Mordaunt looked a little doubtful, for she understood Dan, but did
not say more, for Mr."Don't come out, whatever you hear, mother," said Dan, in a low voice."I'll come out all right, though I shall tantalize him a little at
first."Dan called out, in a loud, clear tone.The door opened, and a thin, undersized man, with bushy red hair and the
look of a cross mastiff, entered the room.Before his entrance Dan had seated himself in the plain wooden
rocking-chair with his feet on a cricket.He looked quite easy and
unconcerned."You might call me _Mr._ Grab," returned the landlord, angrily."I've no objection, I'm sure, Mr."I am perfectly well, and I am not yellow at all."I wouldn't do that for a cent, Mr.I am glad you feel well,
though you ain't looking so.It's very friendly of you to come round to
see me and mother.""She is engaged just now, and won't have the pleasure of seeing you.""I've seen more of you than I want to already," said Grab."That isn't talking like a friend, Mr.Grab," said Dan, "when I'm so
glad to see you."Of course I have come on business, and you know very well what that
business is, you young monkey."It isn't about the
rent, is it?""Oh, dear, how could I have forgotten that it was rent-day," said Dan,
with well-feigned confusion.He concluded that he wasn't going to collect
the rent, and that always chafed him."It's your business to know when rent-day comes," he said, bringing down
his fist with such emphasis on the table that he hurt his knuckles, to
Dan's secret delight."Please don't break the table, Grab," said Dan.said Grab, surveying his red knuckles."We haven't got any blasting powder, and I don't think it would be a
very interesting experiment.It might blow you up, for you are nearest
to it.""Have done with this trifling, boy," said the landlord."I am afraid you got out of the wrong end of the bed this morning, Mr."Look here, boy," said the landlord, savagely, "do you know what I am
tempted to do?""I am strongly tempted to chastise you for your impudence."Dan looked critically at the small, thin form, and secretly decided that
Mr.Grab would find it difficult to carry out his threat."I don't believe I shall sleep any
to-night."Grab made a motion to pound on the table again, but he looked at his
red knuckles and wisely forbore."I can't waste any more time," he said."You must pay your rent, or turn
out.The rent must be paid to-day, or out you go.""Really, he
ought not to tease the poor man so.He has such a bad temper, he might
hurt Dan."As soon as he pays her, I will call
round at your office and pay you.""I won't let you stay here another night, and
I mean to have security for my money, too."So saying, the landlord seized the bundle of vests which lay on the
table beside him.He sprang to his feet, his eyes flashing with anger."Then pay me my rent," said the landlord, recoiling a little."Put down that bundle before you say another word about rent.It isn't
my mother's or mine."What do you mean, boy, by your impudence?"demanded the landlord, a
little uneasily."I mean that if you take that bundle from the room, I shall put you in
charge of the nearest policeman on a charge of stealing.""That is nonsense," said Grab; but he looked nervous, and laid down the
bundle."Now, as I don't want any more of your
company, I'll pay the rent, if you'll give me a receipt.""It isn't my business what you think.There, that is settled, and now,
Mr.Grab, I have the honor of wishing you good-evening.I hope you won't
hurt your knuckles again."Grab left the room, inwardly wishing that he could wring Dan's neck.asked his mother, reproachfully, as she
re-entered the room."Didn't he turn out the poor Donovans on
a cold day last winter?"Not as long as we pay the rent."Punctually at three o'clock Dan knocked at the door of Mr.Grant's room
in the Astor House.That gentleman looked at his watch as he admitted our hero."You are punctual to the minute," he said."I'll tell you why," answered Dan, smiling."I always keep it at
Tiffany's.I don't dare to carry it for fear it will get out of order.""You ought to have a watch," said Mr."Then I could be sure to keep my business
appointments.Now I have to depend on the City Hall clock.I'd rather
look at it than carry it round.""Well, Dan, do you think Mr.He'll think you are going to buy some
clothes.I don't think he'll be very happy to see me.""He must see us both, or neither."Yes, sir--good enough for me.I don't think you would like to patronize
his establishment.""By the way, Dan, you have given me an order for money, and I have not
handed you the equivalent.""You may not get the money, sir.""I will make the effort at any rate.By the way, Dan, that coat of yours
is getting shabby.""It is the best I have, sir.Boys in my business don't have to dress
much."Please hand me my hat, and we will start."One or two of Dan's associates
whom they encountered on the way, were surprised to see him walking on
terms of apparent friendly companionship with a well-to-do stranger, but
decided that Dan was probably acting as his guide.Gripp standing as usual in the door-way of his shop
watching for customers.He did not at first observe Dan, but his
attention was drawn to Mr."Walk in, sir," he said, obsequiously."You will find what you want
here.Styles fashionable, and as for prices--we defy competition."Alexander Grant paused, and looked critically about him.He understood
very well the sort of establishment he was about to enter, and would not
have thought of doing so but in Dan's interests.He stepped over the threshold, and Dan was about to follow, when the
eagle eye of Mr."Don't you come round here
any more."Dan did not answer, for he knew Mr.Grant turned back, and said, quietly:

"To whom are you speaking, sir?""I beg your pardon, sir--it's that boy.""Then, sir, you will oblige me by stopping at once.That boy is in my
company and under my protection."Nathan Gripp stared as if transfixed.He was here
yesterday, and acted outrageously.He is in my company, and if I enter the
store he will.""Oh, of course, if he's with you he can come in.Samuel, show the
gentleman what he wants."Dan smiled, and nothing but a sense of his own interest prevented Mr.asked the callow young man named Samuel,
glaring at Dan in vivid remembrance of the blow which had doubled him
up."Have you any coats and vests that will fit this young gentleman?"repeated Samuel, mechanically, glancing at Dan in
silent hatred."That means me, Samuel," said Dan, mischievously."Samuel is an old
friend of mine, Mr."I think we can fit him," said Samuel, by no means relishing the task of
waiting upon his young opponent."Take off your coat, young feller.""I'll be ---- if I do," muttered the young man.Dan took off his coat, and tried on the one submitted to his inspection.He afterward tried on the vest, and they proved to be a good fit."Yes, sir, they fit as well as if they had been made for me.""What is the price of these articles, young man?""He'll take eight," suggested Dan, in a low voice.Grant knew well enough the ways of Chatham street merchants to
appreciate the suggestion."That is too high," he said, quietly.Samuel, who was trained to read customers, after a glance at Mr.Grant's
face, prepared to reduce the price."We might say eleven," he said, meditatively."You don't want us to give 'em away?"said Samuel, in the tone of one
whose reasonable demands had been objected to."There is no fear of that, I apprehend," returned Mr."I've no objection, I'm sure," remarked Dan, on his own account."I'd make a few remarks to you, young feller, if you were alone," he
read in the eyes of the indignant salesman, and Dan enjoyed the
restraint which he knew Samuel was putting upon himself."You are still asking too much," said the customer."The work didn't cost you much, I presume.""We pay the highest prices for work in this establishment, sir," said
Samuel, hastily."They pay twenty cents apiece for
making vests.""We pay more than that to our best hands," said Samuel."You told me you never paid more," retorted Dan."Young man," said he, "I will give you eight dollars for the clothes."As the regular price was eight dollars--when they couldn't get any
more--Samuel felt authorized to conclude the bargain without consulting
Mr."No," said Dan, "I'll wear 'em.Samuel felt it derogatory to his dignity to obey the orders of our hero,
but there was no alternative."Now write me a receipt for the price," said Mr."I have an order upon you for the balance," he said."I don't understand," ejaculated Samuel."Your principal owes my young friend, or his mother, one dollar and
twenty cents for work.This you will receive as part of the price.""We can't take the order, sir," he said."The boy's money is not yet
due.""Yes, sir; but it is our rule not to pay till a whole dozen is
delivered.""Then it is a rule which you must break," said Mr.Nathan Gripp did not like to lose the sale on the one hand, or abdicate
his position on the other."Tell your mother," he said to Dan, "that when she has finished another
half-dozen vests I will pay her the whole."He reflected that the stranger would be gone, and Dan would be in his
power."Thank you," said Dan, "but mother's agreed to work for Jackson."Then you'll have to wait for your pay," said Mr."Don't you care to sell this suit?""Yes, sir, but under the circumstances we must ask all cash.""Then I don't think we care to sell," said Gripp, allowing his anger to
overcome his interest.I think, Dan, we can find quite as good a bargain at
Jackson's.Gripp, do I understand that you decline to pay this
bill?""I will pay when the other half-dozen vests are made," said Gripp,
stubbornly.The bill is mine, and it is with me you
have to deal.Settle the bill now, or I shall
immediately put it in a lawyer's hands, who will know how to compel you
to pay it.""Take this gentleman's money, Samuel," said Gripp, in a tone of
annoyance.Dan walked out of the store better
dressed than he had been since the days of his prosperity."By continuing to care for your mother, my lad.You are lucky to have a
mother living.Now, my lad, what do you
think of my success in collecting bills?""You were too many for old Gripp, sir."He doesn't deserve to, for he grows rich by defrauding the poor who
work for him."Opposite the City Hall Park Dan and his friend separated."I shall not see you again, my boy," said Mr.Grant, "for I take the
evening train."That's a good man," said Dan, as he wended his way homeward."If there
were more such, it would be good for poor people like mother and me.If
I ever get rich, I mean to help along those that need it."MIKE RAFFERTY'S TRICK.Grant had lent him, and the
result was that for two months he was comparatively easy in his
circumstances.His mother earned five cents more daily, on account of
the higher price she received for work, and though this was a trifle, it
was by no means to be despised where the family income was so small as
in the case of the Mordaunts."Mother," said he, "I suppose I ought to be contented with earning
enough to pay our expenses, but I should like to be saving something.""Yes, Dan, it would be pleasant.But we ought to be thankful for what we
are now receiving.""But, mother, suppose I should fall sick?"Don't mention such a thing, Dan," she said."But it might happen, for all that.""Don't be frightened, mother," answered Dan, laughing."I'm as strong as
a horse, and can eat almost as much.Still, you know, we would feel
safer to have a little money in the savings-bank.""There isn't much chance of that, Dan, unless we earn more than we do
now."Well, I suppose there is no use thinking of it.By
the way, mother, you've got enough money on hand to pay the rent
to-morrow, haven't you?""Yes, Dan, and a dollar over."The door of the room was partly open, and the last part of the
conversation was heard by Mike Rafferty, the son of the tenant who
occupied the room just over the Mordaunts.He was a ne'er-do-well, who
had passed more than one term of imprisonment at Blackwell's Island.His
mother was an honest, hard-working washerwoman, who toiled early and
late to support herself and her three children.Mike might have given
her such assistance that she could have lived quite comfortably, for her
own earnings were by no means inconsiderable.Her wash-tub paid her much
more than Mrs.Mordaunts needle could possibly win, and she averaged a
dollar a day where her more refined neighbor made but twenty-five
cents.But Mike, instead of helping, was an additional burden.He got
his meals regularly at home, but contributed scarcely a dollar a month
to the common expenses.He was a selfish rowdy, who was likely to belong
permanently to the shiftless and dangerous classes of society.Mike had from time to time made approaches to intimacy with Dan, who was
nearly two years younger, but Dan despised him for his selfishly
burdening his mother with his support, and didn't encourage him.Naturally, Mike hated Dan, and pronounced him "stuck up" and proud,
though our hero associated familiarly with more than one boy ranking no
higher in the social scale than Mike Rafferty.Only the day before, Mike, finding himself out of funds, encountering
Dan on the stairs, asked for the loan of a quarter."I have no money to spare," answered Dan."You've got money, Dan; I saw you take out some a minute ago.""Yes, I've got the money, but I won't lend it.""You're a mane skinflint," said Mike, provoked."Because you've got the money, and you won't lend it.""What do you want to do with it?""I want to go to the Old Bowery to-night, if you must know.""If you wanted it for your mother I might have lent it to you, though I
need all I can earn for my own mother.""It's for my mother I want it, thin," said Mike."I guess I won't go to
the theater to-night."Your mother would never see the color of it.""Won't you lend me, thin?"If you want money, why don't you earn it, as I do?"If you go to work and sell papers or black boots, you
will be able to help your mother and pay your way to the theater
yourself.""Kape your advice to yourself," said Mike, sullenly."You'd rather have my money," said Dan, good-humoredly.I'll be _mane_, then.""I'd like to put a head on you," muttered Mike."Oh, you think you're mighty smart wid your jokes," said Mike.Dan smiled and walked off, leaving Mike more his enemy than ever.Mordaunt say that she had more than
the rent already saved up.He knew that it
must amount to several dollars, and this he felt would keep him in
cigarettes and pay for evenings at the theater for several days."I wish I had it," he said to himself."I wonder where the ould woman
kapes it."The more Mike thought of it the more he coveted this money, and he set
to work contriving means to get possession of it.About three o'clock in the afternoon he knocked at Mrs.It's bad news I bring you about Dan."she exclaimed, her heart
giving a great bound."He's been run over, ma'am, by a hoss, in front of the Astor House, and
they took him into the drug store at the corner."I guess he's broke his leg," said Mike.Mordaunt, trembling with apprehension, her faltering
limbs almost refusing to bear her weight, was on her way to the Astor
House.As Mike had calculated, she did not stop to lock the door.The young scape-grace entered the deserted room, rummaged about till he
found the scanty hoard reserved for the landlord, and then went off
whistling."Now I'll have a bully time," he said to himself."Didn't I fool the
ould woman good?"MIKE'S THEFT IS DISCOVERED.Dan was standing in front of the Astor House, talking to a boy
acquaintance, when his mother tottered up to him in a state of great
nervous agitation."Why, mother, what's the matter?"It occurred to him that his mother must
have lost her mind."Yes; they told me you were run over, and had your leg broken.""Then I wish I had him here," said Dan, indignantly; "I'd let him know
whether my leg is broken or not."Haven't you been run over, then?""Not that I know of, and I guess it couldn't be done without my knowing
it.""I don't know how I
got here, I was so agitated.""When did Mike Rafferty tell you this cock-and-bull story, mother?"He said you had been taken into a drug store,
and wanted me to come right over.""It's a mean trick he played on you, mother," said Dan, indignantly."I
don't see what made him do it.""He must have meant it as a joke.""I don't mind it now, Dan, since I have you safe.He didn't know how much he was distressing me."You may forgive him if you want to; I
sha'n't."I feel a good deal happier than I did when I
was hurrying over here."I have sold my papers, and sha'n't work any
more this afternoon.I hope I can come across
him soon.""I left him at the door of our room.""Did you lock the door when you came away, mother?""There isn't much to take, Dan," said Mrs."We shall be in a pretty pickle if that is lost.""You don't think Mike would take it do you, Dan?""I think he would if he knew where to find it.""I wish I had brought it with me," said Mrs.Mordaunt, in a tone of
anxiety."Don't fret, mother; I guess it's all right.""Perhaps you had better go home at once without waiting for me, Dan."In my pocket-book, in the drawer of the work-table."Well, I'll be off, and will meet
you at the room."Dan was not long in reaching his humble home.The more he thought of it,
the more he distrusted Mike, and feared that he might have had a
sinister design in the deception he had practiced upon his mother.To
lose the rent money would be a serious matter.Grab hated him, he
knew full well, and would show no mercy, while in the short time
remaining it would be quite impossible to make up the necessary sum.Dan sprang up the stairs, several at a bound, and made his way at once
to the little work-table.He pulled the drawer open without ceremony,
and in feverish haste rummaged about until, to his great joy, he found
the pocket-book."It's all right, after all," he said."Mike isn't so bad as I thought
him."He opened the pocket-book, and his countenance fell.There was a
twenty-five cent scrip in one of the compartments, and that was all."He's stolen the money, after all," he said, his heart sinking."What
are we going to do now?""That is all that is left," answered Dan, holding up the scrip."Mike could not be wicked enough to take it."You don't know him as I do, mother.He's a mean
thief, and he sent you off to have a clear field."I couldn't think of that, or anything else, Dan, when I thought you
were hurt."Grab will be angry when he finds we can't pay
him.""I will try to find Mike; and if I do, I will get the money if I can.Dan went up stairs at once, and knocked at Mrs.She came to the door, her arms dripping with suds, for she had been
washing."And how is your mother to-day?"asked Dan, abruptly, too impatient to answer the question."No; he went out quarter of an hour ago.""Did he tell you where he was going, Mrs.He said he was going over to Brooklyn to see if he could
get a job, shure.I'm sorry to tell you that Mike has played a
bad trick on my mother.""Oh, whirra, whirra, what a bye he is!""He's
always up to something bad.Sorra bit of worruk he does, and I at the
wash-tub all day long.""He's a bad son to you, Mrs.And what kind of trick has
he played on your good mother?""He told her that I had been run over and broken my leg.Of course she
went out to find me, thinking it was all true, and while she was away he
took the money from her pocket-book."Some mothers would have questioned this statement, but Mrs.Rafferty
knew to her cost that Mike was capable of stealing, having been
implicated in thefts on several occasions.I don't know what to do wid him, shure.""It was the money we were to pay our rent with to-morrow," continued
Dan."I wish I could make it up to you, Dan, dear.Rafferty, but you ought not to make it
up.Do you think he has really gone to
Brooklyn.""He might have done it as a blind, just to put me on the wrong scent."Rafferty, I can't stop any longer.He went down stairs and told his mother what he had discovered or failed
to discover."Don't wait supper for me, mother," he said."I'm going in search of
Mike.""You won't fight with him, Dan?"I am not
going to submit to the loss without trying to get the money back, you
may be sure of that."So Dan went down stairs, considerably perplexed in mind.Mike was sure
to keep out of the way for a time at least, anticipating that Dan would
be upon his track.While our hero was searching for him, he would have
plenty of opportunities of spending the money of which he had obtained
unlawful possession.To punish him without regaining the contents of the
lost pocket-book would be an empty triumph.In the street below Dan
espied Terence Quinn, an acquaintance of Mike."I saw him only a few minutes ago.""I'll tell you where he'll be this evening.""He's going to the Old Bowery, and I'm goin' wid him.""He didn't tell me," said Terence.I'm sure of it now," said Dan to himself."I
wish I knew where to find him."CHAPTER X.

DAN AS A DETECTIVE.Dan quickly decided that if Mike had been going to Brooklyn, he would
not have announced it under the circumstances."He meant to send me there on a wild-goose chase," he reflected."I am
not quite so green as he takes me to be."Dan could not decide as easily where Mike had gone.Hood says in his
poem of "The Lost Heir,"


     "A boy as is lost in London streets is like a needle in a bundle
       of hay."A hunt for a boy in the streets of New York is about equally hopeless."I'll just stroll round a little," he said to himself.Dan bent his steps toward the Courtlandt-street Ferry."Perhaps Mike has gone to Jersey City," he said to himself."Anyway,
I'll go over there."Six cents would defray Dan's expenses
both ways, and he was willing to incur this expense.He meant to look
about him, as something might turn up by which he could turn an honest
penny.Near him in the cabin of the ferry-boat sat a gentleman of middle age,
who seemed overloaded with baggage.He had two heavy carpet-bags, a
satchel, and a bundle, at which he looked from time to time with a
nervous and uncomfortable glance.When the boat touched shore he tried
to gather his various pieces of luggage, but with indifferent success.Noticing his look of perplexity, Dan approached him, and said,
respectfully:

"Can't I assist you, sir?""I wish you would, my boy," said the gentleman, relieved.I'll take one of the carpet-bags and the satchel, if
you like.""Do you know the wharf of the Cunard steamers?""Not more than five or six minutes' walk," answered Dan."Can you help me as far as that with my luggage?""I will make it worth your while, and you will be doing me a great favor
besides.I was brought down to the ferry, but the rascally hackman
demanded five dollars more to carry me across and land me at the Cunard
pier.He thought I would have to submit to this imposition, but I was so
indignant that I tried to handle all my luggage myself.I don't know how
I should have managed without you.""I won't charge you so much, sir," said Dan, smiling."It isn't for the money I cared so much as for the imposition.I would
rather pay you ten dollars than the hackman five.""Be careful, sir," said Dan, smiling, "or I may take advantage of your
liberal offer.""You don't look like a boy that would take advantage of a traveler.""You can't judge from appearances, sir.I have been robbed of six
dollars to-day, and I might try to make it up that way.""Was it all the money your mother had?""How did you happen to be coming across the ferry?"By this time they were in sight of the Cunard wharf."Were you ever on a Cunard steamer?""Help me on board with my luggage, and I will show you about.""I thought the steamers generally left in the morning," said Dan."So they do; but to-day the tide did not serve till later."Stevens down below with his luggage, and assisted him in
storing them in his stateroom.He surveyed with interest the cabin, the
deck, the dining-saloon, and the various arrangements."Well," said the gentleman, smiling, "how do you like it?""Do you think you would like to be going with me?""Yes, sir, but for my mother.""Of course, it won't do to desert her; otherwise I might be tempted to
make you an offer.I am sure you would be very useful to me.""I should like it very much, if mother did not need me."Stevens, and remained till visitors were
warned that it was time to go ashore."I must go, sir," he said.Stevens drew a five-dollar bill from his vest pocket and handed it
to Dan."I haven't any change, sir," said Dan."None is required," said the gentleman, smiling."Do you really mean to give me five dollars, sir?""That is what the hackman wanted to charge me.""It was too much for him; it is not too much for you, if I am willing to
give it to you.""You are very kind, sir," said Dan, almost doubting the reality of his
good fortune."It will prove that I spoke truly when I said I didn't care for the
amount of money, only for the imposition.I am really very glad to give
it to you.Dan shook it heartily, and, wishing him a pleasant
voyage, descended the gangplank."That is almost as much as Mike robbed me of," he said to himself."How
lucky I came over to Jersey City!Now, if I could only get back part of
the money Mike robbed me of, I should be the better off for his mean
trick."He had been so fortunate
that he decided to spend the rest of the afternoon as he liked.He walked on for ten minutes, Mike being temporarily out of his mind,
when his attention was suddenly drawn to him.Just in front of him he
saw Mike himself swaggering along, with a ten-cent cigar in his mouth,
and both hands thrust deep in his trousers pockets.He was strolling
along in fancied security, not dreaming of the near presence of the boy
whom he had so meanly robbed.Dan's eyes sparkled when he recognized his enemy, and hastening his
pace, he put his hand on Mike's shoulder.Mike turned quickly, and his countenance changed when he saw Dan."Anyway, he
can't prove anything."What brings _you_ over here, Mike?""I'm looking for a job," said Mike."You look like it," retorted Dan, "with both hands in your pockets and
a cigar in your mouth!"I don't know," answered Mike, with unblushing falsehood."A man gave it
to me for holdin' his hoss."Mike was never at a loss for a plausible lie."Did they let you over the ferry free, then?""Oh, I had money enough for that.""Then how are you going to take Terence Quinn to the theater to-night?"Even Mike's brazen effrontery was hardly prepared to meet this
unexpected question."Terence told me you had invited him."said Mike, his self-assurance returning."Look here, Mike Rafferty," said Dan, out of patience; "that won't go
down!I know where you got the money you were
going to treat him with.""It's the truth, and if you don't hand over what's left without making
any more trouble, I'll have you arrested."We're in Jersey----"

"I shall have you arrested as soon as you get home.""I didn't take the money," said Mike, sullenly."You did, and you know it," said Dan, firmly."Give me what you have
left, and I'll make no trouble about it.If you don't, you're booked for
another term at the island."Mike tried to save his ill-gotten gains, but Dan was persistent, and
finally extracted from him four dollars and a half.The rest Mike
pretended he had spent.He was sly enough, however, to have saved enough
to take him to the Old Bowery.On the whole, Dan was satisfied, considering the five dollars he had
received on the Cunard steamer, but he could not forbear giving Mike a
farewell shot."How did it happen, Mike, that you took the Jersey Ferry to Brooklyn?""That is my first appearance as a detective," thought Dan.It was only five o'clock when Dan, returning from Jersey City, found
himself again in front of the Astor House.I've
made enough to satisfy me for one day."Dan stood at the corner of Vesey street, glancing at the hurrying
crowds.He rather enjoyed his temporary freedom from business cares.He had made a good day's work, the morrow's rent was provided for, and
he felt like a gentleman of leisure.All at once his attention was drawn to a low sob.It proceeded from a
little flower-girl of ten years, who usually stood near the hotel.asked Dan, calling her by her name, for the
little flower-girl was one of his acquaintances."Haven't you sold as
many bouquets as usual?""Yes," said Fanny, pausing in her sobs, "I've sold more.""No, but a young man passed a bad half-dollar on me."He did not need to ring it, for it was dull in
appearance and unmistakably bad.A young man came up and bought a five-cent bouquet, and gave
me this to change.""Didn't you see that it was bad?""I didn't look at it till afterward."So you gave him forty-five cents in good money, Fanny?""Yes," said the little girl, again beginning to sob."How many bouquets had you sold?""Then you have less money than when you began?""Do you think the fellow knew the piece was bad?""No, I saw him turn down Fulton street.""Give me the bad piece, and I'll go after him.Dan seized the money, and proceeded toward Fulton Ferry at a half run."I hope he won't have taken the boat," he said to himself."If he has I
shall lose him."Dan nearly overthrew an apple woman's stand not far from the ferry, but
did not stop to apologize.He ran into a fat gentleman who looked
daggers at him, but kept on.Breathless he paid his ferriage, and just succeeded in catching a boat
as it was leaving the New York pier.Thus far he had not seen the young man of whom he was in search.I'll go forward," said Dan to himself.He walked through the ladies' cabin, and stepped out on the forward
deck.The boat was crowded, for it was at the time when men who live in
Brooklyn, but are employed in New York, are returning to their homes.Dan looked about him for a time without success, but all at once his
eyes lighted up.Just across the deck, near the door of the gentlemen's
cabin, stood a young man with red hair, holding a small bouquet in his
hand.His face was freckled, his eyes small, and he looked capable of
meanness.Of course appearances are often deceptive, but not unfrequently a man's
character can be read upon his face."That's the fellow that cheated poor Fanny, I'll bet a hat," Dan decided
within himself.He immediately crossed to the other side of the deck.The red-headed young man was talking to another young man of about the
same age."Where did you get that bouquet, Sanderson?""Bought it of a little girl in front of the Astor House," answered
Sanderson."I suppose it is meant for some young lady," suggested the other."Maybe it is," answered Sanderson, with a grin.Dan thought it was about time to come to business.He touched the red-haired young man on the arm."You bought that bouquet of a girl near the Astor House," said Dan.asked Sanderson, uneasily, for he had a suspicion of
what was coming."You gave her a bogus half-dollar in payment," continued Dan."I am sorry I cannot accommodate you," said Dan, "but I want you to give
me a good piece for this first.""I never saw that half-dollar before," said Sanderson."Perhaps you can prove that before the court," said Dan."I mean that you have passed counterfeit money, and unless you give me a
good piece for it I will give you in charge as soon as we reach the
pier," said Dan, firmly.Sanderson looked about him, and saw that the boy's charge was believed."Fanny is a poor girl," he said."I found her crying over her loss, for
it was more than all the money she had taken to-day.""Yes, I am," said Dan, stoutly."This is a put-up job between you two," said Sanderson."Gentlemen," said Dan, turning and appealing to the passengers near him,
"this young man has passed a bad fifty-cent piece on a poor flower-girl.exclaimed half a dozen, and several cried "shame!"with
looks of scorn and disgust directed toward the young man with red hair."I don't believe a word of it," he ejaculated, in a rage."But I'll give you the money to get rid of you," and he threw a
half-dollar at Dan with a look very far from amiable."Thank you, sir; here's your money," said Dan.Though Sanderson had disclaimed all knowledge of the bogus half-dollar,
he took it and put it carefully in his pocket."Keep it to pay your washerwoman with," said a jeering voice.It was a young fellow in the garb of a workman who spoke.The boat touched the pier, and Sanderson was only too glad to hurry away
from the unfriendly crowd.cried a keen-looking businessman, addressing Dan."How did you discover that this fellow was the one that passed the
coin."He placed in Dan's hands a card bearing the firm's name


     BARTON & ROGERS,
     Commission Merchants,
               No.Dan was so pleased at having recovered Fanny's money that he gave
little thought to this last incident, though it was destined to exert an
important influence on his fortunes.He took the same boat back to New
York, and hurried to the Astor House.Little Fanny, the flower-girl, with a sad look upon her face, was still
standing in her wonted place."I've got your money back, Fanny," said Dan."Yes; I made the fellow give it up.""Oh, how kind you are, Dan!"There was a listener to what passed between the two children.A tall
lady, standing at the corner of the street, regarded them attentively.She was evidently revolving some plan in her head.As Dan was about
turning away, she placed her hand on his arm."Young man," she said, "I want to speak to you.""All right, ma'am," said Dan, surprised.Dan thought it probable that the lady who accosted him might wish to
send him on an errand, and his surprise vanished.She was tall, slender,
and grave in appearance."Are you an only child, or have you brothers and sisters?""There is only one of me," answered Dan, humorously."If I were not, I would not sell papers for a living.""Yes," answered Dan, beginning to be tired of satisfying what might be
only curiosity on the part of the lady.She noticed at once the change
in his manner."I am not making these inquiries out of curiosity," she said, quickly."I have an object in what I ask.""All right, ma'am," he said; "I am ready to answer.""Are you at leisure for an hour or two?""I suppose mother will be worried if I don't come home to supper," he
said, hesitating."Can't you send her a message not to expect you?Does this little girl
know where you live?""Little girl," she said, "go at once and tell this boy's mother that he
will not be home till nine o'clock.The little girl's eyes sparkled with joy as the lady placed fifty cents
in her hand.As for Dan, he was puzzled to conjecture what the lady could want of
him.What would justify such a handsome compensation to Fanny merely to
explain his absence to his mother?"Now," said the lady, "if you will hail the next stage we will go up
town."Soon they were rattling over the pavements
through thronged Broadway.It was two years since Dan had been in a
Broadway stage.He could not afford to pay ten cents for a ride, but
when it was absolutely necessary rode in a horse-car for half price.Dan looked about him to see if he knew any one in the stage.Nearly
opposite sat his former schoolmate, Tom Carver, with a young lady at his
side.Their glances met, and Dan saw Tom's lip curl with scorn.Of
course he did not betray any mark of recognition."I like riding in a Broadway stage," he heard the young lady say."There
is more to see as you go along."Not always," said Tom, with a significant glance at Dan.Dan felt indignant, but was too proud to show it."The price excludes the lower classes from using the stage," said the
young lady."It ought to, but I have seen a newsboy in a stage.""How can they afford to pay ten cents for riding?""I give it up," said Tom, shrugging his shoulders.The lady who was with Dan noticed the direction of Tom Carver's look."Yes," answered Dan, "I used to know him.""I don't," said Dan, promptly, returning Tom Carver's stare.Tom could not help hearing this conversation, and learned for the first
time that Dan and the handsomely dressed lady beside him were in
company."What can they have to do with each other?""She can't be a relation--she is too handsomely dressed."At this moment the young lady beside him dropped her handkerchief.Before Tom could stoop to pick it up Dan had handed it to her with a
polite bow."Thank you," said the young lady, with a pleasant smile."You needn't have troubled yourself," said Tom Carver, irritated."This
young lady is under _my_ charge.""It is no trouble, I assure you," answered Dan."He is very polite," said the young lady, in a low voice, "and very
good-looking, too," she added, with a second look at Dan."He is only a common newsboy," said Tom, not relishing Julia Grey's
tribute to a boy he disliked."I can't help what he is," said the young lady, independently; "he looks
like a gentleman."Dan could not help catching the drift of their conversation, and his
face flushed with pleasure, for Julia was a very pretty girl, but not
being addressed to him, he could not take notice of it otherwise."He lives at the Five Points somewhere," muttered Tom.The young lady seemed rather amused at Tom's discomposure, and only
smiled in reply.The stage kept on till it reached Madison square."Will you pull the strap opposite the Fifth Avenue Hotel?"He got out first, and helped his companion out."Follow me into the hotel," she said.asked the lady, as they ascended the stairs."I needn't ask if you have a good mother?""One of the best," said Dan, promptly."You look like a well-bred boy, and I infer that your mother is a lady.Dan followed her, wondering, and she signed to him to take a seat on the
sofa beside her."You have already told me that you have no sister," she began."Do you think your mother would enjoy the society of a little girl?""I have a little girl under my charge--my niece--from whom, for reasons
unnecessary to state, I am obliged to part for a time.Do you think your
mother would be willing to take charge of her?Of course I would make it
worth her while.""I am sure she would like it," said Dan, for he saw at a glance that
this would be a very desirable arrangement for them."Then you feel authorized to accept the charge in your mother's name?"Your mother would be willing to
teach her until such time as she may be old enough to go to school?""I think little girls are best off at home until the age of seven or
eight.""We live in a poor room and a poor neighborhood."I shall pay you enough to enable you to
take better rooms.""I may as well be explicit," said the lady."I propose to pay fifty
dollars a month for my ward's board, including, of course, your mothers
care.""I am afraid it won't be worth it," said Dan, frankly."If Althea is well cared for, as I am sure she will be, I shall have no
fear of that.Let me add that I shall allow your mother ten dollars per
month extra for the child's clothing--say sixty dollars in all.For the
present that will probably be enough.""Oh, yes, I should think so," said Dan."When do you want her to come to
us?"I must leave New York early to-morrow.In fact, I leave
the city by an early train.""She would have to come to our poor lodgings," said Dan, hesitatingly.To-morrow you can secure rooms up town.""Yes, ma'am, I will."Now," said the lady, rising, "since the matter is settled, come up
stairs with me, and I will show you the child."Dan followed the lady up stairs, feeling as if he were in a dream, but a
very pleasant one.As the lady entered the room a little girl, with an expression of joy,
ran from the window from which she had been looking, and took her hand."I'm so glad you've got home, auntie," she said."I staid away longer than I intended, Althea," said the lady."I was
afraid you would feel lonely."I wanted to go out into the hall and play with a
little girl that lives in the next room, but I thought you wouldn't find
me."I have brought you a playfellow, Althea."This drew the little girl's attention to Dan.Unlike most girls of her
age, she was not bashful.Are you going to live with us, Dan?""You are coming to live with me," said Dan, smiling.You are nice-looking," said Althea, in a
matter-of-fact tone.He found the compliment agreeable, though it came from a
little girl."So are you, Althea," he said."I don't think I am," said Althea."I've black hair, and my skin is
dark.You have nice brown hair, and are whiter than I am.""Some like dark people best," suggested Dan.I asked auntie to buy me a big cake of soap to wash the brown
off, but it wouldn't come."He thought the bright, vivacious little face, with the
brilliant dark eyes, pretty, though Althea did not."You will like to live with Dan, my dear?""I have got to go away--on business.""I don't want you to go away, auntie," she said."Dan and I can't live
alone.""Dan has a mother, who will be very good to you."asked Althea, brightening up."And you will come to see me some time, auntie?""Then I will go with Dan;" and the little girl placed her hand
confidingly in that of our hero.Dan thought it would be pleasant for him to have a little sister, and he
knew that it would brighten his mother's existence."Shall we go now, madam?"She drew from her pocket a wallet
containing a considerable sum of money."I will hand you two months' payment in advance," she said, "and
afterward I will remit you monthly, or direct you where to call for
money.Two months at fifty dollars will amount to one hundred, and
twenty more for Althea's dress will make it up to a hundred and twenty."Whenever I have any to be careful about," answered Dan."I hope you will be comfortably provided from this time.There is a
little trunk of Althea's clothes in the trunk-room below.I will write
you an order for it, but you may as well wait till you have moved before
carrying it away."Then you shall go into supper with Althea and myself.""I'm afraid I don't look fit."At any rate, it's nobody's business.There was nothing to say, so Dan followed the mysterious lady into the
supper-room, Althea clinging to his hand.He felt awkward as he took his
seat.Suppose some one should recognize him as the newsboy who usually
stood in front of the Astor House!The young lady whom Tom Carver was escorting boarded at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel, and had alighted at the same time with our hero, though he did
not observe it.Tom had been invited to supper, and, with Julia and her father, was
seated at a neighboring table when Dan entered.Tom could hardly credit his eyes when he saw Dan entering the
supper-room, with the little girl clinging to his hand.he ejaculated, forgetting his manners in his
surprise."I beg your pardon, but I was so astonished.There is that newsboy
coming into supper!""What a pretty little girl is with him!""You must be mistaken about your friend being a newsboy.""Your acquaintance, then; though he is nice enough looking to be a
friend.I saw him selling papers yesterday in front of the Astor
House.""His business must be good, or he would not board at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel.""Of that boy at the next table, pa."Why, that's my young friend of the ferry-boat.Tom, have the
kindness to ask him to come here a moment and speak to me."Much surprised, and considerably against his will, Tom rose and walked
over to where Dan was sitting."Look here," said he; "come over to the next table, will you?""There's a gentleman wants to speak to you."Rogers, of the firm of Barton &
Rogers, who had asked him to call at his place of business on Pearl
street."Not as a rule," answered Dan, smiling."Then, Dan, let me make you acquainted with my daughter, Julia.""I think you were sitting opposite me in the stage, Mr."You were polite enough to hand me my handkerchief when I awkwardly
dropped it.""Dan, this young gentleman is Thomas Carver.Carver a long time," said Dan, smiling."You didn't tell me that, Tom," said Julia Rogers, turning to Tom."No," said Tom, embarrassed; "it is a good while ago.""I won't detain you any longer from your friends," said Mr."I shall see you at the office in the morning.""Where did you meet him, papa?"Her father told the story of Dan's exploit on the ferry-boat."He is a very smart boy," he said."I shall probably take him into my
employ."All this was very disagreeable to Tom Carver, but he did not venture to
say all that he felt, being somewhat in awe of Mr."They are making a great fuss over a common newsboy," he muttered to
himself.After supper, Dan prepared to take Althea home with him.She felt so
well acquainted already that she made no objection, but, hand-in-hand,
left the hotel with Dan.He halted a Broadway stage, and they got in."Are you carrying me to where you live, Dan?""Will your mother be glad to see me?"She wants a little girl to keep her
company."Mordaunt was apprised by Fanny that Dan had gone up town with a
lady, and therefore was not alarmed when he did not return home at the
usual time.She hoped he would clear fifty cents, but had no idea to
what extent their fortunes would be advanced by Dan's evening's work."I will save Dan some supper," she said to herself.So, mother-like, she supped economically herself, on a cup of tea and
some dry bread, and bought a bit of steak for Dan's supper, for she
thought he would be very hungry at so late an hour.It was nearly half-past eight when she heard Dan's well known step on
the stairs.She opened the door to welcome him, but the cheerful welcome upon her
lips died away in surprise when she saw his companion."She is going to be my little sister, mother," said Dan, gayly.said Althea, releasing Dan's hand, and putting
her own confidingly in that of Mrs."Yes, my dear," said the widow, her heart quite won by the little girl's
innocent confidence, and she bent over and kissed her."It means that Althea is to board with us, and be company for you.I
have agreed with her aunt that you will take her.""But does her aunt know that we live in such a poor place?"asked his
mother in a tone of hesitation."Yes, mother, but that makes no difference, as we shall move up town
to-morrow.""I am sure you have acted for the best, Dan, but it seems so strange.""Will it seem strange to receive fifty dollars a month for Althea's
board?"I didn't suppose we ought to charge more."Are you a great eater,
Althea?""Sometimes I am," said the little girl, naively."Never mind, I guess there will be enough."I didn't know there
would be two, but I will go cut and buy some more meat, if you can
wait.""I have had supper, mother, or dinner rather.I dined with Althea and
her aunt at the Fifth Avenue Hotel.""Has Althea been stopping there, Dan?""Then how can she stay even one night in this poor place?"Althea, do you mind stopping here just one night?We
will go to a better place to-morrow.""No, Dan, I don't care.""There, mother, I told you so, Althea is a brick.""What a funny boy you are, Dan!A brick is red and
ugly, and I am not.""No, Althea, you are not ugly, but your cheeks are red.""They don't look like a brick, Dan.""I had got your supper all ready, Dan," said his mother, regretfully."You didn't have any meat, I'll warrant.Now, like a good mother, sit
down and eat the steak."Assured that Dan had supped well, Mrs.Mordaunt didn't resist his
advice.Dan looked on, and saw with pleasure that his mother relished the meat."We will be able to live better hereafter, mother," he said."There
won't be any stinting.Fifty dollars will go a good ways, and then,
besides, there will be my earnings.I forgot to tell you, mother, that I
have probably got a place.""Our good fortune is coming all at once, Dan," said Mrs.I think it has come to stay, too.""I feel so tired," said Althea, at this point.In twenty minutes the little girl was in a sound sleep.Dan was not
sorry, for he wanted to tell his mother about the days adventures, and
he could do so more freely without any one to listen."So, mother," he concluded, "we are going to turn over a new leaf.We
can't go back to our old style of living just yet, but we can get out of
this tenement-house, and live in a respectable neighborhood.""God has been good to us, Dan."I know it, mother, but somehow I don't think of that as quick as you.Who do you think I saw in the supper-room at the Fifth Avenue?He was wonderfully puzzled to know how I happened to be
there.He told the party he was with that I was a common newsboy.""He is a very mean boy," said Mrs."After being
so intimate with you too."He can't do me any harm, and I don't care for his
friendship.The time may come when I can meet him on even terms."I shall work along, and if I get rich I
sha'n't be the first rich man that has risen from the ranks."Early the next morning Dan started out in search of a new home.He and his mother decided that they would like to live somewhere near
Union Square, as that would be a pleasant afternoon resort for their
young boarder."No, Dan, I have not time this morning."Very well, mother; I will do my best."Dan crossed Broadway, and took a horse-car up town.In West Sixteenth street his attention was drawn to the notice,
"Furnished Rooms to Let," upon a good-looking brick house.He rang the bell, and asked to see the lady of the house.A stout, matronly looking woman, with a pleasant face, answered the
servant's call."I called to inquire for rooms," said Dan."For my mother, and sister, and myself.""I have a large back room on the third floor, and a small room on the
fourth floor."It was neatly carpeted and furnished, and had a cheerful outlook."This will do for mother and Althea," he said."Yes, ma'am, but I am sure that will suit.It is for me, and I am not
particular.But there's one thing that may trouble us.""I will give her the privilege of using my kitchen.I don't care to
take boarders, as it would be too much care, but your mother is welcome
to use my kitchen stove.""Leave that to your mother and myself," said Mrs."How much do you want for your rooms?""Of course; that is all I ask."We will pay it," said Dan, quite relieved, for he feared he should have
to pay more."I generally ask a week's rent in advance," said Mrs.Brown, "but in
your case I won't insist upon it.""Oh, it is perfectly convenient," said Dan, and he drew out his
pocket-book containing the money--over a hundred dollars--which Althea's
aunt had given him.Brown's respect for Dan was considerably increased by this display
of wealth, and she congratulated herself on securing such substantial
lodgers.This business accomplished Dan went down town, and informed his mother
of the arrangement he had made.Mordaunt, Althea, and
he were installed in their new home, much to the regret of Mrs.Rafferty, who regretted losing so good a neighbor.Before this, however,
Dan sought the counting-room of Barton & Rogers.DAN BECOMES A DETECTIVE.Barton & Rogers evidently did business in a large way.They occupied an
imposing-looking building of five stories, the greater part being used
to store goods.A spare,
dark-complexioned man of about thirty-five, with a pen behind his ear,
was issuing orders to a couple of workmen."No, he is not," said the dark man, curtly."You might be more civil," thought our hero.He stood his ground, feeling authorized to do so because he had come by
appointment.Observing this, the book-keeper turned and said, sharply:

"Didn't you hear?"I heard you," said Dan, quietly."Not at all, sir; but Mr."Thank you, but I don't think that would do."The book-keeper eyed him sharply, and his face lighted up with a sudden
discovery."You sell papers in front of the Astor House,
don't you?""I thought so; I have bought papers of you."Rogers wants me, I suppose, or he would not have asked me to call,"
returned Dan."Not always," said Dan, with a smile."Some hot days I am far from
cool."Rogers wishes you to supply him with an evening paper?""Perhaps he does," returned Dan, with a smile."In the supper-room of the Fifth Avenue Hotel."demanded Talbot, the book-keeper, in
surprise."I was taking supper," said Dan, rather enjoying the others surprise,
"and Mr.Do you often take supper at the Fifth Avenue Hotel?""I'm willing to change places with you."you are here before me, Dan," he remarked, pleasantly."No, sir; only about five minutes.""I must keep you waiting a few minutes longer while I look at my
letters.The letters have arrived, have they not, Mr."Amuse yourself as you like while you are waiting, Dan," said the
merchant.Talbot, the book-keeper, followed the merchant into the
counting-room, and Dan was left alone.He looked about him with
interest, thinking it probable that this was to be his future business
home.It would certainly be a piece of good fortune to become attached
to so large and important a house, and he felt in very good spirits,
though he foresaw that Mr.Talbot would not make it very pleasant for
him.But with his employer on his side he need not be alarmed."I have to go out a few minutes," he said to Dan."Come with me, and we
can talk on the way."Talbot followed the two with a frown upon his brow."How on earth has that boy managed to get round Mr."I hope he won't be foolish enough to take him in here."Talbot had a nephew whom he was anxious to get into the business, and
Dan's engagement would interfere with his little plan.This partly
accounts for his brusque reception of Dan on his first arrival."Well, how do you like our place of business, Dan?""Would you rather sell papers or take employment with me?""I should like very much to be in your employ, sir.""How much did you earn as a newsboy?""When I was lucky I made a dollar a day.""Then I ought to give you six dollars a week."It is more than boys generally get at the
start, but I am willing to pay a good sum to a boy who suits me.""I will try to suit you, sir.""Do you know why I take you into my employ?""I feel kindly disposed to you, Dan, but that is not my chief reason."Dan was puzzled, and waited to hear more."My attention was drawn to you on the ferry-boat.I observed your
detection of the mean scamp who cheated a poor flower-girl by offering
her bad money, and I inferred that you were sharp and keen.""That is the sort of boy I want just now."I don't think he admires me much," he answered."He wanted to clear me
out before you came in.""Yes; he recognized me as a newsboy."He has a nephew whom he wishes me to
engage."Perhaps his nephew would suit you better, sir," said Dan, modestly."Are you willing to resign in his favor?""I prefer to leave that to you, sir."The nephew is a disagreeable boy, who would not
suit me at all.He thinks more of dress than of duty, and, if I read him
aright, is lazy and incompetent.Talbot has spoken to
me about taking him.""Perhaps he doesn't know his nephew's faults.""He knows them well enough, but is desirous of promoting his interests.He won't look upon you very favorably when he learns that I have engaged
you.""If you are satisfied, I won't care for that."And now for a few words in confidence," and Mr."Our business is a large one, and the sums of
money handled are necessarily large.Three months since I ascertained
that somewhere in my establishment there was a leak.We are losing money
in some unexplained way.I believe that some one in whom I repose
confidence is betraying me."Talbot," he said, in the same low voice."It seems strange, perhaps, that I should speak so confidentially to
you--a mere boy--but I am impressed with the idea that you can help me.""If I can, sir, I will," said Dan, earnestly.My first injunction is to say no word, even to your
nearest relations, of what I have told you."I want to know what are his habits,
whether he uses money freely, with whom he associates.Can you, without
betraying to him that he is watched, find out some information for me on
these points?""If you secure any information, never communicate it to me in the
office.Either come to my house, or write me there.""You understand that I am employing you in a detective capacity, and
that your time will partly be taken up out of business hours.I intend
to pay you extra, according to results.Rogers, but I am afraid you will be disappointed in
me.""Have you any directions to give me, sir, as to how to go to work?""No; I am nothing of a detective myself.I might,
of course, employ a professional detective, but Talbot is sharp, and he
would suspect.He won't dream of my employing a
boy.That is all I have to say for the present."To-morrow let it be, then.Rogers shook hands with our hero, and walked away."I am afraid I have a hard job on my hands," thought Dan, "but I will do
my best."DAN MAKES A DISCOVERY.Dan's mother was much pleased with her new quarters.The large room,
occupied by Althea and herself, was bright and cheerful, and well
furnished.Besides the ordinary chamber furniture, there was a
comfortable arm-chair and a lounge.Mordaunt felt that she would
not be ashamed now to receive a visit from some of her former friends.She had anticipated some trouble about the preparation of meals, but
Mrs.Brown made a proposition which wonderfully removed all
difficulties.Mordaunt," she said, "your family is about the same as mine.I
have a son who is employed in a newspaper office down town, and you have
two young children.Now, suppose we club together, and each pay half of
the table supplies.Then one day you can superintend the cooking--you
will only have to direct my servant Maggie--and the next day I will do
it.Then, every other day, each of us will be a lady of leisure, and not
have to go into the kitchen at all."The arrangement will be so much to my advantage that I can say only
one thing--I accept with thanks.But won't you be doing more than your
share?You will be furnishing the fuel, and pay Maggie's wages.""I should have to do that at any rate.The plan is perfectly
satisfactory to me, if it suits you."Mordaunt found that the expense was not beyond her means.Her
income for the care of Althea was fifty dollars a month, and Dan paid
her four dollars a week out of his wages, reserving the balance as a
fund to purchase clothes.She went herself to market and selected
articles for the table, and, for the first time since her husband's
failure, found herself in easy circumstances.There was no need now to make vests at starvation prices.She had
thought of continuing, but Dan insisted upon her giving it up entirely."If you want to sew, mother," he said, "you can make some of Althea's
clothes, and pay yourself out of the ten dollars a month allowed for her
clothes."Mordaunt decided to follow Dan's
advice.She lost no time in obtaining books for the little girl, and
commencing her education.Althea knew her letters, but nothing more.She
was bright and eager to learn, and gained rapidly under her new teacher.Naturally, Dan and his mother were curious as to Althea's early
history, but from the little girl they obtained little information."Do you remember your mother, Althea?"Only a little while before you brought me here.""Your mother isn't dead, is she?"Poor mamma cried very much
when she went away.She kissed me, and called me her darling.""Perhaps her lungs are affected, and she has gone to a warmer climate,"
suggested Mrs."She may have gone to Florida, or even to
Italy."asked Dan, turning to Althea."Father is a bad man," said the child, positively."He came back once, and then mamma cried again.I think he wanted mamma
to give him some money."Dan and his mother talked over the little girl's revelations, and
thought they had obtained a clew to the mystery in which the child's
history was involved.Althea's mother might have married a man of bad
habits, who wanted to get possession of her fortune, and rendered a
separation necessary.Ill health might have required her to leave home
and shift the care of the little girl upon strangers.It seemed rather
odd that she should have been handed over to utter strangers, but there
might have been reasons of which they knew nothing."We won't trouble ourselves about it," said Dan."It's good luck for us,
even if it was bad luck for Althea's mother.I like the idea of having a
little sister."Althea's last name was not known to her new protector.When Dan
inquired, he was told that she could pass by his name, so Althea
Mordaunt she became.Both Dan and his mother had feared that she might become homesick, but
the fear seemed groundless.She was of a happy disposition, and almost
immediately began to call Mrs."I call you mother," she said, "but I have a mamma besides; but she has
gone away.""You must not forget your mamma, my dear," said the widow.She will come back some day; she said she would.""And I will take care of you till she does, Althea.""I am glad I came to you, for now I have
a brother Dan.""And I have a little sister," said Dan.While Dan was away, and now he was away after supper regularly, Althea
was a great deal of company for Mrs.In the pleasant afternoons she took the little girl out to walk,
frequently to Union Square Park, where she made acquaintance with other
little girls, and had a merry time, while her new mother sat on one of
the benches.One day a dark-complexioned gentleman, who had been looking earnestly at
Althea, addressed Mrs."That is a fine little girl of yours, madam," he said."She does not resemble you much," he said, inquiringly."No; there is very little resemblance," answered Mrs.Mordaunt, quietly,
feeling that she must be on her guard.Mordaunt did not reply, and the stranger thought she was offended."I beg your pardon," he said, "but she resembles a friend of mine, and
that called my attention to her."Mordaunt bowed, but thought it wisest not to protract the
conversation.She feared that the inquirer might be a friend of the
father, and hostile to the true interests of the child.For a week to come she did not again bring Althea to the park, but
walked with her in a different direction.When, after a week, she
returned to the square, the stranger had disappeared.At all events, he
was not to be seen.Talbot heard of his engagement with anything but satisfaction.He
even ventured to remonstrate with Mr."Do you know that this boy whom you have engaged is a common newsboy?""I have bought a paper more than once of him, in front of the
Astor House.""It is none of my business, but I think you could easily get a better
boy.There is my nephew----"

"Your nephew would not suit me, Mr."Won't you give him a trial?""If Dan should prove unsatisfactory, would you try my nephew?"It was an incautious concession, for it was an inducement to the
book-keeper to get Dan into trouble.It was Dan's duty to go to the post-office, sometimes to go on errands,
and to make himself generally useful about the warehouses.As we know,
however, he had other duties of a more important character, of which Mr.The first discovery Dan made was made through the book-keeper's
carelessness.Rogers was absent in Philadelphia, when Talbot received a note which
evidently disturbed him.Dan saw him knitting his brows, and looking
moody.Finally he hastily wrote a note, and called Dan."Take that to -- Wall street," he said, "and don't loiter on the way."On reaching the address, Dan found that Jones & Robinson were stock
brokers."Tell him we will carry the stocks for him a week longer, but can't
exceed that time.""Perhaps you had better write him a note," suggested Dan, "as he may not
like to have me know his business.""I believe I have made a discovery," he said to himself.Talbot is
speculating in Wall street.I wonder if he speculates with his own money
or the firm's?"His face, however, betrayed nothing as he handed the note to the
book-keeper, and the latter, after a searching glance, decided that
there was nothing to fear in that quarter.Talbot's operations, if the reader
will accompany him to a brownstone house on Lexington avenue, on the
evening of the day when Dan was sent to the office of the Wall street
brokers.Talbot ascended the steps, not with the elastic step of a man with
whom the world is prospering, but with the slow step of a man who is
burdened with care.he inquired of the servant who answered the
bell."Will you tell her I should like to speak with her?"Talbot walked in with the air of one who was familiar with the house,
and entering a small front room, took a seat.The furniture was plain, and the general appearance was that of a
boarding-house.Talbot seemed immersed in thought, and only raised his eyes from the
carpet when he heard the entrance of a young lady.His face lighted up,
and he rose eagerly."My dear Virginia," he said, "it seems a long time since I saw you.""It is only four days," returned the young lady, coolly."Four days without seeing you is an eternity."It was easy to see that Talbot was in love, and
she was not."Not good news," said he, soberly.Before going further, it may be as well to describe briefly the young
lady who had so enthralled the book-keeper.She had the advantage of youth, a complexion clear red and white, and
decidedly pretty features.If there was a defect, it was the expression
of her eyes.There was nothing soft or winning in her glance.She
seemed, and was, of a cold, calculating, unsympathetic nature.She was
intensely selfish, and was resolved only to marry a man who could
gratify her taste for finery and luxurious living.Sinclair, who kept the boarding-house, and
though living in dependence upon her aunt, did nothing to relieve her
from the care and drudgery incidental to her business."It's too provoking," she said, pouting."So it is, Virginia;" and Talbot tried to take her hand, but she quietly
withdrew it."You told me that you would have plenty of money by this time, Mr."I expected it, but a man can't foresee the fluctuations of Wall street.I am afraid I shall meet with a loss.""I don't believe you are as smart as Sam Eustis--he's engaged to my
cousin.He made ten thousand dollars last month on Lake Shore.""It's the fools that blunder into luck," said Talbot, irritated."Then you'd better turn fool; it seems to pay," said Virginia, rather
sharply."No need of that--I'm fool enough already," said Talbot, bitterly."Oh, well, if you've only come here to make yourself disagreeable, I'm
sure you'd better stay away," said the young lady, tossing her head."I came here expecting sympathy and encouragement," said Talbot."Instead, you receive me with taunts and coldness.""I will be cheerful
and pleasant when you bring me agreeable news.""Why will you require
impossibilities of me?I have an income of two thousand
dollars a year.We can live comfortably on that, and be happy in a snug
little home.""Thank you; I'd
rather not.It means that I am to be a
household drudge, afraid to spend an extra sixpence--perhaps obliged to
take lodgers, like my aunt.""I am sure you cannot love me when you so coolly give me up for money.""I haven't given you up, but I want you to get money.""Where there's a will, there's a way, Mr.If you really care so
much for me, you will try to support me as I want to live.""Tell me, in a word, what you want.""Well," said Virginia, slowly, "I want to go to Europe for my
honey-moon.I've heard so much of Paris, I know I should like it ever
so much.Then I want to live _respectably_ when I get back.""Well, we must have a nice little house to ourselves, and I think, just
at first, I could get along with three servants; and I should want to go
to the opera, and the theater, and to concerts.""You have not been accustomed to live in that way, Virginia.""No; and that's why I have made up my mind not to marry unless my
husband can gratify me.""Yes, I think so," said Virginia, coolly."And you would desert me for a richer suitor?""Of course I would rather marry you--you know that," said Virginia, with
perfect self-possession; "but if you can't meet my conditions, perhaps
it is better that we should part.""No; only sensible," she returned, calmly."I don't mean to marry you
and be unhappy all my life; and I can't be happy living in the stuffy
way my aunt does.We should both be sorry for such a marriage when it
was too late.""I will take the risk, Virginia," said Talbot, fixing his eyes with
passionate love on the cold-hearted girl."But I will not," said Virginia, decidedly."I am sure you needn't take
it to heart, Mr.Why don't you exert yourself and win a fortune,
as other people do?I am sure plenty of money is made in Wall street."Come now, smooth your face, and tell me you will
try," she said, coaxingly."Yes, Virginia, I will try," he answered, his face clearing."And if I
try----"

"You will succeed," she said, smiling."And now don't let us talk about disagreeable things.Do you know, sir,
it is a week since you took me to any place of amusement?And here I
have been moping at home every evening with my aunt, who is terribly
tiresome, poor old soul!""I would rather spend the evening here with you, Virginia, than go to
any place of amusement.""I don't--if you call by that name being in the company of one you
love.""You would, if you had as little variety as I have.""Tell me one thing, Virginia--you love me, don't you?"asked Talbot, in
whose mind sometimes there rose an unpleasant suspicion that his love
was not returned."Why, of course I do, you foolish man," she said, carelessly."And now,
where are you going to take me?""Where do you want to go, my darling?"To-morrow they play 'The Huguenots.'""I thought you didn't care for music, Virginia?"I want to go because it's fashionable, and I want
to be seen.So, be a good boy, and get some nice seats for to-morrow
evening.""And you'll try to get rich, for my sake?""As soon as you can tell me you have ten thousand dollars, and will
spend half of it on a trip to Europe, I will marry you.""Then I hope to tell you so soon."When Talbot left the house it was with the determination to secure the
sum required by any means, however objectionable.Virginia Conway followed his retreating form with her cool, calculating
glance."I'll give him
two months to raise the money, and if he fails, I think I can captivate
Mr.Cross was a middle-aged grocer, a widower, without children, and
reputed moderately wealthy.Talbot had entered the house, Dan was not far off.Later, he
saw him at the window with Virginia."I suppose that's his young lady," thought Dan.I guess he's
safe for this evening."Stocks took an upward turn, so that Talbot's brokers were willing to
carry them for him longer without an increase of margin.The market
looked so uncertain, however, that he decided to sell, though he only
made himself whole.To escape loss hardly satisfied him, when it was so
essential to make money.He was deeply in love with Virginia Conway, but there was no hope of
obtaining her consent to a marriage unless he could raise money enough
to gratify her desires.He was returning to his boarding-house at a late hour one night, when,
in an unfrequented street, two figures advanced upon him from the
darkness, and, while one seized him by the throat, the other rifled his
pockets.Talbot was not a coward, and having only a few dollars in his
pocket-book, while his watch, luckily, was under repair at Tiffany's, he
submitted quietly to the examination.The pocket-book was opened and its contents eagerly scanned.An exclamation of disgust mingled with profanity followed."Why don't you carry money, like a gentleman?""Ain't you ashamed to carry such a lean wallet as that there?""Really, gentlemen, if I had expected to meet you, I would have provided
myself better," said Talbot, not without a gleam of humor."He's chaffing us Bill," said Mike."You'd better not, if you know what's best for yourself," growled Bill.You ought to have waited till next week, when I'd have
had it for you.""Yes; but they are small, and not worth much.""You've took us in reg'lar!A gent like you ought to have diamond studs,
or a pin, or something of value.""I know it, and I'm sorry I haven't, for your sakes."I look upon you as gentlemen, and treat you
accordingly.In fact, I'm glad I've met with you.""I may be able to put something in your way.""I can't tell you in the street.Is there any quiet place, where we
shall not be disturbed or overheard?""This may be a plant," said Mike, suspiciously."If it is," growled Bill, "you'd better make your will.""I know the risk, and am not afraid.In short, I have a job for you."The men consulted, and finally were led to put confidence in Talbot."We'll hear what you have to say.The three made their way to a dilapidated building on Houston street,
and ascended to the fourth floor.Bill kicked open the door of a room with his foot and strode in.A thin, wretched-looking woman sat in a wooden chair, holding a young
child."Just clear out into the other
room.She meekly obeyed the command of her lord, glancing curiously at Talbot
as she went out.Mike she knew only too well, as one of her husband's
evil companions.The door was closed, but the wife bent her ear to the keyhole and
listened attentively.Suspecting nothing, the conspirators spoke in louder tones than they
were aware of, so that she obtained a pretty clear idea of what was
being planned."Now go ahead," said Bill, throwing himself on the chair his wife had
vacated."We might,'specially if we knowed the combination."Talbot gave the name of his employer and the number of his store."What have you got to do with it?"What are you going to make out of it?"I'll guarantee that you'll find four hundred dollars
there to pay you for your trouble.""If we're caught, it'll be Sing Sing for seven years.""We might do it for five hundred apiece," said Bill.There was a little discussion, but finally this was acceded to.Various
details were discussed, and the men separated."I'm goin' your way," said Mike."All right, thank you, but we'd better separate at the street door."Are you too fine a gentleman to be seen with the likes of me?""Not at all, my friend; but if we were seen together by any of the
police, who know me as book-keeper, it would excite suspicion later."I shouldn't dare to tamper with men like you and Bill.You might find a way to get even with me."said the miserable wife to herself, as she heard through
the keyhole the details of the plan."Bill is getting worse and worse
every day."Here, Nancy, get me something to eat," said Bill, when his visitors had
departed."Yes, Bill, I will get you all there is."The wife brought out from a small closet a slice of bread and a segment
of cheese.said the burly ruffian, turning up his nose."It's all I've got, Bill.""You and your brat have eaten it!"If you will give money, I will provide better."I'll teach you to
complain of me.and he struck the woman two brutal
blows with his fist.One, glancing, struck the child, who began to cry.This further irritated Bill, who, seizing his wife by the shoulders,
thrust her out on the landing."There, stay there with the cursed brat!""I mean to have
one quiet night."The wretched wife crept down stairs, and out into the street, scarcely
knowing what she did.She was not wholly destitute of spirit, and
though she might have forgiven personal injury, felt incensed by the
treatment of her innocent child.she said, pitifully, "must you suffer because your
father is a brute?She sat down on some steps near by; the air was chilly, and she shivered
with the cold, but she tried to shelter her babe as well as she could.She attracted the attention of a boy who was walking slowly by.It was Dan, who had at a distance witnessed Talbot's encounter with the
burglars, and his subsequent friendly companionship with them, and was
trying to ascertain the character of the place which he visited.asked Dan, in a tone of sympathy.[Illustration: "What's the matter with you?"asked Dan, in a tone of
sympathy.Page 148]

"My husband has thrust me out of doors with my poor baby.""I can let you have enough for that.I'll
take you to it, and pay for your lodging, and pay for it in advance."Supported by Dan, the poor woman rose and walked to an humble tavern not
far away."She may know something about Talbot's visit.DAN AS A GOOD SAMARITAN."What made your husband treat you so badly?""Rum has been sinking him lower and lower,
and it's easy to see the end.""You are taking too dark a view of your husband," said Dan, soothingly."He won't go as far as that.""I know him only too well," she said."This very evening he has been
planning a burglary."Dan started, and a sudden suspicion entered his mind."Yes; it is a store on Pearl street."Dan felt that he was on the track of a discovery.He was likely to be
repaid at last for the hours he had spent in detective service.he asked, fixing his eyes intently on the woman."I don't know his name; he is a well-dressed man."Was it a man who came to your rooms this evening?"Here Dan gave a rapid description of
Talbot.He is the book-keeper of the firm."He is to pay a thousand dollars for the job."Bill, I suppose, is your husband?"By this time they had reached a small public-house, of humble exterior,
but likely to afford his companion better accommodations than she had at
home.The woman followed him, with the child in her arms.A stout German, who
appeared to be the proprietor of the establishment, was sitting in an
arm-chair, smoking a pipe.asked the German, with a broad grin."No; she is an acquaintance of mine.Her husband has driven her out of
his house in a fit of drunkenness.asked the Dutchman, shrewdly."Fifty cents a night for the lodging."asked the landlord, upon whom the silver
half-dollar produced a visible impression."Yes," said the woman; "my poor baby is tired.""You had better stay here two nights," said Dan."Don't let your husband
know where you are just yet.Here is money to pay for another night's
lodging, and enough to buy food besides.""But for you I should have
had to stay out all night.""Oh, no; some one would have taken you in.""You don't know this neighborhood; the policeman would have found me,
and taken me to the station-house.For myself I care little; but my poor
babe, who is worse than fatherless----" and she burst into tears.Brighter days may be in store," said Dan,
cheerfully."I will come and see you day after to-morrow," said Dan.Our hero must not be awarded too great credit for his generosity.Rogers would willingly defray all expenses connected with
the discovery, and that the money he had advanced to his unfortunate
companion would be repaid.Had it been otherwise, however, his generous
heart would have prompted him to relieve the woman's suffering.Very early the next morning Dan rang the bell at Mr."The master won't be up for an hour," said the servant."Tell him Dan wishes to see him on business of importance.""I don't think he'll see you.He was up late last night," she said."It's very important you make yourself," said Susan, crossly."I _am_ a person of great importance," said Dan, smiling.Rogers
will see me, you'll find."Two minutes later Susan descended the stairs a little bewildered."You're to walk into the parlor," she said.Rogers came down stairs almost
directly in dressing-gown and slippers."The store is to be broken open to-night and the safe robbed!""By two men living in Houston street--at least, one lives there.""Yes, sir; they are employed by Mr.Dan rehearsed the story, already familiar to our readers, combining with
it some further information he had drawn from the woman."I didn't think Talbot capable of this," said Mr."He has been
in our employ for ten years.I don't like to think of his treachery,
but, unhappily, there is no reason to doubt it.Now, Dan, what is your
advice?""I am afraid my advice wouldn't be worth much, Mr.Rogers," said Dan,
modestly.I am indebted to you for this important
discovery.I won't promise to follow your
advice, but I should like to hear it.""Then, sir, I will ask you a question.Do you want to prevent the
robbery, or to catch the men in the act?""I wish to catch the burglars in the act.""Then, sir, can you stay away from the store to-day?"But how can I take measures to guard
against loss?""No; but Talbot is authorized to sign checks.He will draw money if I am
not at the store."He is to tell the burglars the combination.He will
get it from the janitor.""I will see the janitor, and ask him to give the book-keeper the wrong
word.""I will secretly notify the police, whom he will admit and hide till the
time comes.""Then," continued Dan, flushing with excitement, "we'll wait till the
burglars come, and let them begin work on the safe.While they are at
work, we will nab them.""Yes, sir; I want to be there.""I don't know about that, sir.But if anything is going on to-night, I
want to be in it."Talbot sends me with a large check to the bank,
what shall I do?""He may make off with the money during the day.""I will set another detective to watch him, and have him arrested in
that event.""This is going to be an exciting day," said Dan to himself, as he set
out for the store.TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.As Dan entered the store he noticed that Talbot looked excited and
nervous.Ordinarily the book-keeper would have reprimanded him sharply
for his late arrival, but he was not disposed to be strict this morning."I'm a little late this morning, Mr."Oh, well, you can be excused for once," said Talbot.He wished to disarm suspicion by extra good humor.Besides, he intended
to send Dan to the bank presently for a heavy sum, and thought it best
to be on friendly terms with him.About ten o'clock a messenger entered the store with a note from Mr.It was to this effect:


     "I am feeling rather out of sorts this morning, and shall not come
     to the store.Should you desire to consult me on any subject, send
     a messenger to my house."The only obstacle to
carrying out his plans was the apprehended presence and vigilance of his
employer.About one o'clock he called Dan into the office."Here, Dan," he said, "I want you to go to the bank at once.""Here is a check for twelve thousand dollars--rather a heavy amount--and
you must be very careful not to lose any of it, or to let any one see
that you have so much with you."You may get one hundred dollars in fives and tens, and the remainder in
large bills.""He means to make a big haul," said Dan to himself, as he left the
store."I hope our plans won't miscarry.Rogers to
lose so large a sum."As Dan left the store a man of middle size, who was lounging against a
lamp-post, eyed him sharply.As Dan was turning the corner of the street
he left his post, and, walking rapidly, overtook him."You are in the employ of Barton & Rogers, are you not?""I am a detective, on watch here by order of Mr."He is the book-keeper, is he not?"There is no need of watching till you bring
back the money.Where do you think Talbot will put the money?""In the safe, I think, sir."I believe he will retain the greater part on his
own person.If the men who are to rob the safe got hold of all the money
they would be likely to keep it, and not limit themselves to the sum he
agrees to pay them.""I shall take care to keep Talbot in view.He means to have it understood that all this money has been taken
by the burglars, whereas but a tithe of the sum will be deposited in the
safe.""It seems to me there is a risk of losing the money," he said."Don't be afraid," he said, confidentially."Talbot won't leave the
city.His words inspired confidence, and Dan entered the bank without
misgivings.The check was so large that the bank officials scrutinized it carefully.There was no doubt about its being correct, however."Be very careful, young man," said the disbursing clerk."You've got too
much to lose."Dan deposited one roll of bills in the left inside pocket of his coat,
and the balance in the right pocket, and then buttoned up the coat."I'm a boy of fortune for a short time," he said to himself."I hope
the time will come when I shall have as much money of my own."Dan observed that the detective followed him at a little distance, and
it gave him a feeling of security.Some one might have seen the large
sum of money paid him, and instances had been known where boys in such
circumstances had suddenly been set upon in the open street at midday
and robbed.He felt that he had a friend near at hand who would
interfere in such a case.asked an ill-looking man, suddenly accosting
him."I don't carry one," said Dan, eying the questioner suspiciously."Nor I. I have been very unfortunate.Can't you give me a quarter to buy
me some dinner?""Ask some one else; I'm in a hurry," said Dan, coldly."I'm not as green as you take me for," said Dan to himself.He thought his danger was over, but he was mistaken.Suddenly a large man, with red hair and beard, emerging from Dan knew
not where, laid his hand on his shoulder."Boy," said he, in a fierce undertone, "give me that money you have in
your coat-pocket, or I will brain you.""You forget we are in the public street," said Dan."And you would be--stunned, perhaps killed!""Look here,
boy, I am a desperate man.I know how much money you have with you.Dan looked out of the corner of his eye, to see the detective close at
hand.This gave him courage, for he recognized that the villain was only
speaking the truth, and he did not wish to run any unnecessary risk.He
gave a nod, which brought the detective nearer, and then slipped to one
side, calling:

"Stop thief!"The ruffian made a dash for him, his face distorted with rage, but his
arm was grasped as by an iron vise.exclaimed the detective, and he signaled to
a policeman."You are up to your old tricks again, as I expected.""I have taken nothing," he
added, sullenly.I heard you threatening the boy, unless he gave
up the money in his possession."Thank you, sir," said Dan, gratefully.Talbot, whose conscience was uneasy, and with good cause, awaited Dan's
arrival very anxiously."No; he was recognized by a policeman, who arrested him as he was on the
point of attacking me."Talbot asked no further questions, considerably to Dan's relief, for he
did not wish to mention the detective if it could be avoided.The book-keeper contented himself with saying, in a preoccupied tone, as
he received the money:

"You can't be too careful when you have much money about you.I am
almost sorry I sent for this money," he proceeded."I don't think I
shall need to use it to-day.""Shall I take it back to the bank, sir?""No; I shall put it in the safe over night.I don't care to risk you or
the money again to-day.""He won't put it in the safe."TALBOT'S SCHEME FAILS.Talbot went into the office where he was alone.But the partition walls
were of glass, and Dan managed to put himself in a position where he
could see all that passed within.The book-keeper opened the package of bills, and divided them into two
parcels.One he replaced in the original paper and labeled it "$12,000."The other he put into another paper, and put into his own pocket.Dan
saw it all, but could not distinguish the denominations of the bills
assigned to the different packages.He had no doubt, however, that the
smaller bills were placed in the package intended to be deposited in the
safe, so that, though of apparently equal value, it really contained
only about one-tenth of the money drawn from the bank.Indeed, he was not observed,
except by Dan, whose business it was to watch him.The division being made, he opened the safe and placed the package
therein.He was anxious to communicate his discovery to the detective outside,
but for some time had no opportunity.About an hour later he was sent out on an errand.He looked about him in
a guarded manner till he attracted the attention of the outside
detective.The latter, in answer to a slight nod, approached him
carelessly."Well," he asked, "have you any news?"Talbot has divided the money into two
packages, and one of them he has put into his own pocket."He means to appropriate the greater part to his own
use.""Is there anything more for me to do?"Does the book-keeper suspect that he
is watched?""I am afraid he will get away with the money," said Dan, anxiously.Do you know whether there's any woman in the case?""He visits a young lady on Lexington avenue."It is probably on her account that he wishes to
become suddenly rich."This supposition was a correct one, as we know.It did not, however,
argue unusual shrewdness on the part of the detective, since no motive
is more common in such cases.Dan returned to the office promptly, and nothing of importance occurred
during the remainder of the day.Talbot was preparing to leave, he called in the janitor."You may lock the safe," he said."By the way, you may use the word 'Hartford' for the combination.""Be particularly careful, as the safe contains a package of
money--twelve thousand dollars.""Wouldn't it have been better to deposit it in the bank, Mr."Yes, but it was not till the bank closed that I decided not to use it
to-day.However, it is secure in the safe," he added, carelessly."I have no doubt of that, Mr.In turning a street corner, he brushed against a rough-looking man who
was leaning against a lamp-post."I beg your pardon," said the book-keeper, politely."Hartford," said Talbot, in a low tone."They've got the word," said Talbot to himself."Now the responsibility
rests with them.His face flushed, and his eyes lighted up with joy, as he uttered her
name.He was deeply in love, and he felt that at last he was in a
position to win the consent of the object of his passion.He knew, or,
rather, he suspected her to be coldly selfish, but he was infatuated.It
was enough that he had fulfilled the conditions imposed upon him.In a
few days he would be on his way to Europe with the lady of his love.Matters were so arranged that the loss of the twelve thousand dollars
would be credited to the burglars.If his
European journey should excite a shadow of suspicion, nothing could be
proved, and he could represent that he had been lucky in stock
speculations, as even now he intended to represent to Miss Conway.He was not afraid that she would be deeply shocked by his method of
obtaining money, but he felt that it would be better not to trust her
with a secret, which, if divulged, would compromise his safety.Yes, Miss Conway was at home, and she soon entered the room, smiling
upon him inquiringly."Well," she said, "have you any news to tell me?""Virginia, are you ready to fulfill your promise?"asked Talbot,
eagerly."I make so many promises, you know," she said, fencing."Suppose that the conditions are fulfilled, Virginia?"I dared everything, and I have
succeeded.""As you might have done before, had you listened to me."Ten thousand dollars--the amount you required.""We will make the grand
tour?"She stooped and pressed a kiss lightly upon his cheek.It was a mercenary kiss, but he was so much in love that he felt repaid
for the wrong and wickedness he had done.It would not always be so,
even if he should never be detected, but for the moment he was happy."Now let us form our plans," he said."Will you marry me to-morrow
evening?"We will call on a clergyman, quietly, to-morrow
evening, and in fifteen minutes we shall be man and wife.On Saturday a
steamer leaves for Europe.I can hardly believe that I shall so soon
realize the dreams of years."How can you be spared from your business?""No; not till you are almost ready to start.""It is better that there should be no gossip about it.Besides, your
aunt would probably be scandalized by our hasty marriage, and insist
upon delay.That's something we should neither of us be willing to
consent to.""No, for it would interfere with our European trip.""You consent, then, to my plans?""Yes; I will give you your own way this time," said Virginia, smiling."And you will insist on having your own way ever after?""Of course," she said; "isn't that right?""I am afraid I must consent, at any rate; but, since you are to rule,
you must not be a tyrant, my darling."Talbot agreed to stay to dinner; indeed, it had been his intention from
the first.He remained till the city clocks struck eleven, and then took
leave of Miss Conway at the door.He set out for his boarding-place, his mind filled with thoughts of his
coming happiness, when a hand was laid on his arm.He wheeled suddenly, and his glance fell on a quiet man--the detective."You are suspected
of robbing the firm that employs you."exclaimed Talbot, putting on a bold face,
though his heart sank within him."I hope so; but you must accompany me, and submit to a search.If my
suspicions are unfounded, I will apologize."I will give you into
custody."The detective put a whistle to his mouth, and his summons brought a
policeman."Take this man into custody," he said.exclaimed Talbot; but he was very pale."You will be searched at the station-house, Mr."I hope nothing will be found to criminate you.Talbot, with a swift motion, drew something from his pocket, and hurled
it into the darkness.The detective darted after it, and brought it back."This is what I wanted," he said."Policeman, you will bear witness
that it was in Mr.I fear we shall have to detain
you a considerable time, sir."Fate had turned against him, and he was
sullen and desperate.he asked himself; but no answer suggested
itself.In the house on Houston street, Bill wasted little regret on the absence
of his wife and child.Neither did he trouble himself to speculate as to
where she had gone."I'm better without her," he said to his confederate, Mike."She's
always a-whinin' and complainin', Nance is.If I speak a rough word to her, and it stands to reason a chap can't
always be soft-spoken, she begins to cry.I like to see a woman have
some spirit, I do.""They may have too much," said Mike, shrugging his shoulders."My missus
ain't much like yours.If I speak rough to
her, she ups with something and flings it at my head."Oh, I just leave her to get over it; that's the best way.""Why, you're not half a man, you ain't.Do
you want to know what I'd do if a woman raised her hand against me?""I'd beat her till she couldn't see!"said Bill, fiercely; and he looked
as if he was quite capable of it."You haven't got a wife like mine.""Just you take me round there some time, Mike.If she has a tantrum,
turn her over to me."He was not as great a ruffian as Bill, and the
proposal did not strike him favorably.His wife was certainly a virago, and though strong above the average, he
was her superior in physical strength, but something hindered him from
using it to subdue her.So he was often overmatched by the shrill-voiced
vixen, who knew very well that he would not proceed to extremities.Had
she been Bill's wife, she would have had to yield, or there would have
been bloodshed."I say, Bill," said Mike, suddenly, "how much did your wife hear of our
plans last night?""If she had she would not dare to say a word," said Bill, carelessly."She knows I'd kill her if she betrayed me," said Bill."There ain't no
use considerin' that.""Well, I'm glad you think so.It would be awkward if the police got wind
of it.""What do you think of that chap that's puttin' us up to it?""I don't like him, but I like his money.""Five hundred dollars a-piece ain't much for the risk we run.""If we don't find more in the safe, we'll bleed him when all's over.It was true that Bill was the leading spirit.He was reckless and
desperate, while Mike was apt to count the cost, and dwell upon the
danger incurred.They had been associated more than once in unlawful undertakings; and
though both had served a short term of imprisonment, they had in
general escaped scot-free.It was Bill who hung round the store, and who received from Talbot at
the close of the afternoon the "combination," which was to make the
opening of the safe comparatively easy."It's a good thing to have a friend inside," he said to his confederate."There'll be the janitor to dispose of," suggested Mike."Don't kill him if you can help it, Bill.Murder has an ugly look, and
they'll look out twice as sharp for a murderer as for a burglar.He can wake up when we're
gone, but we'll tie him so he can't give the alarm."Obey
orders, and I'll bring you out all right."So the day passed, and darkness came on.The janitor, or watchman, was a sturdy old man, who in early life had
been a sailor.Some accident had made him lame, and this incapacitated
him for his early vocation.It had not, however, impaired his physical
strength, which was very great, and Mr.Rogers was glad to employ him in
his present capacity.When Jack Green--Jack was the name he generally went by--heard of the
contemplated burglary, he was excited and pleased.It was becoming
rather tame to him to watch night after night without interruption, and
he fancied he should like a little scrimmage.He even wanted to
withstand the burglars single-handed."What's the use of callin' in the police?""It's only two men,
and old Jack is a match for two.""You're a strong man, Jack," said Dan, "but one of the burglars is as
strong as you are.He's broad-shouldered and
big-chested.""I ain't afraid of him," said Jack, defiantly."Perhaps not, but there's another man, too.But Jack finally yielded, though reluctantly, and three policemen were
admitted about eight o'clock, and carefully secreted, to act when
necessary.Jack pleaded for the privilege of meeting the burglars first,
and the privilege was granted, partly in order that they might be taken
in the act.Old Jack was instructed how to act, and though it was a part
not wholly in accordance with his fearless spirit, he finally agreed to
do as he was told.It is not necessary to explain how the burglars effected their entrance.This was effected about twelve o'clock, and by the light of a
dark-lantern Bill and Mike advanced cautiously toward the safe.At this point old Jack made his appearance, putting on an air of alarm
and dismay.he demanded, in a tone which he partially succeeded in
making tremulous."Keep quiet, and we will do you no harm."All right; I'll do it myself.The word agreed with the information
they had received from Talbot.It served to convince them that the
janitor had indeed succumbed, and could be relied upon.There was no
suspicion in the mind of either that there was any one else in the
establishment, and they felt moderately secure from interruption."Here, old fellow, hold the lantern while we go to work.Just behave
yourself, and we'll give you ten dollars--shall we, Mike?""Yes," answered Mike; "I'm agreed.""It'll look as if I was helpin' to rob my master," objected Jack."Oh, never mind about that; he won't know it.When all is over we'll tie
you up, so that it will look as if you couldn't help yourself.Jack felt like making a violent assault upon the man who was offering
him a bribe, but he controlled his impulse, and answered:

"I'm a poor man, and ten dollars will come handy.""All right," said Bill, convinced by this time that Jack's fidelity was
very cheaply purchased.He plumed himself on his success in converting
the janitor into an ally, and felt that the way was clear before him."Mike, give the lantern to this old man, and come here and help me."Old Jack took the lantern, laughing in his sleeve at the ease with which
he had gulled the burglars, while they kneeled before the safe.It was then that, looking over his shoulder, he noticed the stealthy
approach of the policemen, accompanied by Dan.Setting down the lantern, he sprang upon the back of Bill as
he was crouching before him, exclaiming:

"Now, you villain, I have you!"The attack was so sudden and unexpected that Bill, powerful as he was,
was prostrated, and for an instant interposed no resistance."You'll repent this, you old idiot!"he hissed between his closed teeth,
and, in spite of old Jack's efforts to keep him down, he forced his way
up.At the same moment Mike, who had been momentarily dazed by the sudden
attack, seized the janitor, and, between them both, old Jack's life was
likely to be of a very brief tenure.But here the reinforcements
appeared, and changed the aspect of the battle.One burly policeman seized Bill by the collar, while Mike was taken in
hand by another, and their heavy clubs fell with merciless force on the
heads of the two captives.In the new surprise Jack found himself a free man, and, holding up the
lantern, cried, exultingly:

"If I am an old idiot, I've got the better of you, you scoundrels!It was hard for him to give in, but the
fight was too unequal."Mike," said he, "this is a plant.I wish I had that cursed book-keeper
here; he led us into this.""Yes," answered Bill; "he put us up to this."No need to curse him," said Jack, dryly; "he meant you to succeed.""Didn't he tell you we were coming to-night?""How did you find it out, then?""It wasn't enough; but we should have got more out of him.""Before you go away with your prisoners," said Jack to the policeman, "I
wish to open the safe before you, to see if I am right in my suspicions.Talbot drew over ten thousand dollars from the bank to-day, and led
us to think that he deposited it in the safe.I wish to ascertain, in
the presence of witnesses, how much he placed there, and how much he
carried away.""That cursed book-keeper deceived us, then."Burglar," said old Jack, indifferently."There's an
old saying, 'Curses, like chickens, still come home to roost.'Your
cursing won't hurt me any.""If my curses don't my fists may!"retorted Bill, with a malignant look."You won't have a chance to carry out your threats for some years to
come, if you get your deserts," said Jack, by no means terrified."I've
only done my duty, and I'm ready to do it again whenever needed."By this time the safe was open; all present saw the envelope of money
labeled "$12,000."The two burglars saw the prize which was to have rewarded their efforts
and risk with a tantalizing sense of defeat.They had been so near
success, only to be foiled at last, and consigned to a jail for a term
of years.muttered Bill, bitterly, and in his heart Mike said
amen."Gentlemen, I will count this money before you," said the janitor, as he
opened the parcel.It resulted, as my readers already
know, in the discovery that, in place of twelve thousand, the parcel
contained but one thousand dollars."Gentlemen, will you take
notice of this?Of course it is clear where the rest is gone--Talbot
carried it away with him.""By this time he is in custody," said Jack."Look here, old man, who engineered this thing?""Come here, Dan," said Jack, summoning our hero, who modestly stood in
the background.Burglar, this boy is entitled to the credit of
defeating you.We should have known nothing of your intentions but for
Dan, the Detective.""Why, I could crush him with one hand.""Force is a good thing, but brains are better," said Jack."Dan here has
got a better head-piece than any of us.""You've done yourself credit, boy," said the chief policeman."When I
have a difficult case I'll send for you.""You are giving me more credit than I deserve," said Dan, modestly."If I ever get out of jail, I'll remember you," said Bill, scowling."I
wouldn't have minded so much if it had been a man, but to be laid by the
heels by a boy like you--that's enough to make me sick.""You've said enough, my man," said the policeman who had him in charge.The two prisoners, escorted by their captors, made their unwilling way
to the station-house.They were duly tried, and were sentenced to a ten
years' term of imprisonment.As for Talbot, he tried to have it believed that he took the money found
on him because he distrusted the honesty of the janitor; but this
statement fell to the ground before Dan's testimony and that of Bill's
wife.He, too, received a heavy sentence, and it was felt that he only got his
just deserts.*       *       *       *       *       *       *

On the morning after the events recorded above, Mr.Rogers called Dan
into the counting-room."Dan," he said, "I wish to express to you my personal obligations for
the admirable manner in which you have managed the affair of this
burglary.""I am convinced that but for you I should have lost twelve thousand
dollars.It would not have ruined me, to be sure, but it would have been
a heavy loss.""Such a loss as that would have ruined me," said Dan, smiling."So I should suppose," assented his employer."I predict, however, that
the time will come when you can stand such a loss, and have something
left.""As there must always be a beginning, suppose you begin with that."Rogers had turned to his desk and written a check, which he handed
to Dan.This was the way it read:


     No.Pay to Dan Mordaunt or order One Thousand Dollars.Dan took the check, supposing it might be for twenty dollars or so.When
he saw the amount, he started in excitement and incredulity."It is a large sum for a boy like you,
Dan."But, sir, you don't mean all this for me?"It is less than ten per cent on the money you have saved
for us.""How can I thank you for your kindness, sir?"By the way, what wages do we pay
you?""It is a little better than selling papers in front of the Astor House,
isn't it, Dan?"Now, Dan, let me give you two
pieces of advice.""First, put this money in a good savings-bank, and don't draw upon it
unless you are obliged to."And next, spend a part of your earnings in improving your education.You have already had unusual advantages for a boy of your age, but you
should still be learning.It may help you, in a business point of view,
to understand book-keeping."Dan not only did this, but resumed the study of both French and German,
of which he had some elementary knowledge, and advanced rapidly in all.Punctually every month Dan received a remittance of sixty dollars
through a foreign banker, whose office was near Wall street.Of this sum it may be remembered that ten dollars were to be
appropriated to Althea's dress.Of the little girl it may be said she was very happy in her new home.Mordaunt, whom she called mamma,
while she always looked forward with delight to Dan's return at night.Mordaunt was very happy in the child's companionship, and found the
task of teaching her very congenial.But for the little girl she would have had many lonely hours, since Dan
was absent all day on business."I don't know what I shall do, Althea, when you go to school," she said
one day."I don't want to go to school.Let me stay at home with you, mamma.""For the present I can teach you, my dear, but the time will come when
for your own good it will be better to go to school.I cannot teach you
as well as the teachers you will find there.""You know ever so much, mamma."Compared with you, my dear, I seem to know a great deal, but there are
others who know much more."Althea was too young as yet, however, to attend school, and the happy
home life continued.Mordaunt and Dan often wondered how long their mysterious ward was
to remain with them.If so, how could that
mother voluntarily forego her child's society?These were questions they sometimes asked themselves, but no answer
suggested itself.They were content to have them remain unanswered, so
long as Althea might remain with them.The increase of Dan's income, and the large sum he had on interest,
would have enabled them to live comfortably even without the provision
made for their young ward.Dan felt himself justified in indulging
in a little extravagance."Mother," said he, one evening, "I am thinking of taking a course of
lessons in dancing.""What has put that into your head, Dan?""Julia Rogers is to have a birthday party in two or three months, and I
think from a hint her father dropped to-day I shall have an invitation.I shall feel awkward if I don't know how to dance."Tom Carver will be sure to be there, and if I don't dance, or if I am
awkward, he will be sure to sneer at me.""Will that make you feel bad, Dan?""Not exactly, but I don't want to appear at disadvantage when he is
around.If I have been a newsboy, I want to show that I can take the
part of gentleman as well as he.""Does the ability to dance make a gentleman, Dan?""No, mother, but I should feel awkward without it.I don't want to be a
wall-flower.What do you say to my plan, mother?""Carry it out by all means, Dan.There is no reason why you shouldn't
hold up your head with any of them," and Mrs.Mordaunt's eyes rested
with pride on the handsome face and manly expression of her son."You are a little prejudiced in my favor, mother," said Dan, smiling."If I were as awkward as a cat in a strange garret, you wouldn't see
it."He selected a
fashionable teacher, although the price was high, for he thought it
might secure him desirable acquaintances, purchased a handsome suit of
clothes, and soon became very much interested in the lessons.He had a
quick ear, a good figure, and a natural grace of movement, which soon
made him noticeable in the class, and he was quite in demand among the
young ladies as a partner.He was no less a favorite socially, being agreeable as well as
good-looking.Mordaunt," said the professor, "I wish all my scholars did me as
much credit as you do."Thank you, sir," said Dan, modestly, but he felt gratified.By the time the invitation came Dan had no fears as to acquitting
himself creditably."I hope Tom Carver will be there," he said to his mother, as he was
dressing for the party.Rogers lived in a handsome brown-stone-front house up town.As Dan approached, he saw the entire house brilliantly lighted.He
passed beneath a canopy, over carpeted steps, to the front door, and
rang the bell.The door was opened by a stylish-looking <DW52> man, whose grand air
showed that he felt the importance and dignity of his position.As Dan passed in he said:

"Gentlemen's dressing-room third floor back."With a single glance through the open door at the lighted parlors, where
several guests were already assembled, Dan followed directions, and went
up stairs.Entering the dressing-room, he saw a boy carefully arranging his hair
before the glass."That's my friend, Tom Carver," said Dan to himself.Tom was so busily engaged at his toilet that he didn't at once look at
the new guest.When he had leisure to look up, he seemed surprised, and
remarked, superciliously:

"I didn't expect to see _you_ here.""Are you engaged to look after this room?"With all my heart, if you'll brush me," answered Dan, partly offended
and partly amused."Our positions are rather different, I think."You are a guest of Miss Rogers, and so am I.""You don't mean to say that you are going down into the parlor?""A boy who sells papers in front of the Astor House is not a suitable
guest at a fashionable party.""That is not your affair," said Dan, coldly."But it is not true that I
sell papers anywhere.""And I will again, if necessary," answered Dan, as he took Tom's place
in front of the glass and began to arrange his toilet.Then, for the first time, Tom took notice that Dan was dressed as well
as himself, in a style with which the most captious critic could not
find fault.He would have liked
to see Dan in awkward, ill-fitting, or shabby clothes.It seemed to him
that an ex-newsboy had no right to dress so well, and he was greatly
puzzled to understand how he could afford it."It is not remarkable that I should be well dressed."So can I," answered Dan, laconically."Do you mean to say that you bought that suit and paid for it?""You are very kind to take so much interest in me.It may relieve your
mind to see this."Dan took a roll of bills from his pocket, and displayed them to the
astonished Tom."I don't see where you got so much money," said Tom, mystified."I've got more in the bank," said Dan."I mention it to you that you
needn't feel bad about my extravagance in buying a party suit.""I wouldn't have come to this party if I had been you," said Tom,
changing his tone."You'll be so awkward, you know.You don't know any one except Miss
Rogers, who, of course, invited you out of pity, not expecting you would
accept.""You forget I know you," said Dan, smiling again."I beg you won't presume upon our former slight acquaintance," said Tom,
hastily."I shall be so busily occupied that I really can't give you any
attention.""Then I must shift for myself, I suppose," said Dan, good-humoredly."Go first, if you like," said Tom, superciliously."He doesn't want to go down with me," thought Dan."Perhaps I shall
surprise him a little;" and he made his way down stairs.As Dan entered the parlors he saw the young lady in whose honor the
party was given only a few feet distant.He advanced with perfect ease, and paid his respects."I am very glad to see you here this evening, Mr.Mordaunt," said Julia,
cordially."I had no idea he would look
so well."Mentally she pronounced him the handsomest young gentleman present."Take your partners for a quadrille, young gentlemen," announced the
master of ceremonies."Not as yet," answered the young lady, smiling.So it happened that as Tom Carver entered the room, he beheld, to his
intense surprise and disgust, Dan leading the young hostess to her place
in the quadrille."I suppose he
never attempted to dance in his life.It will be fun to watch his
awkwardness.I am very much surprised that Julia should condescend to
dance with him--a common newsboy."At first Tom thought he wouldn't dance, but Mrs.Rogers approaching
said:

"Tom, there's Jane Sheldon.Accordingly Tom found himself leading up a little girl of eight.There was no place except in the quadrille in which Dan and Julia Rogers
were to dance.Tom found himself one of the "sides.""Good-evening, Julia," he said, catching the eye of Miss Rogers."I am too late to be your partner.""Yes, but you see I am not left a wall-flower," said the young lady,
smiling.Mordaunt kindly relieved me of that apprehension.""You are fortunate," said Tom, sneering."I leave my partner to thank you for that compliment," said Julia,
determined not to gratify Tom by appearing to understand the sneer."There's no occasion," said Tom, rudely."I am glad of it," said Dan, "for I am so unused to compliments that I
am afraid I should answer awkwardly.""I can very well believe that," returned Tom, significantly.She looked offended rather for she felt that
rudeness to her partner reflected upon herself.But here the music struck up, and the quadrille began."Now for awkwardness," said Tom to himself, and he watched Dan closely.But, to his surprise, nothing could be neater or better modulated than
Dan's movements.Instead of hopping about, as Tom thought he would, he
was thoroughly graceful."Where could the fellow have learned to dance?"he asked himself, in
disappointment.Julia was gratified; for, to tell the truth, she too had not been
altogether without misgivings on the subject of Dan's dancing, and,
being herself an excellent dancer, she would have found it a little
disagreeable if Dan had proved awkward.The quadrille proceeded, and Tom was chagrined that the newsboy, as he
mentally termed Dan, had proved a better dancer than himself."Oh, well, it's easy to dance in a quadrille," he said to himself, by
way of consolation."He won't venture on any of the round dances."But as Dan was leading Julia to her seat he asked her hand in the next
polka, and was graciously accepted.He then bowed and left her, knowing that he ought not to monopolize the
young hostess.Although Tom had told Dan not to expect any attentions from him, he was
led by curiosity to accost our hero."It seems that newsboys dance," said he."But it was not in very good taste for you to engage Miss Rogers for the
first dance.""Somebody had to be prominent, or Miss Rogers would have been left to
dance by herself.""There are others who would have made more suitable partners for her.""I am sorry to have stood in your way."I shall have plenty of opportunities of dancing
with her, and you won't.I suppose she took pity on you, as you know no
other young lady here."Just then a pretty girl, beautifully dressed, approached Dan.Mordaunt," she said, offering her hand with a beaming
smile."Good-evening, Miss Carroll," said Dan.In a minute Dan was whirling round the room with the young lady, greatly
to Tom's amazement, for Edith Carroll was from a family of high social
standing, living on Murray Hill."How in the duse does Dan Mordaunt know that girl?"To Tom's further disappointment Dan danced as gracefully in the galop as
in the quadrille.When the galop was over, Dan promenaded with another young lady, whose
acquaintance he had made at dancing-school, and altogether seemed as
much at his ease as if he had been attending parties all his life.Tom managed to obtain Edith Carroll as a partner."I didn't know you were acquainted with Dan Mordaunt," he said."Oh, yes, I know him very well.Why I think he dances _beautifully_,
and so do all the girls.""How do the girls know how he dances?""Why he goes to our dancing-school.The professor says he is his best
pupil."That's fortunate for him," said Tom, with a sneer."Perhaps he may
become a dancing-master in time.""He would make a good one, but I don't think he's very likely to do
that.""It would be a good thing for him.He is as well-dressed as any
young gentleman here."This was true, and Tom resented it.He felt that Dan had no right to
dress well."He ought not to spend so much money on dress when he has his mother to
support," he said, provoked."It seems to me you take a great deal of interest in Mr.Mordaunt," said
the young beauty, pointedly."Oh, no; he can do as he likes for all me, but, of course, when a boy
in his position dresses as if he were rich one can't help noticing it.""I am sure he can't be very poor, or he could not attend Dodworth's
dancing-school.At any rate I like to dance with him, and I don't care
whether he's poor or rich."Presently Tom saw Dan dancing the polka with Julia Rogers, and with the
same grace that he had exhibited in the other dances.He felt jealous, for he fancied himself a favorite with Julia, because
their families being intimate, he saw a good deal of her.On the whole Tom was not enjoying the party.He did succeed, however, in
obtaining the privilege of escorting Julia to supper.Just in front of him was Dan, escorting a young lady from Fifth avenue.Mordaunt appears to be enjoying himself," said Julia Rogers."Yes, he has plenty of cheek," muttered Tom."Excuse me, Tom, but do you think such expressions suitable for such an
occasion as this?""I am sorry you don't like it, but I never saw a more forward or
presuming fellow than this Dan Mordaunt.""I beg you to keep your opinion to yourself," said Julia Rogers, with
dignity."I find he is a great favorite with all the young ladies here.I had no idea he knew so many of them."It seemed to him that all the girls were infatuated with
a common newsboy, while his vanity was hurt by finding himself quite
distanced in the race.About twelve o'clock the two boys met in the dressing-room."You seemed to enjoy yourself," said Tom, coldly."Yes, thanks to your kind attentions," answered Dan, with a smile."It
is pleasant to meet old friends, you know.By the way, I suppose we
shall meet at Miss Carroll's party.""So the young lady tells me," answered Dan, smiling."I suppose _you'll_ be giving a fashionable party next," said Tom, with
a sneer.But Dan's dreams were by no means sweet that night.When he reached home, it was to hear of a great and startling
misfortune.At half-past twelve Dan ascended the stairs to his mother's room.He had
promised to come in and tell her how he had enjoyed himself at the
party.He was in excellent spirits on account of the flattering
attentions he had received.It was in this frame of mind that he opened
the door.What was his surprise, even consternation, when his mother
advanced to meet him with tearful eyes and an expression of distress."Oh, Dan, I am so glad you have got home!""I am quite well, Dan; but Althea----"

And Mrs.You don't mean she is----"

He couldn't finish the sentence, but his mother divined what he meant.she said, "but she has disappeared--she has been
stolen."Mordaunt told what she knew, but that related only to the
particulars of the abduction.We are in a position to tell the reader
more, but it will be necessary to go back for a month, and transfer the
scene to another continent.In a spacious and handsomely furnished apartment at the West End of
London sat the lady who had placed Althea in charge of the Mordaunts.She was deep in thought, and that not of an agreeable nature."I fear," she said to herself, "that trouble awaits me.John Hartley,
whom I supposed to be in California, is certainly in London.I cannot be
mistaken in his face, and I certainly saw him in Hyde Park to-day.I don't know, but I fear he did.If so, he will not long
delay in making his appearance.Then I shall be persecuted, but I must
be firm.He shall not learn through me where Althea is.He is her
father, it is true, but he has forfeited all claim to her guardianship.A confirmed gambler and drunkard, he would soon waste her fortune,
bequeathed her by her poor mother.He can have no possible claim to it;
for, apart from his having had no hand in leaving it to her, he was
divorced from my poor sister before her death."At this point there was a knock at the door of the room.There entered a young servant-maid, who courtesied, and said:

"Mrs.Vernon, there is a gentleman who wishes to see you.""Yes, mum; he said his name was Bancroft."I know no one of that name," mused the lady."Well, Margaret,
you may show him up, and you may remain in the anteroom within call."Her eyes were fixed upon the door with natural curiosity, when her
visitor entered.Instantly her face flushed, and her eyes sparkled with anger."I see you know me, Harriet Vernon," he said."It is some time since we
met, is it not?I am charmed, I am sure, to see my sister-in-law looking
so well."He sank into a chair without waiting for an invitation."When did you change your name to Bancroft?"demanded the lady,
abruptly."Oh," he said, showing his teeth, "that was a little ruse.I feared you
would have no welcome for John Hartley, notwithstanding our near
relationship, and I was forced to sail under false colors.""It was quite in character," said Mrs.Vernon, coldly; "you were always
false.The slender tie that
connected us was broken when my sister obtained a divorce from you.""You think so, my lady," said the visitor, dropping his tone of mocking
badinage, and regarding her in a menacing manner, "but you were never
more mistaken.You may flatter yourself that you are rid of me, but you
flatter yourself in vain.""Do you come here to threaten me, John Hartley?""I come here to ask for my child."Where you cannot get at her," answered Mrs."Don't think to put me off in that way," he said, fiercely."Don't think to terrify me, John Hartley," said the lady,
contemptuously."I am not so easily alarmed as your poor wife."Hartley looked at her as if he would have assaulted her had he dared,
but she knew very well that he did not dare.He was a bully, but he was
a coward."You refuse, then, to tell me what you have done with my child?"A father has some rights, and the law will not permit
his child to be kept from him.""Does your anxiety to see Althea arise from parental affection?"she
asked, in a sarcastic tone.I have a right to the custody of my
child.""I suppose you have a right to waste her fortune also at the
gaming-table.""I have a right to act as my child's guardian," he retorted."Why should you not, John Hartley?You
ill-treated and abused her mother.Fortunately, she escaped from you before it was all gone.But you
shortened her life, and she did not long survive the separation.It was
her last request that I should care for her child--that I should, above
all, keep her out of your clutches.I made that promise, and I mean to
keep it.""You poisoned my wife's mind against me," he said."But for your cursed
interference we should never have separated.""You are right, perhaps, in your last statement.I certainly did urge my
sister to leave you.I obtained her consent to the application for a
divorce, but as to poisoning her mind against you, there was no need of
that.By your conduct and your treatment you destroyed her love and
forfeited her respect, and she saw the propriety of the course which I
recommended.""I didn't come here to be lectured.You can spare your invectives,
Harriet Vernon.I was not a model husband,
perhaps, but I was as good as the average.""If that is the case, Heaven help the woman who marries!""Or the man that marries a woman like you!""You are welcome to your opinion of me.I am entirely indifferent to
your good or bad opinion."I don't recognize your right to question me on this subject, but I
will answer you.He appeared to be occupied with
some thought.When he spoke it was in a more conciliatory tone."I don't doubt that she is in good hands," he said."I am sure you will
treat her kindly.Perhaps you are a better guardian than I. I am willing
to leave her in your hands, but I ought to have some compensation.""Althea has a hundred thousand dollars, yielding at least five thousand
dollars income.Probably her expenses are little more than one-tenth of
this sum.Give me half her income--say
three thousand dollars annually--and I will give you and her no further
trouble.""I thought that was the object of your visit," said Mrs."I was right in giving you no credit for parental affection.In regard
to your proposition, I cannot entertain it.You had one half of my
sister's fortune, and you spent it.You have no further claim on her
money.""Then I swear to you that I will be even with you.I will find the
child, and when I do you shall never see her again.""Margaret," she said, coldly, "will you show this gentleman out?""You are certainly very polite, Harriet Vernon," he said."You are bold,
too, for you are defying me, and that is dangerous.You had better
reconsider your determination, before it is too late.""It will never be too late; I can at any time buy you off," she said,
contemptuously."We shall see," he hissed, eying her malignantly.Vernon, when her visitor had been shown out,
"never admit that person again; I am always out to him.""I wonder who 'twas," she thought, curiously.John Hartley, when a young man, had wooed and won Althea's mother.Julia
Belmont was a beautiful and accomplished girl, an heiress in her own
right, and might have made her choice among at least a dozen suitors.That she should have accepted the hand of John Hartley, a banker's
clerk, reputed "fast," was surprising, but a woman's taste in such a
case is often hard to explain or justify.Vernon--strenuously objected to the match, and by so doing gained the
hatred of her future brother-in-law.Opposition proved ineffectual, and
Julia Belmont became Mrs.Her fortune amounted to two hundred
thousand dollars.The trustee and her sister succeeded in obtaining her
consent that half of this sum should be settled on herself, and her
issue, should she have any.John Hartley resigned his position
immediately after marriage, and declined to enter upon any business."Julia and I have enough to live upon.If I am
out of business I can devote myself more entirely to her."This reasoning satisfied his young wife, and for a time all went well.But Hartley joined a fashionable club, formed a taste for gambling,
indulged in copious libations, not unfrequently staggering home drunk,
to the acute sorrow of his wife, and then excesses soon led to
ill-treatment.The money, which he could spend in a few years, melted
away, and he tried to gain possession of the remainder of his wife's
property.But, meanwhile, Althea was born, and a consideration for her
child's welfare strengthened the wife in her firm refusal to accede to
this unreasonable demand."You shall have the income, John," she said--"I will keep none back; but
the principal must be kept for Althea.""You care more for the brat than you do for me," he muttered."I care for you both," she answered."You know how the money would go,
John."That meddling sister of yours has put you up to this," he said,
angrily.It is right, and I have decided for myself.""I feel that in refusing I am doing my duty by you.""It is a strange way--to oppose your husband's wishes.Women ought never
to be trusted with money--they don't know how to take care of it.""You are not the person to say this, John.In five years you have wasted
one hundred thousand dollars.""It was bad luck in investments," he replied.Investing money at the gaming-table is not
very profitable.""Do you mean to insult me, madam?""I am only telling the sad truth, John."She withdrew, flushed and indignant, for she had spirit enough to resent
this outrage, and he left the house in a furious rage.When Hartley found that there was no hope of carrying his point, all
restraint seemed removed.He plunged into worse excesses, and his
treatment became so bad that Mrs.Hartley consented to institute
proceedings for divorce.It was granted, and the child was given to her.When he returned his wife had died of
pneumonia, and her sister--Mrs.Vernon, now a widow--had assumed the
care of Althea.An attempt to gain possession of the child induced her
to find another guardian for the child.This was the way Althea had
come into the family of our young hero.Thus much, that the reader may understand the position of affairs, and
follow intelligently the future course of the story.When John Hartley left the presence of his sister-in-law, he muttered
maledictions upon her."I'll have the child yet, if only to spite her," he muttered, between
his teeth."I won't allow a jade to stand between me and my own flesh
and blood.I must think of some plan to circumvent her."He had absolutely no clew, and little money to assist
him in his quest.But Fortune, which does not always favor the brave,
but often helps the undeserving, came unexpectedly to his help.At an American banker's he ran across an old acquaintance--one who had
belonged to the same club as himself in years past."What are you doing here, Hartley?"By the way, I was reminded of you not long since.""I saw your child in Union Square, in New York.""Are you sure it was my
child?""Of course; I used to see it often, you know."Don't _you_ know where she lives?""No; her aunt is keeping the child from me.She was with a middle-aged lady, who evidently
was suspicious of me, for she did not bring out the child but once more,
and was clearly anxious when I took notice of her.""She was acting according to instructions, no doubt.""So do I. Why do they keep _you_ away from her?""Because she has money, and they wish to keep it in their hands," said
Hartley, plausibly.She is living
here in London, doubtless on my little girl's fortune."John Hartley knew that this was not true, for Mrs.Vernon was a rich
woman; but it suited his purpose to say so, and the statement was
believed by his acquaintance."This is bad treatment, Hartley," he said, in a tone of sympathy."What are you going to do about it?""Try to find out where the child is placed, and get possession of her."This information John Hartley felt to be of value.It narrowed his
search, and made success much less difficult.In order to obtain more definite information, he lay in wait for Mrs.Margaret at first repulsed him, but a sovereign judiciously slipped into
her hand convinced her that Hartley was quite the gentleman, and he had
no difficulty, by the promise of a future douceur, in obtaining her
co-operation."If it's no harm you mean my
missus----"

"Certainly not, but she is keeping my child from me.You can understand
a father's wish to see his child, my dear girl.""Indeed, I think it's cruel to keep her from you, sir.""Then look over your mistress' papers and try to obtain the street and
number where she is boarding in New York."Of course you have, sir," said the girl, readily.So it came about that the girl obtained Dan's address, and communicated
it to John Hartley.As soon as possible afterward Hartley sailed for New York."I'll secure the child," he said to himself, exultingly, "and then my
sweet sister-in-law must pay roundly for her if she wants her back."All which attested the devoted love of John Hartley for his child.ALTHEA'S ABDUCTION.Arrived in New York, John Hartley lost no time in ascertaining where Dan
and his mother lived.In order the better to watch without incurring
suspicion, he engaged by the week a room in a house opposite, which,
luckily for his purpose, happened to be for rent.It was a front window,
and furnished him with a post of observation from which he could see who
went in and out of the house opposite.Hartley soon learned that it would not be so easy as he had anticipated
to gain possession of the little girl.She never went out alone, but
always accompanied either by Dan or his mother.If, now, Althea were attending school, there
would be an opportunity to kidnap her.As it was, he was at his wits'
end.Mordaunt chanced to need some small
article necessary to the work upon which she was engaged.She might
indeed wait until the next day, but she was repairing a vest of Dan's,
which he would need to wear in the morning, and she did not like to
disappoint him."My child," she said, "I find I must go out a little while.""I want to buy some braid to bind Dan's vest.He will want to wear it in
the morning.""May I go with you, mamma?"You can be reading your picture-book till I come back.Mordaunt put on her street dress, and left the house in the
direction of Eighth avenue, where there was a cheap store at which she
often traded.No sooner did Hartley see her leave the house, as he could readily do,
for the night was light, than he hurried to Union Square, scarcely five
minutes distant, and hailed a cab-driver."Do you want a job, my man?""There is nothing wrong, sir, I hope."My child has been kidnapped during my absence in Europe."She is in the custody of some designing persons, who keep possession
of her on account of a fortune which she is to inherit.She does not
know me to be her father, we have been so long separated; but I feel
anxious to take her away from her treacherous guardians."I've got a little girl of my own, and I understand
your feelings.Fifteen minutes afterward the cab drew
up before Mrs.Brown's door, and Hartley, springing from it, rang the
bell.Brown was out, and a servant answered the
bell."A lady lives here with a little girl," he said, quickly."Precisely; and the little girl is named Althea."Mordaunt has been run over by a street-car, and been carried into
my house.She wishes the little girl to come at once to her.""I am afraid her leg is broken; but I can't wait.Will you bring the
little girl down at once?"Nancy went up stairs two steps at a time, and broke into Mrs."Put on your hat at once, Miss Althea," she said."But she said she was coming right back.""She's hurt, and she can't come, and she has sent for you."But how shall I know where to go, Nancy?""There's a kind gentleman at the door with a carriage.Your ma has been
taken to his home."I'm afraid mamma's been killed," she said."No, she hasn't, or how could she send for you?"This argument tended to reassure Althea, and she put on her little shawl
and hat, and hurried down stairs.Hartley was waiting for her impatiently, fearing that Mrs.Mordaunt
would come back sooner than was anticipated, and so interfere with the
fulfillment of his plans."So she calls this woman mamma," said Hartley to himself."Not very badly, but she cannot come home to-night.Get into the
carriage, and I will tell you about it as we are riding to her."He hurried the little girl into the carriage, and taking a seat beside
her, ordered the cabman to drive on.He had before directed him to drive to the South Ferry."She was crossing the street," said Hartley, "when she got in the way of
a carriage and was thrown down and run over."The carriage was not a heavy one, luckily, and
she is only badly bruised.She will be all right in a few days."John Hartley was a trifle inconsistent in his stories, having told the
servant that Mrs.Mordaunt had been run over by a street-car; but in
truth he had forgotten the details of his first narrative, and had
modified it in the second telling.However, Nancy had failed to tell the
child precisely how Mrs.Mordaunt had been hurt, and she was not old
enough to be suspicious."Not far from here," answered Hartley, evasively."Then I shall soon see mamma.""No, not my own mamma, but I call her so."My papa is a very bad man."I thought this was some of Harriet Vernon's work," said Hartley to
himself."It seems like my amiable sister-in-law.She might have been in
better business than poisoning my child's mind against me."he asked, partly out of curiosity, but mainly
to occupy the child's mind, so that she might not be fully conscious of
the lapse of time."Oh, yes; Dan is a nice boy.He has gone to a party
to-night.""And he won't be home till late."I am glad of that," thought Hartley.He goes down town every morning, and he doesn't come home
till supper time."Hartley managed to continue his inquiries about Dan, but at last Althea
became restless."I don't see how mamma could have gone so far.""I see how it is," he said."The cab-driver lost the way, and that has
delayed us."Meanwhile they reached the South
Ferry, and Hartley began to consider in what way he could explain their
crossing the water.After a moment's thought Hartley took a flask from his pocket, into
which he had dropped a sleeping potion, and offered it to the child."Drink, my dear," he said; "it will do you good."It was a sweet wine and pleasant to the taste."It is a cordial," answered Hartley.I will ask mamma to get some."I feel very sleepy," said Althea, drowsily, the potion having already
begun to attack her.The innocent and unsuspecting child did as she was directed.She struggled against the increasing drowsiness, but in
vain."There will be no further trouble," thought Hartley."When she wakes up
it will be morning.It might have been supposed that some instinct of parental affection
would have made it disagreeable to this man to kidnap his own child by
such means, but John Hartley had never been troubled with a heart or
natural affections.He was supremely selfish, and surveyed the sleeping
child as coolly and indifferently as if he had never before set eyes
upon her.Two miles and a half beyond the South Ferry, in a thinly settled
outlying district of Brooklyn, stood a three-story brick house, shabby
and neglected in appearance, bearing upon a sign over the door the name


         DONOVAN'S

     WINES AND LIQUORS.It was the nightly resort of a set of rough and lawless men, many of
them thieves and social outlaws, who drank and smoked as they sat at
small tables in the sand-strewn bar-room.Hugh Donovan himself had served a term at Sing Sing for burglary, and
was suspected to be indirectly interested in the ventures of others
engaged in similar offenses, though he managed to avoid arrest.John Hartley ordered the hackman to stop.He sprang from the carriage,
and unceremoniously entered the bar-room.Donovan, a short, thickset man
with reddish whiskers, a beard of a week's growth, and but one
serviceable eye, sat in a wooden arm-chair, smoking a clay pipe.There
were two other men in the room, and a newsboy sat dozing on a settee.Donovan looked up, and his face assumed a look of surprise as he met the
glance of the visitor, whom he appeared to know.he asked, taking the pipe from
his mouth."I have a job for her and for you."I want her taken care of for a few
days or weeks.""Shure, the old woman isn't a very good protector for a gal.There are reasons--imperative reasons--why the girl
should be concealed for a time, and I can think of no other place than
this."I have little time for explanation, but I may
tell you that she has been kept from me by my enemies, who wanted to get
hold of her money.""Did the old lady leave it all away from you, then?The least I can expect is to be made guardian of my
own child.Is there no way of getting up stairs
except by passing through the bar-room?"Hartley, we can go up the back way.At the rear of the house was a stair-way, up which he
clambered, bearing the sleeping child in his arms.Donovan pushed the door open, and disclosed a dirty room, with his
better-half--a tall, gaunt woman--reclining in a rocking-chair,
evidently partially under the influence of liquor, as might be guessed
from a black bottle on a wooden table near by.She stared in astonishment at her husband's companions."Shure, Hugh, who is it you're bringin' here?""It's a child, old woman, that you're to have the care of.""Divil a bit do I want a child to worrit me.""Will I get the money, or Hugh?""You shall have half, Bridget," said her husband."I will pay ten dollars a week--half to you, and half to your husband,"
said Hartley."Here's a week's pay in advance," and he took out two
five-dollar bills, one of which was eagerly clutched by Mrs."I'll take care of her," said she, readily."Shure that's a quare name.You can call her any name you like," said
Hartley, indifferently."Perhaps you had better call her Katy, as there
may be a hue and cry after her, and that may divert suspicion."Donovan, and she opened the door of a small
room, in which was a single untidy bed.I gave her a sleeping potion--otherwise
she might have made a fuss, for she doesn't know me to be her father."Donovan, I depend upon your keeping her safe.It will not do
to let her escape, for she might find her way back to the people from
whom I have taken her.""Say nothing about me in connection with the matter, Donovan.I will
communicate with you from time to time.If the police are put on the
track, I depend on your sending her away to some other place of
security."I shall go back to New York at once.I must leave
you to pacify her as well as you can when she awakes."I'll trate her like my own child," said Mrs.Had Hartley been a devoted father, this assurance from the coarse,
red-faced woman would have been satisfactory, but he cared only for the
child as a means of replenishing his pockets, and gave himself no
trouble.The hackman was still waiting at the door."It's a queer place to leave a child," thought he, as his experienced
eye took in the features of the place."It appears to be a liquor
saloon.However, it is none of
my business."Driver, I am ready," said Hartley."Go over Fulton Ferry, and leave me at your stand in Union Square."Hartley threw himself back on the seat, and
gave himself up to pleasant self-congratulation."I think this will bring Harriet Vernon to terms," he said."She will
find that she can't stand between me and my child.If she will make it
worth my while, she shall have the child back, but I propose to see that
my interests are secured."The next morning Hartley stepped into an up-town hotel, and wrote a
letter to his sister-in-law in London, demanding that four thousand
dollars be sent him yearly, in quarterly payments, in consideration of
which he agreed to give up the child, and abstain from further
molestation.ALTHEA BECOMES KATY DONOVAN.The sleeping potion which had been administered to Althea kept her in
sound sleep till eight o'clock the next morning.When her eyes opened,
and she became conscious of her surroundings, she looked about her in
surprise.Then she sat up in bed and gazed wildly at the torn wall paper
and dirty and shabby furniture.The door opened, and the red and inflamed face of Mrs."I want mamma," answered the child, still more frightened."Shure I'm your ma, child.""No, you are not," said Althea.I sent you away to board, but
you've come home to live with your ma."You are a bad woman," returned the child,
ready to cry."It's a purty thing for a child to tell her ma she's lyin'.""Don't you go
on talkin' that way, but get right up, or you sha'n't have any
breakfast.""Oh, send me back to my mother and Dan!""Dress yourself, and I'll see about it," said Mrs.Althea looked for her clothes, but could not find them.In their place
she found a faded calico dress and some ragged undergarments, which had
once belonged to a daughter of Mrs."Those clothes are not mine," said Althea."I had a pretty pink dress and a nice new skirt.These was the clothes you took off last night,"
said Mrs."I won't put this dress on," said the child, indignantly."Then you'll have to lay abed all day, and won't get nothing to eat,"
said the woman."Shure you're a quare child to ask your own mother's name."That's a quare name intirely.I'm afraid
you're gone crazy, Katy."Was it possible that she could be Katy Donovan,
and that this red-faced woman was her mother?She began to doubt her own
identity.She could not remember this woman, but was it possible that
there was any connection between them?"I used to live in New York with Mamma Mordaunt.""Well, you're livin' in Brooklyn now with Mamma Donovan.""Shure I shouldn't have sent you away from me to have you come home and
deny your own mother.""Will you let me go to New York and see Mamma Mordaunt?"asked Althea,
after a pause."If you're a good girl, perhaps I will.Now get up, and I'll give you
some breakfast."With a shudder of dislike Althea arrayed herself in the dirty garments
of the real Katy Donovan, and looked at her image in the cracked mirror
with a disgust which she could not repress.Hartley had suggested that her own garments should be taken away in
order to make her escape less feasible.She opened the door, and entered the room in which Mrs.Donovan had set
the table for breakfast.As she came in at one door, Hugh Donovan entered at another."Come here, little gal," he said, with a grin.Althea looked at him with real terror.Certainly Hugh Donovan was not a
man to attract a child.Althea at once thought of an ogre whom Dan had described to her in a
fairy story, and half fancied that she was in the power of such a
creature."I don't want to," said the child, trembling."Go to your father, Katy," said Mrs.Althea shuddered at the idea, and she gazed as if
fascinated at his one eye."Yes, come to your pa," said Donovan, jeeringly."I like little
gals--'specially when they're my own.""Yes, you be, and don't you deny it.The little girl began to cry in nervous terror, and Donovan laughed,
thinking it a good joke."Well, it'll do after breakfast," he said."Sit up, child, and we'll see
what the ould woman has got for us."Donovan did not excel as a cook, but Althea managed to eat a little
bread and butter, for neither of which articles the lady of the house
was responsible.When the meal was over she said:

"Now, will you take me back to New York?""You are not going back at all," said Hugh."You are our little girl,
and you are going to live with us."Althea looked from one to the other in terror.Was it possible they
could be in earnest?She was forced to believe it, and was overwhelmed
at the prospect.She burst into a tempest of sobs.Hugh Donovan's face darkened, and his anger was kindled."Stop it now, if you know what's best for yourself!"Althea was terrified, but she could not at once control her emotion.Her husband took it,
and brandished it menacingly."Yes," said Althea, trembling, stopping short, as if fascinated."Then you'll feel it if you don't stop your howlin'."Althea gazed at him horror-stricken."I thought you'd come to your senses," he said, in a tone of
satisfaction."Kape her safe, old woman, till she knows how to behave."In silent misery the little girl sat down and watched Mrs.Donovan as
she cleared away the table, and washed the dishes.It was dull and
hopeless work for her.Mordaunt and Dan,
and wished she could be with them again.The thought so saddened her that she burst into a low moan, which
at once drew the attention of Mrs."I can't help it," moaned Althea.See here, now," and the woman displayed the whip
with which her husband had threatened the child."I'll give ye something
to cry for.""Oh, don't--don't beat me!""Ye want to run away," said Mrs.I mean I won't unless you let me."asked Althea, with her little heart
sinking at the thought."No, Katy, you may go wid me when I go to the market," answered Mrs."Shure, if you'll be a good gal, I'll give you all the pleasure
I can."Althea waited half an hour, and then was provided with a ragged
sun-bonnet, with which, concealing her sad face, she emerged from the
house, and walked to a small market, where Mrs.Donovan obtained her
supplies for dinner.Troubled as she was, Althea looked about her with a child's curiosity on
her way through the strange streets.It served to divert her from her
sorrow."Shure it's my little Katy," said the woman, with a significant wink
which prevented further questioning.Althea wished to deny this, but she did not dare to.She had become
afraid of her new guardians.She felt
sure that he would take her away from these wicked people, but how was
Dan to know where she was.The poor child's lips quivered, and she could
hardly refrain from crying.It was so late when Dan heard of Althea's disappearance that he felt it
necessary to wait till morning before taking any steps toward her
recovery."I'll find her, mother," he said, confidently."Do not lie awake
thinking of her, for it won't do any good."I didn't know how much I loved the dear child
till I lost her.""I am not so hopeful as you, Dan.I fear that I shall never see her
again."Now, mother, I am going to bed, but I shall be up
bright and early in the morning, and then to work.""You won't have any time, Dan.Rogers,
telling him my reasons, and he will be sure not to object.If Althea is
to be found, I will find her within a week."Mordaunt some courage, but she could not
feel as sanguine of success as Dan.In the morning Dan sought out Nancy, and took down her account of how
the little girl had been spirited away."So she went away in a carriage, Nancy?""Can you tell me what sort of a looking man it was that took her away?"I was struck dumb, you see, wid hearing how your
mother broke her leg, and I didn't think to look at him sharp.""You can tell if he was an old man or a young one."He was betwixt and betwane."Now, what kind of a carriage was it?""Jist a hack like them at the square.""No; shure they all look alike to me."Dan made more inquiries, but elicited nothing further that was likely to
be of service to him.After a little reflection he decided to go to Union Square and
interview some of the drivers waiting for passengers there.He did so, but the driver who had actually been employed by Hartley was
absent, and he learned nothing.One driver, however, remembered carrying
a gentleman and child to a house on Twenty-seventh street, between
Eighth and Ninth avenues.Dan thought the clew of sufficient importance to be followed up.His
courage rose when, on inquiring at the house mentioned, he learned that
a child had actually been brought there."May I see the child, madam?""If you like," answered the lady, in surprise.She appeared in a short time with a boy of about Althea's age."It is a little girl I am inquiring after," he said."You would
have saved me some trouble.""I begin to think I am not as good a detective as I thought," said Dan
to himself."I am on a false scent, that is sure."When he had been asking questions of the cab-drivers he had not been
unobserved.John Hartley, who knew Dan by sight, laughed in his sleeve
as he noted our hero's inquiries."You may be a smart boy, my lad," he said to himself, "but I don't think
you'll find the child.I have a great mind to give you a hint."He approached Dan, and observed, in a friendly way:

"Are you in search of your little sister?""Yes, sir," returned Dan, eagerly."I am not sure, but possibly I may.I occupy a room directly opposite
the house in which you board.""Did you see Althea carried away?""Yes; I was sitting at my window when I saw a hack stop at your door.The door-bell was rung by a man who descended from the hack, and shortly
afterward your sister came out, and was put into the carriage.""What was the man's appearance, sir?"So much the better," thought Hartley, with satisfaction."He was a little taller than myself, I should say," he answered, "and I
believe his hair was brown"--Hartley's was black."I am sorry I can't
remember more particularly."I came down into the street before the cab
drove away, and I heard the gentleman referred to say, in a low voice,
'Drive to Harlem.'""Thank you, sir," said Dan, gratefully."That puts me on the right
track."I wish I could tell you more," said Hartley, with a queer smile."If you find your little sister, I should be glad if you would let me
know," continued Hartley, chuckling inwardly."I will, sir, if you will let me know your name and address.""My name is John Franklin, and I live in the house directly opposite
yours, No."All right, sir; I will note it down."John Hartley looked after Dan with a smile."My dear young friend," he said to himself, "it goes to my heart to
deceive you, you are so innocent and confiding.I wish you much joy of
your search in Harlem.I think it will be some time before I receive
intelligence of your success.Still I will keep my room here, and look
after you a little.I am really afraid your business will suffer while
you are wandering about."John Hartley had already written to London, and he was prepared to wait
three weeks or more for an answer to his proposition.Meanwhile he had
one source of uneasiness.His funds were getting low, and unless Harriet
Vernon responded favorably to his proposal, he was liable to be
seriously embarrassed.He had on previous similar occasions had recourse
to the gaming-table, but Fortune did not always decide in his favor.He
did not dare to hazard the small sum he had on hand, lest want of
success should imperil the bold scheme for obtaining an income at his
child's expense.At this critical point in his fortunes he fell in with a Western
adventurer, who, by a sort of freemasonry, recognizing Hartley's want of
character, cautiously sounded him as to becoming a partner in a
hazardous but probably profitable enterprise.It was to procure some
genuine certificates of stock in a Western railway for a small number of
shares, say five or ten, and raise them ingeniously to fifty and a
hundred, and then pledge them as collateral in Wall street for a
corresponding sum of money.John Hartley, if an honest man, would have indignantly declined the
overtures; but he was not endowed with Roman virtue.He made a cautious
investigation to ascertain how great was the danger of detection, and
how well the enterprise would pay.The answer to the second question was
so satisfactory that he made up his mind to run the necessary risk.Blake and he came to a definite understanding, and matters were put in
train.Certificates were readily obtained, and by the help of a skillful
accomplice, who did the work for a specified sum, were ingeniously
raised tenfold.Then Blake, assuming the dress and manners of a thriving business man
from Syracuse, negotiated a loan, pledging the raised certificate as
collateral.The private banker put it away among his securities without
a doubt or suspicion, and Blake and Hartley divided a thousand dollars
between them.John Hartley was very much elated by his success.The pecuniary
assistance came just in the nick of time, when his purse was very low."It's a good thing to have more than one string to your bow," he
thought."Not but that my little game in getting hold of the child is
likely to pay well.Harriet Vernon will find that I have the whip-hand
of her.She must come to my terms, sooner or later."At that very moment Harriet Vernon was embarking at Liverpool on a
Cunard steamer.She had received the letter of her brother-in-law, and
decided to answer it in person.DAN DISGUISES HIMSELF.For several days Dan strolled about Harlem, using his eyes to good
advantage.As a pretext he carried with him a few morning papers for
sale.Armed with these he entered shops and saloons without exciting
surprise or suspicion.But he discovered not a trace of the lost girl.One day, as he was riding home in the Third avenue cars, there flashed
upon his mind a conviction that he was on a wrong scent."Is it probable that the man who carried away Althea would give the
right direction so that it could be overheard by a third party?No; it
was probably meant as a blind, and I have been just fool enough to fall
into the trap."Before the day was over they were wholly opened.He met John Hartley on
Broadway toward the close of the afternoon."Well, have you heard anything of your sister?"he asked, with an
appearance of interest."Keep on, you will find her in time."After they parted, Dan, happening to look back, detected a mocking
glance in the face of his questioner, and a new discovery flashed upon
him.He had sent him to Harlem,
purposely misleading him."Can he have had anything to do
with the abduction of Althea?"This was a question which he could not satisfactorily answer, but he
resolved to watch Hartley, and follow him wherever he went, in the hope
of obtaining some clew.Of course he must assume some disguise, as
Hartley must not recognize him.He hired a room on East Fourth street for a week, and then sought an
Italian boy to whom he had occasionally given a few pennies, and with
some difficulty (for Giovanni knew but little English, and he no
Italian) proposed that the Italian should teach him to sing and play
"Viva Garibaldi."Dan could play a little on the violin, and soon
qualified himself for his new business.At a second-hand shop on Chatham street he picked up a suit of tattered
velvet, obtained a liquid with which to stain his skin to a dark brown,
and then started out as an Italian street musician.His masquerade suit
he kept in his room at East Fourth street, changing therefrom his street
dress morning and evening.When in full masquerade he for the first time
sang and played, Giovanni clapped his hands with delight.Giovanni was puzzled to understand why Dan took so much pains to enter
upon a hard and unprofitable profession, but Dan did not enlighten him
as to his motive.He thought it most prudent to keep his secret, even from his mother.One
day he met her on the sidewalk, and began to sing "Viva Garibaldi."Mordaunt listened without a suspicion that it was her own son, and
gave him two pennies, which he acknowledged by a low bow, and "Grazia,
signora.""I hope his padrone does not beat him," said Mrs."I hear these poor boys are much abused.I wonder if I can make him
understand?"Si, signora, padrone," answered Dan."It is no use; he doesn't understand English.Here is some more money
for you," and she handed him a five-cent coin."Its a wise mother that knows her own child," thought Dan.Hartley boarded a University Place car, and Dan jumped on also.Italian boys so seldom ride that the conductor eyed Dan with some
suspicion."I thought you might be expecting to ride for nothing," said the
conductor."Seems to me you're flush for an Italian fiddler.""And I don't understand your lingo."A charitable lady inside the car chanced to see Dan, and it occurred to
her that she would do him a service."If the conductor doesn't object, you may sing while we are on our way."You can sing and play," said the conductor, good-naturedly.Dan was not at all desirous of doing this, for Hartley sat only three
feet from him, and he feared he might recognize him, but it would not be
in character to refuse, so he began, and sang his one air, playing an
accompaniment.Several of the passengers handed him small coins, among
them Hartley."I can't agree with you, ma'am," said Hartley."I would rather give him
money to stop.""His voice strikes me as very rich, and the Italian is such a beautiful
language.""I have heard a good deal better performers even among the street boys,"
said Hartley."So have I," said Dan to himself."He doesn't suspect me; I am glad of
that."Hartley remained in the car till it reached the Astor House, and so, of
course, did Dan.In fact, Hartley was on his way to Brooklyn to pay
another installment to the guardians of the little girl whom he had
carried off.Hartley kept on his way to Fulton Ferry, Dan following at a prudent
distance.Had Hartley looked back, he would have suspected nothing, for he had not
penetrated Dan's disguise, and would therefore have been quite at a loss
to understand any connection between the street musician and himself.They both boarded the same ferry-boat, and landed in Brooklyn together.At this moment Hartley turned round, and his glance fell upon Dan."Si, signor," answered Dan, bowing deferentially."I sing, I play," said our hero."It is lucky you don't, or you might not like my compliment.""Shall I sing 'Viva Garibaldi?'"Here, take
this money, and don't sing.""Si, signor," answered Dan, assuming a look of bewilderment.Hartley prepared to board a car, which was not yet ready to start.Dan
rapidly decided that it would not do for him to follow Hartley any
farther.Looking about him, his eye fell
on a bright-looking newsboy of about twelve."Do you want to make some money, Johnny?""Did you speak to me, Garibaldi?""Yes, but I am no Italian," said Dan, rapidly."I am on the track of
that man, but he suspects me.I will give you a dollar if you will jump
on the car and find out where he goes."Pay your expenses out of it, and I will pay you back when you
report to me."The newsboy ran, jumped on the car, and it moved on."It is the best thing I could do," thought Dan."I hope the boy is
sharp, and won't lose sight of him.I feel sure that he had something
to do with carrying off poor little Althea."For two hours Dan lingered near the ferry, playing occasionally by way
of filling up the time.It seemed to be a good location, for he received
from fifty to sixty cents from passers-by."When hard times come," thought Dan, "I shall know what to do.I will
become an Italian street singer."After two hours the newsboy jumped off an incoming car, and approached
Dan.DAN MAKES A DISCOVERY.Dan's eyes sparkled with joy at the success of his plan."Now tell me," he said, drawing the newsboy aside to a place where they
would not be overheard."You've made a fortun' by fiddling, you have," said the newsboy, in
surprise.The newsboy described his following Hartley to Donovan's.Hartley went in, and he directly afterward."Perhaps he only went in for a drink," suggested Dan, uneasily."No, he didn't call for nothing to drink.I saw him take out some money
and give to the man and the woman."I axed old Donovan to buy a paper, and he wouldn't.Then I
sat down for a minute, makin' believe I was tired.They looked at me,
but I didn't appear to be noticin' 'em, and they let me stay.""Did you see anything of a little girl?""Yes, there was a little gal came in.Donovan's daughter, he feared, not the
child he was seeking.He added a description of the little girl which quite revived Dan's
hopes, for it answered in every respect to Althea."Did you hear the little girl say anything?""Yes, she told her mother she wanted to see Dan.""You needn't tell me any more."Have you found out what you want to know?"Have you anything to do for the next two hours?""Then I'll pay you another dollar to go to the place with me.I think I
could find it myself, but I can't take any chances.And don't say a word
about what you have seen.""She is my adopted sister, and she has been stolen from us.""Then I'd be willing to help you for nothing.I've got a little sister
about her size.If anybody stole her, I'd mash him!"The two boys boarded a car, and in forty minutes got out."That's the place," said the newsboy, pointing out Donovan's, only a few
rods away.You'd better leave me now, or you may be remembered, and
that would lead them to suspect me.If I do, it'll be through your help."He stopped in the street, and began
to sing "Viva Garibaldi."Two or three boys gathered about him, and finally a couple of men.One
of them handed him a three-cent piece."Grazio, signor," said Dan, pulling off his hat."What part of Italy do you come from?""Si, signor, I come from Italy," answered Dan, not considering it
prudent to understand too well."His hair doesn't look like that of most Italians."I'd know him for an Italian boy anywhere."At this moment the door of the saloon opened, and Dan, putting his
violin under his arm, entered.One was an Irishman, the other a German.Both
had evidently drank more than was good for them.Dan looked in vain for
Althea."Well, boy, what do you want?"asked Dan, uncertain whether he was talking
as an Italian boy might be expected to."No; I don't want to hear any fiddle-scraping.""Shure, let him play a little, Mister Donovan," said the Irishman."Just as you like," said Donovan, carelessly, "only I have no money for
him."Dan struck up his one tune--Viva Garibaldi--but the Irishman did not
seem to care for that."Oh, bother ould Garibaldi!"Accordingly he tried to play an air popular enough at the time, but
made bad work of it.exclaimed the German, who had a better musical ear
than the Irishman."Here, lend me your fiddle, boy."He took the violin, and in spite of his inebriety, managed to play a
German air upon it."Shure you bate the boy at his own trade," said the Irishman.The German indicated his preference, and the Irishman called for whisky."I no drink," answered our hero, shaking his head."Shure you're an Italian wonder, and it's Barnum ought to hire you.""Then you're a haythen," said Pat Moriarty.He gulped down the whisky, and finding it more convenient to sit than to
stand, fell back upon a settee."I wish Althea would come in," thought Dan.At that moment a heavy fall was heard in the room overhead, and a
child's shrill scream directly afterward."Something's happened to my wife," muttered Donovan.He hurried up stairs, and the German followed.This gave Dan an excuse
for running up, too.Donovan had been drinking more copiously than usual.While in this
condition she imprudently got upon a chair to reach a pitcher from an
upper shelf.Her footing was uncertain, and she fell over, pitcher in
hand, the chair sharing in the downfall.When her husband entered the room she was lying flat on her back,
grasping the handle of the pitcher, her eyes closed, and her breathing
stertorious.Althea, alarmed, stood over her, crying and screaming."The old woman's taken too much," said Donovan.he
shouted, leaning over his matrimonial partner."Ain't you ashamed of
yourself, now?"Donovan opened her eyes, and stared at him vacantly."On your back, you old fool, where you deserve to be.""It's the whisky," murmured the fallen lady.Why can't you drink dacent like me?Shure it's a purty
example you're settin' to the child.Ain't you ashamed to lie here in a
hape before them gintlemen?"This called Althea's attention to the German and Dan.In spite of Dan's
disguise, she recognized him with a cry of joy.she exclaimed, dashing past
Donovan, and clasping her arms round the supposed Italian.exclaimed Donovan, looking at the two in surprise."Oh, it's my brother Dan," exclaimed Althea."You'll take me away, won't
you, Dan?"So that's your game, my young chicken, is it?"demanded Donovan,
seizing our hero roughly by the shoulder.Then pulling off Dan's hat, he
added: "You're no more Italian than I am."Dan saw that it would be useless to keep up the deceit any longer.He
looked Donovan full in the face, and said, firmly:

"You are right, Mr.Donovan, I have come here for my sister."Donovan's red face turned fairly purple with rage.Why, I could crush you with my little
finger.""I have not insulted you," said Dan."I don't know anything about your sister."That little girl is my adopted sister," said Dan, pointing to Althea."Ask her if she doesn't know me.""That is my daughter, Katy Donovan," said the saloon keeper."No, I am not," said Althea, beginning to cry."I want to go away with
my brother Dan."Donovan," (by
this time she was on her feet, looking on in a dazed sort of way), "is
not this our little Katy?""You see, young man, you're mistaken.You can leave," and Donovan waved
his hand triumphantly.I can bring plenty of proof that Althea was until a week since
living with my mother."said Donovan, contemptuously snapping his
fingers."I know who stole her, and who brought her to this house," continued
Dan."The same man has been here to-day," added Dan.How much does he pay you for taking
care of the girl?""I can't waste my time
talkin' wid you."No, I won't, unless Althea goes with me," said Dan, firmly.We'll see about that," and Donovan, making a rush,
seized Dan in his arms, and carried him down stairs, despite our hero's
resistance."I'll tache you to come here insultin' your betters!"Dan struggled to get away, but though a strong boy, he was not a match
for a powerful man, and could not effect his deliverance.The Irishman
already referred to was still upon the settee.he asked, as the saloon-keeper appeared with his
burden."What's the lad been doin'?""What's he been doin', is it?He's been insultin' me to my face--that's
what the Donovans won't stand."Don't trouble me wid your questions, but do as I tell you.Not quite willingly, but reluctant to offend Donovan, who gave him
credit for the drinks, Barney raised a trap-door leading to the cellar
below.There was a ladder for the convenience of those wishing to ascend and
descend, but Donovan was not disposed to use much ceremony with the boy
who had offended him.He dropped him through the opening, Dan by good
luck falling on his feet."That's the best place for you, you young meddler!""You'll
find it mighty comfortable, and I wish you much joy.I won't charge you
no rint, and that's an object in these hard times--eh, Barney?""To be sure it is," said Barney; "but all the same, Donovan, I'd rather
pay rint up stairs, if I had my choice!""He hasn't the choice," said Donovan triumphantly."What's it all about now, Donovan?""He wanted to shtale my Katy," said Donovan.asked Donovan, not caring to go
into particulars.Barney indicated his choice with alacrity, and, after drinking, was
hardly in a condition to pursue his inquiries.DAN DISCOMFITS THE DONOVANS.Dan found himself at first bewildered and confused by his sudden descent
into the cellar.As his eyes became accustomed to the darkness, he was
able to get an idea of his surroundings.It was a common cellar with an
earthen floor.Ranged along one side was a row of kegs, some containing
whisky, others empty.Besides, there were a few boxes and odds and ends
which had been placed here to get them out of the way."Not a very cheerful-looking place," thought Dan, "though I do get it
rent free."He sat down on a box, and began to consider his position.The walls were solid, and although there was a narrow
window, consisting of a row of single panes, it was at the top of the
cellar, and not easily accessible.He might indeed reach it by the
ladder, but he would have to break the glass and crawl through, a mode
of escape likely to be attended by personal risk."No, that won't do," thought Dan."At any rate, I won't try it till
other things fail."Meanwhile Donovan, in the bar-room above, was in high good humor.He
felt that he had done a sharp thing, and more than once chuckled as he
thought of his prisoner below.Indeed he could not forbear, after about
half an hour, lifting the trap and calling down stairs:

"Hallo, there!""You're an impudent jackanapes!""You'll
get enough of it before you're through.""So will you," answered Dan, boldly."I'll take the risk," chuckled Donovan."Do you know what you remind me
of?""You're like a rat in a trap.""Not exactly," answered Dan, as a bright thought dawned upon him."Because a rat can do no harm, and I can."It occurred to Donovan that Dan might have some matches in his pocket,
and was momentarily alarmed at the thought that our hero might set the
house on fire."If you had," said the saloon-keeper, relieved, "it would do you no good
to set a fire."I don't mean to set the house on fire," said Dan, composedly.returned Dan, rising from his seat on the box.asked Donovan, following with his glance the
boy's motion."I'm going to take the spigot out of them
whisky-kegs, and let the whisky run out on the floor."exclaimed the saloon-keeper, now thoroughly
frightened.As he spoke Dan dextrously pulled the spigot from a keg, and Donovan, to
his dismay, heard the precious liquid--precious in his eyes--pouring out
upon the floor.With an exertion he raised the trap-door, hastily descended the ladder,
and rushed to the keg to replace the spigot.Meanwhile Dan ran up the ladder, pulled it after him, and made his late
jailer a captive."Put down the ladder, you young rascal!"roared Donovan, when, turning
from his work, he saw how the tables had been turned."It wouldn't be convenient just yet," answered Dan, coolly.He shut the trap-door, hastily lugged the ladder to the rear of the
house (unobserved, for there were no customers present), then dashed up
stairs and beckoned to Althea to follow him.Donovan was stupefied by liquor.Putting on her things, the little girl hastily and gladly obeyed.As they passed through the saloon, Donovan's execrations and shouts were
heard proceeding from the cellar."Never you mind, Althea," said Dan.The two children hurried to the nearest horse-car, which luckily came up
at the moment, and jumped on board.Dan looked back with a smile at the saloon, saying to himself:

"I rather think, Mr.Donovan, you've found your match this time.I hope
you'll enjoy the cellar as much as I did."In about an hour and a half Dan, holding Althea by the hand,
triumphantly led her into his mother's presence."I've brought her back, mother," he said."Oh, my dear, dear little girl!""I
thought I should never, never see you again.But we will not wait to hear a twice-told tale.Rather let us return to
Donovan, where the unhappy proprietor is still a captive in his own
cellar.Here he remained till his cries attracted the attention of a
wondering customer, who finally lifted the trap-door."What are you doin' down there?""Put down the ladder and let me up first of all."It was a considerable time before the ladder was found.Then the
saloon-keeper emerged from his prison in a very bad humor."I wish I had left you there," said the customer, with justifiable
indignation."This is your gratitude for my trouble, is it?""Excuse me, but I'm so mad with that cursed boy."Come, that's talking," said the placated customer."Wait a minute," said Donovan, a sudden fear possessing him.He rushed up stairs and looked for Althea.His wife was lying on the floor, breathing heavily, but the little girl
was gone.exclaimed Donovan,
sinking into a chair.Then, in a blind fury with the wife who didn't prevent the little girl's
recapture, he seized a pail of water and emptied it over the face of the
prostrate woman.Donovan came to, and berated her husband furiously."Serves you right, you jade!"It was certainly an unlucky day for the Donovans.After calling at Donovan's, on the day when Dan recovered Althea, John
Hartley crossed the Courtlandt street ferry, and took a train to
Philadelphia with Blake, his accomplice in the forged certificates.The
two confederates had raised some Pennsylvania railway certificates,
which they proposed to put on the Philadelphia market.They spent several days in the Quaker City, and thus Hartley heard
nothing of the child's escape.Donovan did not see fit to inform him, as this would stop the weekly
remittance for the child's board, and, moreover, draw Hartley's
indignation down upon his head.One day, in a copy of the _New York Herald_, which he purchased at the
news-stand in the Continental Hotel, Hartley observed the arrival of
Harriet Vernon at the Fifth Avenue Hotel."I thought she would come," he said to himself, with a smile."I have
her in my power at last.She must submit to my terms, or lose sight of
the child altogether.""Blake," he said, aloud, "I must take the first train to New York.""On the contrary, I see a chance of making a good haul."Vernon sat in her room at the Fifth
Avenue Hotel.A servant brought up a card bearing the name of John
Hartley."He is prompt," she said to herself, with a smile."Probably he has not
heard of Althea's escape from the den to which he carried her.I will
humor him, in that case, and draw him out.""I will see the gentleman in the parlor," she said.Five minutes later she entered the ladies' parlor.Hartley rose to
receive her with a smile of conscious power, which told Harriet Vernon
that he was ignorant of the miscarriage of his plans."I heard of your _unexpected_ arrival, Mrs.Vernon," he commenced, "and
have called to pay my respects.""Your motive is appreciated, John Hartley," she said, coldly."That's pleasant," he said, mockingly."May I beg to apologize for
constraining you to cross the Atlantic?""Don't apologize; you have merely acted out your nature.""Probably that is not meant to be complimentary.However, it can't be
helped.""I suppose you have something to say to me, John Hartley," said Mrs.I wrote you that I had ferreted out your cunningly
devised place of concealment for my daughter."She seemed very cool and composed,
whereas he expected she would be angry and disturbed."We may as well come to business at once," he said."If you wish to
recover the charge of your ward, you must accede to my terms.""They are expressed in my letter to you.You must agree to pay me a
thousand dollars each quarter.""It strikes me you are exorbitant in your demands."At any rate, the money won't come out of you.It will
come from my daughter's income.""So you would rob your daughter, John Hartley?"Is
she to live in luxury, and with thousands to spare, while I, her only
living parent, wander penniless and homeless about the world.""I might sympathize with you, if I did not know how you have misused the
gifts of fortune, and embittered the existence of my poor sister.As it
is, it only disgusts me.""I don't want you sympathy, Harriet Vernon," he said, roughly."I want
four thousand dollars a year.""Suppose I decline to let you have it?""Then you must take the consequences," he said, quickly."That you and Althea will be forever separated.He looked at her intently to see the effect of his threat.Harriet Vernon was as cool and imperturbable as ever."Have you been in New York for a week past?"she asked, as he thought,
irrelevantly."Because you don't appear to know what has happened."As for me, I bid you good-evening.""I mean, John Hartley, that you are not as shrewd as you imagine.I mean
that a boy has foiled you; and while you were doubtless laughing at his
simplicity, he has proved more than a match for you.You have no claim
upon me, and I must decline your disinterested proposal."She left the room, leaving him crest-fallen and stupefied.He started for Brooklyn immediately, and toward eleven o'clock entered
the saloon at Donovan's."She's gone," he cried, "but I couldn't help it, Mr.On my
honor, I couldn't."The story was told, Donovan ending by invoking curses upon the boy who
had played such a trick upon him."I am ashamed of you, for
allowing a boy to get the best of you.""That boy's a fox," said Donovan."He's a match for the old one, he is.I'd like to break his neck for him."I may get hold of the girl again," mused Hartley, as
he rose to go."If I do, I won't put her in charge of such a
dunderhead."He left Donovan's and returned to New York, but he had hardly left the
Fulton ferry-boat when he was tapped on the shoulder by an officer."A little financial irregularity, as they call it in Wall street.You
may know something about some raised railroad certificates!"The morning papers contained an account of John Hartley's arrest, and
the crime with which he was charged.Harriet Vernon read it at the breakfast-table with an interest which may
be imagined."I don't like to rejoice in any man's misfortune," she said to herself,
"but now I can have a few years of peace.My precious brother-in-law
will doubtless pass the next few years in enforced seclusion, and I can
have a settled home."Directly after breakfast, she set out for the humble home of her niece.She found all at home, for Dan was not to go back to business till
Monday."Well, my good friend," she said, "I have news for you.""Good news, I hope," said Dan.Henceforth I can have Althea with me.The obstacle that
separated us is removed."Mordaunt's countenance fell, and Dan looked sober.It was plain
that Althea was to be taken from them, and they had learned to love her."I am very glad," faltered Mrs."You don't look glad," returned Mrs."You see we don't like to part with Althea," explained Dan, who
understood his mother's feelings."Who said you were to part with the child?""I thought you meant to take her from us."Your mistake is a natural one, for I have not told you my
plans.I mean to take a house up town, install Mrs.Mordaunt as my
housekeeper and friend, and adopt this young man (indicating Dan),
provided he has no objection."I have plenty of money, and no one to care for, or to
care for me.I have taken a fancy to you all, and I am quite sure that
we can all live happily together.Althea is my niece, and you, Dan, may
call me aunt, too, if you like.Dan offered her his hand in a frank, cordial way, which she liked."So it is settled, then," she said, in a pleased voice."I ought to warn
you," she added, "that I have the reputation of being ill-tempered.You
may get tired of living with me.""We'll take the risk," said Dan, smiling.Vernon, whose habit it was to act promptly, engaged a house on
Madison avenue, furnished it without regard to expense, and in less than
a fortnight, installed her friends in it.Then she had a talk with Dan
about his plans."Do you wish to remain in your place," she asked, "or would you like to
obtain a better education first?""To obtain an education," said Dan, promptly."Then give notice to your employer of your intention."Vernon in a second interview informed him that besides defraying
his school expenses, she should give him an allowance of fifty dollars a
month for his own personal needs."May I give a part of it to my mother?""You don't ask why I refuse," she said."I suppose you have a good reason," said Dan, dubiously."My reason is that I shall pay your mother double this sum.Unless she
is very extravagant it ought to be enough to defray her expenses."exclaimed Dan, in fresh
astonishment.All these important changes in the position of the Mordaunts were
unknown to their old friends, who, since their loss of property, had
given them the cold shoulder.One day Tom Carver, in passing the house, saw Dan coming down the steps
quite as handsomely dressed as himself."I didn't know what else could carry you to such a house.""Oh, that's easily explained," said Dan."You don't mean to say she boards there?"asked Tom, in a more deferential tone.At any rate she gives me a handsome allowance.""And you don't have anything to do?""Why, my father only
allows me three dollars a week."I don't need as much as my aunt allows me.""I say, Dan," said Tom, in the most friendly terms, "I'm awfully hard
up."Yes," said Dan, secretly amused with the change in Tom's manner.said Tom, linking his arm in Dan's."I'm very glad you're rich again."Thank you," said Dan, smiling, "but I'm afraid you have forgotten
something.""You know I used to be a newsboy in front of the Astor House.""And you might not care to associate with a newsboy.""Well, you are all right now," said Tom, magnanimously."You didn't always think so, Tom.""I always thought you were a gentleman, Dan."I suppose it's the way of the world," thought Dan."It is lucky that
there are some true friends who stick by us through thick and thin."Mordaunt had an experience similar to Dan's.Her old acquaintances,
who, during her poverty never seemed to recognize her when they met,
gradually awoke to the consciousness of her continued existence, and
left cards.She received them politely, but rated their professions of
friendship at their true value.They had not been "friends in need," and
she could not count them "friends indeed."Six years rolled by, bringing with them many changes.The little family
on Madison avenue kept together.She had a hearty love for young people, and enjoyed the growth and
development of her niece Althea, and Dan, whom she called her nephew and
loved no less.He completed his preparation for college, and
graduated with high honors.He is no less frank, handsome, and
self-reliant than when as a boy he sold papers in front of the Astor
House for his mother's support.He looks forward to a business life, and
has accepted an invitation to go abroad to buy goods in London and Paris
for his old firm.He was, in fact, preparing to go when a mysterious
letter was put in his hands.It ran thus:


     "MR.DANIEL MORDAUNT:--I shall take it as a great favor if you will
     come to the St.Nicholas Hotel this evening, and inquire for me.I
     am sick, or I would not trouble you.I have to speak
     to you on a matter of great importance."I don't know of any one of that name."I cannot think of any one," said Mrs."I hope you won't go,
Dan," she added, anxiously; "it may be a trap laid by a wicked and
designing man.""You forget that I am not a boy any longer, mother," said Dan, smiling."I think I can defend myself, even if Mr.Davis is a wicked and
designing person."To her he was
still a boy, though in the eyes of others an athletic young man.Davis at the hotel, Dan was ushered into a room on
the third floor.Seated in an arm-chair was an elderly man, weak and
wasted, apparently in the last stages of consumption."It would have been well if he had not known me, for I did him a great
wrong."said Dan, trying to connect the name with his
father.You see before you Robert Hunting, once your
father's book-keeper."Dan's handsome face darkened, and he said, bitterly:

"You killed my father!""Heaven help me, I fear I did!"sighed Davis--to call him by his later
name."The money of which you robbed him caused him to fail, and failure led
to his death.""I have accused myself of this crime oftentimes," moaned Davis."Don't
think that the money brought happiness, for it did not."From Europe I went to
Brazil, and engaged in business in Rio Janeiro.A year since I found my
health failing, and have come back to New York to die.But before I die
I want to make what reparation I can.""You cannot call my father back to me," said Dan, sadly."No; but I can restore the money that I stole.That is the right
word--stole.I hope you and your mother have not suffered?""We saw some hard times, but for years we have lived in comfort."Will you bring a lawyer to me to-morrow evening?"You might keep every dollar if you would bring my father back."The next evening Davis transferred to Dan and his mother property
amounting to fifty thousand dollars, in payment of what he had taken,
with interest, and in less than a month later he died, Dan taking upon
himself the charge of the funeral.His trip to Europe was deferred, and
having now capital to contribute, he was taken as junior partner into
the firm where he had once filled the position of office-boy.His father had failed disastrously, and
Tom is glad to accept a minor clerkship from the boy at whom he once
sneered.Julia Rogers has never lost her preference for Dan.It is whispered that
they are engaged, or likely soon to be, and Dan's assiduous attentions
to the young lady make the report a plausible one.John Hartley was sentenced to a term of years in prison.Harriet Vernon
dreaded the day of his release, being well convinced that he would seize
the earliest opportunity to renew his persecutions.She had about made
up her mind to buy him off, when she received intelligence that he was
carried off by fever, barely a month before the end of his term.It was
a sad end of a bad life, but she could not regret him.Althea was saved
the knowledge of her father's worthlessness.She was led to believe that
he had died when she was a little girl.Dan, the young detective, has entered
upon a career of influence and prosperity.The hardships of his earlier
years contributed to strengthen his character, and give him that
self-reliance of which the sons of rich men so often stand in need.A
similar experience might have benefited Tom Carver, whose lofty
anticipations have been succeeded by a very humble reality.Let those
boys who are now passing through the discipline of poverty and
privation, take courage and emulate the example of "Dan, the Detective."A. L. BURT'S PUBLICATIONS

     HENTY.With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.The period between the landing of Clive as a young writer in India and
the close of his career was critical and eventful in the extreme.At its
commencement the English were traders existing on sufferance of the
native princes.At its close they were masters of Bengal and of the
greater part of Southern India.The author has given a full and accurate
account of the events of that stirring time, and battles and sieges
follow each other in rapid succession, while he combines with his
narrative a tale of daring and adventure, which gives a lifelike
interest to the volume."He has taken a period of Indian history of the most vital
     importance, and he has embroidered on the historical facts a story
     which of itself is deeply interesting.Young people assuredly will
     be delighted with the volume."--_Scotsman._


     +The Lion of the North+: A Tale of Gustavus Adolphus and the Wars of
     Religion.With full-page Illustrations by JOHN
     SCHÖNBERG.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Henty gives the history of the first part of the
Thirty Years' War.The issue had its importance, which has extended to
the present day, as it established religious freedom in Germany.The
army of the chivalrous king of Sweden was largely composed of Scotchmen,
and among these was the hero of the story."The tale is a clever and instructive piece of history, and as boys
     may be trusted to read it conscientiously, they can hardly fail to
     be profited."--_Times._


     +The Dragon and the Raven+; or, The Days of King Alfred.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author gives an account of the fierce struggle between
Saxon and Dane for supremacy in England, and presents a vivid picture of
the misery and ruin to which the country was reduced by the ravages of
the sea-wolves.The hero, a young Saxon thane, takes part in all the
battles fought by King Alfred.He is driven from his home, takes to the
sea and resists the Danes on their own element, and being pursued by
them up the Seine, is present at the long and desperate siege of Paris."Treated in a manner most attractive to the boyish
     reader."--_Athenæum._


     +The Young Carthaginian+: A Story of the Times of Hannibal.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.Boys reading the history of the Punic Wars have seldom a keen
appreciation of the merits of the contest.That it was at first a
struggle for empire, and afterward for existence on the part of
Carthage, that Hannibal was a great and skillful general, that he
defeated the Romans at Trebia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannæ, and all but
took Rome, represents pretty nearly the sum total of their knowledge.To
let them know more about this momentous struggle for the empire of the
world Mr.Henty has written this story, which not only gives in graphic
style a brilliant description of a most interesting period of history,
but is a tale of exciting adventure sure to secure the interest of the
reader.From first to last nothing
     stays the interest of the narrative.It bears us along as on a
     stream whose current varies in direction, but never loses its
     force."--_Saturday Review._


     +In Freedom's Cause+: A Story of Wallace and Bruce.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.In this story the author relates the stirring tale of the Scottish War
of Independence.The extraordinary valor and personal prowess of Wallace
and Bruce rival the deeds of the mythical heroes of chivalry, and indeed
at one time Wallace was ranked with these legendary personages.The
researches of modern historians have shown, however, that he was a
living, breathing man--and a valiant champion.The hero of the tale
fought under both Wallace and Bruce, and while the strictest historical
accuracy has been maintained with respect to public events, the work is
full of "hairbreadth'scapes" and wild adventure."It is written in the author's best style.Full of the wildest and
     most remarkable achievements, it is a tale of great interest, which
     a boy, once he has begun it, will not willingly put on one
     side."--_The Schoolmaster._


     +With Lee in Virginia+: A Story of the American Civil War.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.The story of a young Virginian planter, who, after bravely proving his
sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters, serves with no less courage
and enthusiasm under Lee and Jackson through the most exciting events of
the struggle.He has many hairbreadth escapes, is several times wounded
and twice taken prisoner; but his courage and readiness and, in two
cases, the devotion of a black servant and of a runaway slave whom he
had assisted, bring him safely through all difficulties."One of the best stories for lads which Mr.The picture is full of life and color, and the stirring and
     romantic incidents are skillfully blended with the personal
     interest and charm of the story."--_Standard._


     +By England's Aid+; or, The Freeing of the Netherlands (1585-1604).With full-page Illustrations by ALFRED PEARSE, and
     Maps.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The story of two English lads who go to Holland as pages in the service
of one of "the fighting Veres."After many adventures by sea and land,
one of the lads finds himself on board a Spanish ship at the time of the
defeat of the Armada, and escapes only to fall into the hands of the
Corsairs.He is successful in getting back to Spain under the protection
of a wealthy merchant, and regains his native country after the capture
of Cadiz.It overflows with stirring
     incident and exciting adventure, and the color of the era and of
     the scene are finely reproduced.The illustrations add to its
     attractiveness."--_Boston Gazette._


     +By Right of Conquest+; or, With Cortez in Mexico.With full-page Illustrations by W. S. STACEY, and Two Maps.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.50.The conquest of Mexico by a small band of resolute men under the
magnificent leadership of Cortez is always rightly ranked among the most
romantic and daring exploits in history.With this as the groundwork of
his story Mr.Henty has interwoven the adventures of an English youth,
Roger Hawkshaw, the sole survivor of the good ship Swan, which had
sailed from a Devon port to challenge the mercantile supremacy of the
Spaniards in the New World.He is beset by many perils among the
natives, but is saved by his own judgment and strength, and by the
devotion of an Aztec princess.At last by a ruse he obtains the
protection of the Spaniards, and after the fall of Mexico he succeeds in
regaining his native shore, with a fortune and a charming Aztec bride."'By Right of Conquest' is the nearest approach to a perfectly
     successful historical tale that Mr.Henty has yet
     published."--_Academy._


     +In the Reign of Terror+: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy.By G.
     A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by J. SCHÖNBERG.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.Harry Sandwith, a Westminster boy, becomes a resident at the chateau of
a French marquis, and after various adventures accompanies the family to
Paris at the crisis of the Revolution.Imprisonment and death reduce
their number, and the hero finds himself beset by perils with the three
young daughters of the house in his charge.After hairbreadth escapes
they reach Nantes.There the girls are condemned to death in the
coffin-ships, but are saved by the unfailing courage of their boy
protector."Harry Sandwith, the Westminster boy, may fairly be said to beat
     Mr.His adventures will delight boys by the
     audacity and peril they depict.... The story is one of Mr.Henty's
     best."--_Saturday Review._


     +With Wolfe in Canada+; or, The Winning of a Continent.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.Henty gives an account of the struggle between
Britain and France for supremacy in the North American continent.On the
issue of this war depended not only the destinies of North America, but
to a large extent those of the mother countries themselves.The fall of
Quebec decided that the Anglo-Saxon race should predominate in the New
World; that Britain, and not France, should take the lead among the
nations of Europe; and that English and American commerce, the English
language, and English literature, should spread right round the globe."It is not only a lesson in history as instructively as it is
     graphically told, but also a deeply interesting and often thrilling
     tale of adventure and peril by flood and field."--_Illustrated
     London News._


     +True to the Old Flag+: A Tale of the American War of Independence.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author has gone to the accounts of officers who took
part in the conflict, and lads will find that in no war in which
American and British soldiers have been engaged did they behave with
greater courage and good conduct.The historical portion of the book
being accompanied with numerous thrilling adventures with the redskins
on the shores of Lake Huron, a story of exciting interest is interwoven
with the general narrative and carried through the book."Does justice to the pluck and determination of the British
     soldiers during the unfortunate struggle against American
     emancipation.The son of an American loyalist, who remains true to
     our flag, falls among the hostile redskins in that very Huron
     country which has been endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye
     and Chingachgook."--_The Times._


     +The Lion of St.Mark+: A Tale of Venice in the Fourteenth Century.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A story of Venice at a period when her strength and splendor were put to
the severest tests.The hero displays a fine sense and manliness which
carry him safely through an atmosphere of intrigue, crime, and
bloodshed.He contributes largely to the victories of the Venetians at
Porto d'Anzo and Chioggia, and finally wins the hand of the daughter of
one of the chief men of Venice."Every boy should read 'The Lion of St.Henty has never
     produced a story more delightful, more wholesome, or more
     vivacious."--_Saturday Review._


     +A Final Reckoning+: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by W. B. WOLLEN.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.The hero, a young English lad, after rather a stormy boyhood, emigrates
to Australia, and gets employment as an officer in the mounted police.A
few years of active work on the frontier, where he has many a brush with
both natives and bushrangers, gain him promotion to a captaincy, and he
eventually settles down to the peaceful life of a squatter.Henty has never published a more readable, a more carefully
     constructed, or a better written story than this."--_Spectator._


     +Under Drake's Flag+: A Tale of the Spanish Main.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.A story of the days when England and Spain struggled for the supremacy
of the sea.The heroes sail as lads with Drake in the Pacific
expedition, and in his great voyage of circumnavigation.The historical
portion of the story is absolutely to be relied upon, but this will
perhaps be less attractive than the great variety of exciting adventure
through which the young heroes pass in the course of their voyages."A book of adventure, where the hero meets with experience enough,
     one would think, to turn his hair gray."--_Harper's Monthly
     Magazine._


     +By Sheer Pluck+: A Tale of the Ashanti War.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The author has woven, in a tale of thrilling interest, all the details
of the Ashanti campaign, of which he was himself a witness.His hero,
after many exciting adventures in the interior, is detained a prisoner
by the king just before the outbreak of the war, but escapes, and
accompanies the English expedition on their march to Coomassie.Henty keeps up his reputation as a writer of boys' stories.'By Sheer Pluck' will be eagerly read."--_Athenæum._


     +By Pike and <DW18>+: A Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic.By G.
     A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by MAYNARD BROWN, and 4

English boy in the household of the ablest man of his age--William the
Silent.Edward Martin, the son of an English sea-captain, enters the
service of the Prince as a volunteer, and is employed by him in many
dangerous and responsible missions, in the discharge of which he passes
through the great sieges of the time.He ultimately settles down as Sir
Edward Martin."Boys with a turn for historical research will be enchanted with
     the book, while the rest who only care for adventure will be
     students in spite of themselves."--_St.James' Gazette._


     +St.George for England+: A Tale of Cressy and Poitiers.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.No portion of English history is more crowded with great events than
that of the reign of Edward III.Cressy and Poitiers; the destruction of
the Spanish fleet; the plague of the Black Death; the Jacquerie rising;
these are treated by the author in "St.The hero of
the story, although of good family, begins life as a London apprentice,
but after countless adventures and perils becomes by valor and good
conduct the squire, and at last the trusted friend of the Black Prince.Henty has developed for himself a type of historical novel for
     boys which bids fair to supplement, on their behalf, the historical
     labors of Sir Walter Scott in the land of fiction."--_The
     Standard._


     +Captain Kidd's Gold+: The True Story of an Adventurous Sailor Boy.By JAMES FRANKLIN FITTS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.There is something fascinating to the average youth in the very idea of
buried treasure.A vision arises before his eyes of swarthy Portuguese
and Spanish rascals, with black beards and gleaming
eyes--sinister-looking fellows who once on a time haunted the Spanish
Main, sneaking out from some hidden creek in their long, low schooner,
of picaroonish rake and sheer, to attack an unsuspecting trading craft.There were many famous sea rovers in their day, but none more celebrated
than Capt.Perhaps the most fascinating tale of all is Mr.Fitts'
true story of an adventurous American boy, who receives from his dying
father an ancient bit of vellum, which the latter obtained in a curious
way.The document bears obscure directions purporting to locate a
certain island in the Bahama group, and a considerable treasure buried
there by two of Kidd's crew.The hero of this book, Paul Jones Garry, is
an ambitious, persevering lad, of salt-water New England ancestry, and
his efforts to reach the island and secure the money form one of the
most absorbing tales for our youth that has come from the press.+Captain Bayley's Heir+: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California.By
     G. A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.A frank, manly lad and his cousin are rivals in the heirship of a
considerable property.The former falls into a trap laid by the latter,
and while under a false accusation of theft foolishly leaves England for
America.He works his passage before the mast, joins a small band of
hunters, crosses a tract of country infested with Indians to the
Californian gold diggings, and is successful both as digger and trader.Henty is careful to mingle instruction with entertainment; and
     the humorous touches, especially in the sketch of John Holl, the
     Westminster dustman, Dickens himself could hardly have
     excelled."--_Christian Leader._


     +For Name and Fame+; or, Through Afghan Passes.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.An interesting story of the last war in Afghanistan.The hero, after
being wrecked and going through many stirring adventures among the
Malays, finds his way to Calcutta and enlists in a regiment proceeding
to join the army at the Afghan passes.He accompanies the force under
General Roberts to the Peiwar Kotal, is wounded, taken prisoner, carried
to Cabul, whence he is transferred to Candahar, and takes part in the
final defeat of the army of Ayoub Khan."The best feature of the book--apart from the interest of its
     scenes of adventure--is its honest effort to do justice to the
     patriotism of the Afghan people."--_Daily News._


     +Captured by Apes+: The Wonderful Adventures of a Young Animal
     Trainer.12mo, cloth, $1.00.The scene of this tale is laid on an island in the Malay Archipelago.Philip Garland, a young animal collector and trainer, of New York, sets
sail for Eastern seas in quest of a new stock of living curiosities.The
vessel is wrecked off the coast of Borneo and young Garland, the sole
survivor of the disaster, is cast ashore on a small island, and captured
by the apes that overrun the place.The lad discovers that the ruling
spirit of the monkey tribe is a gigantic and vicious baboon, whom he
identifies as Goliah, an animal at one time in his possession and with
whose instruction he had been especially diligent.The brute recognizes
him, and with a kind of malignant satisfaction puts his former master
through the same course of training he had himself experienced with a
faithfulness of detail which shows how astonishing is monkey
recollection.Very novel indeed is the way by which the young man
escapes death.Prentice has certainly worked a new vein on juvenile
fiction, and the ability with which he handles a difficult subject
stamps him as a writer of undoubted skill.+The Bravest of the Brave+; or, With Peterborough in Spain.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.There are few great leaders whose lives and actions have so completely
fallen into oblivion as those of the Earl of Peterborough.This is
largely due to the fact that they were overshadowed by the glory and
successes of Marlborough.His career as general extended over little
more than a year, and yet, in that time, he showed a genius for warfare
which has never been surpassed.Henty never loses sight of the moral purpose of his work--to
     enforce the doctrine of courage and truth.Lads will read 'The
     Bravest of the Brave' with pleasure and profit; of that we are
     quite sure."--_Daily Telegraph._


     +The Cat of Bubastes+: A Story of Ancient Egypt.With
     full-page Illustrations.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A story which will give young readers an unsurpassed insight into the
customs of the Egyptian people.Amuba, a prince of the Rebu nation, is
carried with his charioteer Jethro into slavery.They become inmates of
the house of Ameres, the Egyptian high-priest, and are happy in his
service until the priest's son accidentally kills the sacred cat of
Bubastes.In an outburst of popular fury Ameres is killed, and it rests
with Jethro and Amuba to secure the escape of the high-priest's son and
daughter."The story, from the critical moment of the killing of the sacred
     cat to the perilous exodus into Asia with which it closes, is very
     skillfully constructed and full of exciting adventures.It is
     admirably illustrated."--_Saturday Review._


     +With Washington at Monmouth+: A Story of Three Philadelphia Boys.By
     JAMES OTIS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Three Philadelphia boys, Seth Graydon "whose mother conducted a
boarding-house which was patronized by the British officers;" Enoch
Ball, "son of that Mrs.Ball whose dancing school was situated on
Letitia Street," and little Jacob, son of "Chris, the Baker," serve as
the principal characters.The story is laid during the winter when Lord
Howe held possession of the city, and the lads aid the cause by
assisting the American spies who make regular and frequent visits from
Valley Forge.One reads here of home-life in the captive city when bread
was scarce among the people of the lower classes, and a reckless
prodigality shown by the British officers, who passed the winter in
feasting and merry-making while the members of the patriot army but a
few miles away were suffering from both cold and hunger.The story
abounds with pictures of Colonial life skillfully drawn, and the
glimpses of Washington's soldiers which are given show that the work has
not been hastily done, or without considerable study.+For the Temple+: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem.With full-page Illustrations by S. J. SOLOMON.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.Henty here weaves into the record of Josephus an admirable and
attractive story.The troubles in the district of Tiberias, the march of
the legions, the sieges of Jotapata, of Gamala, and of Jerusalem, form
the impressive and carefully studied historic setting to the figure of
the lad who passes from the vineyard to the service of Josephus, becomes
the leader of a guerrilla band of patriots, fights bravely for the
Temple, and after a brief term of slavery at Alexandria, returns to his
Galilean home with the favor of Titus.Henty's graphic prose pictures of the hopeless Jewish
     resistance to Roman sway add another leaf to his record of the
     famous wars of the world."--_Graphic._


     +Facing Death+; or, The Hero of the Vaughan Pit.A Tale of the Coal
     Mines.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON
     BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00."Facing Death" is a story with a purpose.It is intended to show that a
lad who makes up his mind firmly and resolutely that he will rise in
life, and who is prepared to face toil and ridicule and hardship to
carry out his determination, is sure to succeed.The hero of the story
is a typical British boy, dogged, earnest, generous, and though
"shamefaced" to a degree, is ready to face death in the discharge of
duty."The tale is well written and well illustrated and there is much
     reality in the characters.If any father, clergyman, or
     schoolmaster is on the lookout for a good book to give as a present
     to a boy who is worth his salt, this is the book we would
     recommend."--_Standard._


     +Tom Temple's Career.+ By HORATIO ALGER.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Tom Temple, a bright, self-reliant lad, by the death of his father
becomes a boarder at the home of Nathan Middleton, a penurious insurance
agent.Though well paid for keeping the boy, Nathan and his wife
endeavor to bring Master Tom in line with their parsimonious habits.The
lad ingeniously evades their efforts and revolutionizes the household.As Tom is heir to $40,000, he is regarded as a person of some importance
until by an unfortunate combination of circumstances his fortune shrinks
to a few hundreds.He leaves Plympton village to seek work in New York,
whence he undertakes an important mission to California, around which
center the most exciting incidents of his young career.Some of his
adventures in the far west are so startling that the reader will
scarcely close the book until the last page shall have been reached.Alger's most fascinating style, and is bound to
please the very large class of boys who regard this popular author as a
prime favorite.+Maori and Settler+: A Story of the New Zealand War.With full-page Illustrations by ALFRED PEARSE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.The Renshaws emigrate to New Zealand during the period of the war with
the natives.Wilfrid, a strong, self-reliant, courageous lad, is the
mainstay of the household.Atherton, a
botanist and naturalist of herculean strength and unfailing nerve and
humor.In the adventures among the Maoris, there are many breathless
moments in which the odds seem hopelessly against the party, but they
succeed in establishing themselves happily in one of the pleasant New
Zealand valleys."Brimful of adventure, of humorous and interesting conversation,
     and vivid pictures of colonial life."--_Schoolmaster._


     +Julian Mortimer+: A Brave Boy's Struggle for Home and Fortune.By
     HARRY CASTLEMON.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Here is a story that will warm every boy's heart.There is mystery
enough to keep any lad's imagination wound up to the highest pitch.The
scene of the story lies west of the Mississippi River, in the days when
emigrants made their perilous way across the great plains to the land of
gold.One of the startling features of the book is the attack upon the
wagon train by a large party of Indians.Our hero is a lad of uncommon
nerve and pluck, a brave young American in every sense of the word.He
enlists and holds the reader's sympathy from the outset.Surrounded by
an unknown and constant peril, and assisted by the unswerving fidelity
of a stalwart trapper, a real rough diamond, our hero achieves the most
happy results.Harry Castlemon has written many entertaining stories for
boys, and it would seem almost superfluous to say anything in his
praise, for the youth of America regard him as a favorite author."+Carrots+:" Just a Little Boy.With
     Illustrations by WALTER CRANE."One of the cleverest and most pleasing stories it has been our
     good fortune to meet with for some time.Carrots and his sister are
     delightful little beings, whom to read about is at once to become
     very fond of."--_Examiner._

     "A genuine children's book; we've seen 'em seize it, and read it
     greedily.Children are first-rate critics, and thoroughly
     appreciate Walter Crane's illustrations."--_Punch._


     +Mopsa the Fairy.+ By JEAN INGELOW.Ingelow is, to our mind, the most charming of all living
     writers for children, and 'Mopsa' alone ought to give her a kind of
     pre-emptive right to the love and gratitude of our young folks.It
     requires genius to conceive a purely imaginary work which must of
     necessity deal with the supernatural, without running into a mere
     riot of fantastic absurdity; but genius Miss Ingelow has and the
     story of 'Jack' is as careless and joyous, but as delicate, as a
     picture of childhood."--_Eclectic._


     +A Jaunt Through Java+: The Story of a Journey to the Sacred
     Mountain.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The central interest of this story is found in the thrilling adventures
of two cousins, Hermon and Eustace Hadley, on their trip across the
island of Java, from Samarang to the Sacred Mountain.In a land where
the Royal Bengal tiger runs at large; where the rhinoceros and other
fierce beasts are to be met with at unexpected moments; it is but
natural that the heroes of this book should have a lively experience.Hermon not only distinguishes himself by killing a full-grown tiger at
short range, but meets with the most startling adventure of the journey.There is much in this narrative to instruct as well as entertain the
reader, and so deftly has Mr.Ellis used his material that there is not
a dull page in the book.The two heroes are brave, manly young fellows,
bubbling over with boyish independence.They cope with the many
difficulties that arise during the trip in a fearless way that is bound
to win the admiration of every lad who is so fortunate as to read their
adventures.+Wrecked on Spider Island+; or, How Ned Rogers Found the Treasure.By
     JAMES OTIS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A "down-east" plucky lad who ships as cabin boy, not from love of
adventure, but because it is the only course remaining by which he can
gain a livelihood.While in his bunk, seasick, Ned Rogers hears the
captain and mate discussing their plans for the willful wreck of the
brig in order to gain the insurance.Once it is known he is in
possession of the secret the captain maroons him on Spider Island,
explaining to the crew that the boy is afflicted with leprosy.While
thus involuntarily playing the part of a Crusoe, Ned discovers a wreck
submerged in the sand, and overhauling the timbers for the purpose of
gathering material with which to build a hut finds a considerable amount
of treasure.Raising the wreck; a voyage to Havana under sail; shipping
there a crew and running for Savannah; the attempt of the crew to seize
the little craft after learning of the treasure on board, and, as a
matter of course, the successful ending of the journey, all serve to
make as entertaining a story of sea-life as the most captious boy could
desire.+Geoff and Jim+: A Story of School Life.Illustrated
     by A. G. WALKER."This is a prettily told story of the life spent by two motherless
     bairns at a small preparatory school.Both Geoff and Jim are very
     lovable characters, only Jim is the more so; and the scrapes he
     gets into and the trials he endures will no doubt, interest a large
     circle of young readers."--_Church Times._

     "This is a capital children's story, the characters well portrayed,
     and the book tastefully bound and well
     illustrated."--_Schoolmaster._

     "The story can be heartily recommended as a present for
     boys."--_Standard._


     +The Castaways+; or, On the Florida Reefs, By JAMES OTIS.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.It is just the kind of story that the
majority of boys yearn for.From the moment that the Sea Queen dispenses
with the services of the tug in lower New York bay till the breeze
leaves her becalmed off the coast of Florida, one can almost hear the
whistle of the wind through her rigging, the creak of her straining
cordage as she heels to the leeward, and feel her rise to the
snow-capped waves which her sharp bow cuts into twin streaks of foam.Off Marquesas Keys she floats in a dead calm.Ben Clark, the hero of the
story, and Jake, the cook, spy a turtle asleep upon the glassy surface
of the water.They determine to capture him, and take a boat for that
purpose, and just as they succeed in catching him a thick fog cuts them
off from the vessel, and then their troubles begin.They take refuge on
board a drifting hulk, a storm arises and they are cast ashore upon a
low sandy key.Their adventures from this point cannot fail to charm the
reader.His
style is captivating, and never for a moment does he allow the interest
to flag.In "The Castaways" he is at his best.+Tom Thatcher's Fortune.+ By HORATIO ALGER, JR.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.Alger's heroes, Tom Thatcher is a brave, ambitious,
unselfish boy.He supports his mother and sister on meager wages earned
as a shoe-pegger in John Simpson's factory.The story begins with Tom's
discharge from the factory, because Mr.Simpson felt annoyed with the

all readers.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dan, The Newsboy, by Horatio Alger Jr.But the copy among the Ashmolean manuscripts at Oxford
is dedicated to Sir Allen Apsley, with the title of "Purveyor to His
Majestie's Navie Royall"; and as Sir Allen was made "Lieutenant of
the Tower" in 1616, it is believed that the manuscript must have been
written before that date, since the author would not have omitted the
more important of the two titles in his dedication.Strachey's prefatory letter to the Council, prefixed to his "Laws"
(1612), is dated "From my lodging in the Black Friars.At your best
pleasures, either to return unto the colony, or pray for the success of
it heere."In his letter he speaks of his experience in the Bermudas and
Virginia: "The full storie of both in due time [I] shall consecrate unto
your view.... Howbit since many impediments, as yet must detaine such
my observations in the shadow of darknesse, untill I shall be able to
deliver them perfect unto your judgments," etc.This is not, as has been assumed, a statement that the observations were
not written then, only that they were not "perfect"; in fact, they
were detained in the "shadow of darknesse" till the year 1849.Our
own inference is, from all the circumstances, that Strachey began his
manuscript in Virginia or shortly after his return, and added to it and
corrected it from time to time up to 1616.We are now in a position to consider Strachey's allusions to Pocahontas.The first occurs in his description of the apparel of Indian women:

"The better sort of women cover themselves (for the most part) all over
with skin mantells, finely drest, shagged and fringed at the skyrt,
carved and coloured with some pretty work, or the proportion of beasts,
fowle, tortayses, or other such like imagry, as shall best please or
expresse the fancy of the wearer; their younger women goe not shadowed
amongst their owne companie, until they be nigh eleaven or twelve
returnes of the leafe old (for soe they accompt and bring about the
yeare, calling the fall of the leaf tagnitock); nor are thev much
ashamed thereof, and therefore would the before remembered Pocahontas,
a well featured, but wanton yong girle, Powhatan's daughter, sometymes
resorting to our fort, of the age then of eleven or twelve yeares, get
the boyes forth with her into the markett place, and make them wheele,
falling on their hands, turning up their heeles upwards, whome she would
followe and wheele so herself, naked as she was, all the fort over;
but being once twelve yeares, they put on a kind of semecinctum lethern
apron (as do our artificers or handycrafts men) before their bellies,
and are very shamefac't to be seene bare.We have seene some use
mantells made both of Turkey feathers, and other fowle, so prettily
wrought and woven with threeds, that nothing could be discerned but the
feathers, which were exceedingly warme and very handsome."Strachey did not see Pocahontas.She did not resort to the camp after
the departure of Smith in September, 1609, until she was kidnapped by
Governor Dale in April, 1613.The
time mentioned by him of her resorting to the fort, "of the age then of
eleven or twelve yeares," must have been the time referred to by Smith
when he might have married her, namely, in 1608-9, when he calls her
"not past 13 or 14 years of age."The description of her as a "yong
girle" tumbling about the fort, "naked as she was," would seem to
preclude the idea that she was married at that time.The use of the word "wanton" is not necessarily disparaging, for
"wanton" in that age was frequently synonymous with "playful" and
"sportive"; but it is singular that she should be spoken of as "well
featured, but wanton."Strachey, however, gives in another place what is
no doubt the real significance of the Indian name "Pocahontas."He says:

"Both men, women, and children have their severall names; at first
according to the severall humor of their parents; and for the men
children, at first, when they are young, their mothers give them a name,
calling them by some affectionate title, or perhaps observing their
promising inclination give it accordingly; and so the great King
Powhatan called a young daughter of his, whom he loved well, Pocahontas,
which may signify a little wanton; howbeyt she was rightly called
Amonata at more ripe years."The polygamous Powhatan had a large
number of wives, but of all his women, his favorites were a dozen "for
the most part very young women," the names of whom Strachey obtained
from one Kemps, an Indian a good deal about camp, whom Smith certifies
was a great villain.Strachey gives a list of the names of twelve of
them, at the head of which is Winganuske.This list was no doubt written
down by the author in Virginia, and it is followed by a sentence,
quoted below, giving also the number of Powhatan's children.The
"great darling" in this list was Winganuske, a sister of Machumps,
who, according to Smith, murdered his comrade in the Bermudas.Strachey
writes:

"He [Powhatan] was reported by the said Kemps, as also by the Indian
Machumps, who was sometyme in England, and comes to and fro amongst us
as he dares, and as Powhatan gives him leave, for it is not otherwise
safe for him, no more than it was for one Amarice, who had his braynes
knockt out for selling but a baskett of corne, and lying in the English
fort two or three days without Powhatan's leave; I say they often
reported unto us that Powhatan had then lyving twenty sonnes and ten
daughters, besyde a young one by Winganuske, Machumps his sister, and a
great darling of the King's; and besides, younge Pocohunta, a daughter
of his, using sometyme to our fort in tymes past, nowe married to a
private Captaine, called Kocoum, some two years since."Does Strachey intend to say that
Pocahontas was married to an Iniaan named Kocoum?She might have been
during the time after Smith's departure in 1609, and her kidnapping
in 1613, when she was of marriageable age.We shall see hereafter that
Powhatan, in 1614, said he had sold another favorite daughter of his,
whom Sir Thomas Dale desired, and who was not twelve years of age, to
be wife to a great chief.The term "private Captain" might perhaps be
applied to an Indian chief.Smith, in his "General Historie," says
the Indians have "but few occasions to use any officers more than one
commander, which commonly they call Werowance, or Caucorouse, which is
Captaine."It is probably not possible, with the best intentions, to
twist Kocoum into Caucorouse, or to suppose that Strachey intended to
say that a private captain was called in Indian a Kocoum.Werowance
and Caucorouse are not synonymous terms.Werowance means "chief," and
Caucorouse means "talker" or "orator," and is the original of our word
"caucus."Either Strachey was uninformed, or Pocahontas was married to an
Indian--a not violent presumption considering her age and the fact
that war between Powhatan and the whites for some time had cut off
intercourse between them--or Strachey referred to her marriage with
Rolfe, whom he calls by mistake Kocoum.If this is to be accepted,
then this paragraph must have been written in England in 1616, and have
referred to the marriage to Rolfe it "some two years since," in 1614.That Pocahontas was a gentle-hearted and pleasing girl, and, through her
acquaintance with Smith, friendly to the whites, there is no doubt; that
she was not different in her habits and mode of life from other Indian
girls, before the time of her kidnapping, there is every reason to
suppose.It was the English who magnified the imperialism of her father,
and exaggerated her own station as Princess.She certainly put on no
airs of royalty when she was "cart-wheeling" about the fort.Nor
does this detract anything from the native dignity of the mature, and
converted, and partially civilized woman.We should expect there would be the discrepancies which have been
noticed in the estimates of her age.Powhatan is not said to have kept
a private secretary to register births in his family.If Pocahontas gave
her age correctly, as it appears upon her London portrait in 1616,
aged twenty-one, she must have been eighteen years of age when she was
captured in 1613 This would make her about twelve at the time of Smith's
captivity in 1607-8.There is certainly room for difference of opinion
as to whether so precocious a woman, as her intelligent apprehension of
affairs shows her to have been, should have remained unmarried till the
age of eighteen.In marrying at least as early as that she would have
followed the custom of her tribe.It is possible that her intercourse
with the whites had raised her above such an alliance as would be
offered her at the court of Werowocomoco.We are without any record of the life of Pocahontas for some years.The occasional mentions of her name in the "General Historie" are so
evidently interpolated at a late date, that they do not aid us.When
and where she took the name of Matoaka, which appears upon her London
portrait, we are not told, nor when she was called Amonata, as Strachey
says she was "at more ripe yeares."How she was occupied from the
departure of Smith to her abduction, we can only guess.To follow her
authentic history we must take up the account of Captain Argall and of
Ralph Hamor, Jr., secretary of the colony under Governor Dale.Captain Argall, who seems to have been as bold as he was unscrupulous
in the execution of any plan intrusted to him, arrived in Virginia
in September, 1612, and early in the spring of 1613 he was sent on an
expedition up the Patowomek to trade for corn and to effect a capture
that would bring Powhatan to terms.The Emperor, from being a friend,
had become the most implacable enemy of the English.Captain Argall
says: "I was told by certain Indians, my friends, that the great
Powhatan's daughter Pokahuntis was with the great King Potowomek,
whither I presently repaired, resolved to possess myself of her by any
stratagem that I could use, for the ransoming of so many Englishmen as
were prisoners with Powhatan, as also to get such armes and tooles as
he and other Indians had got by murther and stealing some others of our
nation, with some quantity of corn for the colonies relief."By the aid of Japazeus, King of Pasptancy, an old acquaintance and
friend of Argall's, and the connivance of the King of Potowomek,
Pocahontas was enticed on board Argall's ship and secured.Word was sent
to Powhatan of the capture and the terms on which his daughter would be
released; namely, the return of the white men he held in slavery, the
tools and arms he had gotten and stolen, and a great quantity of corn.Powhatan, "much grieved," replied that if Argall would use his daughter
well, and bring the ship into his river and release her, he would accede
to all his demands.Therefore, on the 13th of April, Argall repaired to
Governor Gates at Jamestown, and delivered his prisoner, and a few days
after the King sent home some of the white captives, three pieces, one
broad-axe, a long whip-saw, and a canoe of corn.Pocahontas, however,
was kept at Jamestown.Why Pocahontas had left Werowocomoco and gone to stay with Patowomek
we can only conjecture.It is possible that Powhatan suspected her
friendliness to the whites, and was weary of her importunity, and it may
be that she wanted to escape the sight of continual fighting, ambushes,
and murders.More likely she was only making a common friendly visit,
though Hamor says she went to trade at an Indian fair.The story of her capture is enlarged and more minutely related by Ralph
Hamor, Jr., who was one of the colony shipwrecked on the Bermudas in
1609, and returned to England in 1614, where he published (London, 1615)
"A True Discourse of Virginia, and the Success of the Affairs there
till the 18th of June, 1614."Hamor was the son of a merchant tailor in
London who was a member of the Virginia company.Hamor writes:

"It chanced Powhatan's delight and darling, his daughter Pocahuntas
(whose fame has even been spread in England by the title of Nonparella
of Firginia) in her princely progresse if I may so terme it, tooke some
pleasure (in the absence of Captaine Argall) to be among her friends at
Pataomecke (as it seemeth by the relation I had), implored thither as
shopkeeper to a Fare, to exchange some of her father's commodities for
theirs, where residing some three months or longer, it fortuned upon
occasion either of promise or profit, Captaine Argall to arrive there,
whom Pocahuntas, desirous to renew her familiaritie with the English,
and delighting to see them as unknown, fearefull perhaps to be
surprised, would gladly visit as she did, of whom no sooner had Captaine
Argall intelligence, but he delt with an old friend Iapazeus, how and
by what meanes he might procure her caption, assuring him that now or
never, was the time to pleasure him, if he intended indeede that love
which he had made profession of, that in ransome of hir he might redeeme
some of our English men and armes, now in the possession of her father,
promising to use her withall faire and gentle entreaty; Iapazeus well
assured that his brother, as he promised, would use her courteously,
promised his best endeavors and service to accomplish his desire, and
thus wrought it, making his wife an instrument (which sex have ever been
most powerful in beguiling inticements) to effect his plot which hee
had thus laid, he agreed that himself, his wife and Pocahuntas, would
accompanie his brother to the water side, whither come, his wife should
faine a great and longing desire to goe aboorde, and see the shippe,
which being there three or four times before she had never seene, and
should be earnest with her husband to permit her--he seemed angry with
her, making as he pretended so unnecessary request, especially being
without the company of women, which denial she taking unkindly,
must faine to weepe (as who knows not that women can command teares)
whereupon her husband seeming to pitty those counterfeit teares, gave
her leave to goe aboord, so that it would pleese Pocahuntas to accompany
her; now was the greatest labour to win her, guilty perhaps of her
father's wrongs, though not knowne as she supposed, to goe with her, yet
by her earnest persuasions, she assented: so forthwith aboord they went,
the best cheere that could be made was seasonably provided, to supper
they went, merry on all hands, especially Iapazeus and his wife, who to
expres their joy would ere be treading upon Captaine Argall's foot, as
who should say tis don, she is your own.Supper ended Pocahuntas was
lodged in the gunner's roome, but Iapazeus and his wife desired to have
some conference with their brother, which was onely to acquaint him by
what stratagem they had betraied his prisoner as I have already
related: after which discourse to sleepe they went, Pocahuntas nothing
mistrusting this policy, who nevertheless being most possessed with
feere, and desire of returne, was first up, and hastened Iapazeus to be
gon.Argall having secretly well rewarded him, with a small Copper
kittle, and some other les valuable toies so highly by him esteemed,
that doubtlesse he would have betraied his own father for them,
permitted both him and his wife to returne, but told him that for divers
considerations, as for that his father had then eigh [8] of our Englishe
men, many swords, peeces, and other tooles, which he hid at severall
times by trecherous murdering our men, taken from them which though
of no use to him, he would not redeliver, he would reserve Pocahuntas,
whereat she began to be exceeding pensive, and discontented, yet
ignorant of the dealing of Japazeus who in outward appearance was no les
discontented that he should be the meanes of her captivity, much adoe
there was to pursuade her to be patient, which with extraordinary
curteous usage, by little and little was wrought in her, and so to
Jamestowne she was brought."Smith, who condenses this account in his "General Historie," expresses
his contempt of this Indian treachery by saying: "The old Jew and his
wife began to howle and crie as fast as Pocahuntas."It will be noted
that the account of the visit (apparently alone) of Pocahontas and her
capture is strong evidence that she was not at this time married to
"Kocoum" or anybody else.Word was despatched to Powhatan of his daughter's duress, with a
demand made for the restitution of goods; but although this savage is
represented as dearly loving Pocahontas, his "delight and darling," it
was, according to Hamor, three months before they heard anything from
him.His anxiety about his daughter could not have been intense.He
retained a part of his plunder, and a message was sent to him that
Pocahontas would be kept till he restored all the arms.This answer pleased Powhatan so little that they heard nothing from him
till the following March.Then Sir Thomas Dale and Captain Argall, with
several vessels and one hundred and fifty men, went up to Powhatan's
chief seat, taking his daughter with them, offering the Indians a chance
to fight for her or to take her in peace on surrender of the stolen
goods.The Indians received this with bravado and flights of arrows,
reminding them of the fate of Captain Ratcliffe.The whites landed,
killed some Indians, burnt forty houses, pillaged the village, and went
on up the river and came to anchor in front of Matchcot, the Emperor's
chief town.Here were assembled four hundred armed men, with bows and
arrows, who dared them to come ashore.Ashore they went, and a palaver
was held.The Indians wanted a day to consult their King, after which
they would fight, if nothing but blood would satisfy the whites.Two of Powhatan's sons who were present expressed a desire to see their
sister, who had been taken on shore.When they had sight of her, and
saw how well she was cared for, they greatly rejoiced and promised to
persuade their father to redeem her and conclude a lasting peace.The
two brothers were taken on board ship, and Master John Rolfe and Master
Sparkes were sent to negotiate with the King.Powhatan did not show
himself, but his brother Apachamo, his successor, promised to use his
best efforts to bring about a peace, and the expedition returned to
Jamestown."Long before this time," Hamor relates, "a gentleman of approved
behaviour and honest carriage, Master John Rolfe, had been in love with
Pocahuntas and she with him, which thing at the instant that we were
in parlee with them, myselfe made known to Sir Thomas Dale, by a letter
from him [Rolfe] whereby he entreated his advice and furtherance to his
love, if so it seemed fit to him for the good of the Plantation, and
Pocahuntas herself acquainted her brethren therewith."Governor Dale
approved this, and consequently was willing to retire without other
conditions."The bruite of this pretended marriage [Hamor continues]
came soon to Powhatan's knowledge, a thing acceptable to him, as
appeared by his sudden consent thereunto, who some ten daies after sent
an old uncle of hirs, named Opachisco, to give her as his deputy in the
church, and two of his sonnes to see the mariage solemnized which was
accordingly done about the fifth of April [1614], and ever since we have
had friendly commerce and trade, not only with Powhatan himself, but
also with his subjects round about us; so as now I see no reason why the
collonie should not thrive a pace."This marriage was justly celebrated as the means and beginning of a firm
peace which long continued, so that Pocahontas was again entitled to the
grateful remembrance of the Virginia settlers.Already, in 1612, a plan
had been mooted in Virginia of marrying the English with the natives,
and of obtaining the recognition of Powhatan and those allied to him as
members of a fifth kingdom, with certain privileges.Cunega, the Spanish
ambassador at London, on September 22, 1612, writes: "Although some
suppose the plantation to decrease, he is credibly informed that there
is a determination to marry some of the people that go over to Virginia;
forty or fifty are already so married, and English women intermingle and
are received kindly by the natives.A zealous minister hath been wounded
for reprehending it."John Rolfe was a man of industry, and apparently devoted to the
welfare of the colony.He probably brought with him in 1610 his wife,
who gave birth to his daughter Bermuda, born on the Somers Islands at
the time of the shipwreck.Hamor gives
him the distinction of being the first in the colony to try, in 1612,
the planting and raising of tobacco."No man [he adds] hath labored to
his power, by good example there and worthy encouragement into England
by his letters, than he hath done, witness his marriage with Powhatan's
daughter, one of rude education, manners barbarous and cursed
generation, meerely for the good and honor of the plantation: and
least any man should conceive that some sinister respects allured him
hereunto, I have made bold, contrary to his knowledge, in the end of my
treatise to insert the true coppie of his letter written to Sir Thomas
Dale."The letter is a long, labored, and curious document, and comes nearer to
a theological treatise than any love-letter we have on record.Why Rolfe did not speak to Dale, whom he saw every day,
instead of inflicting upon him this painful document, in which the
flutterings of a too susceptible widower's heart are hidden under a
great resolve of self-sacrifice, is not plain.The letter protests in a tedious preamble that the writer is moved
entirely by the Spirit of God, and continues:

"Let therefore this my well advised protestation, which here I make
between God and my own conscience, be a sufficient witness, at the
dreadful day of judgment (when the secrets of all men's hearts shall be
opened) to condemne me herein, if my chiefest interest and purpose be
not to strive with all my power of body and mind, in the undertaking
of so weighty a matter, no way led (so far forth as man's weakness may
permit) with the unbridled desire of carnall affection; but for the good
of this plantation, for the honour of our countrie, for the glory of
God, for my owne salvation, and for the converting to the true knowledge
of God and Jesus Christ, an unbelieving creature, namely Pokahuntas.To whom my heartie and best thoughts are, and have a long time bin so
entangled, and inthralled in so intricate a laborinth, that I was even
awearied to unwinde myself thereout."Master Rolfe goes on to describe the mighty war in his meditations on
this subject, in which he had set before his eyes the frailty of mankind
and his proneness to evil and wicked thoughts.He is aware of God's
displeasure against the sons of Levi and Israel for marrying strange
wives, and this has caused him to look about warily and with good
circumspection "into the grounds and principall agitations which should
thus provoke me to be in love with one, whose education hath bin rude,
her manners barbarous, her generation accursed, and so discrepant in
all nurtriture from myselfe, that oftentimes with feare and trembling,
I have ended my private controversie with this: surely these are
wicked instigations, fetched by him who seeketh and delighteth in man's
distruction; and so with fervent prayers to be ever preserved from such
diabolical assaults (as I looke those to be) I have taken some rest."The good man was desperately in love and wanted to marry the Indian, and
consequently he got no peace; and still being tormented with her image,
whether she was absent or present, he set out to produce an ingenious
reason (to show the world) for marrying her.He continues:

"Thus when I thought I had obtained my peace and quietnesse, beholde
another, but more gracious tentation hath made breaches into my holiest
and strongest meditations; with which I have been put to a new triall,
in a straighter manner than the former; for besides the weary passions
and sufferings which I have dailey, hourely, yea and in my sleepe
indured, even awaking me to astonishment, taxing me with remissnesse,
and carelessnesse, refusing and neglecting to perform the duteie of a
good Christian, pulling me by the eare, and crying: Why dost thou not
indeavor to make her a Christian?And these have happened to my greater
wonder, even when she hath been furthest seperated from me, which
in common reason (were it not an undoubted work of God) might breede
forgetfulnesse of a far more worthie creature."He accurately describes the symptoms and appears to understand the
remedy, but he is after a large-sized motive:

"Besides, I say the holy Spirit of God hath often demanded of me, why I
was created?If not for transitory pleasures and worldly vanities, but
to labour in the Lord's vineyard, there to sow and plant, to nourish and
increase the fruites thereof, daily adding with the good husband in the
gospell, somewhat to the tallent, that in the ends the fruites may be
reaped, to the comfort of the labourer in this life, and his salvation
in the world to come.... Likewise, adding hereunto her great appearance
of love to me, her desire to be taught and instructed in the knowledge
of God, her capablenesse of understanding, her aptness and willingness
to receive anie good impression, and also the spirituall, besides her
owne incitements stirring me up hereunto."The "incitements" gave him courage, so that he exclaims: "Shall I be of
so untoward a disposition, as to refuse to lead the blind into the right
way?Shall I be so unnatural, as not to give bread to the hungrie, or
uncharitable, as not to cover the naked?"It wasn't to be thought of, such wickedness; and so Master Rolfe screwed
up his courage to marry the glorious Princess, from whom thousands
of people were afterwards so anxious to be descended.But he made the
sacrifice for the glory of the country, the benefit of the plantation,
and the conversion of the unregenerate, and other and lower motive
he vigorously repels: "Now, if the vulgar sort, who square all men's
actions by the base rule of their own filthinesse, shall tax or taunt
mee in this my godly labour: let them know it is not hungry appetite, to
gorge myselfe with incontinency; sure (if I would and were so sensually
inclined) I might satisfy such desire, though not without a seared
conscience, yet with Christians more pleasing to the eie, and less
fearefull in the offense unlawfully committed.Nor am I in so desperate
an estate, that I regard not what becometh of me; nor am I out of hope
but one day to see my country, nor so void of friends, nor mean in
birth, but there to obtain a mach to my great con'tent.... But shall it
please God thus to dispose of me (which I earnestly desire to fulfill
my ends before set down) I will heartily accept of it as a godly taxe
appointed me, and I will never cease (God assisting me) untill I have
accomplished, and brought to perfection so holy a worke, in which I will
daily pray God to bless me, to mine and her eternal happiness."It is to be hoped that if sanctimonious John wrote any love-letters to
Amonata they had less cant in them than this.But it was pleasing to Sir
Thomas Dale, who was a man to appreciate the high motives of Mr.In a letter which he despatched from Jamestown, June 18, 1614, to a
reverend friend in London, he describes the expedition when Pocahontas
was carried up the river, and adds the information that when she went on
shore, "she would not talk to any of them, scarcely to them of the best
sort, and to them only, that if her father had loved her, he would not
value her less than old swords, pieces, or axes; wherefore she would
still dwell with the Englishmen who loved her.""Powhatan's daughter [the letter continues] I caused to be carefully
instructed in Christian Religion, who after she had made some good
progress therein, renounced publically her countrey idolatry, openly
confessed her Christian faith, was, as she desired, baptized, and is
since married to an English Gentleman of good understanding (as by his
letter unto me, containing the reasons for his marriage of her you may
perceive), an other knot to bind this peace the stronger.Her father
and friends gave approbation to it, and her uncle gave her to him in
the church; she lives civilly and lovingly with him, and I trust will
increase in goodness, as the knowledge of God increaseth in her.She
will goe into England with me, and were it but the gayning of this one
soule, I will think my time, toile, and present stay well spent."Hamor also appends to his narration a short letter, of the same date
with the above, from the minister Alexander Whittaker, the genuineness
of which is questioned.In speaking of the good deeds of Sir Thomas Dale
it says: "But that which is best, one Pocahuntas or Matoa, the
daughter of Powhatan, is married to an honest and discreet English
Gentleman--Master Rolfe, and that after she had openly renounced her
countrey Idolatry, and confessed the faith of Jesus Christ, and was
baptized, which thing Sir Thomas Dale had laboured a long time to ground
her in."If, as this proclaims, she was married after her conversion,
then Rolfe's tender conscience must have given him another twist for
wedding her, when the reason for marrying her (her conversion) had
ceased with her baptism.His marriage, according to this, was a pure
work of supererogation.It took place about the 5th of April, 1614.It
is not known who performed the ceremony.How Pocahontas passed her time in Jamestown during the period of her
detention, we are not told.Conjectures are made that she was an inmate
of the house of Sir Thomas Dale, or of that of the Rev.Whittaker,
both of whom labored zealously to enlighten her mind on religious
subjects.She must also have been learning English and civilized ways,
for it is sure that she spoke our language very well when she went to
London.John Rolfe was also laboring for her conversion, and we may
suppose that with all these ministrations, mingled with her love of Mr.Rolfe, which that ingenious widower had discovered, and her desire to
convert him into a husband, she was not an unwilling captive.Whatever
may have been her barbarous instincts, we have the testimony of Governor
Dale that she lived "civilly and lovingly" with her husband.STORY OF POCAHONTAS, CONTINUED

Sir Thomas Dale was on the whole the most efficient and discreet
Governor the colony had had.One element of his success was no doubt the
change in the charter of 1609.By the first charter everything had
been held in common by the company, and there had been no division of
property or allotment of land among the colonists.Under the new regime
land was held in severalty, and the spur of individual interest began
at once to improve the condition of the settlement.The character of the
colonists was also gradually improving.They had not been of a sort
to fulfill the earnest desire of the London promoter's to spread vital
piety in the New World.A zealous defense of Virginia and Maryland,
against "scandalous imputation," entitled "Leah and Rachel; or, The
Two Fruitful Sisters," by Mr.John Hammond, London, 1656, considers
the charges that Virginia "is an unhealthy place, a nest of rogues,
abandoned women, dissolut and rookery persons; a place of intolerable
labour, bad usage and hard diet"; and admits that "at the first
settling, and for many years after, it deserved most of these
aspersions, nor were they then aspersions but truths.... There were
jails supplied, youth seduced, infamous women drilled in, the provision
all brought out of England, and that embezzled by the Trustees."Governor Dale was a soldier; entering the army in the Netherlands as a
private he had risen to high position, and received knighthood in 1606.Shortly after he was with Sir Thomas Gates in South Holland.The States
General in 1611 granted him three years' term of absence in Virginia.Upon his arrival he began to put in force that system of industry and
frugality he had observed in Holland.He had all the imperiousness of a
soldier, and in an altercation with Captain Newport, occasioned by some
injurious remarks the latter made about Sir Thomas Smith, the treasurer,
he pulled his beard and threatened to hang him.Active operations for
settling new plantations were at once begun, and Dale wrote to Cecil,
the Earl of Salisbury, for 2,000 good colonists to be sent out, for the
three hundred that came were "so profane, so riotous, so full of mutiny,
that not many are Christians but in name, their bodies so diseased and
crazed that not sixty of them may be employed."He served afterwards
with credit in Holland, was made commander of the East Indian fleet in
1618, had a naval engagement with the Dutch near Bantam in 1619, and
died in 1620 from the effects of the climate.He was twice married, and
his second wife, Lady Fanny, the cousin of his first wife, survived him
and received a patent for a Virginia plantation.Governor Dale kept steadily in view the conversion of the Indians to
Christianity, and the success of John Rolfe with Matoaka inspired
him with a desire to convert another daughter of Powhatan, of whose
exquisite perfections he had heard.He therefore despatched Ralph Hamor,
with the English boy, Thomas Savage, as interpreter, on a mission to
the court of Powhatan, "upon a message unto him, which was to deale with
him, if by any means I might procure a daughter of his, who (Pocahuntas
being already in our possession) is generally reported to be his delight
and darling, and surely he esteemed her as his owne Soule, for surer
pledge of peace."This visit Hamor relates with great naivete.At his town of Matchcot, near the head of York River, Powhatan
himself received his visitors when they landed, with great cordiality,
expressing much pleasure at seeing again the boy who had been presented
to him by Captain Newport, and whom he had not seen since he gave him
leave to go and see his friends at Jamestown four years before; he also
inquired anxiously after Namontack, whom he had sent to King James's
land to see him and his country and report thereon, and then led the way
to his house, where he sat down on his bedstead side."On each hand of
him was placed a comely and personable young woman, which they called
his Queenes, the howse within round about beset with them, the outside
guarded with a hundred bowmen."The first thing offered was a pipe of tobacco, which Powhatan "first
drank," and then passed to Hamor, who "drank" what he pleased and then
returned it.The Emperor then inquired how his brother Sir Thomas Dale
fared, "and after that of his daughter's welfare, her marriage, his
unknown son, and how they liked, lived and loved together."Hamor
replied "that his brother was very well, and his daughter so well
content that she would not change her life to return and live with him,
whereat he laughed heartily, and said he was very glad of it."Powhatan then desired to know the cause of his unexpected coming, and
Mr.Hamor said his message was private, to be delivered to him without
the presence of any except one of his councilors, and one of the guides,
who already knew it.Therefore the house was cleared of all except the two Queens, who may
never sequester themselves, and Mr.First there
was a message of love and inviolable peace, the production of presents
of coffee, beads, combs, fish-hooks, and knives, and the promise of
a grindstone when it pleased the Emperor to send for it.Hamor then
proceeded:

"The bruite of the exquesite perfection of your youngest daughter, being
famous through all your territories, hath come to the hearing of your
brother, Sir Thomas Dale, who for this purpose hath addressed me hither,
to intreate you by that brotherly friendship you make profession of, to
permit her (with me) to returne unto him, partly for the desire which
himselfe hath, and partly for the desire her sister hath to see her of
whom, if fame hath not been prodigall, as like enough it hath not, your
brother (by your favour) would gladly make his nearest companion, wife
and bed fellow [many times he would have interrupted my speech, which
I entreated him to heare out, and then if he pleased to returne me
answer], and the reason hereof is, because being now friendly and firmly
united together, and made one people [as he supposeth and believes] in
the bond of love, he would make a natural union between us, principally
because himself hath taken resolution to dwel in your country so long as
he liveth, and would not only therefore have the firmest assurance hee
may, of perpetuall friendship from you, but also hereby binde himselfe
thereunto."Powhatan replied with dignity that he gladly accepted the salute of love
and peace, which he and his subjects would exactly maintain.But as to
the other matter he said: "My daughter, whom my brother desireth, I sold
within these three days to be wife to a great Weroance for two bushels
of Roanoke [a small kind of beads made of oyster shells], and it is true
she is already gone with him, three days' journey from me."Hamor persisted that this marriage need not stand in the way; "that if
he pleased herein to gratify his Brother he might, restoring the Roanoke
without the imputation of injustice, take home his daughter again, the
rather because she was not full twelve years old, and therefore not
marriageable; assuring him besides the bond of peace, so much the
firmer, he should have treble the price of his daughter in beads,
copper, hatchets, and many other things more useful for him."The reply of the noble old savage to this infamous demand ought to have
brought a blush to the cheeks of those who made it.He said he loved his
daughter as dearly as his life; he had many children, but he delighted
in none so much as in her; he could not live if he did not see her
often, as he would not if she were living with the whites, and he
was determined not to put himself in their hands.He desired no other
assurance of friendship than his brother had given him, who had already
one of his daughters as a pledge, which was sufficient while she lived;
"when she dieth he shall have another child of mine."And then he broke
forth in pathetic eloquence: "I hold it not a brotherly part of your
King, to desire to bereave me of two of my children at once; further
give him to understand, that if he had no pledge at all, he should not
need to distrust any injury from me, or any under my subjection; there
have been too many of his and my men killed, and by my occasion there
shall never be more; I which have power to perform it have said it; no
not though I should have just occasion offered, for I am now old and
would gladly end my days in peace; so as if the English offer me any
injury, my country is large enough, I will remove myself farther from
you."The old man hospitably entertained his guests for a day or two, loaded
them with presents, among which were two dressed buckskins, white as
snow, for his son and daughter, and, requesting some articles sent him
in return, bade them farewell with this message to Governor Dale: "I
hope this will give him good satisfaction, if it do not I will go three
days' journey farther from him, and never see Englishmen more."It
speaks well for the temperate habits of this savage that after he had
feasted his guests, "he caused to be fetched a great glass of sack, some
three quarts or better, which Captain Newport had given him six or seven
years since, carefully preserved by him, not much above a pint in all
this time spent, and gave each of us in a great oyster shell some three
spoonfuls."We trust that Sir Thomas Dale gave a faithful account of all this to his
wife in England.Sir Thomas Gates left Virginia in the spring of 1614 and never returned.After his departure scarcity and severity developed a mutiny, and six
of the settlers were executed.Rolfe was planting tobacco (he has the
credit of being the first white planter of it), and his wife was getting
an inside view of Christian civilization.In 1616 Sir Thomas Dale returned to England with his company and John
Rolfe and Pocahontas, and several other Indians.They reached Plymouth
early in June, and on the 20th Lord Carew made this note: "Sir Thomas
Dale returned from Virginia; he hath brought divers men and women of
thatt countrye to be educated here, and one Rolfe who married a daughter
of Pohetan (the barbarous prince) called Pocahuntas, hath brought his
wife with him into England."On the 22d Sir John Chamberlain wrote to
Sir Dudley Carlton that there were "ten or twelve, old and young, of
that country."The Indian girls who came with Pocahontas appear to have been a great
care to the London company.In May, 1620, is a record that the company
had to pay for physic and cordials for one of them who had been living
as a servant in Cheapside, and was very weak of a consumption.The same
year two other of the maids were shipped off to the Bermudas, after
being long a charge to the company, in the hope that they might there
get husbands, "that after they were converted and had children, they
might be sent to their country and kindred to civilize them."The attempt to educate them in England was not
very successful, and a proposal to bring over Indian boys obtained this
comment from Sir Edwin Sandys:

"Now to send for them into England, and to have them educated here, he
found upon experience of those brought by Sir Thomas Dale, might be far
from the Christian work intended."One Nanamack, a lad brought over by
Lord Delaware, lived some years in houses where "he heard not much of
religion but sins, had many times examples of drinking, swearing and
like evils, ran as he was a mere Pagan," till he fell in with a
devout family and changed his life, but died before he was baptized.Accompanying Pocahontas was a councilor of Powhatan, one Tomocomo, the
husband of one of her sisters, of whom Purchas says in his "Pilgrimes":
"With this savage I have often conversed with my good friend Master
Doctor Goldstone where he was a frequent geust, and where I have seen
him sing and dance his diabolical measures, and heard him discourse of
his country and religion.... Master Rolfe lent me a discourse which
I have in my Pilgrimage delivered.And his wife did not only accustom
herself to civility, but still carried herself as the daughter of a
king, and was accordingly respected, not only by the Company which
allowed provision for herself and her son, but of divers particular
persons of honor, in their hopeful zeal by her to advance Christianity.I was present when my honorable and reverend patron, the Lord Bishop of
London, Doctor King, entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond
what I had seen in his great hospitality offered to other ladies.At
her return towards Virginia she came at Gravesend to her end and grave,
having given great demonstration of her Christian sincerity, as the
first fruits of Virginia conversion, leaving here a goodly memory,
and the hopes of her resurrection, her soul aspiring to see and enjoy
permanently in heaven what here she had joyed to hear and believe of her
blessed Saviour.Not such was Tomocomo, but a blasphemer of what he knew
not and preferring his God to ours because he taught them (by his own
so appearing) to wear their Devil-lock at the left ear; he acquainted me
with the manner of that his appearance, and believed that their Okee or
Devil had taught them their husbandry."Upon news of her arrival, Captain Smith, either to increase his own
importance or because Pocahontas was neglected, addressed a letter or
"little booke" to Queen Anne, the consort of King James.This letter is
found in Smith's "General Historie" ( 1624), where it is introduced
as having been sent to Queen Anne in 1616.We find no mention of its receipt or of any acknowledgment of
it.Whether the "abstract" in the "General Historie" is exactly like
the original we have no means of knowing.We have no more confidence in
Smith's memory than we have in his dates.The letter is as follows:

"To the most high and vertuous Princesse Queene Anne of Great Brittaine."The love I beare my God, my King and Countrie hath so oft emboldened me
in the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee
presume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestie this short
discourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues,
I must be guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee
thankful."That some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the
power of Powhaten, their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage
exceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquaus, the
most manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage and
his sister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and well-beloved daughter,
being but a childe of twelve or thirteen yeeres of age, whose
compassionate pitifull heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause
to respect her: I being the first Christian this proud King and his grim
attendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I
cannot say I felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of
those my mortall foes to prevent notwithstanding al their threats.After
some six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of
my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save
mine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was
safely conducted to Jamestowne, where I found about eight and thirty
miserable poore and sicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those
large territories of Virginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore
Commonwealth, as had the Salvages not fed us, we directly had starved."And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly brought us by
this Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant
Fortune turned our Peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not
spare to dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have been oft appeased,
and our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to
imploy her, or the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or
her extraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am
sure: when her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought
to surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the dark night could not
affright her from comming through the irksome woods, and with watered
eies gave me intilligence, with her best advice to escape his furie:
which had hee known hee had surely slaine her.Jamestowne with her wild
traine she as freely frequented, as her father's habitation: and during
the time of two or three yeares, she next under God, was still the
instrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter
confusion, which if in those times had once beene dissolved, Virginia
might have laine as it was at our first arrivall to this day.Since
then, this buisinesse having been turned and varied by many accidents
from that I left it at: it is most certaine, after a long and
troublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father and our
Colonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres longer,
the Colonie by that meanes was releived, peace concluded, and at last
rejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,
with whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of
that Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe
in mariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly
considered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding."Thus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestic, what at your
best leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done
in the time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented
you from a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet
I never begged anything of the State, or any, and it is my want of
abilitie and her exceeding desert, your birth, meanes, and authoritie,
her birth, vertue, want and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly
to beseech your Majestic: to take this knowledge of her though it be
from one so unworthy to be the reporter, as myselfe, her husband's
estate not being able to make her fit to attend your Majestic: the most
and least I can doe, is to tell you this, because none so oft hath tried
it as myselfe: and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her
station: if she should not be well received, seeing this Kingdome
may rightly have a Kingdome by her meanes: her present love to us and
Christianitie, might turne to such scorne and furie, as to divert all
this good to the worst of evill, when finding so great a Queene should
doe her some honour more than she can imagine, for being so kinde to
your servants and subjects, would so ravish her with content, as endeare
her dearest bloud to effect that, your Majestic and all the Kings honest
subjects most earnestly desire: and so I humbly kisse your gracious
hands."The passage in this letter, "She hazarded the beating out of her owne
braines to save mine," is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the
paragraph which speaks of "the exceeding great courtesie" of Powhatan;
and Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up
his

"General Historie."Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the
first three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to
New England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the
service she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect
of the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there
Smith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only
one we have, must be given for what it is worth.According to this she
had supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He
writes:

"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured
her face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband
with divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself
to have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to
talke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, 'You
did promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to
you; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the
same reason so must I do you:' which though I would have excused, I
durst not allow of that title, because she was a king's daughter.With
a well set countenance she said: 'Were you not afraid to come into my
father's country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and
fear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and
you shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your
contrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other
till I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek
you, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much."'This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by
Powhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they
and their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make
notches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that
task.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him
to show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had
told so much.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had
heard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably
not coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was
convinced he had seen him.Then he replied very sadly: "You gave
Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave
me nothing, and I am better than your white dog."Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and "they
did think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen
many English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;" and
he heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,
as also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both
at the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but
the contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of
curiosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,
and the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson's "Christmas his Mask" at court, January
6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain
writes to Carleton: "The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father
counsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and
her assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though
sore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away."Neill says that "after the first weeks of her residence in England
she does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter
writers," and the Rev.Peter Fontaine says that "when they heard that
Rolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he
had not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian
princesse."His interest in the colony was never
the most intelligent, and apt to be in things trivial.15, 1609) writes to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King of
the Virginia squirrels brought into England, which are said to fly.The
King very earnestly asked if none were provided for him, and said he was
sure Salisbury would get him one.Would not have troubled him, "but that
you know so well how he is affected to these toys."There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a
portrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is
translated: "Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,
Emperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died
on shipboard at Gravesend 1617."This is doubtless the portrait engraved
by Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the
London edition of the "General Historie," 1624.It is not probable that
the portrait was originally published with the "General Historie."The
portrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:

Round the portrait:

"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim."In the oval, under the portrait:

         "Aetatis suae 21 A.1616"
Below:

"Matoaks als Rebecka daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan Emprour of
Attanoughkomouck als virginia converted and baptized in the Christian
faith, and wife to the worth Mr.Camden in his "History of Gravesend" says that everybody paid this
young lady all imaginable respect, and it was believed she would have
sufficiently acknowledged those favors, had she lived to return to her
own country, by bringing the Indians to a kinder disposition toward the
English; and that she died, "giving testimony all the time she lay sick,
of her being a very good Christian."The Lady Rebecka, as she was called in London, died on shipboard at
Gravesend after a brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably
on the 21st of March, 1617.I have seen somewhere a statement, which
I cannot confirm, that her disease was smallpox.George's Church,
where she was buried, was destroyed by fire in 1727.The register of
that church has this record:


       "1616, May 21 Rebecca Wrothe
        Wyff of Thomas Wroth gent
     A Virginia lady borne, here was buried
          in ye chaunncle."Yet there is no doubt, according to a record in the Calendar of State
Papers, dated "1617, 29 March, London," that her death occurred March
21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became
Governor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that
unscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the
company.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: "We cannot
imagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives
have given the country to Mr.Rolfe's child, and that they reserve it
from all others till he comes of years except as we suppose as some
do here report it be a device of your own, to some special purpose for
yourself."It appears also by the minutes of the company in 1621 that
Lady Delaware had trouble to recover goods of hers left in Rolfe's hands
in Virginia, and desired a commission directed to Sir Thomas Wyatt and
Mr.George Sandys to examine what goods of the late "Lord Deleware had
come into Rolfe's possession and get satisfaction of him."This George
Sandys is the famous traveler who made a journey through the Turkish
Empire in 1610, and who wrote, while living in Virginia, the first book
written in the New World, the completion of his translation of Ovid's
"Metamorphosis."John Rolfe died in Virginia in 1622, leaving a wife and children.This is supposed to be his third wife, though there is no note of his
marriage to her nor of the death of his first.October 7, 1622, his
brother Henry Rolfe petitioned that the estate of John should be
converted to the support of his relict wife and children and to his own
indemnity for having brought up John's child by Powhatan's daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas
to the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil
practices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle
Henry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned
to Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his
application to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the
Indian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother's sister.He left an only
daughter who was married, says Stith (1753), "to Col.John Bolling; by
whom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father
to the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to
Col.Campbell in his "History of Virginia"
says that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an
esteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,
grandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the
great granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with
fighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;
his own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,
and usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and
conquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not
defined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the
Potomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he
alternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of
which at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey
(York) River.He is said
to have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the
youngest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his
harem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into
all his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to
select.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:
"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold
and stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes
and attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is
supposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how
much more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a
sad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,
hanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so
on his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,
vigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath
been, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and
that to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,
as also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in
security and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions
of peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is
likewise more quietly settled amongst his own."It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives
whom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,
presenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,
or tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on
burning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put
on such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to
the necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)
the impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other
heathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the
knowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an
infused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall
be so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on
earth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the
appearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed
by Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or
conjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept
and conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but
propitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception
of an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a
ceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,
although Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the
devil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes
their own children.An image of their god which he sent to England
"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed
monster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are
no other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe
also pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief
that the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a
well-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the
better effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow's Relation,"
quoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
under date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought
a fast day was appointed.The
exercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to
prayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the
difference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name
of God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as
sometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the
ground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never
observed the like."It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of
those in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they
got a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth
and the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either
according to the custom of the country or as a defense against the
stinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says
Strachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so
discolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth
how they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the
women," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming
it the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden
quince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient
Britain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]
he or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this
collour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not
yet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their
oyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly
communicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"
London, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their
children are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors
presently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no
beards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at
the end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as
the Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty
hands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as
barbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an
ell long."A Puritan divine--"New England's Plantation, 1630"--says of
the Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before
like our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to
our gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from
Strachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:

"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in
the same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white
bone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up
hollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,
hawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,
squirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke
to the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these
holes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard
in length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes
familiarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt
tyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense
it bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves
his prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight
against the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for
the crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is
something pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death
of his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun
by the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege
of moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him
peace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the
cruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the
heart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle
words for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of
a gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has
woven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later
writers have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts
that industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and
unrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters
in her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the
appearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so
inclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt
to learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those
who taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,
sensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something
more than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger
and a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who
opposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in
civilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight
of a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural
to a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than
efforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the
whites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the
support of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on
sight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed
whites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a
base violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to
her situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her
captors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,
that her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always
remains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained
by the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her
adopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian
name she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than
she left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre
of 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she
might have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles
of the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying
when she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all
history, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose
empire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except
the remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people.He intended to make a man
of himself, and he could only accomplish his purpose by constant
exertion, by constant study and constant "trying again."He was
obliged to keep a close watch over himself, for often he was tempted
to be idle and negligent, to be careless and indifferent.After supper, on Thursday evening of his second week at Wake & Wade's,
he hastened to Major Phillips' stable to see John Lane, and obtain the
news from Rockville.His heart beat violently when he saw John's great
wagon, for he dreaded some fearful announcement from his sick friend.He had not before been so deeply conscious of his indebtedness to the
little angel as now, when she lay upon the bed of pain, perhaps of
death.She had kindled in his soul a love for the good and the
beautiful.She had inspired him with a knowledge of the difference
between the right and the wrong.In a word, she was the guiding star
of his existence.Her approbation was the bright guerdon of fidelity
to truth and principle.asked Harry, without giving John time to inquire why
he had left the stable."They think she is a little grain better."continued Harry, a great load of anxiety
removed from his soul."She is; but it is very doubtful how it will turn.I went in to see
her yesterday, and she spoke of you.""She said she should like to see you.""I should like to see her very much.""Her father told me, if you was a mind to go up to Rockville, he would
pay your expenses."I will go, if I can get away."Julia is an only child, and he
would do anything in the world to please her.""I will go and see the gentlemen I work for, and if they will let me,
I will go with you to-morrow morning.""Better take the stage; you will get there so much quicker."Harry returned home to ascertain of Edward where Mr.Wake lived, and
hastened to see him.That gentleman, however, coldly assured him if he
went to Rockville he must lose his place--they could not get along
without a boy.In vain Harry urged that he should be gone but two
days; the senior was inflexible.said he to himself, when he got into the street
again.Wake says she is no relation of mine, and he don't see why
I should go.She may die, and I shall never see her again.It did not require a great deal of deliberation to convince himself
that it was his duty to visit the sick girl.She had been a true
friend to him, and he could afford to sacrifice his place to procure
her even a slight gratification.Affection and duty called him one
way, self-interest the other.If he did not go, he should regret it as
long as he lived.Wake would take him again on his
return; if not, he could at least go to work in the stable again."Edward, I am going to Rockville to-morrow," he remarked to his
"chum," on his return to Mrs."The old man agreed to it, then?He never will
let a fellow off even for a day.""He did not; but I must go."He will discharge you, for he is a hard nut.""I must go," repeated Harry, taking a candle, and going up to their
chamber."You have got more spunk than I gave you credit for; but you are sure
of losing your place," replied Edward, following him upstairs.Harry opened a drawer in the old broken bureau in the room, and from
beneath his clothes took out the great pill box which served him for a
savings bank."You have got lots of money," remarked Edward, as he glanced at the
contents of the box."Not much; only twelve dollars," replied Harry, taking out three of
them to pay his expenses to Rockville."You won't leave that box there, will you, while you are gone?"I can hide it, though, before I go."Harry took his money and went to a bookstore in Washington Street,
where he purchased an appropriate present for Julia, for which he gave
half a dollar.On his return, he wrote her name in it, with his own as
the giver.Then the safety of his money came up for consideration; and
this matter was settled by raising a loose board in the floor and
depositing the pill box in a secure place.He had scarcely done so
before Edward joined him.He was not altogether
satisfied with the step he was about to take.It was not doing right
by his employers; but he compromised the matter in part by engaging
Edward, "for a consideration," to make the fires and sweep out the
next morning.At noon, on the following day, he reached Rockville, and hastened to
the house of Mr.he asked, breathless with interest, of the girl who
answered his knock.Harry was conducted into the house, and Mr.Bryant was informed of his
presence."I am glad you have come, Harry.Julia is much better to-day," said
her father, taking him by the hand."She has frequently spoken of you
during her illness, and feels a very strong interest in your welfare."I don't know what would have become of me if
she had not been a friend to me.""That is the secret of her interest in you.We love those best whom we
serve most.She is asleep now; but you shall see her as soon as she
wakes.In the meantime you had better have your dinner."Bryant looked very pale, and his eyes were reddened with weeping.Harry saw how much he had suffered during the last fortnight; but it
seemed natural to him that he should suffer terribly at the thought of
losing one so beautiful and precious as the little angel.Bryant could not leave the
couch of the little sufferer.The fond father could speak of nothing
but Julia, and more than once the tears flooded his eyes, as he told
Harry how meek and patient she had been through the fever, how loving
she was, and how resigned even to leave her parents, and go to the
heavenly Parent, to dwell with Him forever.Harry wept, too; and after dinner he almost feared to enter the
chamber, and behold the wreck which disease had made of this bright
and beautiful form.Removing the wrapper from the book he had
brought--a volume of sweet poems, entitled "Angel Songs"--he followed
Mr.Bryant into the sick girl's chamber."Ah, Harry, I am delighted to see you!"exclaimed she, in a whisper,
for her diseased throat rendered articulation difficult and painful."I am sorry to see you so sick, Julia," replied Harry, taking the
wasted hand she extended to him.I feel as though I should get well now.""You don't know how much I have thought of you while I lay here; how I
wished you were my brother, and could come in every day and see me,"
she continued, with a faint smile."Now tell me how you get along in Boston.""Very well; but your father says I must not talk much with you now.I
have brought you a little book," and he placed it in her hand.Now, Harry, you
must read me one of the angel songs.""I will; but I can't read very well," said he, as he opened the
volume.The piece he selected was a very
pretty and a very touching little song; and Harry's feelings were so
deeply moved by the pathetic sentiments of the poem and their
adaptation to the circumstances of the case, that he was quite
eloquent.Bryant interfered to prevent further
conversation; and Julia, though she had a great deal to say to her
young friend, cheerfully yielded to her mother's wishes, and Harry
reluctantly left the room.Towards night he was permitted to see her again, when he read several
of the angel songs to her, and gave her a brief account of the events
of his residence in Boston.She was pleased with his earnestness, and
smiled approvingly upon him for the moral triumphs he had achieved.The reward of all his struggles with trial and temptation was lavishly
bestowed in her commendation, and if fidelity had not been its own
reward, he could have accepted her approval as abundant compensation
for all he had endured.There was no silly sentiment in Harry's
composition; he had read no novels, seen no plays, knew nothing of
romance even "in real life."The homage he yielded to the fair and
loving girl was an unaffected reverence for simple purity and
goodness; that which the True Heart and the True Life never fail to
call forth whenever they exert their power.On the following morning, Julia's condition was very much improved,
and the physician spoke confidently of a favorable issue.Harry was
permitted to spend an hour by her bedside, inhaling the pure spirit
that pervaded the soul of the sick one.She was so much better that
her father proposed to visit the city, to attend to some urgent
business, which had been long deferred by her illness; and an
opportunity was thus afforded for Harry to return.Bryant drove furiously in his haste, changing horses twice on the
journey, so that they reached the city at one o'clock.On their
arrival, Harry's attention naturally turned to the reception he
expected to receive from his employers.He had not spoken of his
relations with them at Rockville, preferring not to pain them, on the
one hand, and not to take too much credit to himself for his devotion
to Julia, on the other.After the horse was disposed of at Major
Phillips's stable, Mr.Bryant walked down town with Harry; and when
they reached the store of Wake & Wade, he entered with him.asked the senior partner, rather
coldly, when he saw the delinquent.Harry was confused at this reception, though it was not unexpected."I didn't know but that you might be willing to take me again."Did you say that you did not want my
young friend, here?"Bryant, taking the offered hand of
Mr."I did say so," said the senior."I was not aware that he was your
friend, though," and he proceeded to inform Mr.Bryant that Harry had
left them against their wish."A few words with you, if you please."Wake conducted him to the private office, where they remained for
half an hour."It is all right, Harry," continued Mr.ejaculated our hero, rejoiced to find his place was
still secure."I would not have gone if I could possibly have helped
it.""You did right, my boy, and I honor you for your courage and
constancy."Bryant bade him an affectionate adieu, promising to write to him
often until Julia recovered, and then departed.With a grateful heart Harry immediately resumed his duties, and the
partners were probably as glad to retain him as he was to remain.At night, when he went to his chamber, he raised the loose board to
get the pill box, containing his savings, in order to return the money
he had not expended.To his consternation, he discovered that it was
gone!CHAPTER XVIII

IN WHICH HARRY MEETS WITH AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AND GETS A HARD KNOCK ON
THE HEAD


It was in vain that Harry searched beneath the broken floor for his
lost treasure; it could not be found.He raised the boards up, and
satisfied himself that it had not slipped away into any crevice, or
fallen through into the room below; and the conclusion was inevitable
that the box had been stolen.The mystery confused Harry, for he was certain
that no one had seen him deposit the box beneath the floor.No one
except Edward even knew that he had any money.Flint nor Katy would have stolen it; and he was not
willing to believe that his room-mate would be guilty of such a mean
and contemptible act.He tried to assure himself that it had not been stolen--that it was
still somewhere beneath the floor; and he pulled up another board, to
resume the search.He had scarcely done so before Edward joined him.he asked, apparently very much astonished
at his chum's occupation."Are you going to pull the house down?"replied Harry, suspending
operations to watch Edward's expression when he told him of his loss."Put it here, under this loose board."Edward manifested a great deal of enthusiasm in the search.He was
sure it must be where Harry had put it, or that it had rolled back out
of sight; and he began tearing up the floor with a zeal that
threatened the destruction of the building.But the box could not be
found, and they were obliged to abandon the search."That is a fact; I can't spare that money, anyhow.I have been a good
while earning it, and it is too thundering bad to lose it.""I don't understand it," continued Edward."Nor I either," replied Harry, looking his companion sharp in the eye."No one knew I had it but you.""Do you mean to say I stole it?"exclaimed Edward, doubling his fist,
while his cheek reddened with anger.I didn't mean to lay it to you."And Edward was very glad to have the matter compromised."I did not; perhaps I spoke hastily.You know how hard I worked for
this money; and it seems hard to lose it.But no matter; I will try
again."Flint and Katy were much grieved when Harry told of his loss.They looked as though they suspected Edward, but said nothing, for it
was very hard to accuse a son or a brother of such a crime.Flint advised Harry to put his money in the savings bank in
future, promising to take care of his spare funds till they amounted
to five dollars, which was then the smallest sum that would be
received.It was a long time before our hero became reconciled to his
loss.He had made up his mind to be a rich man; and he had carefully
hoarded every cent he could spare, thus closely imitating the man who
got rich by saving his fourpences.A few days after the loss he was reading in one of Katy's Sunday
school books about a miser.The wretch was held up as a warning to
young folks by showing them how he starved his body and soul for the
sake of gold.exclaimed Harry, as he laid the book
upon the window."I have been hoarding up my money just like this old man in the book."You couldn't be mean and stingy if you
tried.""A miser wouldn't do what you did for us, Harry," added Mrs."I have been thinking too much of money.After all, perhaps it was
just as well that I lost that money.""I am sorry you lost it; for I don't think there is any danger of your
becoming a miser," said Katy."Perhaps not; at any rate, it has set me to thinking."Harry finished the book; and it was, fortunately, just such a work as
he required to give him right and proper views in regard to the value
of wealth.His dream of being a rich man was essentially modified by
these views; and he renewedly resolved that it was better to be a good
man than a rich man, if he could not be both.It seemed to him a
little remarkable that the minister should preach upon this very topic
on the following Sunday, taking for his text the words, "Seek ye first
the kingdom of heaven and all these things shall be added unto you."He was deeply impressed by the sermon, probably because it was on a
subject to which he had given some attention.A few days after his return from Rockville, Harry received a very
cheerful letter from Mr.Bryant, to which Julia had added a few lines
in a postscript.The little angel was rapidly recovering, and our hero
was rejoiced beyond expression.The favorable termination of her
illness was a joy which far outbalanced the loss of his money, and he
was as cheerful and contented as ever.As he expressed it, in rather
homely terms, he had got "the streak of fat and the streak of lean."Julia was alive; was to smile upon him again; was still to inspire him
with that love of goodness which had given her such an influence over
him.Week after week passed by, and Harry heard nothing of his lost
treasure; but Julia had fully recovered, and for the treasure lost an
incomparably greater treasure had been gained.Edward and himself
continued to occupy the same room, though ever since the loss of the
money box Harry's chum had treated him coldly.There had never been
much sympathy between them; for while Edward was at the theatre, or
perhaps at worse places, Harry was at home, reading some good book,
writing a letter to Rockville, or employed in some other worthy
occupation.While Harry was at church or at the Sunday school, Edward,
in company with some dissolute companion, was riding about the
adjacent country.Flint often remonstrated with her son upon the life he led, and
the dissipated habits he was contracting; and several times Harry
ventured to introduce the subject.Edward, however, would not hear a
word from either.It is true that we either grow better or worse, as
we advance in life; and Edward Flint's path was down a headlong steep.His mother wept and begged him to be a better boy.Harry often wondered how he could afford to ride out and visit the
theatre and other places of amusement so frequently.His salary was
only five dollars a week now; it was only four when he had said it was
five.He seemed to have money at all times, and to spend it very
freely.He could not help believing that the contents of his pill box
had paid for some of the "stews" and "Tom and Jerrys" which his
reckless chum consumed.But the nine dollars he had lost would have
been but a drop in the bucket compared with his extravagant outlays.One day, about six months after Harry's return from Rockville, as he
was engaged behind the counter, a young man entered the store and
accosted him.It was a familiar voice; and, to Harry's surprise, but not much to his
satisfaction, he recognized his old companion, Ben Smart, who, he had
learned from Mr.Bryant, had been sent to the house of correction for
burning Squire Walker's barn."Yes, I have been here six months.""You have got a sign out for a boy, I see."There were more errands to run than one boy
could attend to; besides, Harry had proved himself so faithful and so
intelligent, that Mr.Wake wished to retain him in the store, to fit
him for a salesman."You can speak a good word for me, Harry; for I should like to work
here," continued Ben."I thought you were in--in the--"

Harry did not like to use the offensive expression, and Ben's face
darkened when he discovered what the other was going to say."Not a word about that," said he."If you ever mention that little
matter, I'll take your life.""My father got me out, and then I ran away.Not a word more, for I had
as lief be hung for an old sheep as a lamb."Wake; you can apply to him," continued Harry.The senior
talked with him a few moments, and then retired to his private office,
calling Harry as he entered."If you say anything, I will be the death of you," whispered Ben, as
Harry passed him on his way to the office.Our hero was not particularly pleased with these threats; he certainly
was not frightened by them.Wake, as he presented himself
before the senior."Who is he, and what is he?"Bryant told you the story about my leaving Redfield,"
said Harry."That is the boy that run away with me.""And the one that set the barn afire?"And Harry returned to his work at the counter.Before Harry had time to make any reply, Mr."We don't want you, young man," said he.With a glance of hatred at Harry, the applicant left the store.Since
leaving Redfield, our hero's views of duty had undergone a change; and
he now realized that to screen a wicked person was to plot with him
against the good order of society.He knew Ben's character; he had no
reason, after their interview, to suppose it was changed; and he could
not wrong his employers by permitting them ignorantly to engage a bad
boy, especially when he had been questioned directly on the point.Towards evening Harry was sent with a bundle to a place in Boylston
Street, which required him to cross the Common.On his return, when he
reached the corner of the burying ground, Ben Smart, who had evidently
followed him, and lay in wait at this spot for him, sprang from his
covert upon him.The young villain struck him a heavy blow in the eye
before Harry realized his purpose.The blow, however, was vigorously
returned; but Ben, besides being larger and stronger than his victim,
had a large stone in his hand, with which he struck him a blow on the
side of his head, knocking him insensible to the ground.The wretch, seeing that he had done his work, fled along the side of
the walk of the burying ground, pursued by several persons who had
witnessed the assault.Ben was a fleet runner this time, and succeeded
in making his escape.CHAPTER XIX

IN WHICH HARRY FINDS THAT EVEN A BROKEN HEAD MAY BE OF SOME USE TO A
PERSON


When Harry recovered his consciousness, he found himself in an
elegantly furnished chamber, with several persons standing around the
bed upon which he had been laid.A physician was standing over him,
engaged in dressing the severe wound he had received in the side of
his head."There, young man, you have had a narrow escape," said the doctor, as
he saw his patient's eyes open.asked Harry, faintly, as he tried to concentrate his
wandering senses."You are in good hands, my boy.replied the sufferer, trying to
rise on the bed."Do you feel as though you could walk home?""I don't know; I feel kind of faint.""No, sir; it feels numb, and everything seems to be flying round."Harry expressed an earnest desire to go home, and the physician
consented to accompany him in a carriage to Mrs.He
had been conveyed in his insensible condition to a house in Boylston
Street, the people of which were very kind to him, and used every
effort to make him comfortable.A carriage was procured, and Harry was assisted to enter it; for he
was so weak and confused that he could not stand alone.Ben had struck
him a terrible blow; and, as the physician declared, it was almost a
miracle that he had not been killed.Flint and Katy were shocked and alarmed when they saw the
helpless boy borne into the house; but everything that the
circumstances required was done for him.he asked, when they had placed him on the bed."They will wonder what has become of me at the store," continued the
sufferer, whose thoughts reverted to his post of duty."I will go down to the store and tell them what has happened," said
Mr.Callender, the kind gentleman to whose house Harry had been
carried, and who had attended him to his home."Thank you, sir; you are very good.I don't want them to think that I
have run away, or anything of that sort.""They will not think so, I am sure," returned Mr.Callender, as he
departed upon his mission."Do you think I can go to the store to-morrow?"asked Harry, turning
to the physician."I am afraid not; you must keep very quiet for a time."He had never been sick a day in
his life; and it seemed to him just then as though the world could not
possibly move on without him to help the thing along.A great many
persons cherish similar notions, and cannot afford to be sick a single
day.I should like to tell my readers at some length what blessings come to
us while we are sick; what angels with healing ministrations for the
soul visit the couch of pain; what holy thoughts are sometimes kindled
in the darkened chamber; what noble resolutions have their birth in
the heart when the head is pillowed on the bed of sickness.But my
remaining space will not permit it; and I content myself with
remarking that sickness in its place is just as great a blessing as
health; that it is a part of our needed discipline.When any of my
young friends are sick, therefore, let them yield uncomplainingly to
their lot, assured that He who hath them in his keeping "doeth all
things well."Harry was obliged to learn this lesson; and when the pain in his head
began to be almost intolerable, he fretted and vexed himself about
things at the store.He was not half as patient as he might have been;
and, during the evening, he said a great many hard things about Ben
Smart, the author of his misfortune.I am sorry to say he cherished
some malignant, revengeful feelings towards him, and looked forward
with a great deal of satisfaction to the time when he should be
arrested and punished for his crime.Wade called upon him as soon as they heard of
his misfortune.They were very indignant when they learned that Harry
was suffering for telling the truth.They assured him that they should
miss him very much at the store, but they would do the best they
could--which, of course, was very pleasant to him.But they told him
they could get along without him, bade him not fret, and said his
salary should be paid just the same as though he did his work.Wade continued; "and, as it will cost you more to be sick,
we will raise your wages to four dollars a week."Certainly," replied the junior, warmly.There was no possible excuse for fretting now.With so many kind
friends around him, he had no excuse for fretting; but his human
nature rebelled at his lot, and he made himself more miserable than
the pain of his wound could possibly have made him.Flint, who
sat all night by his bedside, labored in vain to make him resigned to
his situation.It seemed as though the great trial of his lifetime had
come--that which he was least prepared to meet and conquer.His head ached, and the pain of his
wound was very severe.His moral condition was, if possible, worse
than on the preceding night.He was fretful, morose, and unreasonable
towards those kind friends who kept vigil around his bedside.Strange
as it may seem, and strange as it did seem to himself, his thoughts
seldom reverted to the little angel.Once, when he thought of her
extended on the bed of pain as he was then, her example seemed to
reproach him.She had been meek and patient through all her
sufferings--had been content to die, even, if it was the will of the
Father in heaven.With a peevish exclamation, he drove her--his
guardian angel, as she often seemed to him--from his mind, with the
reflection that she could not have been as sick as he was, that she
did not endure as much pain as he did.For several days he remained in
pretty much the same state.His head ached, and the fever burned in
his veins.His moral symptoms were not improved, and he continued to
snarl and growl at those who took care of him."Give me some cold water, marm; I don't want your slops," fretted he,
when Mrs."But the doctor says you mustn't have cold water."Give me a glass of cold water, and I will--"

The door opened then, causing him to suspend the petulant words; for
one stood there whose good opinion he valued more than that of any
other person.I am so sorry to see you so sick!"exclaimed Julia Bryant,
rushing to his bedside.She was followed by her father and mother; and Katy had admitted them
unannounced to the chamber.replied Harry, smiling for the first time since
the assault."Yes, Harry; I hope you are better.When I heard about it last night,
I would not give father any peace till he promised to bring me to
Boston.""Don't be so wild, Julia," interposed her mother."You forget that he
is very sick.""Forgive me, Harry; I was so glad and so sorry.I hope I didn't make
your head ache," she added, in a very gentle tone.It was very good of you to come and see me."Harry felt a change come over him the moment she entered the room.The
rebellious thoughts in his bosom seemed to be banished by her
presence; and though his head ached and his flesh burned as much as
ever, he somehow had more courage to endure them.Bryant had asked him a few questions, and expressed
their sympathy in proper terms, they departed, leaving Julia to remain
with the invalid for a couple of hours."I did not expect to see you, Julia," said Harry, when they had gone."Didn't you think I would do as much for you as you did for me?"I am only a poor boy, and you are a
rich man's child."You can't think how bad I
felt when father got Mr."It's a hard case to be knocked down in that way, and laid up in the
house for a week or two.""I know it; but we must be patient."I haven't any patience--not a bit.If I could get
hold of Ben Smart, I would choke him.I hope they will catch him and
send him to the state prison for life."These malignant words did not sound like those of
the Harry West she had known and loved.They were so bitter that they
curdled the warm blood in her veins, and the heart of Harry seemed
less tender than before."Harry," said she, in soft tones, and so sad that he could not but
observe the change which had come over her."No, I am sure you don't.asked he, deeply impressed by the sad and solemn
tones of the little angel."Forgive Ben Smart, after he has almost killed me?"Julia took up the
Bible, which lay on the table by the bedside--it was the one she had
given him--and read several passages upon the topic she had
introduced.The gentle rebuke she administered
touched his soul, and he thought how peevish and ill-natured he had
been."You have been badly hurt, Harry, and you are very sick.Now, let me
ask you one question: Which would you rather be, Harry West, sick as
you are, or Ben Smart, who struck the blow?""I had rather be myself," replied he, promptly."You ought to be glad that you are Harry West, instead of Ben Smart.Sick as you are, I am sure you are a great deal happier than he can
be, even if he is not punished for striking you."Here I have been
grumbling and growling all the time for four days.It is lucky for me that I am Harry, instead of Ben.""I am sure I have been a great deal better since I was sick than
before.When I lay on the bed, hardly able to move, I kept thinking
all the time; and my thoughts did me a great deal of good."Harry had learned his lesson, and Julia's presence was indeed an
angel's visit.For an hour longer she sat by his bed, and her words
were full of inspiration; and when her father called for her he could
hardly repress a tear as she bade him good night.Flint and Katy to forgive him for
being so cross, promising to be patient in the future.She read to him, conversed
with him about the scenes of the preceding autumn in the woods, and
told him again about her own illness.In the afternoon she bade him a
final adieu, as she was to return that day to her home.The patience and resignation which he had learned gave a favorable
turn to his sickness, and he began to improve.It was a month,
however, before he was able to take his place in the store again.Without the assistance of Julia, perhaps, he had not learned the moral
of sickness so well.As it was, he came forth from his chamber with
truer and loftier motives, and with a more earnest desire to lead the
true life.Ben Smart had been arrested; and, shortly after his recovery, Harry
was summoned as a witness at his trial.It was a plain case, and Ben
was sent to the house of correction for a long term.CHAPTER XX

IN WHICH HARRY PASSES THROUGH HIS SEVEREST TRIAL, AND ACHIEVES HIS
GREATEST TRIUMPH


Three years may appear to be a great while to the little pilgrim
through life's vicissitudes; but they soon pass away and are as "a
tale that is told."To note all the events of Harry's experience
through this period would require another volume; therefore I can only
tell the reader what he was, and what results he had achieved in that
time.It was filled with trials and temptations, not all of which were
overcome without care and privation.Often he failed, was often
disappointed, and often was pained to see how feebly the Spirit warred
against the Flesh.He loved money, and avarice frequently prompted him to do those things
which would have wrecked his bright hopes.That vision of the grandeur
and influence of the rich man's position sometimes deluded him,
causing him to forget at times that the soul would live forever, while
the body and its treasures would perish in the grave.As he grew
older, he reasoned more; his principles became more firmly fixed; and
the object of existence assumed a more definite character.He was an
attentive student, and every year not only made him wiser, but better.I do not mean to say that Harry was a remarkably good boy, that his
character was perfect, or anything of the kind.He meant well, and
tried to do well, and he did not struggle in vain against the trials
and temptations that beset him.I dare say those with whom he
associated did not consider him much better than themselves.It is
true, he did not swear, did not frequent the haunts of vice and
dissipation, did not spend his Sundays riding about the country; yet
he had his faults, and captious people did not fail to see them.He was still with Wake & Wade, though he was a salesman now, on a
salary of five dollars a week.Flint,
though Edward was no longer his room-mate.A year had been sufficient
to disgust his "fast" companion with the homely fare and homely
quarters of his father's house; and, as his salary was now eight
dollars a week, he occupied a room in the attic of a first-class
hotel.Harry was sixteen years old, and he had three hundred dollars in the
Savings Bank.He might have had more if he had not so carefully
watched and guarded against the sin of avarice.He gave some very
handsome sums to the various public charities, as well as expended
them in relieving distress wherever it presented itself.It is true,
it was sometimes very hard work to give of his earnings to relieve the
poor; and if he had acted in conformity with the nature he had
inherited, he might never have known that it was "more blessed to give
than to receive."As he grew older, and the worth of money was more
apparent, he was tempted to let the poor and the unfortunate take care
of themselves; but the struggle of duty with parsimony rendered his
gifts all the more worthy.Joe Flint had several times violated his solemn resolution to drink no
more ardent spirits; but Harry, who was his friend and confidant,
encouraged him, when he failed, to try again; and it was now nearly a
year since he had been on a "spree."Our hero occasionally heard from Rockville; and a few months before
the event we are about to narrate he had spent the pleasantest week of
his life with Julia Bryant, amid those scenes which were so full of
interest to both of them.As he walked through the woods where he had
first met the "little angel"--she had now grown to be a tall girl--he
could not but recall the events of that meeting.It was there that he
first began to live, in the true sense of the word.It was there that
he had been born into a new sphere of moral existence.Julia was still his friend, still his guiding star.Though the freedom
of childish intimacy had been diminished, the same heart resided in
each, and each felt the same interest in the other.The correspondence
between them had been almost wholly suspended, perhaps by the
interference of the "powers" at Rockville, and perhaps by the growing
sense of the "fitness of things" in the parties.But they occasionally
met, which amply compensated for the deprivations which propriety
demanded.But I must pass on to the closing event of my story--it was Harry's
severest trial, yet it resulted in his most signal triumph.He lived extravagantly, and
his increased salary was insufficient to meet his wants.When Harry
saw him drive a fast horse through the streets on Sundays, and heard
him say how often he went to the theatre, what balls and parties he
attended--when he observed how elegantly he dressed, and that he wore
a gold chain, a costly breastpin and several rings--he did not wonder
that he was "short."He lived like a prince, and it seemed as though
eight dollars a week would be but a drop in the bucket in meeting his
expenses.One day, in his extremity, he applied to Harry for the loan of five
dollars.Our hero did not like to encourage his extravagance, but he
was good-natured, and could not well avoid doing the favor, especially
as Edward wanted the money to pay his board.However, he made it the
occasion for a friendly remonstrance, and gave the spendthrift youth
some excellent advice.Edward was vexed at the lecture; but, as he
obtained the loan, he did not resent the kindly act.About a fortnight after, Edward paid him the money.It consisted of a
two-dollar bill and six half dollars.Harry was about to make a
further application of his views of duty to his friend's case, when
Edward impatiently interrupted him, telling him that, as he had got
his money, he need not preach.This was just before Harry went home to
dinner.Wake called him into the private office, and when
they had entered he closed and locked the door.Harry regarded this as
rather a singular proceeding; but, possessing the entire confidence of
his employers, it gave him no uneasiness.Wake began, "we have been losing money from the store for
the last year or more.I have missed small sums a great many times."exclaimed Harry, not knowing whether he was regarded as a
confidant or as the suspected person."To-day I gave a friend of mine several marked coins, with which he
purchased some goods."Now, we have four salesmen besides yourself."I can form no idea, sir," returned Harry."I can only speak for
myself.""Oh, well, I had no suspicion it was you," added Mr."I am going to try the same experiment again; and I want you to
keep your eyes on the money drawer all the rest of the afternoon."Wade took several silver coins from his pocket and scratched them
in such a way that they could be readily identified, and then
dismissed Harry, with the injunction to be very vigilant.When he came out of the office he perceived that Edward and Charles
Wallis were in close conversation."I say, Harry, what's in the wind?"asked the former, as our hero
returned to his position behind the counter.Harry evaded answering the question, and the other two salesmen, who
were very intimate and whose tastes and amusements were very much
alike, continued their conversation.They were evidently aware that
something unusual had occurred, or was about to occur.Soon after, a person appeared at the counter and purchased a dozen
spools of cotton, offering two half dollars in payment.Harry kept his
eye upon the money drawer, but nothing was discovered.From what he
knew of Edward's mode of life, he was prepared to believe that he was
the guilty person.The experiment was tried for three days in succession before any
result was obtained.The coins were always found in the drawer; but on
the fourth day, when they were very busy, and there was a great deal
of money in the drawer, Harry distinctly observed Edward, while making
change, take several coins from the till.The act appalled him; he
forgot the customer to whose wants he was attending, and hastened to
inform Mr."Only to the office," replied he; and his appearance and manner might
have attracted the attention of any skillful rogue."Come, Harry, don't leave your place," added Edward, playfully
grasping him by the collar, on his return."Don't stop to fool, Edward," answered Harry, as he shook him off and
took his place at the counter again.He was very absent-minded the rest of the forenoon, and his frame
shook with agitation as he heard Mr.But he trembled still more when he was summoned also, for it was very
unpleasant business."Of course, you will not object to letting me see the contents of
your pockets, Edward," said Mr."Certainly not, sir;" and he turned every one of his pockets inside
out.Not one of the decoy pieces was found upon him, or any other coins,
for that matter; he had no money.Wake was confused, for he fully
expected to convict the culprit on the spot."I suppose I am indebted to this young man for this," continued
Edward, with a sneer."I'll bet five dollars he stole the money
himself, if any has been stolen."Search me, sir, by all means," added Harry; and he began to turn his
pockets out.From his vest pocket he took out a little parcel wrapped in a shop
bill.I wasn't aware that there was any such thing in my
pocket.""But you seem to know more about it than Edward," remarked Mr.Wade,
as he took the parcel.The senior opened the wrapper, and to his surprise and sorrow found it
contained two of the marked coins.But he was not disposed hastily to
condemn Harry.He could not believe him capable of stealing; besides,
there was something in Edward's manner which seemed to indicate that
our hero was the victim of a conspiracy."As he has been so very generous towards me, Mr.Wake," interposed
Edward, "I will suggest a means by which you may satisfy yourself.My
mother keeps Harry's money for him, and perhaps, if you look it over,
you will find more marked pieces."Wake, I'm innocent," protested Harry, when he had in some measure
recovered from the first shock of the heavy blow."I never stole a
cent from anybody.""I don't believe you ever did, Harry.But can you explain how this
money happened to be in your pocket?"If you wish to look at my money, Mrs."Don't let him go with you, though," said Edward, maliciously.Flint, requesting her to exhibit the
money, and Harry signed it.sneered Edward, when he had gone."So you have been
watching me, I thought as much."Wade told me to do," replied Harry, exceedingly
mortified at the turn the investigation had taken.That is the way with you psalm-singers.Steal yourself, and
lay it to me!""I am sorry, Harry, to find that I have been mistaken in you.Is it
possible that one who is outwardly so correct in his habits should be
a thief?But your career is finished," said he, very sternly, as he
entered the office."Nothing strange to the rest of us," added Edward."I never knew one
yet who pretended to be so pious that did not turn out a rascal."Wake, I am neither a thief nor a hypocrite," replied Harry, with
spirit."I found four of the coins--four half dollars--which I marked first,
at Mrs.Flint's," said the senior, severely.Those half dollars were part of the money paid
him by Edward, and he so explained how they came in his possession.exclaimed Edward, with well-feigned surprise."I
never borrowed a cent of him in my life; and, of course, never paid
him a cent."Harry looked at Edward, amazed at the coolness with which he uttered
the monstrous lie.He questioned him in regard to the transaction, but
the young reprobate reiterated his declaration with so much force and
art that Mr.Our hero, conscious of his innocence, however strong appearances were
against him, behaved with considerable spirit, which so irritated Mr.Wake that he sent for a constable, and Harry soon found himself in
Leverett Street Jail.Strange as it may seem to my young friends, he
was not very miserable there.He was innocent, and he depended upon
that special Providence which had before befriended him to extricate
him from the difficulty.It is true, he wondered what Julia would say
when she heard of his misfortune.She would weep and grieve; and he
was sad when he thought of her.But she would be the more rejoiced
when she learned that he was innocent.The triumph would be in
proportion to the trial.On the following day he was brought up for examination.As his name
was called, the propriety of the court was suddenly disturbed by an
exclamation of surprise from an elderly man, with sun-browned face and
monstrous whiskers.almost shouted the elderly man, regardless of the dignity
of the court.An officer was on the point of turning him out; but his earnest manner
saved him.Wake, he questioned him in
regard to the youthful prisoner.muttered the elderly man, in the
most intense excitement.Harry had a friend who had not been idle,
as the sequel will show.Wake first testified to the facts we have already related, and the
lawyer, whom Harry's friends had provided, questioned him in regard to
the prisoner's character and antecedents.He was subjected to a severe cross-examination by Harry's
counsel, in which he repeatedly denied that he had ever borrowed or
paid any money to the accused.While the events preceding Harry's
arrest were transpiring, he had been absent from the city, but had
returned early in the afternoon.He disagreed with his partner in
relation to our hero's guilt, and immediately set himself to work to
unmask the conspiracy, for such he was persuaded it was.He testified that, a short time before, Edward had requested him to
pay him his salary two days before it was due, assigning as a reason
the fact that he owed Harry five dollars, which he wished to pay.He
produced two of the marked half dollars, which he had received from
Edward's landlady.Of course, Edward was utterly confounded; and, to add to his
confusion, he was immediately called to the stand again.This time his
coolness was gone; he crossed himself a dozen times, and finally
acknowledged, under the pressure of the skillful lawyer's close
questioning, that Harry was innocent.He had paid him the money found
in Mrs.Flint's possession, and had slipped the coins wrapped in the
shop bills into his pocket when he took him by the collar on his
return from the office.He had known for some time that the partners were on the watch for the
thief.He had heard them talking about the matter; but he supposed he
had managed the case so well as to exonerate himself and implicate
Harry, whom he hated for being a good boy.His heart swelled with gratitude for the kindly
interposition of Providence.The trial was past--the triumph had come.Wade, and other friends, congratulated him on the happy
termination of the affair; and while they were so engaged the elderly
man elbowed his way through the crowd to the place where Harry stood."Young man, what is your father's name?"he asked, in tones tremulous
with emotion."You had a father--what was his name?""Franklin West; a carpenter by trade.He went from Redfield to
Valparaiso when I was very young, and we never heard anything from
him."exclaimed the stranger, grasping our hero by the hand, while
the tears rolled down his brown visage.Harry did not know what to make of this announcement."Is it possible that you are my father?""I am, Harry; but I was sure you were dead.I got a letter, informing
me that your mother and the baby had gone; and about a year after I
met a man from Rockville who told me that you had died also."They continued the conversation as they walked from the court room to
the store.There was a long story for each to tell.West confessed
that, for two years after his arrival at Valparaiso, he had
accomplished very little.He drank hard, and brought on a fever, which
had nearly carried him off.But that fever was a blessing in disguise;
and since his recovery he had been entirely temperate.He had nothing
to send to his family, and shame prevented him from even writing to
his wife.He received the letter which conveyed the intelligence of
the death of his wife and child, and soon after learned that his
remaining little one was also gone.Carpenters were then in great demand in Valparaiso.He was soon in a
condition to take contracts, and fortune smiled upon him.He had
rendered himself independent, and had now returned to spend his
remaining days in his native land.He had been in Boston a week, and
happened to stray into the Police Court, where he had found the son
who, he supposed, had long ago been laid in the grave.Edward Flint finished his career of "fashionable dissipation" by being
sentenced to the house of correction.Just before he was sent over, he
confessed to Mr.Wade that it was he who had stolen Harry's money,
three years before.The next day Harry obtained leave of absence, for the purpose of
accompanying his father on a visit to Redfield.He was in exuberant
spirits.It seemed as though his cup of joy was full.He could hardly
realize that he had a father--a kind, affectionate father--who shared
the joy of his heart.They went to Redfield; but I cannot stop to tell my readers how
astonished Squire Walker, and Mr.Nason, and the paupers were, to see
the spruce young clerk come to his early home, attended by his
father--a rich father, too.We can follow our hero no farther through the highways and byways of
his life-pilgrimage.We have seen him struggle like a hero through
trial and temptation, and come off conqueror in the end.He has found
a rich father, who crowns his lot with plenty; but his true wealth is
in those good principles which the trials, no less than the triumphs,
of his career have planted in his soul.CHAPTER XXI

IN WHICH HARRY IS VERY PLEASANTLY SITUATED, AND THE STORY COMES TO AN
END


Perhaps my young readers will desire to know something of Harry's
subsequent life; and we will "drop in" upon him at his pleasant
residence in Rockville, without the formality of an introduction.The
years have elapsed since we parted with him, after his triumphant
discharge from arrest.His father did not live long after his return
to his native land, and when he was twenty-one, Harry came into
possession of a handsome fortune.But even wealth could not tempt him
to choose a life of idleness; and he went into partnership with Mr.Wade, the senior retiring at the same time.The firm of Wade and West
is quite as respectable as any in the city.Harry is not a slave to business; and he spends a portion of his time
at his beautiful place in Rockville; for the cars pass through the
village, which is only a ride of an hour and a half from the city.West's house is situated on a gentle eminence not far distant from
the turnpike road.It is built upon the very spot where the cabin of
the charcoal burners stood, in which Harry, the fugitive, passed two
nights.The aspect of the place is entirely changed, though the very
rock upon which our hero ate the sumptuous repast the little angel
brought him may be seen in the centre of the beautiful garden, by the
side of the house.West often seats himself there to think of the
events of the past, and to treasure up the pleasant memories connected
with the vicinity.The house is elegant and spacious, though there is nothing gaudy or
gay about it.It is plainly furnished, though the
articles are rich and tasteful.Who is that
beautiful lady sitting at the piano-forte?Do you not recognize her,
gentle reader?West, and an old
acquaintance.She is no longer the little angel, though I cannot tell
her height or her weight; but her husband thinks she is just as much
of an angel now as when she fed him on doughnuts upon the flat rock in
the garden.He is a fine-looking man, rather tall; and
though he does not wear a mustache, I have no doubt Mrs.West thinks
he is handsome--which is all very well, provided he does not think so
himself."This is a capital day, Julia; suppose we ride over to Redfield, and
see friend Nason," said Mr.The horse is ordered; and as they ride along, the gentleman amuses his
wife with the oft-repeated story of his flight from Jacob Wire's."Do you see that high rock, Julia?""That is the very one where I dodged Leman, and took the back track;
and there is where I knocked the bull-dog over."It is a pleasant little
cottage, for he is no longer in the service of the town.Connected with it is a fine farm of
twenty acres.Nason by his
protege, though no money was paid.Harry would have made it a free
gift, if the pride of his friend would have permitted; but it amounts
to the same thing.West and his lady are warmly welcomed by Mr.The ex-keeper is an old man now.He is a member of the church, and
considered an excellent and useful citizen.West
his "boy," and regards him with mingled pride and admiration.Our friends dine at the cottage; and, after dinner, Mr.West talk over old times, ride down to Pine Pleasant, and visit the
poorhouse.Squire Walker, Jacob
Wire, and most of the paupers who were the companions of our hero, are
dead and gone, and the living speak gently of the departed.At Pine Pleasant, they fasten the horse to a tree, and cross over to
the rock which was Harry's favorite resort in childhood."By the way, Harry, have you heard anything of Ben Smart lately?""After his discharge from the state prison, I heard that he went to
sea."They say she never smiled after she
gave him up as a hopeless case."I pity a mother whose son turns out badly.In their absence, a letter for Julia from Katy Flint
has arrived.Joe is a
steady man, and, with Harry's assistance, has purchased an interest in
the stable formerly kept by Major Phillips, who has retired on a
competency.asked Harry, as she broke the seal."Yes; he has just been sent to the Maryland penitentiary for
housebreaking.""Katy says her mother feels very badly about it."Flint is an excellent woman; she was a mother to
me.""She says they are coming up to Rockville next week.""Glad of that; they will always be welcome beneath my roof.I must
call upon them to-morrow when I go to the city.""Do; and give my love to them."And, here, reader, I must leave them--not without regret, I confess,
for it is always sad to part with warm and true-hearted friends; but
if one must leave them, it is pleasant to know that they are happy,
and are surrounded by all the blessings which make life desirable, and
filled with that bright hope which reaches beyond the perishable
things of this world.It is cheering to know that one's friends, after
they have fought a hard battle with foes without and foes within, have
won the victory, and are receiving their reward.If my young friends think well of Harry, let me admonish them to
imitate his virtues, especially his perseverance in trying to do well;
and when they fail to be as good and true as they wish to be, to TRY
AGAIN.THE END

PUBLISHERS, 147 FOURTH AVENUE

NEW YORK, N. Y.Henry returned to the wynd, warm with the good wine and the applause of
his fellow citizens, and fell asleep to dream of perfect happiness and
Catharine Glover.We have said that, when the combat was decided, the spectators were
divided into two bodies.Of these, when the more respectable portion
attended the victor in joyous procession, much the greater number, or
what might be termed the rabble, waited upon the subdued and sentenced
Bonthron, who was travelling in a different direction, and for a very
opposite purpose.Whatever may be thought of the comparative attractions
of the house of mourning and of feasting under other circumstances,
there can be little doubt which will draw most visitors, when the
question is, whether we would witness miseries which we are not to
share, or festivities of which we are not to partake.Accordingly, the
tumbril in which the criminal was conveyed to execution was attended by
far the greater proportion of the inhabitants of Perth.A friar was seated in the same car with the murderer, to whom he did
not hesitate to repeat, under the seal of confession, the same false
asseveration which he had made upon the place of combat, which charged
the Duke of Rothsay with being director of the ambuscade by which
the unfortunate bonnet maker had suffered.The same falsehood he
disseminated among the crowd, averring, with unblushing effrontery, to
those who were nighest to the car, that he owed his death to his having
been willing to execute the Duke of Rothsay's pleasure.For a time
he repeated these words, sullenly and doggedly, in the manner of one
reciting a task, or a liar who endeavours by reiteration to obtain
a credit for his words which he is internally sensible they do not
deserve.But when he lifted up his eyes, and beheld in the distance the
black outline of a gallows, at least forty feet high, with its ladder
and its fatal cord, rising against the horizon, he became suddenly
silent, and the friar could observe that he trembled very much."Be comforted, my son," said the good priest, "you have confessed
the truth, and received absolution.Your penitence will be accepted
according to your sincerity; and though you have been a man of bloody
hands and cruel heart, yet, by the church's prayers, you shall be in due
time assoilzied from the penal fires of purgatory."These assurances were calculated rather to augment than to diminish
the terrors of the culprit, who was agitated by doubts whether the
mode suggested for his preservation from death would to a certainty be
effectual, and some suspicion whether there was really any purpose of
employing them in his favour, for he knew his master well enough to be
aware of the indifference with which he would sacrifice one who might on
some future occasion be a dangerous evidence against him.His doom, however, was sealed, and there was no escaping from it.They
slowly approached the fatal tree, which was erected on a bank by the
river's side, about half a mile from the walls of the city--a site
chosen that the body of the wretch, which was to remain food for the
carrion crows, might be seen from a distance in every direction.Here the priest delivered Bonthron to the executioner, by whom he was
assisted up the ladder, and to all appearance despatched according to
the usual forms of the law.He seemed to struggle for life for a
minute, but soon after hung still and inanimate.The executioner, after
remaining upon duty for more than half an hour, as if to permit the
last spark of life to be extinguished, announced to the admirers of such
spectacles that the irons for the permanent suspension of the carcass
not having been got ready, the concluding ceremony of disembowelling the
dead body and attaching it finally to the gibbet would be deferred till
the next morning at sunrise.Notwithstanding the early hour which he had named, Master Smotherwell
had a reasonable attendance of rabble at the place of execution, to
see the final proceedings of justice with its victim.But great was the
astonishment and resentment of these amateurs to find that the dead body
had been removed from the gibbet.They were not, however, long at a loss
to guess the cause of its disappearance.Bonthron had been the follower
of a baron whose estates lay in Fife, and was himself a native of that
province.What was more natural than that some of the Fife men, whose
boats were frequently plying on the river, should have clandestinely
removed the body of their countryman from the place of public shame?The
crowd vented their rage against Smotherwell for not completing his
job on the preceding evening; and had not he and his assistant betaken
themselves to a boat, and escaped across the Tay, they would have run
some risk of being pelted to death.The event, however, was too much in
the spirit of the times to be much wondered at.Its real cause we shall
explain in the following chapter.Let gallows gape for dogs, let men go free.Henry V.


The incidents of a narrative of this kind must be adapted to each other,
as the wards of a key must tally accurately with those of the lock to
which it belongs.The reader, however gentle, will not hold himself
obliged to rest satisfied with the mere fact that such and such
occurrences took place, which is, generally speaking, all that in
ordinary life he can know of what is passing around him; but he is
desirous, while reading for amusement, of knowing the interior movements
occasioning the course of events.This is a legitimate and reasonable
curiosity; for every man hath a right to open and examine the mechanism
of his own watch, put together for his proper use, although he is not
permitted to pry into the interior of the timepiece which, for general
information, is displayed on the town steeple.It would be, therefore, uncourteous to leave my readers under any doubt
concerning the agency which removed the assassin Bonthron from the
gallows--an event which some of the Perth citizens ascribed to the foul
fiend himself, while others were content to lay it upon the natural
dislike of Bonthron's countrymen of Fife to see him hanging on the river
side, as a spectacle dishonourable to their province.About midnight succeeding the day when the execution had taken place,
and while the inhabitants of Perth were deeply buried in slumber, three
men muffled in their cloaks, and bearing a dark lantern, descended the
alleys of a garden which led from the house occupied by Sir John Ramorny
to the banks of the Tay, where a small boat lay moored to a landing
place, or little projecting pier.The wind howled in a low and
melancholy manner through the leafless shrubs and bushes; and a pale
moon "waded," as it is termed in Scotland, amongst drifting clouds,
which seemed to threaten rain.The three individuals entered the boat
with great precaution to escape observation.One of them was a tall,
powerful man; another short and bent downwards; the third middle sized,
and apparently younger than his companions, well made, and active.They seated themselves in the
boat and unmoored it from the pier."We must let her drift with the current till we pass the bridge, where
the burghers still keep guard; and you know the proverb, 'A Perth
arrow hath a perfect flight,'" said the most youthful of the party, who
assumed the office of helmsman, and pushed the boat off from the pier;
whilst the others took the oars, which were muffled, and rowed with all
precaution till they attained the middle of the river; they then ceased
their efforts, lay upon their oars, and trusted to the steersman for
keeping her in mid channel.In this manner they passed unnoticed or disregarded beneath the stately
Gothic arches of the old bridge, erected by the magnificent patronage
of Robert Bruce in 1329, and carried away by an inundation in 1621.Although they heard the voices of a civic watch, which, since these
disturbances commenced, had been nightly maintained in that important
pass, no challenge was given; and when they were so far down the stream
as to be out of hearing of these guardians of the night, they began to
row, but still with precaution, and to converse, though in a low tone."You have found a new trade, comrade, since I left you," said one of the
rowers to the other."I left you engaged in tending a sick knight, and I
find you employed in purloining a dead body from the gallows.""A living body, so please your squirehood, Master Buncle, or else my
craft hath failed of its purpose.""So I am told, Master Pottercarrier; but, saving your clerkship, unless
you tell me your trick, I will take leave to doubt of its success.""A simple toy, Master Buncle, not likely to please a genius so acute as
that of your valiancie.This suspension of the human
body, which the vulgar call hanging, operates death by apoplexia--that
is, the blood being unable to return to the heart by the compression
of the veins, it rushes to the brain, and the man dies.Also, and as an
additional cause of dissolution, the lungs no longer receive the needful
supply of the vital air, owing to the ligature of the cord around the
thorax; and hence the patient perishes."But how is such a revulsion of blood to
the brain to be prevented, sir mediciner?"said the third person, who
was no other than Ramorny's page, Eviot."Marry, then," replied Dwining, "hang me the patient up in such fashion
that the carotid arteries shall not be compressed, and the blood will
not determine to the brain, and apoplexia will not take place; and
again, if there be no ligature around the thorax, the lungs will be
supplied with air, whether the man be hanging in the middle heaven or
standing on the firm earth.""All this I conceive," said Eviot; "but how these precautions can be
reconciled with the execution of the sentence of hanging is what my dull
brain cannot comprehend."good youth, thy valiancie hath spoiled a fair wit.Hadst thou
studied with me, thou shouldst have learned things more difficult than
this.I get me certain bandages, made of the same
substance with your young valiancie's horse girths, having especial care
that they are of a kind which will not shrink on being strained, since
that would spoil my experiment.One loop of this substance is drawn
under each foot, and returns up either side of the leg to a cincture,
with which it is united; these cinctures are connected by divers straps
down the breast and back, in order to divide the weight.And there are
sundry other conveniences for easing the patient, but the chief is this:
the straps, or ligatures, are attached to a broad steel collar, curving
outwards, and having a hook or two, for the better security of the
halter, which the friendly executioner passes around that part of the
machine, instead of applying it to the bare throat of the patient.Thus, when thrown off from the ladder, the sufferer will find himself
suspended, not by his neck, if it please you, but by the steel circle,
which supports the loops in which his feet are placed, and on which his
weight really rests, diminished a little by similar supports under each
arm.Thus, neither vein nor windpipe being compressed, the man will
breathe as free, and his blood, saving from fright and novelty of
situation, will flow as temperately as your valiancie's when you stand
up in your stirrups to view a field of battle.""By my faith, a quaint and rare device!"pursued the leech, "and well worth being known to such
mounting spirits as your valiancies, since there is no knowing to what
height Sir John Ramorny's pupils may arrive; and if these be such that
it is necessary to descend from them by a rope, you may find my mode of
management more convenient than the common practice.Marry, but you must
be provided with a high collared doublet, to conceal the ring of steel,
and, above all, such a bonus socius as Smother well to adjust the
noose.""Base poison vender," said Eviot, "men of our calling die on the field
of battle.""I will save the lesson, however," replied Buncle, "in case of some
pinching occasion.But what a night the bloody hangdog Bonthron must
have had of it, dancing a pavise in mid air to the music of his own
shackles, as the night wind swings him that way and this!""It were an alms deed to leave him there," said Eviot; "for his descent
from the gibbet will but encourage him to new murders.He knows but two
elements--drunkenness and bloodshed.""Perhaps Sir John Ramorny might have been of your opinion," said
Dwining; "but it would first have been necessary to cut out the rogue's
tongue, lest he had told strange tales from his airy height.And there
are other reasons that it concerns not your valiancies to know.In
truth, I myself have been generous in serving him, for the fellow is
built as strong as Edinburgh Castle, and his anatomy would have matched
any that is in the chirurgical hall of Padua.But tell me, Master
Buncle, what news bring you from the doughty Douglas?""They may tell that know," said Buncle."I am the dull ass that bears
the message, and kens nought of its purport.I carried letters from the Duke of Albany and from Sir John
Ramorny to the Douglas, and he looked black as a northern tempest when
he opened them.I brought them answers from the Earl, at which they
smiled like the sun when the harvest storm is closing over him.Go to
your ephemerides, leech, and conjure the meaning out of that.""Methinks I can do so without much cost of wit," said the chirurgeon;
"but yonder I see in the pale moonlight our dead alive.Should he have
screamed out to any chance passenger, it were a curious interruption
to a night journey to be hailed from the top of such a gallows as that.Hark, methinks I do hear his groans amid the whistling of the wind and
the creaking of the chains.So--fair and softly; make fast the boat
with the grappling, and get out the casket with my matters, we would be
better for a little fire, but the light might bring observation on
us.Come on, my men of valour, march warily, for we are bound for the
gallows foot.Follow with the lantern; I trust the ladder has been left."Sing, three merry men, and three merry men,
     And three merry men are we,
     Thou on the land, and I on the sand,
     And Jack on the gallows tree."As they advanced to the gibbet, they could plainly hear groans, though
uttered in a low tone.Dwining ventured to give a low cough once or
twice, by way of signal; but receiving no answer, "We had best make
haste," said he to his companions, "for our friend must be in extremis,
as he gives no answer to the signal which announces the arrival of help.I will go up the ladder first and cut the
rope.Do you two follow, one after another, and take fast hold of the
body, so that he fall not when the halter is unloosed.Keep sure gripe,
for which the bandages will afford you convenience.Bethink you that,
though he plays an owl's part tonight, he hath no wings, and to fall out
of a halter may be as dangerous as to fall into one."While he spoke thus with sneer and gibe, he ascended the ladder, and
having ascertained that the men at arms who followed him had the body in
their hold, he cut the rope, and then gave his aid to support the almost
lifeless form of the criminal.By a skilful exertion of strength and address, the body of Bonthron was
placed safely on the ground; and the faint yet certain existence of life
having been ascertained, it was thence transported to the river side,
where, shrouded by the bank, the party might be best concealed from
observation, while the leech employed himself in the necessary means of
recalling animation, with which he had taken care to provide himself.For this purpose he first freed the recovered person from his shackles,
which the executioner had left unlocked on purpose, and at the same time
disengaged the complicated envelopes and bandages by which he had been
suspended.It was some time ere Dwining's efforts succeeded; for, in
despite of the skill with which his machine had been constructed, the
straps designed to support the body had stretched so considerably as to
occasion the sense of suffocation becoming extremely overpowering.But
the address of the surgeon triumphed over all obstacles; and, after
sneezing and stretching himself, with one or two brief convulsions,
Bonthron gave decided proofs of reanimation, by arresting the hand
of the operator as it was in the act of dropping strong waters on his
breast and throat, and, directing the bottle which contained them to his
lips, he took, almost perforce, a considerable gulp of the contents."It is spiritual essence double distilled," said the astonished
operator, "and would blister the throat and burn the stomach of any
other man.But this extraordinary beast is so unlike all other human
creatures, that I should not wonder if it brought him to the complete
possession of his faculties."Bonthron seemed to confirm this: he started with a strong convulsion,
sat up, stared around, and indicated some consciousness of existence."Wine--wine," were the first words which he articulated.The leech gave him a draught of medicated wine, mixed with water.He
rejected it, under the dishonourable epithet of "kennel washings," and
again uttered the words, "Wine--wine.""Nay, take it to thee, i' the devil's name," said the leech, "since none
but he can judge of thy constitution."A draught, long and deep enough to have discomposed the intellects of
any other person, was found effectual in recalling those of Bonthron to
a more perfect state; though he betrayed no recollection of where he was
or what had befallen him, and in his brief and sullen manner asked why
he was brought to the river side at this time of night."Another frolic of the wild Prince, for drenching me as he did before.Nails and blood, but I would--"

"Hold thy peace," interrupted Eviot, "and be thankful, I pray you, if
you have any thankfulness in you, that thy body is not crow's meat and
thy soul in a place where water is too scarce to duck thee.""I begin to bethink me," said the ruffian; and raising the flask to his
mouth, which he saluted with a long and hearty kiss, he set the empty
bottle on the earth, dropped his head on his bosom, and seemed to muse
for the purpose of arranging his confused recollections."We can abide the issue of his meditations no longer," said Dwining; "he
will be better after he has slept.you have been riding the air
these some hours; try if the water be not an easier mode of conveyance.I can no more lift this mass than I
could raise in my arms a slaughtered bull.""Stand upright on thine own feet, Bonthron, now we have placed thee upon
them," said Eviot."Every drop of blood tingles in my
veins as if it had pinpoints, and my knees refuse to bear their burden.This is some practice of thine,
thou dog leech!""Ay--ay, so it is, honest Bonthron," said Dwining--"a practice thou
shalt thank me for when thou comest to learn it.In the mean while,
stretch down in the stern of that boat, and let me wrap this cloak about
thee."Assisted into the boat accordingly, Bonthron was deposited there as
conveniently as things admitted of.He answered their attentions with
one or two snorts resembling the grunt of a boar who has got some food
particularly agreeable to him."And now, Buncle," said the chirurgeon, "your valiant squireship
knows your charge.You are to carry this lively cargo by the river to
Newburgh, where you are to dispose of him as you wot of; meantime,
here are his shackles and bandages, the marks of his confinement and
liberation.Bind them up together, and fling them into the deepest pool
you pass over; for, found in your possession, they might tell tales
against us all.This low, light breath of wind from the west will permit
you to use a sail as soon as the light comes in and you are tired of
rowing.Your other valiancie, Master Page Eviot, must be content to
return to Perth with me afoot, for here severs our fair company.Take
with thee the lantern, Buncle, for thou wilt require it more than we,
and see thou send me back my flasket."As the pedestrians returned to Perth, Eviot expressed his belief that
Bonthron's understanding would never recover the shock which terror had
inflicted upon it, and which appeared to him to have disturbed all the
faculties of his mind, and in particular his memory."It is not so, an it please your pagehood," said the leech."Bonthron's
intellect, such as it is, hath a solid character: it Will but vacillate
to and fro like a pendulum which hath been put in motion, and then will
rest in its proper point of gravity.Our memory is, of all our powers of
mind, that which is peculiarly liable to be suspended.Deep intoxication
or sound sleep alike destroy it, and yet it returns when the drunkard
becomes sober or the sleeper is awakened.I knew at Paris a criminal condemned to die by the halter,
who suffered the sentence accordingly, showing no particular degree of
timidity upon the scaffold, and behaving and expressing himself as men
in the same condition are wont to do.Accident did for him what a little
ingenious practice hath done for our amiable friend from whom we but
now parted.He was cut down and given to his friends before life was
extinct, and I had the good fortune to restore him.But, though he
recovered in other particulars, he remembered but little of his trial
and sentence.Of his confession on the morning of his execution--he!(in his usual chuckling manner)--he remembered him not a word.Neither of leaving the prison, nor of his passage to the Greve, where
he suffered, nor of the devout speeches with which he--he!he!--so many good Christians, nor of ascending the
fatal tree, nor of taking the fatal leap, had my revenant the slightest
recollection.'But here we reach the point where we must separate;
for it were unfit, should we meet any of the watch, that we be found
together, and it were also prudent that we enter the city by different
gates.My profession forms an excuse for my going and coming at all
times.Your valiant pagehood will make such explanation as may seem
sufficing.""I shall make my will a sufficient excuse if I am interrogated," said
the haughty young man."Yet I will avoid interruption, if possible.The
moon is quite obscured, and the road as black as a wolf's mouth.""Tut," said the physicianer, "let not your valour care for that: we
shall tread darker paths ere it be long."Without inquiring into the meaning of these evil boding sentences, and
indeed hardly listening to them in the pride and recklessness of his
nature, the page of Ramorny parted from his ingenious and dangerous
companion, and each took his own way.The course of true love never did run smooth.The ominous anxiety of our armourer had not played him false.When the
good glover parted with his intended son in law, after the judicial
combat had been decided, he found what he indeed had expected, that his
fair daughter was in no favourable disposition towards her lover.But
although he perceived that Catharine was cold, restrained, collected,
had cast away the appearance of mortal passion, and listened with a
reserve, implying contempt, to the most splendid description he could
give her of the combat in the Skinners' Yards, he was determined not
to take the least notice of her altered manner, but to speak of her
marriage with his son Henry as a thing which must of course take place.At length, when she began, as on a former occasion, to intimate that her
attachment to the armourer did not exceed the bounds of friendship, that
she was resolved never to marry, that the pretended judicial combat
was a mockery of the divine will, and of human laws, the glover not
unnaturally grew angry."I cannot read thy thoughts, wench; nor can I pretend to guess under
what wicked delusion it is that you kiss a declared lover, suffer him
to kiss you, run to his house when a report is spread of his death, and
fling yourself into his arms when you find him alone [alive].All
this shows very well in a girl prepared to obey her parents in a match
sanctioned by her father; but such tokens of intimacy, bestowed on one
whom a young woman cannot esteem, and is determined not to marry, are
uncomely and unmaidenly.You have already been more bounteous of your
favours to Henry Smith than your mother, whom God assoilzie, ever was to
me before I married her.I tell thee, Catharine, this trifling with the
love of an honest man is what I neither can, will, nor ought to endure.I have given my consent to the match, and I insist it shall take place
without delay, and that you receive Henry Wynd tomorrow, as a man whose
bride you are to be with all despatch.""A power more potent than yours, father, will say no," replied
Catharine."I will risk it; my power is a lawful one, that of a father over a
child, and an erring child," answered her father."God and man allow of
my influence.""Then, may Heaven help us," said Catharine; "for, if you are obstinate
in your purpose, we are all lost.""We can expect no help from Heaven," said the glover, "when we act
with indiscretion.I am clerk enough myself to know that; and that your
causeless resistance to my will is sinful, every priest will inform
you.Ay, and more than that, you have spoken degradingly of the blessed
appeal to God in the combat of ordeal.for the Holy Church
is awakened to watch her sheepfold, and to extirpate heresy by fire and
steel; so much I warn thee of."Catharine uttered a suppressed exclamation; and, with difficulty
compelling herself to assume an appearance of composure, promised her
father that, if he would spare her any farther discussion of the subject
till tomorrow morning, she would then meet him, determined to make a
full discovery of her sentiments.With this promise Simon Glover was obliged to remain contented, though
extremely anxious for the postponed explanation.It could not be levity
or fickleness of character which induced his daughter to act with so
much apparent inconsistency towards the man of his choice, and whom she
had so lately unequivocally owned to be also the man of her own.What
external force there could exist, of a kind powerful enough to change
the resolutions she had so decidedly expressed within twenty-four hours,
was a matter of complete mystery."But I will be as obstinate as she can be," thought the glover, "and she
shall either marry Henry Smith without farther delay or old Simon Glover
will know an excellent reason to the contrary."The subject was not renewed during the evening; but early on the next
morning, just at sun rising, Catharine knelt before the bed in which her
parent still slumbered.Her heart sobbed as if it would burst, and her
tears fell thick upon her father's face.The good old man awoke, looked
up, crossed his child's forehead, and kissed her affectionately."I understand thee, Kate," he said; "thou art come to confession, and, I
trust, art desirous to escape a heavy penance by being sincere.""I need not ask, my father, if you remember the Carthusian monk,
Clement, and his preachings and lessons; at which indeed you assisted so
often, that you cannot be ignorant men called you one of his converts,
and with greater justice termed me so likewise?""I am aware of both," said the old man, raising himself on his elbow;
"but I defy foul fame to show that I ever owned him in any heretical
proposition, though I loved to hear him talk of the corruptions of the
church, the misgovernment of the nobles, and the wild ignorance of
the poor, proving, as it seemed to me, that the sole virtue of our
commonweal, its strength and its estimation, lay among the burgher
craft of the better class, which I received as comfortable doctrine, and
creditable to the town.And if he preached other than right doctrine,
wherefore did his superiors in the Carthusian convent permit it?If the
shepherds turn a wolf in sheep's clothing into the flock, they should
not blame the sheep for being worried.""They endured his preaching, nay, they encouraged it," said Catharine,
"while the vices of the laity, the contentions of the nobles, and
the oppression of the poor were the subject of his censure, and they
rejoiced in the crowds who, attracted to the Carthusian church,
forsook those of the other convents.But the hypocrites--for such they
are--joined with the other fraternities in accusing their preacher
Clement, when, passing from censuring the crimes of the state, he
began to display the pride, ignorance, and luxury of the churchmen
themselves--their thirst of power, their usurpation over men's
consciences, and their desire to augment their worldly wealth.""For God's sake, Catharine," said her father, "speak within doors: your
voice rises in tone and your speech in bitterness, your eyes sparkle.It is owing to this zeal in what concerns you no more than others
that malicious persons fix upon you the odious and dangerous name of a
heretic.""You know I speak no more than what is truth," said Catharine, "and
which you yourself have avouched often.""Wouldst
thou have me avouch what might cost me life and limb, land and goods?For a full commission hath been granted for taking and trying heretics,
upon whom is laid the cause of all late tumults and miscarriages;
wherefore, few words are best, wench.I am ever of mind with the old
maker:

"Since word is thrall and thought is free, Keep well thy tongue, I
counsel thee.""The counsel comes too late, father," answered Catharine, sinking down
on a chair by her father's bedside."The words have been spoken and
heard; and it is indited against Simon Glover, burgess in Perth, that he
hath spoken irreverent discourses of the doctrines of Holy Church.""As I live by knife and needle," interrupted Simon, "it is a lie!I
never was so silly as to speak of what I understood not.""And hath slandered the anointed of the church, both regular and
secular," continued Catharine."Nay, I will never deny the truth," said the glover: "an idle word I may
have spoken at the ale bench, or over a pottle pot of wine, or in right
sure company; but else, my tongue is not one to run my head into peril.""So you think, my dearest father; but your slightest language has been
espied, your best meaning phrases have been perverted, and you are in
dittay as a gross railer against church and churchmen, and for holding
discourse against them with loose and profligate persons, such as the
deceased Oliver Proudfute, the smith Henry of the Wynd, and others, set
forth as commending the doctrines of Father Clement, whom they charge
with seven rank heresies, and seek for with staff and spear, to try him
to the death.But that," said Catharine, kneeling, and looking upwards
with the aspect of one of those beauteous saints whom the Catholics have
given to the fine arts--"that they shall never do.He hath escaped from
the net of the fowler; and, I thank Heaven, it was by my means.""Thy means, girl--art thou mad?""I will not deny what I glory in," answered Catharine: "it was by my
means that Conachar was led to come hither with a party of men and carry
off the old man, who is now far beyond the Highland line.""Thou my rash--my unlucky child!"said the glover, "hast dared to aid
the escape of one accused of heresy, and to invite Highlanders in arms
to interfere with the administration of justice within burgh?thou hast offended both against the laws of the church and those of the
realm.What--what would become of us, were this known?""It is known, my dear father," said the maiden, firmly--"known even to
those who will be the most willing avengers of the deed.""This must be some idle notion, Catharine, or some trick of those
cogging priests and nuns; it accords not with thy late cheerful
willingness to wed Henry Smith."dearest father, remember the dismal surprise occasioned by his
reported death, and the joyful amazement at finding him alive; and deem
it not wonder if I permitted myself, under your protection, to say more
than my reflection justified.But then I knew not the worst, and thought
the danger exaggerated.Alas I was yesterday fearfully undeceived, when
the abbess herself came hither, and with her the Dominican.They showed
me the commission, under the broad seal of Scotland, for inquiring into
and punishing heresy; they showed me your name and my own in a list of
suspected persons; and it was with tears--real tears, that the abbess
conjured me to avert a dreadful fate by a speedy retreat into the
cloister, and that the monk pledged his word that you should not be
molested if I complied.""The foul fiend take them both for weeping crocodiles!"replied Catharine, "complaint or anger will little help us; but
you see I have had real cause for this present alarm."my reckless child, where was your
prudence when you ran headlong into such a snare?""Hear me, father," said Catharine; "there is still one mode of safety
held out: it is one which I have often proposed, and for which I have in
vain supplicated your permission.""I understand you--the convent," said her father."But, Catharine, what
abbess or prioress would dare--"

"That I will explain to you, father, and it will also show the
circumstances which have made me seem unsteady of resolution to a
degree which has brought censure upon me from yourself and others.Our
confessor, old Father Francis, whom I chose from the Dominican convent
at your command--"

"Ay, truly," interrupted the glover; "and I so counselled and commanded
thee, in order to take off the report that thy conscience was altogether
under the direction of Father Clement.""Well, this Father Francis has at different times urged and provoked me
to converse on such matters as he judged I was likely to learn something
of from the Carthusian preacher.I fell
into the snare, spoke freely, and, as he argued gently, as one who would
fain be convinced, I even spoke warmly in defence of what I believed
devoutly.The confessor assumed not his real aspect and betrayed not his
secret purpose until he had learned all that I had to tell him.It was
then that he threatened me with temporal punishment and with eternal
condemnation.Had his threats reached me alone, I could have stood firm;
for their cruelty on earth I could have endured, and their power beyond
this life I have no belief in."said the glover, who was well nigh beside himself
at perceiving at every new word the increasing extremity of his
daughter's danger, "beware of blaspheming the Holy Church, whose arms
are as prompt to strike as her ears are sharp to hear.""To me," said the Maid of Perth, again looking up, "the terrors of the
threatened denunciations would have been of little avail; but when they
spoke of involving thee, my father, in the charge against me, I own
I trembled, and desired to compromise.The Abbess Martha, of Elcho
nunnery, being my mother's kinswoman, I told her my distresses, and
obtained her promise that she would receive me, if, renouncing worldly
love and thoughts of wedlock, I would take the veil in her sisterhood.She had conversation on the topic, I doubt not, with the Dominican
Francis, and both joined in singing the same song."'Remain in the world,' said they, 'and thy father and thou shall be
brought to trial as heretics; assume the veil, and the errors of both
shall be forgiven and cancelled.'They spoke not even of recantation
of errors of doctrine: all should be peace if I would but enter the
convent.""I doubt not--I doubt not," said Simon: "the old glover is thought rich,
and his wealth would follow his daughter to the convent of Elcho, unless
what the Dominicans might claim as their own share.So this was thy call
to the veil, these thy objections to Henry Wynd?""Indeed, father, the course was urged on all hands, nor did my own
mind recoil from it.Sir John Ramorny threatened me with the powerful
vengeance of the young Prince, if I continued to repel his wicked suit;
and as for poor Henry, it is but of late that I have discovered, to
my own surprise--that--that I love his virtues more than I dislike his
faults.the discovery has only been made to render my quitting the
world more difficult than when I thought I had thee only to regret."She rested her head on her hand and wept bitterly."All this is folly," said the glover."Never was there an extremity so
pinching, but what a wise man might find counsel if he was daring enough
to act upon it.This has never been the land or the people over whom
priests could rule in the name of Rome, without their usurpation being
controlled.If they are to punish each honest burgher who says the
monks love gold, and that the lives of some of them cry shame upon the
doctrines they teach, why, truly, Stephen Smotherwell will not lack
employment; and if all foolish maidens are to be secluded from the world
because they follow the erring doctrines of a popular preaching friar,
they must enlarge the nunneries and receive their inmates on slighter
composition.Our privileges have been often defended against the Pope
himself by our good monarchs of yore, and when he pretended to interfere
with the temporal government of the kingdom, there wanted not a Scottish
Parliament who told him his duty in a letter that should have been
written in letters of gold.I have seen the epistle myself, and though
I could not read it, the very sight of the seals of the right reverend
prelates and noble and true barons which hung at it made my heart leap
for joy.Thou shouldst not have kept this secret, my child--but it is no
time to tax thee with thy fault.I will mount
instantly, and go to our Lord Provost and have his advice, and, as I
trust, his protection and that of other true hearted Scottish nobles,
who will not see a true man trodden down for an idle word."my father," said Catharine, "it was even this impetuosity which I
dreaded.I knew if I made my plaint to you there would soon be fire and
feud, as if religion, though sent to us by the Father of peace, were fit
only to be the mother of discord; and hence I could now--even now--give
up the world, and retire with my sorrow among the sisters of Elcho,
would you but let me be the sacrifice.Only, father--comfort poor Henry
when we are parted for ever; and do not--do not let him think of me too
harshly.Say Catharine will never vex him more by her remonstrances, but
that she will never forget him in her prayers.""The girl hath a tongue that would make a Saracen weep," said her
father, his own eyes sympathising with those of his daughter."But I
will not yield way to this combination between the nun and the priest to
rob me of my only child.Away with you, girl, and let me don my clothes;
and prepare yourself to obey me in what I may have to recommend for your
safety.Get a few clothes together, and what valuables thou hast; also,
take the keys of my iron box, which poor Henry Smith gave me, and divide
what gold you find into two portions; put the one into a purse for
thyself, and the other into the quilted girdle which I made on purpose
to wear on journeys.Thus both shall be provided, in case fate should
sunder us; in which event, God send the whirlwind may take the withered
leaf and spare the green one!Let them make ready my horse instantly,
and the white jennet that I bought for thee but a day since, hoping to
see thee ride to St.John's Kirk with maids and matrons, as blythe a
bride as ever crossed the holy threshold.Away, and remember that the saints help those who are willing to help
themselves.Not a word in answer; begone, I say--no wilfullness now.The
pilot in calm weather will let a sea boy trifle with the rudder; but, by
my soul, when winds howl and waves arise, he stands by the helm himself.Catharine left the room to execute, as well as she might, the commands
of her father, who, gentle in disposition and devotedly attached to his
child, suffered her often, as it seemed, to guide and rule both herself
and him; yet who, as she knew, was wont to claim filial obedience and
exercise parental authority with sufficient strictness when the occasion
seemed to require an enforcement of domestic discipline.While the fair Catharine was engaged in executing her father's behests,
and the good old glover was hastily attiring himself, as one who was
about to take a journey, a horse's tramp was heard in the narrow street.The horseman was wrapped in his riding cloak, having the cape of it
drawn up, as if to hide the under part of his face, while his bonnet was
pulled over his brows, and a broad plume obscured his upper features.He sprung from the saddle, and Dorothy had scarce time to reply to
his inquiries that the glover was in his bedroom, ere the stranger had
ascended the stair and entered the sleeping apartment.Simon, astonished
and alarmed, and disposed to see in this early visitant an apparitor or
sumner come to attach him and his daughter, was much relieved when, as
the stranger doffed the bonnet and threw the skirt of the mantle from
his face, he recognised the knightly provost of the Fair City, a visit
from whom at any time was a favour of no ordinary degree, but, being
made at such an hour, had something marvellous, and, connected with the
circumstances of the times, even alarming."This high honour done to your
poor beadsman--"

"Hush!"said the knight, "there is no time for idle civilities.I came
hither because a man is, in trying occasions, his own safest page, and
I can remain no longer than to bid thee fly, good glover, since warrants
are to be granted this day in council for the arrest of thy daughter and
thee, under charge of heresy; and delay will cost you both your liberty
for certain, and perhaps your lives.""I have heard something of such a matter," said the glover, "and was
this instant setting forth to Kinfauns to plead my innocence of this
scandalous charge, to ask your lordship's counsel, and to implore your
protection.""Thy innocence, friend Simon, will avail thee but little before
prejudiced judges; my advice is, in one word, to fly, and wait for
happier times.As for my protection, we must tarry till the tide turns
ere it will in any sort avail thee.But if thou canst lie concealed for
a few days or weeks, I have little doubt that the churchmen, who, by
siding with the Duke of Albany in court intrigue, and by alleging
the decay of the purity of Catholic doctrine as the sole cause of the
present national misfortunes, have, at least for the present hour, an
irresistible authority over the King, will receive a check.In the mean
while, however, know that King Robert hath not only given way to this
general warrant for inquisition after heresy, but hath confirmed the
Pope's nomination of Henry Wardlaw to be Archbishop of St.Andrews and
Primate of Scotland; thus yielding to Rome those freedoms and immunities
of the Scottish Church which his ancestors, from the time of Malcolm
Canmore, have so boldly defended.His brave fathers would have rather
subscribed a covenant with the devil than yielded in such a matter to
the pretensions of Rome.""None, old man, save in some sudden court change," said Sir Patrick."The King is but like a mirror, which, having no light itself, reflects
back with equal readiness any which is placed near to it for the
time.Now, although the Douglas is banded with Albany, yet the Earl is
unfavourable to the high claims of those domineering priests, having
quarrelled with them about the exactions which his retinue hath raised
on the Abbot of Arbroath.He will come back again with a high hand, for
report says the Earl of March hath fled before him.When he returns
we shall have a changed world, for his presence will control Albany;
especially as many nobles, and I myself, as I tell you in confidence,
are resolved to league with him to defend the general right.Thy exile,
therefore, will end with his return to our court.Thou hast but to seek
thee some temporary hiding place.""For that, my lord," said the glover, "I can be at no loss, since I
have just title to the protection of the high Highland chief, Gilchrist
MacIan, chief of the Clan Quhele.""Nay, if thou canst take hold of his mantle thou needs no help of any
one else: neither Lowland churchman nor layman finds a free course of
justice beyond the Highland frontier.""But then my child, noble sir--my Catharine?"The graddan cake will keep her white teeth
in order, the goat's whey will make the blood spring to her cheek again,
which these alarms have banished and even the Fair Maiden of Perth may
sleep soft enough on a bed of Highland breckan.""It is not from such idle respects, my lord, that I hesitate," said the
glover."Catharine is the daughter of a plain burgher, and knows not
nicety of food or lodging.But the son of MacIan hath been for many
years a guest in my house, and I am obliged to say that I have observed
him looking at my daughter, who is as good as a betrothed bride, in a
manner that, though I cared not for it in this lodging in Curfew Street,
would give me some fear of consequences in a Highland glen, where I have
no friend and Conachar many."The knightly provost replied by a long whistle.Nay, in
that case, I advise thee to send her to the nunnery at Elcho, where the
abbess, if I forget not, is some relation of yours.Indeed, she said so
herself, adding, that she loved her kinswoman well, together with all
that belongs to thee, Simon.""Truly, my lord, I do believe that the abbess hath so much regard for
me, that she would willingly receive the trust of my daughter, and
my whole goods and gear, into her sisterhood.Marry, her affection is
something of a tenacious character, and would be loth to unloose its
hold, either upon the wench or her tocher."again whistled the Knight of Kinfauns; "by the Thane's
Cross, man, but this is an ill favoured pirn to wind: Yet it shall never
be said the fairest maid in the Fair City was cooped up in a convent,
like a kain hen in a cavey, and she about to be married to the bold
burgess Henry Wynd.That tale shall not be told while I wear belt and
spurs, and am called Provost of Perth.""We must all take our share of the risk.Come, get you and your daughter
presently to horse.You shall ride with me, and we'll see who dare
gloom at you.The summons is not yet served on thee, and if they send
an apparitor to Kinfauns without a warrant under the King's own hand,
I make mine avow, by the Red Rover's soul!that he shall eat his
writ, both wax and wether skin.and," addressing
Catharine, as she entered at the moment, "you too, my pretty maid--

"To horse, and fear not for your quarters; They thrive in law that trust
in Charters."In a minute or two the father and daughter were on horseback, both
keeping an arrow's flight before the provost, by his direction, that
they might not seem to be of the same company.They passed the eastern
gate in some haste, and rode forward roundly until they were out of
sight.Sir Patrick followed leisurely; but, when he was lost to the view
of the warders, he spurred his mettled horse, and soon came up with the
glover and Catharine, when a conversation ensued which throws light upon
some previous passages of this history.seed of those who scorn'd
     To stoop the neck to wide imperial Rome--
     Oh, dearest half of Albion sea walled!"I have been devising a mode," said the well meaning provost, "by which
I may make you both secure for a week or two from the malice of your
enemies, when I have little doubt I may see a changed world at court.But that I may the better judge what is to be done, tell me frankly,
Simon, the nature of your connexion with Gilchrist MacIan, which leads
you to repose such implicit confidence in him.You are a close observer
of the rules of the city, and are aware of the severe penalties which
they denounce against such burghers as have covine and alliance with the
Highland clans.""True, my lord; but it is also known to you that our craft, working in
skins of cattle, stags, and every other description of hides, have a
privilege, and are allowed to transact with those Highlanders, as with
the men who can most readily supply us with the means of conducting our
trade, to the great profit of the burgh.Thus it hath chanced with me to
have great dealings with these men; and I can take it on my salvation,
that you nowhere find more just and honourable traffickers, or by whom a
man may more easily make an honest penny.I have made in my day several
distant journeys into the far Highlands, upon the faith of their chiefs;
nor did I ever meet with a people more true to their word, when you
can once prevail upon them to plight it in your behalf.And as for the
Highland chief, Gilchrist MacIan, saving that he is hasty in homicide
and fire raising towards those with whom he hath deadly feud, I have
nowhere seen a man who walketh a more just and upright path.""It is more than ever I heard before," said Sir Patrick Charteris."Yet
I have known something of the Highland runagates too.""They show another favour, and a very different one, to their friends
than to their enemies, as your lordship shall understand," said the
glover."However, be that as it may, it chanced me to serve Gilchrist
MacIan in a high matter.It is now about eighteen years since, that it
chanced, the Clan Quhele and Clan Chattan being at feud, as indeed they
are seldom at peace, the former sustained such a defeat as well nigh
extirpated the family of their chief MacIan.Seven of his sons were
slain in battle and after it, himself put to flight, and his castle
taken and given to the flames.His wife, then near the time of giving
birth to an infant, fled into the forest, attended by one faithful
servant and his daughter.Here, in sorrow and care enough, she gave
birth to a boy; and as the misery of the mother's condition rendered her
little able to suckle the infant, he was nursed with the milk of a doe,
which the forester who attended her contrived to take alive in a snare.It was not many months afterwards that, in a second encounter of these
fierce clans, MacIan defeated his enemies in his turn, and regained
possession of the district which he had lost.It was with unexpected
rapture that he found his wife and child were in existence, having never
expected to see more of them than the bleached bones, from which the
wolves and wildcats had eaten the flesh."But a strong and prevailing prejudice, such as is often entertained
by these wild people, prevented their chief from enjoying the full
happiness arising from having thus regained his only son in safety.An
ancient prophecy was current among them, that the power of the tribe
should fall by means of a boy born under a bush of holly and suckled
by a white doe.The circumstance, unfortunately for the chief, tallied
exactly with the birth of the only child which remained to him, and it
was demanded of him by the elders of the clan, that the boy should be
either put to death or at least removed from the dominions of the tribe
and brought up in obscurity.Gilchrist MacIan was obliged to consent and
having made choice of the latter proposal, the child, under the name of
Conachar, was brought up in my family, with the purpose, as was at first
intended, of concealing from him all knowledge who or what he was, or of
his pretensions to authority over a numerous and warlike people.But,
as years rolled on, the elders of the tribe, who had exerted so much
authority, were removed by death, or rendered incapable of interfering
in the public affairs by age; while, on the other hand, the influence of
Gilchrist MacIan was increased by his successful struggles against
the Clan Chattan, in which he restored the equality betwixt the two
contending confederacies, which had existed before the calamitous defeat
of which I told your honour.Feeling himself thus firmly seated, he
naturally became desirous to bring home his only son to his bosom and
family; and for that purpose caused me to send the young Conachar, as
he was called, more than once to the Highlands.He was a youth expressly
made, by his form and gallantry of bearing, to gain a father's heart.At length, I suppose the lad either guessed the secret of his birth
or something of it was communicated to him; and the disgust which the
paughty Hieland varlet had always shown for my honest trade became more
manifest; so that I dared not so much as lay my staff over his costard,
for fear of receiving a stab with a dirk, as an answer in Gaelic to
a Saxon remark.It was then that I wished to be well rid of him, the
rather that he showed so much devotion to Catharine, who, forsooth, set
herself up to wash the Ethiopian, and teach a wild Hielandmnan mercy and
morals."Nay, my father," said Catharine, "it was surely but a point of charity
to snatch the brand from the burning.""But a small point of wisdom," said her father, "to risk the burning of
your own fingers for such an end."My lord would not offend the Fair Maid of Perth," said Sir Patrick;
"and he knows well the purity and truth of her mind.And yet I must
needs say that, had this nursling of the doe been shrivelled, haggard,
cross made, and red haired, like some Highlanders I have known, I
question if the Fair Maiden of Perth would have bestowed so much zeal
upon his conversion; and if Catharine had been as aged, wrinkled, and
bent by years as the old woman that opened the door for me this morning,
I would wager my gold spurs against a pair of Highland brogues that this
wild roebuck would never have listened to a second lecture.You laugh,
glover, and Catharine blushes a blush of anger.Let it pass, it is the
way of the world.""The way in which the men of the world esteem their neighbours, my
lord," answered Catharine, with some spirit."Nay, fair saint, forgive a jest," said the knight; "and thou, Simon,
tell us how this tale ended--with Conachar's escape to the Highlands, I
suppose?""With his return thither," said the glover."There was, for some two
or three years, a fellow about Perth, a sort of messenger, who came
and went under divers pretences, but was, in fact, the means of
communication between Gilchrist MacIan and his son, young Conachar, or,
as he is now called, Hector.From this gillie I learned, in general,
that the banishment of the dault an neigh dheil, or foster child of
the white doe, was again brought under consideration of the tribe.His
foster father, Torquil of the Oak, the old forester, appeared with
eight sons, the finest men of the clan, and demanded that the doom of
banishment should be revoked.He spoke with the greater authority, as
he was himself taishatar, or a seer, and supposed to have communication
with the invisible world.He affirmed that he had performed a magical
ceremony, termed tine egan, by which he evoked a fiend, from whom he
extorted a confession that Conachar, now called Eachin, or Hector,
MacIan, was the only man in the approaching combat between the two
hostile clans who should come off without blood or blemish.Hence
Torquil of the Oak argued that the presence of the fated person was
necessary to ensure the victory.'So much I am possessed of this,' said
the forester, 'that, unless Eachin fight in his place in the ranks of
the Clan Quhele, neither I, his foster father, nor any of my eight sons
will lift a weapon in the quarrel.'"This speech was received with much alarm; for the defection of
nine men, the stoutest of their tribe, would be a serious blow, more
especially if the combat, as begins to be rumoured, should be decided by
a small number from each side.The ancient superstition concerning
the foster son of the white doe was counterbalanced by a new and later
prejudice, and the father took the opportunity of presenting to the
clan his long hidden son, whose youthful, but handsome and animated,
countenance, haughty carriage, and active limbs excited the admiration
of the clansmen, who joyfully received him as the heir and descendant of
their chief, notwithstanding the ominous presage attending his birth and
nurture."From this tale, my lord," continued Simon Glover, "your lordship may
easily conceive why I myself should be secure of a good reception among
the Clan Quhele; and you may also have reason to judge that it would be
very rash in me to carry Catharine thither.And this, noble lord, is the
heaviest of my troubles.""We shall lighten the load, then," said Sir Patrick; "and, good glover,
I will take risk for thee and this damsel.My alliance with the Douglas
gives me some interest with Marjory, Duchess of Rothsay, his daughter,
the neglected wife of our wilful Prince.Rely on it, good glover, that
in her retinue thy daughter will be as secure as in a fenced castle.The
Duchess keeps house now at Falkland, a castle which the Duke of Albany,
to whom it belongs, has lent to her for her accommodation.I cannot
promise you pleasure, Fair Maiden; for the Duchess Marjory of Rothsay
is unfortunate, and therefore splenetic, haughty, and overbearing;
conscious of the want of attractive qualities, therefore jealous of
those women who possess them.But she is firm in faith and noble in
spirit, and would fling Pope or prelate into the ditch of her castle who
should come to arrest any one under her protection.You will therefore
have absolute safety, though you may lack comfort.""I have no title to more," said Catharine; "and deeply do I feel the
kindness that is willing to secure me such honourable protection.If she
be haughty, I will remember she is a Douglas, and hath right, as being
such, to entertain as much pride as may become a mortal; if she be
fretful, I will recollect that she is unfortunate, and if she be
unreasonably captious, I will not forget that she is my protectress.Heed no longer for me, my lord, when you have placed me under the noble
lady's charge.But my poor father, to be exposed amongst these wild and
dangerous people!""Think not of that, Catharine," said the glover: "I am as familiar with
brogues and bracken as if I had worn them myself.I have only to fear
that the decisive battle may be fought before I can leave this country;
and if the clan Quhele lose the combat, I may suffer by the ruin of my
protectors.""We must have that cared for," said Sir Patrick: "rely on my looking out
for your safety.But which party will carry the day, think you?""Frankly, my Lord Provost, I believe the Clan Chattan will have the
worse: these nine children of the forest form a third nearly of the band
surrounding the chief of Clan Quhele, and are redoubted champions.""And your apprentice, will he stand to it, thinkest thou?""He is hot as fire, Sir Patrick," answered the glover; "but he is also
unstable as water.Nevertheless, if he is spared, he seems likely to be
one day a brave man.""But, as now, he has some of the white doe's milk still lurking about
his liver, ha, Simon?""He has little experience, my lord," said the glover, "and I need not
tell an honoured warrior like yourself that danger must be familiar to
us ere we can dally with it like a mistress."This conversation brought them speedily to the Castle of Kinfauns,
where, after a short refreshment, it was necessary that the father and
the daughter should part, in order to seek their respective places of
refuge.It was then first, as she saw that her father's anxiety on her
account had drowned all recollections of his friend, that Catharine
dropped, as if in a dream, the name of "Henry Gow.""True--most true," continued her father; "we must possess him of our
purposes.""Leave that to me," said Sir Patrick."I will not trust to a messenger,
nor will I send a letter, because, if I could write one, I think he
could not read it.He will suffer anxiety in the mean while, but I will
ride to Perth tomorrow by times and acquaint him with your designs."It was a bitter moment, but
the manly character of the old burgher, and the devout resignation of
Catharine to the will of Providence made it lighter than might have been
expected.The good knight hurried the departure of the burgess, but
in the kindest manner; and even went so far as to offer him some gold
pieces in loan, which might, where specie was so scarce, be considered
as the ne plus ultra of regard.The glover, however, assured him he
was amply provided, and departed on his journey in a northwesterly
direction.The hospitable protection of Sir Patrick Charteris was no
less manifested towards his fair guest.She was placed under the charge
of a duenna who managed the good knight's household, and was compelled
to remain several days in Kinfauns, owing to the obstacles and delays
interposed by a Tay boatman, named Kitt Henshaw, to whose charge she was
to be committed, and whom the provost highly trusted.Thus were severed the child and parent in a moment of great danger and
difficulty, much augmented by circumstances of which they were then
ignorant, and which seemed greatly to diminish any chance of safety that
remained for them."Austin may do the same again for me."Pope's Prologue to Canterbury Tales from Chaucer.The course of our story will be best pursued by attending that of Simon
Glover.It is not our purpose to indicate the exact local boundaries of
the two contending clans, especially since they are not clearly pointed
out by the historians who have transmitted accounts of this memorable
feud.It is sufficient to say, that the territory of the Clan Chattan
extended far and wide, comprehending Caithness and Sutherland, and
having for their paramount chief the powerful earl of the latter shire,
thence called Mohr ar Chat.In this general sense, the Keiths, the
Sinclairs, the Guns, and other families and clans of great power, were
included in the confederacy.These, however, were not engaged in the
present quarrel, which was limited to that part of the Clan Chattan
occupying the extensive mountainous districts of Perthshire and
Inverness shire, which form a large portion of what is called the
northeastern Highlands.It is well known that two large septs,
unquestionably known to belong to the Clan Chattan, the MacPhersons and
the MacIntoshes, dispute to this day which of their chieftains was at
the head of this Badenoch branch of the great confederacy, and both have
of later times assumed the title of Captain of Clan Chattan.But, at all events, Badenoch must have been the centre of the
confederacy, so far as involved in the feud of which we treat.Of the rival league of Clan Quhele we have a still less distinct
account, for reasons which will appear in the sequel.Some authors have
identified them with the numerous and powerful sept of MacKay.If this
is done on good authority, which is to be doubted, the MacKays must have
shifted their settlements greatly since the reign of Robert III, since
they are now to be found (as a clan) in the extreme northern parts of
Scotland, in the counties of Ross and Sutherland.We cannot, therefore,
be so clear as we would wish in the geography of the story.Suffice
it that, directing his course in a northwesterly direction, the glover
travelled for a day's journey in the direction of the Breadalbane
country, from which he hoped to reach the castle where Gilchrist MacIan,
the captain of the Clan Quhele, and the father of his pupil Conachar,
usually held his residence, with a barbarous pomp of attendance and
ceremonial suited to his lofty pretensions.We need not stop to describe the toil and terrors of such a journey,
where the path was to be traced among wastes and mountains, now
ascending precipitous ravines, now plunging into inextricable bogs,
and often intersected with large brooks, and even rivers.But all these
perils Simon Glover had before encountered in quest of honest gain; and
it was not to be supposed that he shunned or feared them where liberty,
and life itself, were at stake.The danger from the warlike and uncivilised inhabitants of these wilds
would have appeared to another at least as formidable as the perils of
the journey.But Simon's knowledge of the manners and language of the
people assured him on this point also.An appeal to the hospitality of
the wildest Gael was never unsuccessful; and the kerne, that in other
circumstances would have taken a man's life for the silver button of
his cloak, would deprive himself of a meal to relieve the traveller who
implored hospitality at the door of his bothy.The art of travelling in
the Highlands was to appear as confident and defenceless as possible;
and accordingly the glover carried no arms whatever, journeyed without
the least appearance of precaution, and took good care to exhibit
nothing which might excite cupidity.Another rule which he deemed it
prudent to observe was to avoid communication with any of the passengers
whom he might chance to meet, except in the interchange of the common
civilities of salutation, which the Highlanders rarely omit.Few
opportunities occurred of exchanging even such passing greetings.The
country, always lonely, seemed now entirely forsaken; and, even in the
little straths or valleys which he had occasion to pass or traverse,
the hamlets were deserted, and the inhabitants had betaken themselves to
woods and caves.This was easily accounted for, considering the imminent
dangers of a feud which all expected would become one of the most
general signals for plunder and ravage that had ever distracted that
unhappy country.Simon began to be alarmed at this state of desolation.He had made a
halt since he left Kinfauns, to allow his nag some rest; and now he
began to be anxious how he was to pass the night.He had reckoned
upon spending it at the cottage of an old acquaintance, called Niel
Booshalloch (or the cow herd), because he had charge of numerous herds
of cattle belonging to the captain of Clan Quhele, for which purpose he
had a settlement on the banks of the Tay, not far from the spot where
it leaves the lake of the same name.From this his old host and friend,
with whom he had transacted many bargains for hides and furs, the old
glover hoped to learn the present state of the country, the prospect of
peace or war, and the best measures to be taken for his own safety.It
will be remembered that the news of the indentures of battle entered
into for diminishing the extent of the feud had only been communicated
to King Robert the day before the glover left Perth, and did not become
public till some time afterwards."If Niel Booshalloch hath left his dwelling like the rest of them, I
shall be finely holped up," thought Simon, "since I want not only the
advantage of his good advice, but also his interest with Gilchrist
MacIan; and, moreover, a night's quarters and a supper."Thus reflecting, he reached the top of a swelling green hill, and saw
the splendid vision of Loch Tay lying beneath him--an immense plate of
polished silver, its dark heathy mountains and leafless thickets of oak
serving as an arabesque frame to a magnificent mirror.Indifferent to natural beauty at any time, Simon Glover was now
particularly so; and the only part of the splendid landscape on which he
turned his eye was an angle or loop of meadow land where the river Tay,
rushing in full swoln dignity from its parent lake, and wheeling around
a beautiful valley of about a mile in breadth, begins his broad course
to the southeastward, like a conqueror and a legislator, to subdue
and to enrich remote districts.Upon the sequestered spot, which is so
beautifully situated between lake, mountain, and river, arose afterwards
the feudal castle of the Ballough [Balloch is Gaelic for the discharge
of a lake into a river], which in our time has been succeeded by the
splendid palace of the Earls of Breadalbane.But the Campbells, though they had already attained very great power
in Argyleshire, had not yet extended themselves so far eastward as Loch
Tay, the banks of which were, either by right or by mere occupancy,
possessed for, the present by the Clan Quhele, whose choicest herds were
fattened on the Balloch margin of the lake.In this valley, therefore,
between the river and the lake, amid extensive forests of oak wood,
hazel, rowan tree, and larches, arose the humble cottage of Niel
Booshalloch, a village Eumaeus, whose hospitable chimneys were seen to
smoke plentifully, to the great encouragement of Simon Glover, who might
otherwise have been obliged to spend the night in the open air, to his
no small discomfort.He reached the door of the cottage, whistled, shouted, and made his
approach known.There was a baying of hounds and collies, and presently
the master of the hut came forth.There was much care on his brow, and
he seemed surprised at the sight of Simon Glover, though the herdsman
covered both as well as he might; for nothing in that region could be
reckoned more uncivil than for the landlord to suffer anything to escape
him in look or gesture which might induce the visitor to think that
his arrival was an unpleasing, or even an unexpected, incident.The
traveller's horse was conducted to a stable, which was almost too low
to receive him, and the glover himself was led into the mansion of the
Booshalloch, where, according to the custom of the country, bread
and cheese was placed before the wayfarer, while more solid food was
preparing.Simon, who understood all their habits, took no notice of the
obvious marks of sadness on the brow of his entertainer and on those of
the family, until he had eaten somewhat for form's sake, after which he
asked the general question, "Was there any news in the country?""Bad news as ever were told," said the herdsman: "our father is no
more."said Simon, greatly alarmed, "is the captain of the Clan Quhele
dead?""The captain of the Clan Quhele never dies," answered the Booshalloch;
"but Gilchrist MacIan died twenty hours since, and his son, Eachin
MacIan, is now captain.""What, Eachin--that is Conachar--my apprentice?""As little of that subject as you list, brother Simon," said the
herdsman."It is to be remembered, friend, that your craft, which doth
very well for a living in the douce city of Perth, is something too
mechanical to be much esteemed at the foot of Ben Lawers and on the
banks of Loch Tay.We have not a Gaelic word by which we can even name a
maker of gloves.""It would be strange if you had, friend Niel," said Simon, drily,
"having so few gloves to wear.I think there be none in the whole Clan
Quhele, save those which I myself gave to Gilchrist MacIan, whom God
assoilzie, who esteemed them a choice propine.Most deeply do I regret
his death, for I was coming to him on express business.""You had better turn the nag's head southward with morning light," said
the herdsman."The funeral is instantly to take place, and it must be
with short ceremony; for there is a battle to be fought by the Clan
Quhele and the Clan Chattan, thirty champions on a side, as soon as Palm
Sunday next, and we have brief time either to lament the dead or honour
the living.""Yet are my affairs so pressing, that I must needs see the young chief,
were it but for a quarter of an hour," said the glover."Hark thee, friend," replied his host, "I think thy business must be
either to gather money or to make traffic.Now, if the chief owe thee
anything for upbringing or otherwise, ask him not to pay it when all the
treasures of the tribe are called in for making gallant preparation of
arms and equipment for their combatants, that we may meet these proud
hill cats in a fashion to show ourselves their superiors.But if thou
comest to practise commerce with us, thy time is still worse chosen.Thou knowest that thou art already envied of many of our tribe, for
having had the fosterage of the young chief, which is a thing usually
given to the best of the clan."'exclaimed the glover, "men should remember the
office was not conferred on me as a favour which I courted, but that
it was accepted by me on importunity and entreaty, to my no small
prejudice.This Conachar, or Hector, of yours, or whatever you call him,
has destroyed me doe skins to the amount of many pounds Scots.""There again, now," said the Booshalloch, "you have spoken word to cost
your life--any allusion to skins or hides, or especially to deer and
does--may incur no less a forfeit.The chief is young, and jealous of
his rank; none knows the reason better than thou, friend Glover.He
will naturally wish that everything concerning the opposition to
his succession, and having reference to his exile, should be totally
forgotten; and he will not hold him in affection who shall recall the
recollection of his people, or force back his own, upon what they must
both remember with pain.Think how, at such a moment, they will look
on the old glover of Perth, to whom the chief was so long apprentice!Come--come, old friend, you have erred in this.You are in over great
haste to worship the rising sun, while his beams are yet level with the
horizon.Come thou when he has climbed higher in the heavens, and thou
shalt have thy share of the warmth of his noonday height.""Niel Booshalloch," said the glover, "we have been old friends, as thou
say'st; and as I think thee a true one, I will speak to thee freely,
though what I say might be perilous if spoken to others of thy clan.Thou think'st I come hither to make my own profit of thy young chief,
and it is natural thou shouldst think so.But I would not, at my years,
quit my own chimney corner in Curfew Street to bask me in the beams of
the brightest sun that ever shone upon Highland heather.The very truth
is, I come hither in extremity: my foes have the advantage of me, and
have laid things to my charge whereof I am incapable, even in thought.Nevertheless, doom is like to go forth against me, and there is no
remedy but that I must up and fly, or remain and perish.I come to your
young chief, as one who had refuge with me in his distress--who ate of
my bread and drank of my cup.I ask of him refuge, which, as I trust, I
shall need but a short time.""That makes a different case," replied the herdsman."So different,
that, if you came at midnight to the gate of MacIan, having the King
of Scotland's head in your hand, and a thousand men in pursuit for the
avenging of his blood, I could not think it for his honour to refuse you
protection.And for your innocence or guilt, it concerns not the case;
or rather, he ought the more to shelter you if guilty, seeing your
necessity and his risk are both in that case the greater.I must
straightway to him, that no hasty tongue tell him of your arriving
hither without saying the cause.""A pity of your trouble," said the glover; "but where lies the chief?""He is quartered about ten miles hence, busied with the affairs of the
funeral, and with preparations for the combat--the dead to the grave and
the living to battle.""It is a long way, and will take you all night to go and come," said the
glover; "and I am very sure that Conachar when he knows it is I who--"

"Forget Conachar," said the herdsman, placing his finger on his lips."And as for the ten miles, they are but a Highland leap, when one bears
a message between his friend and his chief."So saying, and committing the traveller to the charge of his eldest son
and his daughter, the active herdsman left his house two hours before
midnight, to which he returned long before sunrise.He did not disturb
his wearied guest, but when the old man had arisen in the morning he
acquainted him that the funeral of the late chieftain was to take place
the same day, and that, although Eachin MacIan could not invite a Saxon
to the funeral, he would be glad to receive him at the entertainment
which was to follow."His will must be obeyed," said the glover, half smiling at the change
of relation between himself and his late apprentice."The man is
the master now, and I trust he will remember that, when matters were
otherwise between us, I did not use my authority ungraciously."exclaimed the Booshalloch, "the less of that you say
the better.You will find yourself a right welcome guest to Eachin, and
the deil a man dares stir you within his bounds.But fare you well, for
I must go, as beseems me, to the burial of the best chief the clan ever
had, and the wisest captain that ever cocked the sweet gale (bog myrtle)
in his bonnet.Farewell to you for a while, and if you will go to the
top of the Tom an Lonach behind the house, you will see a gallant sight,
and hear such a coronach as will reach the top of Ben Lawers.A boat
will wait for you, three hours hence, at a wee bit creek about half a
mile westward from the head of the Tay."With these words he took his departure, followed by his three sons, to
man the boat in which he was to join the rest of the mourners, and two
daughters, whose voices were wanted to join in the lament, which was
chanted, or rather screamed, on such occasions of general affliction.Simon Glover, finding himself alone, resorted to the stable to look
after his nag, which, he found, had been well served with graddan, or
bread made of scorched barley.Of this kindness he was fully sensible,
knowing that, probably, the family had little of this delicacy left to
themselves until the next harvest should bring them a scanty supply.In
animal food they were well provided, and the lake found them abundance
of fish for their lenten diet, which they did not observe very strictly;
but bread was a delicacy very scanty in the Highlands.The bogs afforded
a soft species of hay, none of the best to be sure; but Scottish horses,
like their riders, were then accustomed to hard fare.Gauntlet, for this was the name of the palfrey, had his stall crammed
full of dried fern for litter, and was otherwise as well provided for as
Highland hospitality could contrive.Simon Glover being thus left to his own painful reflections, nothing
better remained, after having seen after the comforts of the dumb
companion of his journey, than to follow the herdsman's advice; and
ascending towards the top of an eminence called Tom an Lonach, or the
Knoll of Yew Trees, after a walk of half an hour he reached the summit,
and could look down on the broad expanse of the lake, of which the
height commanded a noble view.A few aged and scattered yew trees
of great size still vindicated for the beautiful green hill the name
attached to it.But a far greater number had fallen a sacrifice to
the general demand for bow staves in that warlike age, the bow being a
weapon much used by the mountaineers, though those which they employed,
as well as their arrows, were, in shape and form, and especially in
efficacy, far inferior to the archery of merry England.The dark and
shattered individual yews which remained were like the veterans of a
broken host, occupying in disorder some post of advantage, with the
stern purpose of resisting to the last.Behind this eminence, but
detached from it, arose a higher hill, partly covered with copsewood,
partly opening into glades of pasture, where the cattle strayed,
finding, at this season of the year, a scanty sustenance among the
spring heads and marshy places, where the fresh grass began first to
arise.The opposite or northern shore of the lake presented a far more Alpine
prospect than that upon which the glover was stationed.Woods and
thickets ran up the sides of the mountains, and disappeared among the
sinuosities formed by the winding ravines which separated them from each
other; but far above these specimens of a tolerable natural soil arose
the swart and bare mountains themselves, in the dark grey desolation
proper to the season.Some were peaked, some broad crested, some rocky and precipitous, others
of a tamer outline; and the clan of Titans seemed to be commanded by
their appropriate chieftains--the frowning mountain of Ben Lawers, and
the still more lofty eminence of Ben Mohr, arising high above the rest,
whose peaks retain a dazzling helmet of snow far into the summer season,
and sometimes during the whole year.Yet the borders of this wild and
silvan region, where the mountains descended upon the lake, intimated,
even at that early period, many traces of human habitation.Hamlets were
seen, especially on the northern margin of the lake, half hid among the
little glens that poured their tributary streams into Loch Tay, which,
like many earthly things, made a fair show at a distance, but, when more
closely approached, were disgustful and repulsive, from their squalid
want of the conveniences which attend even Indian wigwams.They were
inhabited by a race who neither cultivated the earth nor cared for
the enjoyments which industry procures.The women, although otherwise
treated with affection, and even delicacy of respect, discharged all the
absolutely necessary domestic labour.The men, excepting some reluctant
use of an ill formed plough, or more frequently a spade, grudgingly gone
through, as a task infinitely beneath them, took no other employment
than the charge of the herds of black cattle, in which their wealth
consisted.At all other times they hunted, fished, or marauded, during
the brief intervals of peace, by way of pastime; plundering with bolder
license, and fighting with embittered animosity, in time of war, which,
public or private, upon a broader or more restricted scale, formed the
proper business of their lives, and the only one which they esteemed
worthy of them.The magnificent bosom of the lake itself was a scene to gaze on with
delight.Its noble breadth, with its termination in a full and beautiful
run, was rendered yet more picturesque by one of those islets which are
often happily situated in the Scottish lakes.The ruins upon that isle,
now almost shapeless, being overgrown with wood rose, at the time we
speak of, into the towers and pinnacles of a priory, where slumbered
the remains of Sibylla, daughter of Henry I of England, and consort
of Alexander the First of Scotland.This holy place had been deemed of
dignity sufficient to be the deposit of the remains of the captain of
the Clan Quhele, at least till times when the removal of the danger, now
so imminently pressing, should permit of his body being conveyed to a
distinguished convent in the north, where he was destined ultimately to
repose with all his ancestry.A number of boats pushed off from various points of the near and more
distant shore, many displaying sable banners, and others having their
several pipers in the bow, who from time to time poured forth a few
notes of a shrill, plaintive, and wailing character, and intimated to
the glover that the ceremony was about to take place.These sounds of
lamentation were but the tuning as it were of the instruments, compared
with the general wail which was speedily to be raised.A distant sound was heard from far up the lake, even as it seemed from
the remote and distant glens out of which the Dochart and the Lochy pour
their streams into Loch Tay.It was in a wild, inaccessible spot, where
the Campbells at a subsequent period founded their strong fortress of
Finlayrigg, that the redoubted commander of the Clan Quhele drew his
last breath; and, to give due pomp to his funeral, his corpse was now to
be brought down the loch to the island assigned for his temporary place
of rest.The funeral fleet, led by the chieftain's barge, from which a
huge black banner was displayed, had made more than two thirds of its
voyage ere it was visible from the eminence on which Simon Glover stood
to overlook the ceremony.The instant the distant wail of the coronach
was heard proceeding from the attendants on the funeral barge, all the
subordinate sounds of lamentation were hushed at once, as the raven
ceases to croak and the hawk to whistle whenever the scream of the eagle
is heard.The boats, which had floated hither and thither upon the lake,
like a flock of waterfowl dispersing themselves on its surface, now drew
together with an appearance of order, that the funeral flotilla might
pass onward, and that they themselves might fall into their proper
places.In the mean while the piercing din of the war pipes became
louder and louder, and the cry from the numberless boats which followed
that from which the black banner of the chief was displayed rose in
wild unison up to the Tom an Lonach, from which the glover viewed the
spectacle.The galley which headed the procession bore on its poop a
species of scaffold, upon which, arrayed in white linen, and with the
face bare, was displayed the corpse of the deceased chieftain.His son
and the nearest relatives filled the vessel, while a great number of
boats, of every description that could be assembled, either on Loch
Tay itself or brought by land carriage from Loch Earn and otherwise,
followed in the rear, some of them of very frail materials.There were
even curraghs, composed of ox hides stretched over hoops of willow,
in the manner of the ancient British, and some committed themselves
to rafts formed for the occasion, from the readiest materials that
occurred, and united in such a precarious manner as to render it
probable that, before the accomplishment of the voyage, some of the
clansmen of the deceased might be sent to attend their chieftain in the
world of spirits.When the principal flotilla came in sight of the smaller group of boats
collected towards the foot of the lake, and bearing off from the little
island, they hailed each other with a shout so loud and general, and
terminating in a cadence so wildly prolonged, that not only the deer
started from their glens for miles around, and sought the distant
recesses of the mountains, but even the domestic cattle, accustomed to
the voice of man, felt the full panic which the human shout strikes into
the wilder tribes, and like them fled from their pasture into morasses
and dingles.Summoned forth from their convent by those sounds, the monks who
inhabited the little islet began to issue from their lowly portal, with
cross and banner, and as much of ecclesiastical state as they had the
means of displaying; their bells at the same time, of which the edifice
possessed three, pealing the death toll over the long lake, which came
to the ears of the now silent multitude, mingled with the solemn chant
of the Catholic Church, raised by the monks in their procession.Various
ceremonies were gone through, while the kindred of the deceased carried
the body ashore, and, placing it on a bank long consecrated to the
purpose, made the deasil around the departed.When the corpse was
uplifted to be borne into the church, another united yell burst from the
assembled multitude, in which the deep shout of warriors and the shrill
wail of females joined their notes with the tremulous voice of age and
the babbling cry of childhood.The coronach was again, and for the last
time, shrieked as the body was carried into the interior of the
church, where only the nearest relatives of the deceased and the most
distinguished of the leaders of the clan were permitted to enter.The
last yell of woe was so terribly loud, and answered by so many hundred
echoes, that the glover instinctively raised his hands to his ears, to
shut out, or deaden at least, a sound so piercing.He kept this attitude
while the hawks, owls, and other birds, scared by the wild scream, had
begun to settle in their retreats, when, as he withdrew his hands, a
voice close by him said:

"Think you this, Simon Glover, the hymn of penitence and praise with
which it becomes poor forlorn man, cast out from his tenement of clay,
to be wafted into the presence of his maker?"The glover turned, and in the old man with a long white beard who stood
close beside him had no difficulty, from the clear mild eye and the
benevolent cast of features, to recognise the Carthusian monk Father
Clement, no longer wearing his monastic habiliments, but wrapped in a
frieze mantle and having a Highland cap on his head.It may be recollected that the glover regarded this man with a combined
feeling of respect and dislike--respect, which his judgment could not
deny to the monk's person and character, and dislike, which arose from
Father Clement's peculiar doctrines being the cause of his daughter's
exile and his own distress.It was not, therefore, with sentiments of
unmixed satisfaction that he returned the greetings of the father, and
replied to the reiterated question, what he thought of the funeral rites
which were discharged in so wild a manner: "I know not, my good father;
but these men do their duty to their deceased chief according to the
fashion of their ancestors: they mean to express their regret for their
friend's loss and their prayers to Heaven in his behalf; and that which
is done of goodwill must, to my thinking, be accepted favourably.Had
it been otherwise, methinks they had ere now been enlightened to do
better.""Thou art deceived," answered the monk."God has sent His light amongst
us all, though in various proportions; but man wilfully shuts his eyes
and prefers darkness.This benighted people mingle with the ritual of
the Roman Church the old heathen ceremonies of their own fathers, and
thus unite with the abominations of a church corrupted by wealth and
power the cruel and bloody ritual of savage paynims.""Father," said Simon, abruptly, "methinks your presence were more
useful in yonder chapel, aiding your brethren in the discharge of their
clerical duties, than in troubling and unsettling the belief of an
humble though ignorant Christian like myself.""And wherefore say, good brother, that I would unfix thy principles of
belief?""So Heaven deal with me, as, were my life
blood necessary to cement the mind of any man to the holy religion he
professeth, it should be freely poured out for the purpose.""Your speech is fair, father, I grant you," said the glover; "but if I
am to judge the doctrine by the fruits, Heaven has punished me by the
hand of the church for having hearkened thereto.Ere I heard you, my
confessor was little moved though I might have owned to have told
a merry tale upon the ale bench, even if a friar or a nun were the
subject.If at a time I had called Father Hubert a better hunter of
hares than of souls, I confessed me to the Vicar Vinesauf, who laughed
and made me pay a reckoning for penance; or if I had said that the Vicar
Vinesauf was more constant to his cup than to his breviary, I confessed
me to Father Hubert, and a new hawking glove made all well again; and
thus I, my conscience, and Mother Church lived together on terms of
peace, friendship, and mutual forbearance.But since I have listened to
you, Father Clement, this goodly union is broke to pieces, and nothing
is thundered in my ear but purgatory in the next world and fire and
fagot in this.Therefore, avoid you, Father Clement, or speak to those
who can understand your doctrine.I have no heart to be a martyr: I have
never in my whole life had courage enough so much as to snuff a candle
with my fingers; and, to speak the truth, I am minded to go back to
Perth, sue out my pardon in the spiritual court, carry my fagot to the
gallows foot in token of recantation, and purchase myself once more the
name of a good Catholic, were it at the price of all the worldly wealth
that remains to me.""You are angry, my dearest brother," said Clement, "and repent you on
the pinch of a little worldly danger and a little worldly loss for the
good thoughts which you once entertained.""You speak at ease, Father Clement, since I think you have long forsworn
the wealth and goods of the world, and are prepared to yield up your
life when it is demanded in exchange for the doctrine you preach and
believe.You are as ready to put on your pitched shirt and brimstone
head gear as a naked man is to go to his bed, and it would seem you have
not much more reluctance to the ceremony.But I still wear that which
clings to me.My wealth is still my own, and I thank Heaven it is a
decent pittance whereon to live; my life, too, is that of a hale old man
of sixty, who is in no haste to bring it to a close; and if I were
poor as Job and on the edge of the grave, must I not still cling to my
daughter, whom your doctrines have already cost so dear?""Thy daughter, friend Simon," said the Carmelite [Carthusian], "may be
truly called an angel upon earth.""Ay, and by listening to your doctrines, father, she is now like to be
called on to be an angel in heaven, and to be transported thither in a
chariot of fire.""Nay, my good brother," said Clement, "desist, I pray you, to speak of
what you little understand.Since it is wasting time to show thee the
light that thou chafest against, yet listen to that which I have to say
touching thy daughter, whose temporal felicity, though I weigh it not
even for an instant in the scale against that which is spiritual, is,
nevertheless, in its order, as dear to Clement Blair as to her own
father."The tears stood in the old man's eyes as he spoke, and Simon Glover was
in some degree mollified as he again addressed him."One would think thee, Father Clement, the kindest and most amiable of
men; how comes it, then, that thy steps are haunted by general ill
will wherever thou chancest to turn them?I could lay my life thou hast
contrived already to offend yonder half score of poor friars in their
water girdled cage, and that you have been prohibited from attendance on
the funeral?""Even so, my son," said the Carthusian, "and I doubt whether their
malice will suffer me to remain in this country.I did but speak a few
sentences about the superstition and folly of frequenting St.Fillan's
church, to detect theft by means of his bell, of bathing mad patients in
his pool, to cure their infirmity of mind; and lo!the persecutors have
cast me forth of their communion, as they will speedily cast me out of
this life.""Lo you there now," said the glover, "see what it is for a man that
cannot take a warning!Well, Father Clement, men will not cast me forth
unless it were as a companion of yours.I pray you, therefore, tell me
what you have to say of my daughter, and let us be less neighbours than
we have been.""This, then, brother Simon, I have to acquaint you with.This young
chief, who is swoln with contemplation of his own power and glory, loves
one thing better than it all, and that is thy daughter.""My runagate apprentice look up to my
daughter!"said Clement, "how close sits our worldly pride, even as ivy
clings to the wall, and cannot be separated!Look up to thy daughter,
good Simon?The captain of Clan Quhele, great as he is, and
greater as he soon expects to be, looks down to the daughter of the
Perth burgess, and considers himself demeaned in doing so.But, to use
his own profane expression, Catharine is dearer to him than life here
and Heaven hereafter: he cannot live without her.""Then he may die, if he lists," said Simon Glover, "for she is betrothed
to an honest burgess of Perth; and I would not break my word to make my
daughter bride to the Prince of Scotland.""I thought it would be your answer," replied the monk; "I would, worthy
friend, thou couldst carry into thy spiritual concerns some part of that
daring and resolved spirit with which thou canst direct thy temporal
affairs.""Hush thee--hush, Father Clement!"answered the glover; "when thou
fallest into that vein of argument, thy words savour of blazing tar, and
that is a scent I like not.As to Catharine, I must manage as I can, so
as not to displease the young dignitary; but well is it for me that she
is far beyond his reach.""She must then be distant indeed," said the Carmelite [Carthusian]."And now, brother Simon, since you think it perilous to own me and my
opinions, I must walk alone with my own doctrines and the dangers they
draw on me.But should your eye, less blinded than it now is by worldly
hopes and fears, ever turn a glance back on him who soon may be snatched
from you, remember, that by nought save a deep sense of the truth and
importance of the doctrine which he taught could Clement Blair have
learned to encounter, nay, to provoke, the animosity of the powerful and
inveterate, to alarm the fears of the jealous and timid, to walk in the
world as he belonged not to it, and to be accounted mad of men, that he
might, if possible, win souls to God.Heaven be my witness, that I would
comply in all lawful things to conciliate the love and sympathy of my
fellow creatures!It is no light thing to be shunned by the worthy as
an infected patient, to be persecuted by the Pharisees of the day as an
unbelieving heretic, to be regarded with horror at once and contempt by
the multitude, who consider me as a madman, who may be expected to turn
mischievous.But were all those evils multiplied an hundredfold, the
fire within must not be stifled, the voice which says within me 'Speak'
must receive obedience.Woe unto me if I preach not the Gospel, even
should I at length preach it from amidst the pile of flames!"So spoke this bold witness, one of those whom Heaven raised up from time
to time to preserve amidst the most ignorant ages, and to carry down to
those which succeed them, a manifestation of unadulterated Christianity,
from the time of the Apostles to the age when, favoured by the invention
of printing, the Reformation broke out in full splendour.The selfish
policy of the glover was exposed in his own eyes; and he felt himself
contemptible as he saw the Carthusian turn from him in all the
hallowedness of resignation.He was even conscious of a momentary
inclination to follow the example of the preacher's philanthropy and
disinterested zeal, but it glanced like a flash of lightning through a
dark vault, where there lies nothing to catch the blaze; and he slowly
descended the hill in a direction different from that of the Carthusian,
forgetting him and his doctrines, and buried in anxious thoughts about
his child's fate and his own.What want these outlaws conquerors should have
     But history's purchased page to call them great,
     A wider space, an ornamented grave?Their hopes were not less warm, their souls were full as brave.The funeral obsequies being over, the same flotilla which had proceeded
in solemn and sad array down the lake prepared to return with displayed
banners, and every demonstration of mirth and joy; for there was but
brief time to celebrate festivals when the awful conflict betwixt the
Clan Quhele and their most formidable rivals so nearly approached.It
had been agreed, therefore, that the funeral feast should be blended
with that usually given at the inauguration of the young chief.Some objections were made to this arrangement, as containing an evil
omen.But, on the other hand, it had a species of recommendation, from
the habits and feelings of the Highlanders, who, to this day, are wont
to mingle a degree of solemn mirth with their mourning, and something
resembling melancholy with their mirth.The usual aversion to speak
or think of those who have been beloved and lost is less known to this
grave and enthusiastic race than it is to others.You hear not only the
young mention (as is everywhere usual) the merits and the character of
parents, who have, in the course of nature, predeceased them; but the
widowed partner speaks, in ordinary conversation, of the lost spouse,
and, what is still stranger, the parents allude frequently to the beauty
or valour of the child whom they have interred.The Scottish Highlanders
appear to regard the separation of friends by death as something less
absolute and complete than it is generally esteemed in other countries,
and converse of the dear connexions who have sought the grave before
them as if they had gone upon a long journey in which they themselves
must soon follow.The funeral feast, therefore, being a general custom
throughout Scotland, was not, in the opinion of those who were to share
it, unseemingly mingled, on the present occasion, with the festivities
which hailed the succession to the chieftainship.The barge which had lately borne the dead to the grave now conveyed
the young MacIan to his new command and the minstrels sent forth their
gayest notes to gratulate Eachin's succession, as they had lately
sounded their most doleful dirges when carrying Gilchrist to his grave.From the attendant flotilla rang notes of triumph and jubilee, instead
of those yells of lamentation which had so lately disturbed the echoes
of Loch Tay; and a thousand voices hailed the youthful chieftain as he
stood on the poop, armed at all points, in the flower of early manhood,
beauty, and activity, on the very spot where his father's corpse had so
lately been extended, and surrounded by triumphant friends, as that had
been by desolate mourners.One boat kept closest of the flotilla to the honoured galley.Torquil
of the Oak, a grizzled giant, was steersman; and his eight sons, each
exceeding the ordinary stature of mankind, pulled the oars.Like some
powerful and favourite wolf hound, unloosed from his couples, and
frolicking around a liberal master, the boat of the foster brethren
passed the chieftain's barge, now on one side and now on another, and
even rowed around it, as if in extravagance of joy; while, at the same
time, with the jealous vigilance of the animal we have compared it to,
they made it dangerous for any other of the flotilla to approach so near
as themselves, from the risk of being run down by their impetuous
and reckless manoeuvres.Raised to an eminent rank in the clan by the
succession of their foster brother to the command of the Clan Quhele,
this was the tumultuous and almost terrible mode in which they testified
their peculiar share in their chief's triumph.Far behind, and with different feelings, on the part of one at least of
the company, came the small boat in which, manned by the Booshalloch and
one of his sons, Simon Glover was a passenger."If we are bound for the head of the lake," said Simon to his friend,
"we shall hardly be there for hours."But as he spoke the crew of the boat of the foster brethren, or
leichtach, on a signal from the chief's galley, lay on their oars until
the Booshalloch's boat came up, and throwing on board a rope of hides,
which Niel made fast to the head of his skiff, they stretched to their
oars once more, and, notwithstanding they had the small boat in tow,
swept through the lake with almost the same rapidity as before.The
skiff was tugged on with a velocity which seemed to hazard the pulling
her under water, or the separation of her head from her other timbers.Simon Glover saw with anxiety the reckless fury of their course, and the
bows of the boat occasionally brought within an inch or two of the level
of the water; and though his friend, Niel Booshalloch, assured him it
was all done in especial honour, he heartily wished his voyage might
have a safe termination.It had so, and much sooner than he apprehended;
for the place of festivity was not four miles distant from the
sepulchral island, being chosen to suit the chieftain's course, which
lay to the southeast, so soon as the banquet should be concluded.A
bay on the southern side of Loch Tay presented a beautiful beach of
sparkling sand, on which the boats might land with ease, and a dry
meadow, covered with turf, verdant considering the season, behind and
around which rose high banks, fringed with copsewood, and displaying the
lavish preparations which had been made for the entertainment.The Highlanders, well known for ready hatchet men, had constructed a
long arbour or silvan banqueting room, capable of receiving two hundred
men, while a number of smaller huts around seemed intended for sleeping
apartments.The uprights, the couples, and roof tree of the temporary
hall were composed of mountain pine, still covered with its bark.The
framework of the sides was of planks or spars of the same material,
closely interwoven with the leafy boughs of the fir and other
evergreens, which the neighbouring woods afforded, while the hills had
furnished plenty of heath to form the roof.Within this silvan palace
the most important personages present were invited to hold high
festival.Others of less note were to feast in various long sheds
constructed with less care; and tables of sod, or rough planks, placed
in the open air, were allotted to the numberless multitude.At a
distance were to be seen piles of glowing charcoal or blazing wood,
around which countless cooks toiled, bustled, and fretted, like so many
demons working in their native element.Pits, wrought in the hillside,
and lined with heated stones, served as ovens for stewing immense
quantities of beef, mutton, and venison; wooden spits supported sheep
and goats, which were roasted entire; others were cut into joints,
and seethed in caldrons made of the animal's own skins, sewed hastily
together and filled with water; while huge quantities of pike, trout,
salmon, and char were broiled with more ceremony on glowing embers.The
glover had seen many a Highland banquet, but never one the preparations
for which were on such a scale of barbarous profusion.He had little time, however, to admire the scene around him for, as
soon as they landed on the beach, the Booshalloch observed with some
embarrassment, that, as they had not been bidden to the table of the
dais, to which he seemed to have expected an invitation, they had best
secure a place in one of the inferior bothies or booths; and was leading
the way in that direction, when he was stopped by one of the bodyguards,
seeming to act as master of ceremonies, who whispered something in his
ear."I thought so," said the herdsman, much relieved--"I thought neither the
stranger nor the man that has my charge would be left out at the high
table."They were conducted accordingly into the ample lodge, within which were
long ranges of tables already mostly occupied by the guests, while those
who acted as domestics were placing upon them the abundant though rude
materials of the festival.The young chief, although he certainly saw
the glover and the herdsman enter, did not address any personal salute
to either, and their places were assigned them in a distant corner, far
beneath the salt, a huge piece of antique silver plate, the only article
of value that the table displayed, and which was regarded by the clan
as a species of palladium, only produced and used on the most solemn
occasions, such as the present.The Booshalloch, somewhat discontented, muttered to Simon as he took his
place: "These are changed days, friend.His father, rest his soul, would
have spoken to us both; but these are bad manners which he has learned
among you Sassenachs in the Low Country."To this remark the glover did not think it necessary to reply; instead
of which he adverted to the evergreens, and particularly to the skins
and other ornaments with which the interior of the bower was decorated.The most remarkable part of these ornaments was a number of Highland
shirts of mail, with steel bonnets, battle axes, and two handed swords
to match, which hung around the upper part of the room, together with
targets highly and richly embossed.Each mail shirt was hung over a well
dressed stag's hide, which at once displayed the armour to advantage and
saved it from suffering by damp."These," whispered the Booshalloch, "are the arms of the chosen
champions of the Clan Quhele.They are twenty-nine in number, as you
see, Eachin himself being the thirtieth, who wears his armour today,
else had there been thirty.And he has not got such a good hauberk after
all as he should wear on Palm Sunday.These nine suits of harness, of
such large size, are for the leichtach, from whom so much is expected.""And these goodly deer hides," said Simon, the spirit of his profession
awakening at the sight of the goods in which he traded--"think you the
chief will be disposed to chaffer for them?They are in demand for the
doublets which knights wear under their armour.""Did I not pray you," said Niel Booshalloch, "to say nothing on that
subject?""It is the mail shirts I speak of," said Simon--"may I ask if any of
them were made by our celebrated Perth armourer, called Henry of the
Wynd?""Thou art more unlucky than before," said Niel, "that man's name is to
Eachin's temper like a whirlwind upon the lake; yet no man knows for
what cause.""I can guess," thought our glover, but gave no utterance to the thought;
and, having twice lighted on unpleasant subjects of conversation, he
prepared to apply himself, like those around him, to his food, without
starting another topic.We have said as much of the preparations as may lead the reader to
conclude that the festival, in respect of the quality of the food, was
of the most rude description, consisting chiefly of huge joints of meat,
which were consumed with little respect to the fasting season, although
several of the friars of the island convent graced and hallowed the
board by their presence.The platters were of wood, and so were the
hooped cogues or cups out of which the guests quaffed their liquor, as
also the broth or juice of the meat, which was held a delicacy.There
were also various preparations of milk which were highly esteemed, and
were eaten out of similar vessels.Bread was the scarcest article at the
banquet, but the glover and his patron Niel were served with two small
loaves expressly for their own use.In eating, as, indeed, was then the
case all over Britain, the guests used their knives called skenes, or
the large poniards named dirks, without troubling themselves by the
reflection that they might occasionally have served different or more
fatal purposes.At the upper end of the table stood a vacant seat, elevated a step or
two above the floor.It was covered with a canopy of hollow boughs and
ivy, and there rested against it a sheathed sword and a folded banner.This had been the seat of the deceased chieftain, and was left vacant
in honour of him.Eachin occupied a lower chair on the right hand of the
place of honour.The reader would be greatly mistaken who should follow out this
description by supposing that the guests behaved like a herd of hungry
wolves, rushing upon a feast rarely offered to them.On the contrary,
the Clan Quhele conducted themselves with that species of courteous
reserve and attention to the wants of others which is often found in
primitive nations, especially such as are always in arms, because a
general observance of the rules of courtesy is necessary to prevent
quarrels, bloodshed, and death.The guests took the places assigned them
by Torquil of the Oak, who, acting as marischal taeh, i.e.sewer of
the mess, touched with a white wand, without speaking a word, the place
where each was to sit.Thus placed in order, the company patiently
waited for the portion assigned them, which was distributed among them
by the leichtach; the bravest men or more distinguished warriors of
the tribe being accommodated with a double mess, emphatically called
bieyfir, or the portion of a man.When the sewers themselves had seen
every one served, they resumed their places at the festival, and were
each served with one of these larger messes of food.Water was placed
within each man's reach, and a handful of soft moss served the purposes
of a table napkin, so that, as at an Eastern banquet, the hands were
washed as often as the mess was changed.For amusement, the bard recited
the praises of the deceased chief, and expressed the clan's confidence
in the blossoming virtues of his successor.The seannachie recited the
genealogy of the tribe, which they traced to the race of the Dalriads;
the harpers played within, while the war pipes cheered the multitude
without.The conversation among the guests was grave, subdued, and
civil; no jest was attempted beyond the bounds of a very gentle
pleasantry, calculated only to excite a passing smile.There were no
raised voices, no contentious arguments; and Simon Glover had heard a
hundred times more noise at a guild feast in Perth than was made on this
occasion by two hundred wild mountaineers.Even the liquor itself did not seem to raise the festive party above the
same tone of decorous gravity.Wine appeared in
very small quantities, and was served out only to the principal guests,
among which honoured number Simon Glover was again included.The wine
and the two wheaten loaves were indeed the only marks of notice which he
received during the feast; but Niel Booshalloch, jealous of his master's
reputation for hospitality, failed not to enlarge on them as proofs
of high distinction.Distilled liquors, since so generally used in
the Highlands, were then comparatively unknown.The usquebaugh was
circulated in small quantities, and was highly flavoured with a
decoction of saffron and other herbs, so as to resemble a medicinal
potion rather than a festive cordial.Cider and mead were seen at the
entertainment, but ale, brewed in great quantities for the purpose, and
flowing round without restriction, was the liquor generally used, and
that was drunk with a moderation much less known among the more modern
Highlanders.A cup to the memory of the deceased chieftain was the first
pledge solemnly proclaimed after the banquet was finished, and a low
murmur of benedictions was heard from the company, while the monks
alone, uplifting their united voices, sung Requiem eternam dona.An
unusual silence followed, as if something extraordinary was expected,
when Eachin arose with a bold and manly, yet modest, grace, and ascended
the vacant seat or throne, saying with dignity and firmness:

"This seat and my father's inheritance I claim as my right--so prosper
me God and St."How will you rule your father's children?"said an old man, the uncle
of the deceased."I will defend them with my father's sword, and distribute justice to
them under my father's banner."The old man, with a trembling hand, unsheathed the ponderous weapon,
and, holding it by the blade, offered the hilt to the young chieftain's
grasp; at the same time Torquil of the Oak unfurled the pennon of the
tribe, and swung it repeatedly over Eachin's head, who, with singular
grace and dexterity, brandished the huge claymore as in its defence.The guests raised a yelling shout to testify their acceptance of the
patriarchal chief who claimed their allegiance, nor was there any who,
in the graceful and agile youth before them, was disposed to recollect
the subject of sinister vaticinations.As he stood in glittering mail,
resting on the long sword, and acknowledging by gracious gestures the
acclamations which rent the air within, without, and around, Simon
Glover was tempted to doubt whether this majestic figure was that of the
same lad whom he had often treated with little ceremony, and began to
have some apprehension of the consequences of having done so.A
general burst of minstrelsy succeeded to the acclamations, and rock and
greenwood rang to harp and pipes, as lately to shout and yell of woe.It would be tedious to pursue the progress of the inaugural feast, or
detail the pledges that were quaffed to former heroes of the clan, and
above all to the twenty-nine brave galloglasses who were to fight in the
approaching conflict, under the eye and leading of their young chief.The bards, assuming in old times the prophetic character combined with
their own, ventured to assure them of the most distinguished victory,
and to predict the fury with which the blue falcon, the emblem of the
Clan Quhele, should rend to pieces the mountain cat, the well known
badge of the Clan Chattan.It was approaching sunset when a bowl, called the grace cup, made of
oak, hooped with silver, was handed round the table as the signal of
dispersion, although it was left free to any who chose a longer carouse
to retreat to any of the outer bothies.As for Simon Glover, the
Booshalloch conducted him to a small hut, contrived, it would seem,
for the use of a single individual, where a bed of heath and moss was
arranged as well as the season would permit, and an ample supply of
such delicacies as the late feast afforded showed that all care had been
taken for the inhabitant's accommodation."Do not leave this hut," said the Booshalloch, taking leave of his
friend and protege: "this is your place of rest.But apartments are lost
on such a night of confusion, and if the badger leaves his hole the toad
will creep into it."To Simon Glover this arrangement was by no means disagreeable.He had
been wearied by the noise of the day, and felt desirous of repose.After
eating, therefore, a morsel, which his appetite scarce required, and
drinking a cup of wine to expel the cold, he muttered his evening
prayer, wrapt himself in his cloak, and lay down on a couch which old
acquaintance had made familiar and easy to him.The hum and murmur,
and even the occasional shouts, of some of the festive multitude who
continued revelling without did not long interrupt his repose, and in
about ten minutes he was as fast asleep as if he had lain in his own bed
in Curfew Street.Two hours before the black cock crew, Simon Glover was wakened by a well
known voice, which called him by name.he replied, as he started from sleep, "is the morning
so far advanced?"and, raising his eyes, the person of whom he was
dreaming stood before him; and at the same moment, the events of
yesterday rushing on his recollection, he saw with surprise that the
vision retained the form which sleep had assigned it, and it was not the
mail clad Highland chief, with claymore in hand, as he had seen him
the preceding night, but Conachar of Curfew Street, in his humble
apprentice's garb, holding in his hand a switch of oak.An apparition
would not more have surprised our Perth burgher.As he gazed with
wonder, the youth turned upon him a piece of lighted bog wood which he
carried in a lantern, and to his waking exclamation replied:

"Even so, father Simon: it is Conachar, come to renew our old
acquaintance, when our intercourse will attract least notice."So saying, he sat down on a tressel which answered the purpose of
a chair, and placing the lantern beside him, proceeded in the most
friendly tone:

"I have tasted of thy good cheer many a day, father Simon; I trust thou
hast found no lack in my family?""None whatever, Eachin MacIan," answered the glover, for the simplicity
of the Celtic language and manners rejects all honorary titles; "it was
even too good for this fasting season, and much too good for me, since I
must be ashamed to think how hard you fared in Curfew Street.""Even too well, to use your own word," said Conachar, "for the deserts
of an idle apprentice and for the wants of a young Highlander.But
yesterday, if there was, as I trust, enough of food, found you not, good
glover, some lack of courteous welcome?Excuse it not--I know you did
so.But I am young in authority with my people, and I must not too early
draw their attention to the period of my residence in the Lowlands,
which, however, I can never forget.""I understand the cause entirely," said Simon; "and therefore it is
unwillingly, and as it were by force, that I have made so early a visit
hither."It is well you are come to see some of my Highland
splendour while it yet sparkles.Return after Palm Sunday, and who knows
whom or what you may find in the territories we now possess!The
wildcat may have made his lodge where the banqueting bower of MacIan now
stands."The young chief was silent, and pressed the top of the rod to his lips,
as if to guard against uttering more."There is no fear of that, Eachin," said Simon, in that vague way in
which lukewarm comforters endeavour to turn the reflections of their
friends from the consideration of inevitable danger."There is fear, and there is peril of utter ruin," answered Eachin, "and
there is positive certainty of great loss.I marvel my father consented
to this wily proposal of Albany.I would MacGillie Chattanach would
agree with me, and then, instead of wasting our best blood against
each other, we would go down together to Strathmore and kill and take
possession.I would rule at Perth and he at Dundee, and all the great
strath should be our own to the banks of the Firth of Tay.Such is the
policy I have caught from your old grey head, father Simon, when holding
a trencher at thy back, and listening to thy evening talk with Bailie
Craigdallie.""The tongue is well called an unruly member," thought the glover."Here have I been holding a candle to the devil, to show him the way to
mischief."But he only said aloud: "These plans come too late.""The indentures of battle are signed
by our marks and seals, the burning hate of the Clan Quhele and Clan
Chattan is blown up to an inextinguishable flame by mutual insults and
boasts.But to thine own affairs, father
Glover.It is religion that has brought thee hither, as I learn from
Niel Booshalloch.Surely, my experience of thy prudence did not lead
me to suspect thee of any quarrel with Mother Church.As for my old
acquaintance, Father Clement, he is one of those who hunt after the
crown of martyrdom, and think a stake, surrounded with blazing fagots,
better worth embracing than a willing bride.He is a very knight errant
in defence of his religious notions, and does battle wherever he comes.He hath already a quarrel with the monks of Sibyl's Isle yonder about
some point of doctrine."I have," answered Simon; "but we spoke little together, the time being
pressing.""He may have said that there is a third person--one more likely, I
think, to be a true fugitive for religion than either you, a shrewd
citizen, or he, a wrangling preacher--who would be right heartily
welcome to share our protection?Thou art dull, man, and wilt not guess
my meaning--thy daughter, Catharine."These last words the young chief spoke in English; and he continued the
conversation in that language, as if apprehensive of being overheard,
and, indeed, as if under the sense of some involuntary hesitation."My daughter Catharine," said the glover, remembering what the
Carthusian had told him, "is well and safe.""And wherefore came she
not with you?Think you the Clan Quhele have no cailliachs as active as
old Dorothy, whose hand has warmed my haffits before now, to wait upon
the daughter of their chieftain's master?""Again I thank you," said the glover, "and doubt neither your power nor
your will to protect my daughter, as well as myself.But an honourable
lady, the friend of Sir Patrick Charteris, hath offered her a safe place
of refuge without the risk of a toilsome journey through a desolate and
distracted country.""Oh, ay, Sir Patrick Charteris," said Eachin, in a more reserved and
distant tone; "he must be preferred to all men, without doubt.Simon Glover longed to punish this affectation of a boy who had been
scolded four times a day for running into the street to see Sir Patrick
Charteris ride past; but he checked his spirit of repartee, and simply
said:

"Sir Patrick Charteris has been provost of Perth for seven years, and it
is likely is so still, since the magistrates are elected, not in Lent,
but at St."Ah, father Glover," said the youth, in his kinder and more familiar
mode of address, "you are so used to see the sumptuous shows and
pageants of Perth, that you would but little relish our barbarous
festival in comparison.What didst thou think of our ceremonial of
yesterday?""It was noble and touching," said the glover; "and to me, who knew your
father, most especially so.When you rested on the sword and looked
around you, methought I saw mine old friend Gilchrist MacIan arisen from
the dead and renewed in years and in strength.""I played my part there boldly, I trust; and showed little of that
paltry apprentice boy whom you used to--use just as he deserved?""Eachin resembles Conachar," said the glover, "no more than a salmon
resembles a gar, though men say they are the same fish in a different
state, or than a butterfly resembles a grub.""Thinkest thou that, while I was taking upon me the power which all
women love, I would have been myself an object for a maiden's eye to
rest upon?To speak plain, what would Catharine have thought of me in
the ceremonial?""We approach the shallows now," thought Simon Glover, "and without nice
pilotage we drive right on shore.""Most women like show, Eachin; but I think my daughter Catharine be an
exception.She would rejoice in the good fortune of her household friend
and playmate; but she would not value the splendid MacIan, captain of
Clan Quhele, more than the orphan Conachar.""She is ever generous and disinterested," replied the young chief."But
yourself, father, have seen the world for many more years than she has
done, and can better form a judgment what power and wealth do for those
who enjoy them.Think, and speak sincerely, what would be your own
thoughts if you saw your Catharine standing under yonder canopy, with
the command over an hundred hills, and the devoted obedience of ten
thousand vassals; and as the price of these advantages, her hand in that
of the man who loves her the best in the world?""Meaning in your own, Conachar?""Ay, Conachar call me: I love the name, since it was by that I have been
known to Catharine.""Sincerely, then," said the glover, endeavouring to give the least
offensive turn to his reply, "my inmost thought would be the earnest
wish that Catharine and I were safe in our humble booth in Curfew
Street, with Dorothy for our only vassal.""And with poor Conachar also, I trust?You would not leave him to pine
away in solitary grandeur?""I would not," answered the glover, "wish so ill to the Clan Quhele,
mine ancient friends, as to deprive them, at the moment of emergency,
of a brave young chief, and that chief of the fame which he is about to
acquire at their head in the approaching conflict."Eachin bit his lip to suppress his irritated feelings as he replied:
"Words--words--empty words, father Simon.You fear the Clan Quhele
more than you love them, and you suppose their indignation would be
formidable should their chief marry the daughter of a burgess of Perth.""And if I do fear such an issue, Hector MacIan, have I not reason?How
have ill assorted marriages had issue in the house of MacCallanmore,
in that of the powerful MacLeans--nay, of the Lords of the Isles
themselves?What has ever come of them but divorce and exheredation,
sometimes worse fate, to the ambitious intruder?You could not marry my
child before a priest, and you could only wed her with your left
hand; and I--" he checked the strain of impetuosity which the subject
inspired, and concluded, "and I am an honest though humble burgher of
Perth, who would rather my child were the lawful and undoubted spouse of
a citizen in my own rank than the licensed concubine of a monarch.""I will wed Catharine before the priest and before the world, before
the altar and before the black stones of Iona," said the impetuous young
man."She is the love of my youth, and there is not a tie in religion or
honour but I will bind myself by them!If
we do but win this combat--and, with the hope of gaining Catharine, we
SHALL win it--my heart tells me so--I shall be so much lord over their
affections that, were I to take a bride from the almshouse, so it was
my pleasure, they would hail her as if she were a daughter of
MacCallanmore."You put words of offence in my mouth," said the old man, "and may next
punish me for them, since I am wholly in your power.But with my consent
my daughter shall never wed save in her own degree.Her heart would
break amid the constant wars and scenes of bloodshed which connect
themselves with your lot.If you really love her, and recollect her
dread of strife and combat, you would not wish her to be subjected to
the train of military horrors in which you, like your father, must
needs be inevitably and eternally engaged.Choose a bride amongst the
daughters of the mountain chiefs, my son, or fiery Lowland nobles.You
are fair, young, rich, high born, and powerful, and will not woo in
vain.You will readily find one who will rejoice in your conquests, and
cheer you under defeat.To Catharine, the one would be as frightful
as the other.A warrior must wear a steel gauntlet: a glove of kidskin
would be torn to pieces in an hour."A dark cloud passed over the face of the young chief, lately animated
with so much fire."Farewell," he said, "the only hope which could have lighted me to fame
or victory!"He remained for a space silent, and intensely thoughtful, with downcast
eyes, a lowering brow, and folded arms.At length he raised his hands,
and said: "Father,--for such you have been to me--I am about to tell you
a secret.Reason and pride both advise me to be silent, but fate urges
me, and must be obeyed.I am about to lodge in you the deepest and
dearest secret that man ever confided to man.But beware--end this
conference how it will--beware how you ever breathe a syllable of what
I am now to trust to you; for know that, were you to do so in the most
remote corner of Scotland, I have ears to hear it even there, and a
hand and poniard to reach a traitor's bosom.I am--but the word will not
out!""Do not speak it then," said the prudent glover: "a secret is no longer
safe when it crosses the lips of him who owns it, and I desire not a
confidence so dangerous as you menace me with.""Ay, but I must speak, and you must hear," said the youth."In this age
of battle, father, you have yourself been a combatant?""Once only," replied Simon, "when the Southron assaulted the Fair City.I was summoned to take my part in the defence, as my tenure required,
like that of other craftsmen, who are bound to keep watch and ward.""What can that import to the present business?""Much, else I had not asked the question," answered.Eachin, in the tone
of haughtiness which from time to time he assumed."An old man is easily brought to speak of olden times," said Simon, not
unwilling, on an instant's reflection, to lead the conversation away
from the subject of his daughter, "and I must needs confess my feelings
were much short of the high, cheerful confidence, nay, the pleasure,
with which I have seen other men go to battle.My life and profession
were peaceful, and though I have not wanted the spirit of a man, when
the time demanded it, yet I have seldom slept worse than the night
before that onslaught.My ideas were harrowed by the tales we were
told--nothing short of the truth--about the Saxon archers: how they drew
shafts of a cloth yard length, and used bows a third longer than ours.When I fell into a broken slumber, if but a straw in the mattress
pricked my side I started and waked, thinking an English arrow was
quivering in my body.In the morning, as I began for very weariness to
sink into some repose, I was waked by the tolling of the common bell,
which called us burghers to the walls; I never heard its sound peal so
like a passing knell before or since.""I did on my harness," said Simon, "such as it was; took my mother's
blessing, a high spirited woman, who spoke of my father's actions for
the honour of the Fair Town.This heartened me, and I felt still bolder
when I found myself ranked among the other crafts, all bowmen, for thou
knowest the Perth citizens have good skill in archery.We were dispersed
on the walls, several knights and squires in armour of proof being
mingled amongst us, who kept a bold countenance, confident perhaps in
their harness, and informed us, for our encouragement, that they would
cut down with their swords and axes any of those who should attempt to
quit their post.I was kindly assured of this myself by the old Kempe
of Kinfauns, as he was called, this good Sir Patrick's father, then our
provost.He was a grandson of the Red Rover, Tom of Longueville, and
a likely man to keep his word, which he addressed to me in especial,
because a night of much discomfort may have made me look paler than
usual; and, besides, I was but a lad.""And did his exhortation add to your fear or your resolution?"said
Eachin, who seemed very attentive."To my resolution," answered Simon; "for I think nothing can make a
man so bold to face one danger at some distance in his front as the
knowledge of another close behind him, to push him forward.Well, I
mounted the walls in tolerable heart, and was placed with others on the
Spey Tower, being accounted a good bowman.But a very cold fit seized me
as I saw the English, in great order, with their archers in front,
and their men at arms behind, marching forward to the attack in strong
columns, three in number.They came on steadily, and some of us would
fain have shot at them; but it was strictly forbidden, and we were
obliged to remain motionless, sheltering ourselves behind the battlement
as we best might.As the Southron formed their long ranks into lines,
each man occupying his place as by magic, and preparing to cover
themselves by large shields, called pavesses, which they planted before
them, I again felt a strange breathlessness, and some desire to go home
for a glass of distilled waters.But as I looked aside, I saw the worthy
Kempe of Kinfauns bending a large crossbow, and I thought it pity he
should waste the bolt on a true hearted Scotsman, when so many English
were in presence; so I e'en staid where I was, being in a comfortable
angle, formed by two battlements.The English then strode forward, and
drew their bowstrings--not to the breast, as your Highland kerne do, but
to the ear--and sent off their volleys of swallow tails before we could
call on St.I winked when I saw them haul up their tackle, and I
believe I started as the shafts began to rattle against the parapet.But looking round me, and seeing none hurt but John Squallit, the town
crier, whose jaws were pierced through with a cloth yard shaft, I took
heart of grace, and shot in my turn with good will and good aim.A
little man I shot at, who had just peeped out from behind his target,
dropt with a shaft through his shoulder.The provost cried, 'Well
stitched, Simon Glover!'John, for his own town, my fellow
craftsmen!'shouted I, though I was then but an apprentice.And if you
will believe me, in the rest of the skirmish, which was ended by the
foes drawing off, I drew bowstring and loosed shaft as calmly as if
I had been shooting at butts instead of men's breasts.I gained
some credit, and I have ever afterwards thought that, in case of
necessity--for with me it had never been matter of choice--I should not
have lost it again.And this is all I can tell of warlike experience in
battle.Other dangers I have had, which I have endeavoured to avoid like
a wise man, or, when they were inevitable, I have faced them like a
true one.Upon other terms a man cannot live or hold up his head in
Scotland.""I understand your tale," said Eachin; "but I shall find it difficult
to make you credit mine, knowing the race of which I am descended, and
especially that I am the son of him whom we have this day laid in the
tomb--well that he lies where he will never learn what you are now to
hear!Look, my father, the light which I bear grows short and pale, a
few minutes will extinguish it; but before it expires, the hideous tale
will be told.Father, I am--a COWARD!It is said at last, and the secret
of my disgrace is in keeping of another!"The young man sunk back in a species of syncope, produced by the agony
of his mind as he made the fatal communication.The glover, moved as
well by fear as by compassion, applied himself to recall him to life,
and succeeded in doing so, but not in restoring him to composure.He hid
his face with his hands, and his tears flowed plentifully and bitterly."For Our Lady's sake, be composed," said the old man, "and recall the
vile word!I know you better than yourself: you are no coward, but only
too young and inexperienced, ay, and somewhat too quick of fancy, to
have the steady valour of a bearded man.I would hear no other man say
that of you, Conachar, without giving him the lie.You are no coward:
I have seen high sparks of spirit fly from you even on slight enough
provocation."said the unfortunate youth; "but
when saw you them supported by the resolution that should have backed
them?The sparks you speak of fell on my dastardly heart as on a piece
of ice which could catch fire from nothing: if my offended pride urged
me to strike, my weakness of mind prompted me the next moment to fly.""Want of habit," said Simon; "it is by clambering over walls that youths
learn to scale precipices.Begin with slight feuds; exercise daily the
arms of your country in tourney with your followers."exclaimed the young chief,
starting as if something horrid had occurred to his imagination."How
many days are there betwixt this hour and Palm Sunday, and what is to
chance then?A list inclosed, from which no man can stir, more than the
poor bear who is chained to his stake.Sixty living men, the best
and fiercest--one alone excepted!--which Albyn can send down from her
mountains, all athirst for each other's blood, while a king and his
nobles, and shouting thousands besides, attend, as at a theatre, to
encourage their demoniac fury!Blows clang and blood flows, thicker,
faster, redder; they rush on each other like madmen, they tear each
other like wild beasts; the wounded are trodden to death amid the feet
of their companions!Blood ebbs, arms become weak; but there must be
no parley, no truce, no interruption, while any of the maimed wretches
remain alive!Here is no crouching behind battlements, no fighting with
missile weapons: all is hand to hand, till hands can no longer be raised
to maintain the ghastly conflict!If such a field is so horrible in
idea, what think you it will be in reality?""I can only pity you, Conachar," said Simon."It is hard to be the
descendant of a lofty line--the son of a noble father--the leader by
birth of a gallant array, and yet to want, or think you want, for
still I trust the fault lies much in a quick fancy, that over estimates
danger--to want that dogged quality which is possessed by every game
cock that is worth a handful of corn, every hound that is worth a
mess of offal.But how chanced it that, with such a consciousness of
inability to fight in this battle, you proffered even now to share your
chiefdom with my daughter?Your power must depend on your fighting this
combat, and in that Catharine cannot help you.""You mistake, old man," replied Eachin: "were Catharine to look kindly
on the earnest love I bear her, it would carry me against the front of
the enemies with the mettle of a war horse.Overwhelming as my sense
of weakness is, the feeling that Catharine looked on would give me
strength.Say yet--oh, say yet--she shall be mine if we gain the combat,
and not the Gow Chrom himself, whose heart is of a piece with his
anvil, ever went to battle so light as I shall do!One strong passion is
conquered by another."Cannot the recollection of your interest, your
honour, your kindred, do as much to stir your courage as the thoughts of
a brent browed lass?"You tell me but what I have told myself, but it is in vain," replied
Eachin, with a sigh."It is only whilst the timid stag is paired with
the doe that he is desperate and dangerous.Be it from constitution; be
it, as our Highland cailliachs will say, from the milk of the white
doe; be it from my peaceful education and the experience of your strict
restraint; be it, as you think, from an overheated fancy, which paints
danger yet more dangerous and ghastly than it is in reality, I cannot
tell.But I know my failing, and--yes, it must be said!--so sorely dread
that I cannot conquer it, that, could I have your consent to my wishes
on such terms, I would even here make a pause, renounce the rank I have
assumed, and retire into humble life.""What, turn glover at last, Conachar?""This beats the
legend of St.Nay--nay, your hand was not framed for that: you
shall spoil me no more doe skins.""Jest not," said Eachin, "I am serious.If I cannot labour, I will bring
wealth enough to live without it.They will proclaim me recreant with
horn and war pipe.Catharine will love me the better
that I have preferred the paths of peace to those of bloodshed, and
Father Clement shall teach us to pity and forgive the world, which will
load us with reproaches that wound not.I shall be the happiest of men;
Catharine will enjoy all that unbounded affection can confer upon her,
and will be freed from apprehension of the sights and sounds of horror
which your ill assorted match would have prepared for her; and you,
father Glover, shall occupy your chimney corner, the happiest and most
honoured man that ever--"

"Hold, Eachin--I prithee, hold," said the glover; "the fir light, with
which this discourse must terminate, burns very low, and I would speak
a word in my turn, and plain dealing is best.Though it may vex,
or perhaps enrage, you, let me end these visions by saying at once:
Catharine can never be yours.A glove is the emblem of faith, and a
man of my craft should therefore less than any other break his own.Catharine's hand is promised--promised to a man whom you may hate, but
whom you must honour--to Henry the armourer.The match is fitting by
degree, agreeable to their mutual wishes, and I have given my promise.It is best to be plain at once; resent my refusal as you will--I am
wholly in your power.The glover spoke thus decidedly, because he was aware from experience
that the very irritable disposition of his former apprentice yielded in
most cases to stern and decided resolution.Yet, recollecting where he
was, it was with some feelings of fear that he saw the dying flame leap
up and spread a flash of light on the visage of Eachin, which seemed
pale as the grave, while his eye rolled like that of a maniac in his
fever fit.The light instantly sunk down and died, and Simon felt a
momentary terror lest he should have to dispute for his life with
the youth, whom he knew to be capable of violent actions when highly
excited, however short a period his nature could support the measures
which his passion commenced.He was relieved by the voice of Eachin, who
muttered in a hoarse and altered tone:

"Let what we have spoken this night rest in silence for ever.If thou
bring'st it to light, thou wert better dig thine own grave."Thus speaking, the door of the hut opened, admitting a gleam of
moonshine.The form of the retiring chief crossed it for an instant, the
hurdle was then closed, and the shieling left in darkness.Simon Glover felt relieved when a conversation fraught with offence and
danger was thus peaceably terminated.But he remained deeply affected by
the condition of Hector MacIan, whom he had himself bred up."The poor child," said he, "to be called up to a place of eminence,
only to be hurled from it with contempt!What he told me I partly knew,
having often remarked that Conachar was more prone to quarrel than to
fight.But this overpowering faint heartedness, which neither shame
nor necessity can overcome, I, though no Sir William Wallace, cannot
conceive.And to propose himself for a husband to my daughter, as if
a bride were to find courage for herself and the bridegroom!No--no,
Catharine must wed a man to whom she may say, 'Husband, spare your
enemy'--not one in whose behalf she must cry, 'Generous enemy, spare my
husband!"Tired out with these reflections, the old man at length fell asleep.In the morning he was awakened by his friend the Booshalloch, who, with
something of a blank visage, proposed to him to return to his abode on
the meadow at the Ballough.He apologised that the chief could not see
Simon Glover that morning, being busied with things about the expected
combat; and that Eachin MacIan thought the residence at the Ballough
would be safest for Simon Glover's health, and had given charge that
every care should be taken for his protection and accommodation.Niel Booshalloch dilated on these circumstances, to gloss over the
neglect implied in the chief's dismissing his visitor without a
particular audience."His father knew better," said the herdsman."But where should he have
learned manners, poor thing, and bred up among your Perth burghers, who,
excepting yourself, neighbour Glover, who speak Gaelic as well as I do,
are a race incapable of civility?"Simon Glover, it may be well believed, felt none of the want of respect
which his friend resented on his account.On the contrary, he greatly
preferred the quiet residence of the good herdsman to the tumultuous
hospitality of the daily festival of the chief, even if there had not
just passed an interview with Eachin upon a subject which it would be
most painful to revive.To the Ballough, therefore, he quietly retreated, where, could he have
been secure of Catharine's safety, his leisure was spent pleasantly
enough.His amusement was sailing on the lake in a little skiff, which a
Highland boy managed, while the old man angled.He frequently landed
on the little island, where he mused over the tomb of his old friend
Gilchrist MacIan, and made friends with the monks, presenting the prior
with gloves of martens' fur, and the superior officers with each of them
a pair made from the skin of the wildcat.The cutting and stitching of
these little presents served to beguile the time after sunset, while
the family of the herdsman crowded around, admiring his address, and
listening to the tales and songs with which the old man had skill to
pass away a heavy evening.It must be confessed that the cautious glover avoided the conversation
of Father Clement, whom he erroneously considered as rather the author
of his misfortunes than the guiltless sharer of them."I will not," he
thought, "to please his fancies, lose the goodwill of these kind
monks, which may be one day useful to me.I have suffered enough by his
preachments already, I trow.Little the wiser and much the poorer they
have made me.No--no, Catharine and Clement may think as they will; but
I will take the first opportunity to sneak back like a rated hound at
the call of his master, submit to a plentiful course of haircloth and
whipcord, disburse a lusty mulct, and become whole with the church
again."More than a fortnight had passed since the glover had arrived at
Ballough, and he began to wonder that he had not heard news of Catharine
or of Henry Wynd, to whom he concluded the provost had communicated the
plan and place of his retreat.He knew the stout smith dared not come
up into the Clan Quhele country, on account of various feuds with
the inhabitants, and with Eachin himself, while bearing the name of
Conachar; but yet the glover thought Henry might have found means to
send him a message, or a token, by some one of the various couriers who
passed and repassed between the court and the headquarters of the Clan
Quhele, in order to concert the terms of the impending combat, the
march of the parties to Perth, and other particulars requiring previous
adjustment.It was now the middle of March, and the fatal Palm Sunday
was fast approaching.Whilst time was thus creeping on, the exiled glover had not even once
set eyes upon his former apprentice.The care that was taken to attend
to his wants and convenience in every respect showed that he was not
forgotten; but yet, when he heard the chieftain's horn ringing through
the woods, he usually made it a point to choose his walk in a different
direction.One morning, however, he found himself unexpectedly in
Eachin's close neighbourhood, with scarce leisure to avoid him, and thus
it happened.As Simon strolled pensively through a little silvan glade, surrounded
on either side with tall forest trees, mixed with underwood, a white doe
broke from the thicket, closely pursued by two deer greyhounds, one
of which griped her haunch, the other her throat, and pulled her down
within half a furlong of the glover, who was something startled at the
suddenness of the incident.The ear and piercing blast of a horn, and
the baying of a slow hound, made Simon aware that the hunters were close
behind, and on the trace of the deer.Hallooing and the sound of
men running through the copse were heard close at hand.A moment's
recollection would have satisfied Simon that his best way was to stand
fast, or retire slowly, and leave it to Eachin to acknowledge his
presence or not, as he should see cause.But his desire of shunning the
young man had grown into a kind of instinct, and in the alarm of finding
him so near, Simon hid himself in a bush of hazels mixed with holly,
which altogether concealed him.He had hardly done so ere Eachin, rosy
with exercise, dashed from the thicket into the open glade, accompanied
by his foster father, Torquil of the Oak.The latter, with equal
strength and address, turned the struggling hind on her back, and
holding her forefeet in his right hand, while he knelt on her body,
offered his skene with the left to the young chief, that he might cut
the animal's throat."It may not be, Torquil; do thine office, and take the assay thyself.I
must not kill the likeness of my foster--"

This was spoken with a melancholy smile, while a tear at the same time
stood in the speaker's eye.Torquil stared at his young chief for an
instant, then drew his sharp wood knife across the creature's throat
with a cut so swift and steady that the weapon reached the backbone.Then rising on his feet, and again fixing a long piercing look on his
chief, he said: "As much as I have done to that hind would I do to any
living man whose ears could have heard my dault (foster son) so much as
name a white doe, and couple the word with Hector's name!"If Simon had no reason before to keep himself concealed, this speech of
Torquil furnished him with a pressing one."It cannot be concealed, father Torquil," said Eachin: "it will all out
to the broad day.""It is the fatal secret," thought Simon; "and now, if this huge privy
councillor cannot keep silence, I shall be made answerable, I suppose,
for Eachin's disgrace having been blown abroad."Thinking thus anxiously, he availed himself at the same time of his
position to see as much as he could of what passed between the afflicted
chieftain and his confidant, impelled by that spirit of curiosity which
prompts us in the most momentous, as well as the most trivial, occasions
of life, and which is sometimes found to exist in company with great
personal fear.As Torquil listened to what Eachin communicated, the young man sank
into his arms, and, supporting himself on his shoulder, concluded his
confession by a whisper into his ear.Torquil seemed to listen with such
amazement as to make him incapable of crediting his ears.As if to be
certain that it was Eachin who spoke, he gradually roused the youth from
his reclining posture, and, holding him up in some measure by a grasp on
his shoulder, fixed on him an eye that seemed enlarged, and at the same
time turned to stone, by the marvels he listened to.And so wild waxed
the old man's visage after he had heard the murmured communication,
that Simon Glover apprehended he would cast the youth from him as a
dishonoured thing, in which case he might have lighted among the very
copse in which he lay concealed, and occasioned his discovery in a
manner equally painful and dangerous.But the passions of Torquil,
who entertained for his foster child even a double portion of that
passionate fondness which always attends that connexion in the Highlands
took a different turn."I believe it not," he exclaimed; "it is false of thy father's child,
false of thy mother's son, falsest of my dault!I offer my gage to
heaven and hell, and will maintain the combat with him that shall call
it true.Thou hast been spellbound by an evil eye, my darling, and the
fainting which you call cowardice is the work of magic.I remember the
bat that struck the torch out on the hour that thou wert born--that hour
of grief and of joy.Thou shalt with me to Iona,
and the good St.Columbus, with the whole choir of blessed saints and
angels, who ever favoured thy race, shall take from thee the heart of
the white doe and return that which they have stolen from thee."Eachin listened, with a look as if he would fain have believed the words
of the comforter."But, Torquil," he said, "supposing this might avail us, the fatal day
approaches, and if I go to the lists, I dread me we shall be shamed.""Hell shall not prevail so
far: we will steep thy sword in holy water, place vervain, St.John's
Wort, and rowan tree in thy crest.We will surround thee, I and thy
eight brethren: thou shalt be safe as in a castle."Again the youth helplessly uttered something, which, from the dejected
tone in which it was spoken, Simon could not understand, while Torquil's
deep tones in reply fell full and distinct upon his ear."Yes, there may be a chance of withdrawing thee from the conflict.Thou
art the youngest who is to draw blade.Now, hear me, and thou shalt know
what it is to have a foster father's love, and how far it exceeds the
love even of kinsmen.The youngest on the indenture of the Clan Chattan
is Ferquhard Day.His father slew mine, and the red blood is seething
hot between us; I looked to Palm Sunday as the term that should cool it.Thou wouldst have thought that the blood in the veins of this
Ferquhard Day and in mine would not have mingled had they been put into
the same vessel, yet hath he cast the eyes of his love upon my only
daughter Eva, the fairest of our maidens.Think with what feelings I
heard the news.It was as if a wolf from the skirts of Farragon had
said, 'Give me thy child in wedlock, Torquil.'My child thought not
thus: she loves Ferquhard, and weeps away her colour and strength in
dread of the approaching battle.Let her give him but a sign of favour,
and well I know he will forget kith and kin, forsake the field, and fly
with her to the desert.""He, the youngest of the champions of Clan Chattan, being absent, I, the
youngest of the Clan Quhele, may be excused from combat" said Eachin,
blushing at the mean chance of safety thus opened to him."See now, my chief;" said Torquil, "and judge my thoughts towards
thee: others might give thee their own lives and that of their sons--I
sacrifice to thee the honour of my house.""My friend--my father," repeated the chief, folding Torquil to his
bosom, "what a base wretch am I that have a spirit dastardly enough to
avail myself of your sacrifice!"Let us back to the camp, and
send our gillies for the venison.The slowhound, or lyme dog, luckily for Simon, had drenched his nose in
the blood of the deer, else he might have found the glover's lair in the
thicket; but its more acute properties of scent being lost, it followed
tranquilly with the gazehounds.When the hunters were out of sight and hearing, the glover arose,
greatly relieved by their departure, and began to move off in the
opposite direction as fast as his age permitted.His first reflection
was on the fidelity of the foster father."The wild mountain heart is faithful and true.Yonder man is more like
the giants in romaunts than a man of mould like ourselves; and yet
Christians might take an example from him for his lealty.A simple
contrivance this, though, to finger a man from off their enemies'
chequer, as if there would not be twenty of the wildcats ready to supply
his place."Thus thought the glover, not aware that the strictest proclamations
were issued, prohibiting any of the two contending clans, their friends,
allies, and dependants, from coming within fifty miles of Perth, during
a week before and a week after the combat, which regulation was to be
enforced by armed men.So soon as our friend Simon arrived at the habitation of the herdsman,
he found other news awaiting him.They were brought by Father Clement,
who came in a pilgrim's cloak, or dalmatic, ready to commence his return
to the southward, and desirous to take leave of his companion in exile,
or to accept him as a travelling companion."But what," said the citizen, "has so suddenly induced you to return
within the reach of danger?""Have you not heard," said Father Clement, "that, March and his English
allies having retired into England before the Earl of Douglas, the good
earl has applied himself to redress the evils of the commonwealth, and
hath written to the court letters desiring that the warrant for the High
Court of Commission against heresy be withdrawn, as a trouble to men's
consciences, that the nomination of Henry of Wardlaw to be prelate of
St.Andrews be referred to the Parliament, with sundry other things
pleasing to the Commons?Now, most of the nobles that are with the King
at Perth, and with them Sir Patrick Charteris, your worthy provost, have
declared for the proposals of the Douglas.The Duke of Albany had agreed
to them--whether from goodwill or policy I know not.The good King is
easily persuaded to mild and gentle courses.And thus are the jaw
teeth of the oppressors dashed to pieces in their sockets, and the prey
snatched from their ravening talons.Will you with me to the Lowlands,
or do you abide here a little space?"Neil Booshalloch saved his friend the trouble of reply."He had the chief's authority," he said, "for saying that Simon Glover
should abide until the champions went down to the battle."In this answer the citizen saw something not quite consistent with his
own perfect freedom of volition; but he cared little for it at the
time, as it furnished a good apology for not travelling along with the
clergyman."An exemplary man," he said to his friend Niel Booshalloch, as soon as
Father Clement had taken leave--"a great scholar and a great saint.It
is a pity almost he is no longer in danger to be burned, as his sermon
at the stake would convert thousands.O Niel Booshalloch, Father
Clement's pile would be a sweet savouring sacrifice and a beacon to
all decent Christians!But what would the burning of a borrel ignorant
burgess like me serve?Men offer not up old glove leather for incense,
nor are beacons fed with undressed hides, I trow.Sooth to speak, I have
too little learning and too much fear to get credit by the affair, and,
therefore, I should, in our homely phrase, have both the scathe and the
scorn.""True for you," answered the herdsman.We must return to the characters of our dramatic narrative whom we
     left at Perth, when we accompanied the glover and his fair daughter
     to Kinfauns, and from that hospitable mansion traced the course of
     Simon to Loch Tay; and the Prince, as the highest personage, claims
     our immediate attention.This rash and inconsiderate young man endured with some impatience his
sequestered residence with the Lord High Constable, with whose company,
otherwise in every respect satisfactory, he became dissatisfied, from
no other reason than that he held in some degree the character of his
warder.Incensed against his uncle and displeased with his father, he
longed, not unnaturally, for the society of Sir John Ramorny, on whom he
had been so long accustomed to throw himself for amusement, and, though
he would have resented the imputation as an insult, for guidance and
direction.He therefore sent him a summons to attend him, providing his
health permitted; and directed him to come by water to a little pavilion
in the High Constable's garden, which, like that of Sir John's own
lodgings, ran down to the Tay.In renewing an intimacy so dangerous,
Rothsay only remembered that he had been Sir Join Ramorny's munificent
friend; while Sir John, on receiving the invitation, only recollected,
on his part, the capricious insults he had sustained from his patron,
the loss of his hand, and the lightness with which he had treated the
subject, and the readiness with which Rothsay had abandoned his cause in
the matter of the bonnet maker's slaughter.He laughed bitterly when he
read the Prince's billet."Eviot," he said, "man a stout boat with six trusty men--trusty men,
mark me--lose not a moment, and bid Dwining instantly come hither."Heaven smiles on us, my trusty friend," he said to the mediciner."I
was but beating my brains how to get access to this fickle boy, and here
he sends to invite me."I see the matter very clearly," said Dwining."Heaven smiles on
some untoward consequences--he!"No matter, the trap is ready; and it is baited, too, my friend, with
what would lure the boy from a sanctuary, though a troop with drawn
weapons waited him in the churchyard.His own weariness of himself would have done the job.Get thy matters
ready--thou goest with us.Write to him, as I cannot, that we come
instantly to attend his commands, and do it clerkly.He reads well, and
that he owes to me.""He will be your valiancie's debtor for more knowledge before he
dies--he!But is your bargain sure with the Duke of Albany?""Enough to gratify my ambition, thy avarice, and the revenge of both.Aboard--aboard, and speedily; let Eviot throw in a few flasks of the
choicest wine, and some cold baked meats.""But your arm, my lord, Sir John?"The throbbing of my heart silences the pain of my wound.It beats as it
would burst my bosom."said Dwining; adding, in a low voice--"It would be a
strange sight if it should.I should like to dissect it, save that its
stony case would spoil my best instruments."In a few minutes they were in the boat, while a speedy messenger carried
the note to the Prince.Rothsay was seated with the Constable, after their noontide repast.He
was sullen and silent; and the earl had just asked whether it was his
pleasure that the table should be cleared, when a note, delivered to the
Prince, changed at once his aspect."I go to the pavilion in the garden--always
with permission of my Lord Constable--to receive my late master of the
horse.""Ay, my lord; must I ask permission twice?""No, surely, my lord," answered the Constable; "but has your Royal
Highness recollected that Sir John Ramorny--"

"Has not the plague, I hope?""Come, Errol,
you would play the surly turnkey, but it is not in your nature; farewell
for half an hour."said Errol, as the Prince, flinging open a lattice of
the ground parlour in which they sat, stept out into the garden--"a new
folly, to call back that villain to his counsels.The Prince, in the mean time, looked back, and said hastily:

"Your lordship's good housekeeping will afford us a flask or two of
wine and a slight collation in the pavilion?I love the al fresco of the
river."The Constable bowed, and gave the necessary orders; so that Sir John
found the materials of good cheer ready displayed, when, landing from
his barge, he entered the pavilion."It grieves my heart to see your Highness under restraint," said
Ramorny, with a well executed appearance of sympathy."That grief of thine will grieve mine," said the Prince."I am sure here
has Errol, and a right true hearted lord he is, so tired me with grave
looks, and something like grave lessons, that he has driven me back to
thee, thou reprobate, from whom, as I expect nothing good, I may perhaps
obtain something entertaining.Yet, ere we say more, it was foul work,
that upon the Fastern's Even, Ramorny.I well hope thou gavest not aim
to it.""On my honour, my lord, a simple mistake of the brute Bonthron.I did
hint to him that a dry beating would be due to the fellow by whom I had
lost a hand; and lo you, my knave makes a double mistake.He takes one
man for another, and instead of the baton he uses the axe.""It is well that it went no farther.Small matter for the bonnet maker;
but I had never forgiven you had the armourer fallen--there is not his
match in Britain.But I hope they hanged the villain high enough?""If thirty feet might serve," replied Ramorny.no more of him," said Rothsay; "his wretched name makes the good
wine taste of blood.And what are the news in Perth, Ramorny?How stands
it with the bona robas and the galliards?""Little galliardise stirring, my lord," answered the knight."All eyes
are turned to the motions of the Black Douglas, who comes with five
thousand chosen men to put us all to rights, as if he were bound for
another Otterburn.It is said he is to be lieutenant again.It is
certain many have declared for his faction.""It is time, then, my feet were free," said Rothsay, "otherwise I may
find a worse warder than Errol."were you once away from this place, you might make as bold
a head as Douglas.""Ramorny," said the Prince, gravely, "I have but a confused remembrance
of your once having proposed something horrible to me.I would be free--I would have my person at my own disposal; but
I will never levy arms against my father, nor those it pleases him to
trust.""It was only for your Royal Highness's personal freedom that I was
presuming to speak," answered Ramorny."Were I in your Grace's place,
I would get me into that good boat which hovers on the Tay, and drop
quietly down to Fife, where you have many friends, and make free to take
possession of Falkland.It is a royal castle; and though the King has
bestowed it in gift on your uncle, yet surely, even if the grant were
not subject to challenge, your Grace might make free with the residence
of so near a relative.""He hath made free with mine," said the Duke, "as the stewartry of
Renfrew can tell.But stay, Ramorny--hold; did I not hear Errol say
that the Lady Marjory Douglas, whom they call Duchess of Rothsay, is
at Falkland?I would neither dwell with that lady nor insult her by
dislodging her.""The lady was there, my lord," replied Ramorny; "I have sure advice that
she is gone to meet her father."or perhaps to beg him to spare
me, providing I come on my knees to her bed, as pilgrims say the emirs
and amirals upon whom a Saracen soldan bestows a daughter in marriage
are bound to do?Ramorny, I will act by the Douglas's own saying, 'It
is better to hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak.'I will keep both
foot and hand from fetters.""No place fitter than Falkland," replied Ramorny."I have enough of good
yeomen to keep the place; and should your Highness wish to leave it, a
brief ride reaches the sea in three directions."Neither mirth, music,
nor maidens--ha!""Pardon me, noble Duke; but, though the Lady Marjory Douglas be
departed, like an errant dame in romance, to implore succour of her
doughty sire, there is, I may say, a lovelier, I am sure a younger,
maiden, either presently at Falkland or who will soon be on the road
thither.Your Highness has not forgotten the Fair Maid of Perth?""Forget the prettiest wench in Scotland!No--any more than thou hast
forgotten the hand that thou hadst in the Curfew Street onslaught on St.Your Highness would say, the hand that I lost.As
certain as I shall never regain it, Catharine Glover is, or will soon
be, at Falkland.I will not flatter your Highness by saying she
expects to meet you; in truth, she proposes to place herself under the
protection of the Lady Marjory.""The little traitress," said the Prince--"she too to turn against me?"I trust your Grace will make her penance a gentle one," replied the
knight."Faith, I would have been her father confessor long ago, but I have ever
found her coy.""Opportunity was lacking, my lord," replied Ramorny; "and time presses
even now.""Nay, I am but too apt for a frolic; but my father--"

"He is personally safe," said Ramorny, "and as much at freedom as ever
he can be; while your Highness--"

"Must brook fetters, conjugal or literal--I know it.Yonder comes
Douglas, with his daughter in his hand, as haughty and as harsh featured
as himself, bating touches of age.""And at Falkland sits in solitude the fairest wench in Scotland," said
Ramorny."Here is penance and restraint, yonder is joy and freedom.""Thou hast prevailed, most sage counsellor," replied Rothsay; "but mark
you, it shall be the last of my frolics.""I trust so," replied Ramorny; "for, when at liberty, you may make a
good accommodation with your royal father.""I will write to him, Ramorny.No, I cannot
put my thoughts in words--do thou write.""Your Royal Highness forgets," said Ramorny, pointing to his mutilated
arm."So please your Highness," answered his counsellor, "if you would use
the hand of the mediciner, Dwining--he writes like a clerk.""Hath he a hint of the circumstances?"Fully," said Ramorny; and, stepping to the window, he called Dwining
from the boat.He entered the presence of the Prince of Scotland, creeping as if he
trode upon eggs, with downcast eyes, and a frame that seemed shrunk up
by a sense of awe produced by the occasion.I will make trial of you; thou
know'st the case--place my conduct to my father in a fair light."Dwining sat down, and in a few minutes wrote a letter, which he handed
to Sir John Ramorny."Why, the devil has aided thee, Dwining," said the knight.'Respected father and liege sovereign--Know that important
considerations induce me to take my departure from this your court,
purposing to make my abode at Falkland, both as the seat of my dearest
uncle Albany, with whom I know your Majesty would desire me to use all
familiarity, and as the residence of one from whom I have been too
long estranged, and with whom I haste to exchange vows of the closest
affection from henceforward.'"The Duke of Rothsay and Ramorny laughed aloud; and the physician,
who had listened to his own scroll as if it were a sentence of death,
encouraged by their applause, raised his eyes, uttered faintly his
chuckling note of "He!and was again grave and silent, as if afraid
he had transgressed the bounds of reverent respect.The old man will apply
all this to the Duchess, as they call her, of Rothsay.Dwining, thou
shouldst be a secretis to his Holiness the Pope, who sometimes, it is
said, wants a scribe that can make one word record two meanings.I will
subscribe it, and have the praise of the device.""And now, my lord," said Ramorny, sealing the letter and leaving it
behind, "will you not to boat?""Not till my chamberlain attends with some clothes and necessaries, and
you may call my sewer also.""My lord," said Ramorny, "time presses, and preparation will but excite
suspicion.Your officers will follow with the mails tomorrow.For
tonight, I trust my poor service may suffice to wait on you at table and
chamber.""Nay, this time it is thou who forgets," said the Prince, touching the
wounded arm with his walking rod."Recollect, man, thou canst neither
carve a capon nor tie a point--a goodly sewer or valet of the mouth!"Ramorny grinned with rage and pain; for his wound, though in a way of
healing, was still highly sensitive, and even the pointing a finger
towards it made him tremble."Will your Highness now be pleased to take boat?""Not till I take leave of the Lord Constable.Rothsay must not slip
away, like a thief from a prison, from the house of Errol."My Lord Duke," said Ramorny, "it may be dangerous to our plan.""To the devil with danger, thy plan, and thyself!I must and will act to
Errol as becomes us both."The earl entered, agreeable to the Prince's summons."I gave you this trouble, my lord," said Rothsay, with the dignified
courtesy which he knew so well how to assume, "to thank you for your
hospitality and your good company.I can enjoy them no longer, as
pressing affairs call me to Falkland.""My lord," said the Lord High Constable, "I trust your Grace remembers
that you are--under ward."If I am a prisoner, speak plainly; if not, I will
take my freedom to depart.""I would, my lord, your Highness would request his Majesty's permission
for this journey."Mean you displeasure against yourself, my lord, or against me?""I have already said your Highness lies in ward here; but if you
determine to break it, I have no warrant--God forbid--to put force on
your inclinations.I can but entreat your Highness, for your own sake--"

"Of my own interest I am the best judge.The wilful Prince stepped into the boat with Dwining and Ramorny, and,
waiting for no other attendance, Eviot pushed off the vessel, which
descended the Tay rapidly by the assistance of sail and oar and of the
ebb tide.For some space the Duke of Rothsay appeared silent and moody, nor did
his companions interrupt his reflections.He raised his head at length
and said: "My father loves a jest, and when all is over he will take
this frolic at no more serious rate than it deserves--a fit of youth,
with which he will deal as he has with others.Yonder, my masters, shows
the old hold of Kinfauns, frowning above the Tay.Now, tell me, John
Ramorny, how thou hast dealt to get the Fair Maid of Perth out of the
hands of yonder bull headed provost; for Errol told me it was rumoured
that she was under his protection.""Truly she was, my lord, with the purpose of being transferred to the
patronage of the Duchess--I mean of the Lady Marjory of Douglas.Now,
this beetle headed provost, who is after all but a piece of blundering
valiancy, has, like most such, a retainer of some slyness and cunning,
whom he uses in all his dealings, and whose suggestions he generally
considers as his own ideas.Whenever I would possess myself of a
landward baron, I address myself to such a confidant, who, in the
present case, is called Kitt Henshaw, an old skipper upon the Tay,
and who, having in his time sailed as far as Campvere, holds with Sir
Patrick Charteris the respect due to one who has seen foreign countries.This his agent I have made my own, and by his means have insinuated
various apologies in order to postpone the departure of Catharine for
Falkland.""I know not if it is wise to tell your Highness, lest you should
disapprove of my views.I meant the officers of the Commission for
inquiry into heretical opinions should have found the Fair Maid at
Kinfauns, for our beauty is a peevish, self willed swerver from the
church; and certes, I designed that the knight should have come in
for his share of the fines and confiscations that were about to be
inflicted.The monks were eager enough to be at him, seeing he hath had
frequent disputes with them about the salmon tithe.""But wherefore wouldst thou have ruined the knight's fortunes, and
brought the beautiful young woman to the stake, perchance?"An old woman
might have been in some danger; and as for my Lord Provost, as they call
him, if they had clipped off some of his fat acres, it would have
been some atonement for the needless brave he put on me in St."Methinks, John, it was but a base revenge," said Rothsay.He that cannot right himself by the hand
must use his head.Well, that chance was over by the tender hearted
Douglas's declaring in favour of tender conscience; and then, my lord,
old Henshaw found no further objections to carrying the Fair Maid
of Perth to Falkland, not to share the dulness of the Lady Marjory's
society, as Sir Patrick Charteris and she herself doth opine, but to
keep your Highness from tiring when we return from hunting in the park."There was again a long pause, in which the Prince seemed to muse deeply."Ramorny, I have a scruple in this matter; but if I
name it to thee, the devil of sophistry, with which thou art possessed,
will argue it out of me, as it has done many others.This girl is the
most beautiful, one excepted, whom I ever saw or knew; and I like her
the more that she bears some features of--Elizabeth of Dunbar.But she,
I mean Catharine Glover, is contracted, and presently to be wedded, to
Henry the armourer, a craftsman unequalled for skill, and a man at arms
yet unmatched in the barrace.To follow out this intrigue would do a
good fellow too much wrong.""Your Highness will not expect me to be very solicitous of Henry Smith's
interest," said Ramorny, looking at his wounded arm.Andrew with his shored cross, this disaster of thine is too much
harped upon, John Ramorny!Others are content with putting a finger
into every man's pie, but thou must thrust in thy whole gory hand.It is
done, and cannot be undone; let it be forgotten.""Nay, my lord, you allude to it more frequently than I," answered the
knight--"in derision, it is true; while I--but I can be silent on the
subject if I cannot forget it.""Well, then, I tell thee that I have scruple about this intrigue.Dost
thou remember, when we went in a frolic to hear Father Clement preach,
or rather to see this fair heretic, that he spoke as touchingly as a
minstrel about the rich man taking away the poor man's only ewe lamb?""A great matter, indeed," answered Sir John, "that this churl's wife's
eldest son should be fathered by the Prince of Scotland!How many earls
would covet the like fate for their fair countesses?and how many that
have had such good luck sleep not a grain the worse for it?""And if I might presume to speak," said the mediciner, "the ancient
laws of Scotland assigned such a privilege to every feudal lord over his
female vassals, though lack of spirit and love of money hath made many
exchange it for gold.""I require no argument to urge me to be kind to a pretty woman; but this
Catharine has been ever cold to me," said the Prince."Nay, my lord," said Ramorny, "if, young, handsome, and a prince, you
know not how to make yourself acceptable to a fine woman, it is not for
me to say more.""And if it were not far too great audacity in me to speak again, I would
say," quoth the leech, "that all Perth knows that the Gow Chrom never
was the maiden's choice, but fairly forced upon her by her father.I
know for certain that she refused him repeatedly.""Nay, if thou canst assure us of that, the case is much altered," said
Rothsay."Vulcan was a smith as well as Harry Wynd; he would needs wed
Venus, and our chronicles tell us what came of it.""Then long may Lady Venus live and be worshipped," said Sir John
Ramorny, "and success to the gallant knight Mars who goes a-wooing to
her goddess-ship!"The discourse took a gay and idle turn for a few minutes; but the Duke
of Rothsay soon dropped it."I have left," he said, "yonder air of the
prison house behind me, and yet my spirits scarce revive.I feel that
drowsy, not unpleasing, yet melancholy mood that comes over us when
exhausted by exercise or satiated with pleasure.Some music now,
stealing on the ear, yet not loud enough to make us lift the eye, were a
treat for the gods.""Your Grace has but to speak your wishes, and the nymphs of the Tay are
as favourable as the fair ones upon the shore.said the Duke of Rothsay, listening; "it is, and rarely
touched.Steer towards the boat from
whence the music comes.""It is old Henshaw," said Ramorny, "working up the stream.The boatman answered the hail, and drew up alongside of the Prince's
barge.said the Prince, recognising the figure as well
as the appointments of the French glee woman, Louise."I think I owe
thee something for being the means of thy having a fright, at least,
upon St.Into this boat with thee, lute, puppy dog,
scrip and all; I will prefer thee to a lady's service who shall feed thy
very cur on capons and canary.""I trust your Highness will consider--" said Ramorny."I will consider nothing but my pleasure, John.Pray, do thou be so
complying as to consider it also.""Is it indeed to a lady's service you would promote me?""Oh, I have heard of that great lady!"said Louise; "and will you indeed
prefer me to your right royal consort's service?""I will, by my honour--whenever I receive her as such.Mark that
reservation, John," said he aside to Ramorny.The persons who were in the boat caught up the tidings, and, concluding
a reconciliation was about to take place betwixt the royal couple,
exhorted Louise to profit by her good fortune, and add herself to the
Duchess of Rothsay's train.Several offered her some acknowledgment for
the exercise of her talents.During this moment of delay, Ramorny whispered to Dwining: "Make in,
knave, with some objection.Rouse thy
wits, while I speak a word with Henshaw.""If I might presume to speak," said Dwining, "as one who have made
my studies both in Spain and Arabia, I would say, my lord, that the
sickness has appeared in Edinburgh, and that there may be risk in
admitting this young wanderer into your Highness's vicinity."and what is it to thee," said Rothsay, "whether I choose to be
poisoned by the pestilence or the 'pothecary?Must thou, too, needs
thwart my humour?"While the Prince thus silenced the remonstrances of Dwining, Sir John
Ramorny had snatched a moment to learn from Henshaw that the removal of
the Duchess of Rothsay from Falkland was still kept profoundly secret,
and that Catharine Glover would arrive there that evening or the
next morning, in expectation of being taken under the noble lady's
protection.The Duke of Rothsay, deeply plunged in thought, received this intimation
so coldly, that Ramorny took the liberty of remonstrating."This, my
lord," he said, "is playing the spoiled child of fortune.You wish for
liberty; it comes.You wish for beauty; it awaits you, with just so much
delay as to render the boon more precious.Even your slightest desires
seem a law to the Fates; for you desire music when it seems most
distant, and the lute and song are at your hand.These things, so sent,
should be enjoyed, else we are but like petted children, who break and
throw from them the toys they have wept themselves sick for.""To enjoy pleasure, Ramorny," said the Prince, "a man should have
suffered pain, as it requires fasting to gain a good appetite.We, who
can have all for a wish, little enjoy that all when we have possessed
it.Seest thou yonder thick cloud, which is about to burst to rain?It
seems to stifle me--the waters look dark and lurid--the shores have lost
their beautiful form--"

"My lord, forgive your servant," said Ramorny."You indulge a powerful
imagination, as an unskilful horseman permits a fiery steed to rear
until he falls back on his master and crushes him.I pray you shake off
this lethargy.Shall the glee maiden make some music?""Let her; but it must be melancholy: all mirth would at this moment jar
on my ear."The maiden sung a melancholy dirge in Norman French; the words, of which
the following is an imitation, were united to a tune as doleful as they
are themselves:

     Yes, thou mayst sigh,
     And look once more at all around,
     At stream and bank, and sky and ground.Thy life its final course has found,
     And thou must die.Yes, lay thee down,
     And while thy struggling pulses flutter,
     Bid the grey monk his soul mass mutter,
     And the deep bell its death tone utter--
     Thy life is gone.'Tis but a pang, and then a thrill,
     A fever fit, and then a chill,
     And then an end of human ill,
     For thou art dead.The Prince made no observation on the music; and the maiden, at
Ramorny's beck, went on from time to time with her minstrel craft, until
the evening sunk down into rain, first soft and gentle, at length in
great quantities, and accompanied by a cold wind.There was neither
cloak nor covering for the Prince, and he sullenly rejected that which
Ramorny offered."It is not for Rothsay to wear your cast garments, Sir John; this melted
snow, which I feel pierce me to the very marrow, I am now encountering
by your fault.Why did you presume to put off the boat without my
servants and apparel?"Ramorny did not attempt an exculpation; for he knew the Prince was in
one of those humours, when to enlarge upon a grievance was more pleasing
to him than to have his mouth stopped by any reasonable apology.In
sullen silence, or amid unsuppressed chiding, the boat arrived at the
fishing village of Newburgh.The party landed, and found horses in
readiness, which, indeed, Ramorny had long since provided for the
occasion.Their quality underwent the Prince's bitter sarcasm, expressed
to Ramorny sometimes by direct words, oftener by bitter gibes.At length
they were mounted and rode on through the closing night and the falling
rain, the Prince leading the way with reckless haste.The glee maiden,
mounted by his express order, attended them and well for her that,
accustomed to severe weather, and exercise both on foot and horseback,
she supported as firmly as the men the fatigues of the nocturnal ride.Ramorny was compelled to keep at the Prince's rein, being under no small
anxiety lest, in his wayward fit, he might ride off from him entirely,
and, taking refuge in the house of some loyal baron, escape the snare
which was spread for him.He therefore suffered inexpressibly during the
ride, both in mind and in body.At length the forest of Falkland received them, and a glimpse of the
moon showed the dark and huge tower, an appendage of royalty itself,
though granted for a season to the Duke of Albany.On a signal given the
drawbridge fell.Torches glared in the courtyard, menials attended,
and the Prince, assisted from horseback, was ushered into an apartment,
where Ramorny waited on him, together with Dwining, and entreated him
to take the leech's advice.The Duke of Rothsay repulsed the proposal,
haughtily ordered his bed to be prepared, and having stood for some time
shivering in his dank garments beside a large blazing fire, he retired
to his apartment without taking leave of anyone."You see the peevish humour of this childish boy, now," said Ramorny to
Dwining; "can you wonder that a servant who has done so much for him as
I have should be tired of such a master?""No, truly," said Dwining, "that and the promised earldom of Lindores
would shake any man's fidelity.But shall we commence with him this
evening?He has, if eye and cheek speak true, the foundation of a fever
within him, which will make our work easy while it will seem the effect
of nature.""It is an opportunity lost," said Ramorny; "but we must delay our blow
till he has seen this beauty, Catharine Glover.She may be hereafter a
witness that she saw him in good health, and master of his own motions,
a brief space before--you understand me?"Dwining nodded assent, and added:

"There is no time lost; for there is little difficulty in blighting a
flower exhausted from having been made to bloom too soon."in sooth he was a shameless wight,
     Sore given to revel and ungodly glee:
     Few earthly things found favour in his sight,
     Save concubines and carnal companie,
     And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.With the next morning the humour of the Duke of Rothsay was changed.He complained, indeed, of pain and fever, but they rather seemed to
stimulate than to overwhelm him.He was familiar with Ramorny, and
though he said nothing on the subject of the preceding night, it was
plain he remembered what he desired to obliterate from the memory of his
followers--the ill humour he had then displayed.He was civil to every
one, and jested with Ramorny on the subject of Catharine's arrival."How surprised will the pretty prude be at seeing herself in a family
of men, when she expects to be admitted amongst the hoods and pinners
of Dame Marjory's waiting women!Thou hast not many of the tender sex in
thy household, I take it, Ramorny?""Faith, none except the minstrel wench, but a household drudge or two
whom we may not dispense with.By the way, she is anxiously inquiring
after the mistress your Highness promised to prefer her to.Shall I
dismiss her, to hunt for her new mistress at leisure?""By no means, she will serve to amuse Catharine.And, hark you, were it
not well to receive that coy jillet with something of a mumming?"We will not disappoint her, since she expects
to find the Duchess of Rothsay: I will be Duke and Duchess in my own
person.""No one so dull as a wit," said the Prince, "when he does not hit off
the scent at once.My Duchess, as they call her, has been in as great a
hurry to run away from Falkland as I to come hither.There is as much female trumpery in the wardrobe
adjoining to my sleeping room as would equip a whole carnival.Look you,
I will play Dame Marjory, disposed on this day bed here with a mourning
veil and a wreath of willow, to show my forsaken plight; thou, John,
wilt look starch and stiff enough for her Galwegian maid of honour,
the Countess Hermigild; and Dwining shall present the old Hecate, her
nurse--only she hath more beard on her upper lip than Dwining on his
whole face, and skull to boot.He should have the commodity of a beard
to set her forth conformably.Get thy kitchen drudges, and what passable
pages thou hast with thee, to make my women of the bedroom.Ramorny hasted into the anteroom, and told Dwining the Prince's device."Do thou look to humour the fool," he said; "I care not how little I see
him, knowing what is to be done.""Trust all to me," said the physician, shrugging his shoulders."What
sort of a butcher is he that can cut the lamb's throat, yet is afraid to
hear it bleat?""Tush, fear not my constancy: I cannot forget that he would have cast
me into the cloister with as little regard as if he threw away the
truncheon of a broken lance.Begone--yet stay; ere you go to arrange
this silly pageant, something must be settled to impose on the thick
witted Charteris.He is like enough, should he be left in the belief
that the Duchess of Rothsay is still here, and Catharine Glover in
attendance on her, to come down with offers of service, and the like,
when, as I need scarce tell thee, his presence would be inconvenient.Indeed, this is the more likely, that some folks have given a warmer
name to the iron headed knight's great and tender patronage of this
damsel.""With that hint, let me alone to deal with him.I will send him such a
letter, that for this month he shall hold himself as ready for a journey
to hell as to Falkland.Can you tell me the name of the Duchess's
confessor?""Waltheof, a grey friar."In a few minutes, for he was a clerk of rare celerity, Dwining finished
a letter, which he placed in Ramorny's hand."This is admirable, and would have made thy fortune with Rothsay.I
think I should have been too jealous to trust thee in his household,
save that his day is closed.""Read it aloud," said Dwining, "that we may judge if it goes trippingly
off."And Ramorny read as follows: "By command of our high and mighty Princess
Marjory, Duchess of Rothsay, and so forth, we Waltheof, unworthy brother
of the order of St.Francis, do thee, Sir Patrick Charteris, knight of
Kinfauns, to know, that her Highness marvels much at the temerity with
which you have sent to her presence a woman of whose fame she can judge
but lightly, seeing she hath made her abode, without any necessity,
for more than a week in thine own castle, without company of any other
female, saving menials; of which foul cohabitation the savour is gone
up through Fife, Angus, and Perthshire.Nevertheless, her Highness,
considering the ease as one of human frailty, hath not caused this
wanton one to be scourged with nettles, or otherwise to dree penance;
but, as two good brethren of the convent of Lindores, the Fathers
Thickskull and Dundermore, have been summoned up to the Highlands upon
an especial call, her Highness hath committed to their care this maiden
Catharine, with charge to convey her to her father, whom she states
to be residing beside Loch Tay, under whose protection she will find
a situation more fitting her qualities and habits than the Castle of
Falkland, while her Highness the Duchess of Rothsay abides there.She
hath charged the said reverend brothers so to deal with the young woman
as may give her a sense of the sin of incontinence, and she commendeth
thee to confession and penitence.--Signed, Waltheof, by command of an
high and mighty Princess"; and so forth.When he had finished, "Excellent--excellent!""This
unexpected rebuff will drive Charteris mad!He hath been long making
a sort of homage to this lady, and to find himself suspected of
incontinence, when he was expecting the full credit of a charitable
action, will altogether confound him; and, as thou say'st, it will be
long enough ere he come hither to look after the damsel or do honour
to the dame.But away to thy pageant, while I prepare that which shall
close the pageant for ever."It was an hour before noon, when Catharine, escorted by old Henshaw and
a groom of the Knight of Kinfauns, arrived before the lordly tower of
Falkland.The broad banner which was displayed from it bore the arms
of Rothsay, the servants who appeared wore the colours of the Prince's
household, all confirming the general belief that the Duchess still
resided there.Catharine's heart throbbed, for she had heard that
the Duchess had the pride as well as the high courage of the house
of Douglas, and felt uncertain touching the reception she was to
experience.On entering the castle, she observed that the train was
smaller than she had expected, but, as the Duchess lived in close
retirement, she was little surprised at this.In a species of anteroom
she was met by a little old woman, who seemed bent double with age, and
supported herself upon an ebony staff."Truly thou art welcome, fair daughter," said she, saluting Catharine,
"and, as I may say, to an afflicted house; and I trust (once more
saluting her) thou wilt be a consolation to my precious and right royal
daughter the Duchess.Sit thee down, my child, till I see whether my
lady be at leisure to receive thee.Ah, my child, thou art very lovely
indeed, if Our Lady hath given to thee a soul to match with so fair a
body."With that the counterfeit old woman crept into the next apartment,
where she found Rothsay in the masquerading habit he had prepared, and
Ramorny, who had evaded taking part in the pageant, in his ordinary
attire."Thou art a precious rascal, sir doctor," said the Prince; "by my
honour, I think thou couldst find in thy heart to play out the whole
play thyself, lover's part and all.""If it were to save your Highness trouble," said the leech, with his
usual subdued laugh."No--no," said Rothsay, "I never need thy help, man; and tell me now,
how look I, thus disposed on the couch--languishing and ladylike, ha?""Something too fine complexioned and soft featured for the Lady Marjory
of Douglas, if I may presume to say so," said the leech."Away, villain, and marshal in this fair frost piece--fear not she will
complain of my effeminacy; and thou, Ramorny, away also."As the knight left the apartment by one door, the fictitious old woman
ushered in Catharine Glover by another.The room had been carefully
darkened to twilight, so that Catharine saw the apparently female figure
stretched on the couch without the least suspicion.asked Rothsay, in a voice naturally sweet, and now
carefully modulated to a whispering tone."Let her approach, Griselda,
and kiss our hand."The supposed nurse led the trembling maiden forward to the side of the
couch, and signed to her to kneel.Catharine did so, and kissed with
much devotion and simplicity the gloved hand which the counterfeit
duchess extended to her."Be not afraid," said the same musical voice; "in me you only see a
melancholy example of the vanity of human greatness; happy those, my
child, whose rank places them beneath the storms of state."While he spoke, he put his arms around her neck and drew her towards
him, as if to salute her in token of welcome.But the kiss was bestowed
with an earnestness which so much overacted the part of the fair
patroness, that Catharine, concluding the Duchess had lost her senses,
screamed aloud.Catharine looked around her; the nurse was gone, and the Duke tearing
off his veil, she saw herself in the power of a daring young libertine.she said; "and Thou wilt, if I forsake
not myself."As this resolution darted through her mind, she repressed her
disposition to scream, and, as far as she might, strove to conceal her
fear."The jest hath been played," she said, with as much firmness as she
could assume; "may I entreat that your Highness will now unhand me?"for
he still kept hold of her arm."Nay, my pretty captive, struggle not--why should you fear?"As you are pleased to detain me, I will
not, by striving, provoke you to use me ill, and give pain to yourself,
when you have time to think.""Why, thou traitress, thou hast held me captive for months," said the
Prince, "and wilt thou not let me hold thee for a moment?""This were gallantry, my lord, were it in the streets of Perth, where I
might listen or escape as I listed; it is tyranny here.""And if I did let thee go, whither wouldst thou fly?""The bridges are up, the portcullis down, and the men who follow me are
strangely deaf to a peevish maiden's squalls.Be kind, therefore, and
you shall know what it is to oblige a prince.""Unloose me, then, my lord, and hear me appeal from thyself to thyself,
from Rothsay to the Prince of Scotland.I am the daughter of an humble
but honest citizen.I am, I may well nigh say, the spouse of a brave and
honest man.If I have given your Highness any encouragement for what you
have done, it has been unintentional.Thus forewarned, I entreat you to
forego your power over me, and suffer me to depart.Your Highness can
obtain nothing from me, save by means equally unworthy of knighthood or
manhood.""You are bold, Catharine," said the Prince, "but neither as a knight
nor a man can I avoid accepting a defiance.I must teach you the risk of
such challenges."While he spoke, he attempted to throw his arms again around her; but she
eluded his grasp, and proceeded in the same tone of firm decision."My strength, my lord, is as great to defend myself in an honourable
strife as yours can be to assail me with a most dishonourable purpose.Do not shame yourself and me by putting it to the combat.You may stun
me with blows, or you may call aid to overpower me; but otherwise you
will fail of your purpose.""The force I would
use is no more than excuses women in yielding to their own weakness.""Then keep it," said Catharine, "for those women who desire such an
excuse.My resistance is that of the most determined mind which love
of honour and fear of shame ever inspired.my lord, could you
succeed, you would but break every bond between me and life, between
yourself and honour.I have been trained fraudulently here, by what
decoys I know not; but were I to go dishonoured hence, it would be to
denounce the destroyer of my happiness to every quarter of Europe.I would take the palmer's staff in my hand, and wherever chivalry is
honoured, or the word Scotland has been heard, I would proclaim the heir
of a hundred kings, the son of the godly Robert Stuart, the heir of
the heroic Bruce, a truthless, faithless man, unworthy of the crown he
expects and of the spurs he wears.Every lady in wide Europe would hold
your name too foul for her lips; every worthy knight would hold you
a baffled, forsworn caitiff, false to the first vow of arms, the
protection of woman and the defence of the feeble."Rothsay resumed his seat, and looked at her with a countenance in which
resentment was mingled with admiration."You forget to whom you speak,
maiden.Know, the distinction I have offered you is one for which
hundreds whose trains you are born to bear would feel gratitude.""Once more, my lord," resumed Catharine, "keep these favours for those
by whom they are prized; or rather reserve your time and your health
for other and nobler pursuits--for the defence of your country and
the happiness of your subjects.Alas, my lord, how willingly would an
exulting people receive you for their chief!How gladly would they close
around you, did you show desire to head them against the oppression of
the mighty, the violence of the lawless, the seduction of the vicious,
and the tyranny of the hypocrite!"The Duke of Rothsay, whose virtuous feelings were as easily excited
as they were evanescent, was affected by the enthusiasm with which she
spoke."Forgive me if I have alarmed you, maiden," he said "thou art
too noble minded to be the toy of passing pleasure, for which my mistake
destined thee; and I, even were thy birth worthy of thy noble spirit and
transcendent beauty, have no heart to give thee; for by the homage of
the heart only should such as thou be wooed.But my hopes have been
blighted, Catharine: the only woman I ever loved has been torn from me
in the very wantonness of policy, and a wife imposed on me whom I must
ever detest, even had she the loveliness and softness which alone can
render a woman amiable in my eyes.My health is fading even in early
youth; and all that is left for me is to snatch such flowers as the
short passage from life to the grave will now present.Look at my hectic
cheek; feel, if you will, my intermitting pulse; and pity me and excuse
me if I, whose rights as a prince and as a man have been trampled upon
and usurped, feel occasional indifference towards the rights of others,
and indulge a selfish desire to gratify the wish of the passing moment."exclaimed Catharine, with the enthusiasm which belonged
to her character--"I will call you my dear lord, for dear must the heir
of Bruce be to every child of Scotland--let me not, I pray, hear you
speak thus!Your glorious ancestor endured exile, persecution, the night
of famine, and the day of unequal combat, to free his country; do you
practise the like self denial to free yourself.Tear yourself from those
who find their own way to greatness smoothed by feeding your follies.You know it not, I am sure--you could not
know; but the wretch who could urge the daughter to courses of shame by
threatening the life of the aged father is capable of all that is vile,
all that is treacherous!""He did indeed, my lord, and he dares not deny it.""It shall be looked to," answered the Duke of Rothsay."I have ceased
to love him; but he has suffered much for my sake, and I must see his
services honourably requited."Oh, my lord, if chronicles speak true, such services
brought Troy to ruins and gave the infidels possession of Spain.""Hush, maiden--speak within compass, I pray you," said the Prince,
rising up; "our conference ends here.""Yet one word, my Lord Duke of Rothsay," said Catharine, with animation,
while her beautiful countenance resembled that of an admonitory angel."I cannot tell what impels me to speak thus boldly; but the fire burns
within me, and will break out.Leave this castle without an hour's
delay; the air is unwholesome for you.Dismiss this Ramorny before the
day is ten minutes older; his company is most dangerous.""None in especial," answered Catharine, abashed at her own
eagerness--"none, perhaps, excepting my fears for your safety.""To vague fears the heir of Bruce must not listen.Ramorny entered, and bowed low to the Duke and to the maiden, whom,
perhaps, he considered as likely to be preferred to the post of
favourite sultana, and therefore entitled to a courteous obeisance."Ramorny," said the Prince, "is there in the household any female of
reputation who is fit to wait on this young woman till we can send her
where she may desire to go?""I fear," replied Ramorny, "if it displease not your Highness to hear
the truth, your household is indifferently provided in that way; and
that, to speak the very verity, the glee maiden is the most decorous
amongst us.""Let her wait upon this young person, then, since better may not be.And
take patience, maiden, for a few hours.""So, my lord, part you so soon from the Fair Maid of Perth?This is,
indeed, the very wantonness of victory.""There is neither victory nor defeat in the case," returned the Prince,
drily."The girl loves me not; nor do I love her well enough to torment
myself concerning her scruples.""The chaste Malcolm the Maiden revived in one of his descendants!""Favour me, sir, by a truce to your wit, or by choosing a different
subject for its career.It is noon, I believe, and you will oblige me by
commanding them to serve up dinner."Ramorny left the room; but Rothsay thought he discovered a smile upon
his countenance, and to be the subject of this man's satire gave him no
ordinary degree of pain.He summoned, however, the knight to his table,
and even admitted Dwining to the same honour.The conversation was of
a lively and dissolute cast, a tone encouraged by the Prince, as if
designing to counterbalance the gravity of his morals in the morning,
which Ramorny, who was read in old chronicles, had the boldness to liken
to the continence of Scipio.The banquet, nothwithstanding the Duke's indifferent health, was
protracted in idle wantonness far beyond the rules of temperance; and,
whether owing simply to the strength of the wine which he drank, or the
weakness of his constitution, or, as it is probable, because the last
wine which he quaffed had been adulterated by Dwining, it so happened
that the Prince, towards the end of the repast, fell into a lethargic
sleep, from which it seemed impossible to rouse him.Sir John Ramorny
and Dwining carried him to his chamber, accepting no other assistance
than that of another person, whom we will afterwards give name to.Next morning, it was announced that the Prince was taken ill of
an infectious disorder; and, to prevent its spreading through the
household, no one was admitted to wait on him save his late master of
horse, the physician Dwining, and the domestic already mentioned; one of
whom seemed always to remain in the apartment, while the others observed
a degree of precaution respecting their intercourse with the rest of the
family, so strict as to maintain the belief that he was dangerously ill
of an infectious disorder.In winter's tedious nights, sit by the fire,
     With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales
     Of woeful ages, long ago betid:
     And, ere thou bid goodnight, to quit their grief,
     Tell thou the lamentable fall of me.King Richard II Act V. Scene I.


Far different had been the fate of the misguided heir of Scotland from
that which was publicly given out in the town of Falkland.His ambitious
uncle had determined on his death, as the means of removing the first
and most formidable barrier betwixt his own family and the throne.James, the younger son of the King, was a mere boy, who might at more
leisure be easily set aside.Ramorny's views of aggrandisement, and the
resentment which he had latterly entertained against his masters made
him a willing agent in young Rothsay's destruction.Dwining's love of
gold, and his native malignity of disposition, rendered him equally
forward.It had been resolved, with the most calculating cruelty,
that all means which might leave behind marks of violence were to be
carefully avoided, and the extinction of life suffered to take place
of itself by privation of every kind acting upon a frail and impaired
constitution.The Prince of Scotland was not to be murdered, as Ramorny
had expressed himself on another occasion, he was only to cease to
exist.Rothsay's bedchamber in the Tower of Falkland was well adapted
for the execution of such a horrible project.A small, narrow staircase,
scarce known to exist, opened from thence by a trapdoor to the
subterranean dungeons of the castle, through a passage by which
the feudal lord was wont to visit, in private and in disguise, the
inhabitants of those miserable regions.By this staircase the villains
conveyed the insensible Prince to the lowest dungeon of the castle,
so deep in the bowels of the earth, that no cries or groans, it was
supposed, could possibly be heard, while the strength of its door and
fastenings must for a long time have defied force, even if the entrance
could have been discovered.Bonthron, who had been saved from the
gallows for the purpose, was the willing agent of Ramorny's unparalleled
cruelty to his misled and betrayed patron.This wretch revisited the dungeon at the time when the Prince's lethargy
began to wear off, and when, awaking to sensation, he felt himself
deadly cold, unable to move, and oppressed with fetters, which scarce
permitted him to stir from the dank straw on which he was laid.His
first idea was that he was in a fearful dream, his next brought a
confused augury of the truth.He called, shouted, yelled at length in
frenzy but no assistance came, and he was only answered by the vaulted
roof of the dungeon.The agent of hell heard these agonizing screams,
and deliberately reckoned them against the taunts and reproaches with
which Rothsay had expressed his instinctive aversion to him.When,
exhausted and hopeless, the unhappy youth remained silent, the savage
resolved to present himself before the eyes of his prisoner.The locks
were drawn, the chain fell; the Prince raised himself as high as his
fetters permitted; a red glare, against which he was fain to shut his
eyes, streamed through the vault; and when he opened them again, it was
on the ghastly form of one whom he had reason to think dead."I am judged and condemned," he exclaimed, "and the most abhorred fiend
in the infernal regions is sent to torment me!""I live, my lord," said Bonthron; "and that you may live and enjoy life,
be pleased to sit up and eat your victuals.""Free me from these irons," said the Prince, "release me from this
dungeon, and, dog as thou art, thou shalt be the richest man in
Scotland.""If you would give me the weight of your shackles in gold," said
Bonthron, "I would rather see the iron on you than have the treasure
myself!But look up; you were wont to love delicate fare--behold how I
have catered for you."The wretch, with fiendish glee, unfolded a piece of rawhide covering the
bundle which he bore under' his arm, and, passing the light to and fro
before it, showed the unhappy Prince a bull's head recently hewn from
the trunk, and known in Scotland as the certain signal of death.He
placed it at the foot of the bed, or rather lair, on which the Prince
lay."Be moderate in your food," he said; "it is like to be long ere thou
getst another meal.""Tell me but one thing, wretch," said the Prince."Does Ramorny know of
this practice?""How else hadst thou been decoyed hither?Poor woodcock, thou art
snared!"With these words, the door shut, the bolts resounded, and the unhappy
Prince was left to darkness, solitude, and misery."Oh, my father!--my
prophetic father!The staff I leaned on has indeed proved a spear!"We will not dwell on the subsequent hours, nay, days, of bodily agony
and mental despair.But it was not the pleasure of Heaven that so great a crime should be
perpetrated with impunity.Catharine Glover and the glee woman, neglected by the other inmates,
who seemed to be engaged with the tidings of the Prince's illness, were,
however, refused permission to leave the castle until it should be seen
how this alarming disease was to terminate, and whether it was actually
an infectious sickness.Forced on each other's society, the two desolate
women became companions, if not friends; and the union drew somewhat
closer when Catharine discovered that this was the same female minstrel
on whose account Henry Wynd had fallen under her displeasure.She now
heard his complete vindication, and listened with ardour to the praises
which Louise heaped on her gallant protector.On the other hand, the
minstrel, who felt the superiority of Catharine's station and character,
willingly dwelt upon a theme which seemed to please her, and recorded
her gratitude to the stout smith in the little song of "Bold and True,"
which was long a favourite in Scotland.Oh, bold and true,
     In bonnet blue,
     That fear or falsehood never knew,
     Whose heart was loyal to his word,
     Whose hand was faithful to his sword--
     Seek Europe wide from sea to sea,
     But bonny blue cap still for me!I've seen Almain's proud champions prance,
     Have seen the gallant knights of France,
     Unrivall'd with the sword and lance,
     Have seen the sons of England true,
     Wield the brown bill and bend the yew.Search France the fair, and England free,
     But bonny blue cap still for me!In short, though Louise's disreputable occupation would have been in
other circumstances an objection to Catharine's voluntarily frequenting
her company, yet, forced together as they now were, she found her a
humble and accommodating companion.They lived in this manner for four or five days, and, in order to avoid
as much as possible the gaze, and perhaps the incivility, of the menials
in the offices, they prepared their food in their own apartment.In the
absolutely necessary intercourse with domestics, Louise, more accustomed
to expedients, bolder by habit, and desirous to please Catharine,
willingly took on herself the trouble of getting from the pantler the
materials of their slender meal, and of arranging it with the dexterity
of her country.The glee woman had been abroad for this purpose upon the sixth day, a
little before noon; and the desire of fresh air, or the hope to find
some sallad or pot herbs, or at least an early flower or two, with which
to deck their board, had carried her into the small garden appertaining
to the castle.She re-entered her apartment in the tower with a
countenance pale as ashes, and a frame which trembled like an aspen
leaf.Her terror instantly extended itself to Catharine, who could
hardly find words to ask what new misfortune had occurred.said Louise, speaking under her breath, and huddling
her words so thick upon each other that Catharine could hardly catch
the sense."I was seeking for flowers to dress your pottage, because
you said you loved them yesterday; my poor little dog, thrusting himself
into a thicket of yew and holly bushes that grow out of some old ruins
close to the castle wall, came back whining and howling.I crept forward
to see what might be the cause--and, oh!I heard a groaning as of one
in extreme pain, but so faint, that it seemed to arise out of the very
depth of the earth.At length, I found it proceeded from a small rent in
the wall, covered with ivy; and when I laid my ear close to the opening,
I could hear the Prince's voice distinctly say, 'It cannot now last
long'--and then it sunk away in something like a prayer.""I said, 'Is it you, my lord?'and the answer was, 'Who mocks me with
that title?'I asked him if I could help him, and he answered with a
voice I shall never forget, 'Food--food!So I came
hither to tell you.that were more likely to destroy than to aid," said Catharine."I know not yet," said Catharine, prompt and bold on occasions of
moment, though yielding to her companion in ingenuity of resource on
ordinary occasions: "I know not yet, but something we will do: the blood
of Bruce shall not die unaided."So saying, she seized the small cruise which contained their soup, and
the meat of which it was made, wrapped some thin cakes which she had
baked into the fold of her plaid, and, beckoning her companion to follow
with a vessel of milk, also part of their provisions, she hastened
towards the garden."So, our fair vestal is stirring abroad?"said the only man she met, who
was one of the menials; but Catharine passed on without notice or reply,
and gained the little garden without farther interruption.Louise indicated to her a heap of ruins, which, covered with underwood,
was close to the castle wall.It had probably been originally a
projection from the building; and the small fissure, which communicated
with the dungeon, contrived for air, had terminated within it.But the
aperture had been a little enlarged by decay, and admitted a dim ray of
light to its recesses, although it could not be observed by those who
visited the place with torchlight aids."Here is dead silence," said Catharine, after she had listened
attentively for a moment."Heaven and earth, he is gone!""We must risk something," said her companion, and ran her fingers over
the strings of her guitar.A sigh was the only answer from the depth of the dungeon."I am here, my lord--I am here, with food and drink."The jest comes too late; I am dying," was the answer."His brain is turned, and no wonder," thought Catharine; "but whilst
there is life, there may be hope.""It is I, my lord, Catharine Glover.I have food, if I could pass it
safely to you."I thought the pain was over, but it glows
again within me at the name of food.""The food is here, but how--ah, how can I pass it to you?the chink
is so narrow, the wall is so thick!Yet there is a remedy--I have it.Quick, Louise; cut me a willow bough, the tallest you can find."The glee maiden obeyed, and, by means of a cleft in the top of the
wand, Catharine transmitted several morsels of the soft cakes, soaked in
broth, which served at once for food and for drink.The unfortunate young man ate little, and with difficulty, but prayed
for a thousand blessings on the head of his comforter."I had destined
thee to be the slave of my vices," he said, "and yet thou triest to
become the preserver of my life!"I will return with food as I shall see opportunity," said Catharine,
just as the glee maiden plucked her sleeve and desired her to be silent
and stand close.Both crouched among the ruins, and they heard the voices of Ramorny and
the mediciner in close conversation."He is stronger than I thought," said the former, in a low, croaking
tone."How long held out Dalwolsy, when the knight of Liddesdale
prisoned him in his castle of Hermitage?""For a fortnight," answered Dwining; "but he was a strong man, and had
some assistance by grain which fell from a granary above his prison
house.""Were it not better end the matter more speedily?He will demand to see the
Prince, and all must be over ere he comes."They passed on in their dark and fatal conversation."Now gain we the tower," said Catharine to her companion, when she saw
they had left the garden."I had a plan of escape for myself; I will
turn it into one of rescue for the Prince.The dey woman enters the
castle about vesper time, and usually leaves her cloak in the passage as
she goes into the pantlers' office with the milk.Take thou the cloak,
muffle thyself close, and pass the warder boldly; he is usually drunken
at that hour, and thou wilt go as the dey woman unchallenged through
gate and along bridge, if thou bear thyself with confidence.Then away
to meet the Black Douglas; he is our nearest and only aid.""But," said Louise, "is he not that terrible lord who threatened me with
shame and punishment?""Believe it," said Catharine, "such as thou or I never dwelt an hour in
the Douglas's memory, either for good or evil.Tell him that his son in
law, the Prince of Scotland dies--treacherously famished--in Falkland
Castle, and thou wilt merit not pardon only, but reward.""I care not for reward," said Louise; "the deed will reward itself.But
methinks to stay is more dangerous than to go.Let me stay, then, and
nourish the unhappy Prince, and do you depart to bring help.If they
kill me before you return, I leave you my poor lute, and pray you to be
kind to my poor Charlot.""No, Louise," replied Catharine, "you are a more privileged and
experienced wanderer than I--do you go; and if you find me dead on your
return, as may well chance, give my poor father this ring and a lock of
my hair, and say, Catharine died in endeavouring to save the blood of
Bruce.And give this other lock to Henry; say, Catharine thought of him
to the last, and that, if he has judged her too scrupulous touching the
blood of others, he will then know it was not because she valued her
own."They sobbed in each other's arms, and the intervening hours till evening
were spent in endeavouring to devise some better mode of supplying the
captive with nourishment, and in the construction of a tube, composed
of hollow reeds, slipping into each other, by which liquids might be
conveyed to him.The bell of the village church of Falkland tolled to
vespers.The dey, or farm woman, entered with her pitchers to deliver
the milk for the family, and to hear and tell the news stirring.She had
scarcely entered the kitchen when the female minstrel, again throwing
herself in Catharine's arms, and assuring her of her unalterable
fidelity, crept in silence downstairs, the little dog under her arm.A
moment after, she was seen by the breathless Catharine, wrapt in the dey
woman's cloak, and walking composedly across the drawbridge."So," said the warder, "you return early tonight, May Bridget?Small
mirth towards in the hall--ha, wench!"I have forgotten my tallies," said the ready witted French woman, "and
will return in the skimming of a bowie."She went onward, avoiding the village of Falkland, and took a footpath
which led through the park.Catharine breathed freely, and blessed God
when she saw her lost in the distance.It was another anxious hour
for Catharine which occurred before the escape of the fugitive was
discovered.This happened so soon as the dey girl, having taken an hour
to perform a task which ten minutes might have accomplished, was about
to return, and discovered that some one had taken away her grey frieze
cloak.A strict search was set on foot; at length the women of the
house remembered the glee maiden, and ventured to suggest her as one not
unlikely to exchange an old cloak for a new one.The warder, strictly
questioned, averred he saw the dey woman depart immediately after
vespers; and on this being contradicted by the party herself, he could
suggest, as the only alternative, that it must needs have been the
devil.As, however, the glee woman could not be found, the real circumstances
of the case were easily guessed at; and the steward went to inform Sir
John Ramorny and Dwining, who were now scarcely ever separate, of
the escape of one of their female captives.Everything awakens the
suspicions of the guilty.They looked on each other with faces of
dismay, and then went together to the humble apartment of Catharine,
that they might take her as much as possible by surprise while they
inquired into the facts attending Louise's disappearance.said Ramorny, in a tone of
austere gravity."I have no companion here," answered Catharine."Trifle not," replied the knight; "I mean the glee maiden, who lately
dwelt in this chamber with you.""She is gone, they tell me," said Catharine--"gone about an hour since.""How," answered Catharine, "should I know which way a professed wanderer
may choose to travel?She was tired no doubt of a solitary life, so
different from the scenes of feasting and dancing which her trade leads
her to frequent.She is gone, and the only wonder is that she should
have stayed so long.""This, then," said Ramorny, "is all you have to tell us?""All that I have to tell you, Sir John," answered Catharine, firmly;
"and if the Prince himself inquire, I can tell him no more.""There is little danger of his again doing you the honour to speak to
you in person," said Ramorny, "even if Scotland should escape being
rendered miserable by the sad event of his decease.""Is the Duke of Rothsay so very ill?""No help, save in Heaven," answered Ramorny, looking upward."Then may there yet be help there," said Catharine, "if human aid prove
unavailing!"said Ramorny, with the most determined gravity; while Dwining
adopted a face fit to echo the feeling, though it seemed to cost him
a painful struggle to suppress his sneering yet soft laugh of triumph,
which was peculiarly excited by anything having a religious tendency."And it is men--earthly men, and not incarnate devils, who thus appeal
to Heaven, while they are devouring by inches the life blood of their
hapless master!"muttered Catharine, as her two baffled inquisitors left
the apartment.But it will roll ere long, and
oh!may it be to preserve as well as to punish!"The hour of dinner alone afforded a space when, all in the castle being
occupied with that meal, Catharine thought she had the best opportunity
of venturing to the breach in the wall, with the least chance of being
observed.In waiting for the hour, she observed some stir in the castle,
which had been silent as the grave ever since the seclusion of the Duke
of Rothsay.The portcullis was lowered and raised, and the creaking of
the machinery was intermingled with the tramp of horse, as men at arms
went out and returned with steeds hard ridden and covered with foam.She
observed, too, that such domestics as she casually saw from her window
were in arms.All this made her heart throb high, for it augured the
approach of rescue; and besides, the bustle left the little garden more
lonely than ever.At length the hour of noon arrived; she had taken care
to provide, under pretence of her own wishes, which the pantler seemed
disposed to indulge, such articles of food as could be the most easily
conveyed to the unhappy captive.She whispered to intimate her presence;
there was no answer; she spoke louder, still there was silence."He sleeps," she muttered these words half aloud, and with a shuddering
which was succeeded by a start and a scream, when a voice replied behind
her:

"Yes, he sleeps; but it is for ever."Sir John Ramorny stood behind her in complete armour,
but the visor of his helmet was up, and displayed a countenance more
resembling one about to die than to fight.He spoke with a grave tone,
something between that of a calm observer of an interesting event and of
one who is an agent and partaker in it."Catharine," he said, "all is true which I tell you.You
have done your best for him; you can do no more.""I will not--I cannot believe it," said Catharine."Heaven be merciful
to me!it would make one doubt of Providence, to think so great a crime
has been accomplished.""Doubt not of Providence, Catharine, though it has suffered the
profligate to fall by his own devices.Follow me; I have that to say
which concerns you.I say follow (for she hesitated), unless you prefer
being left to the mercies of the brute Bonthron and the mediciner
Henbane Dwining.""I will follow you," said Catharine."You cannot do more to me than you
are permitted."He led the way into the tower, and mounted staircase after staircase and
ladder after ladder."I will follow no farther," she said.If to my death, I can die here.""Only to the battlements of the castle, fool," said Ramorny, throwing
wide a barred door which opened upon the vaulted roof of the castle,
where men were bending mangonels, as they called them (military engines,
that is, for throwing arrows or stones), getting ready crossbows, and
piling stones together.But the defenders did not exceed twenty in
number, and Catharine thought she could observe doubt and irresolution
amongst them."Catharine," said Ramorny, "I must not quit this station, which is
necessary for my defence; but I can speak with you here as well as
elsewhere.""Say on," answered Catharine, "I am prepared to hear you.""You have thrust yourself, Catharine, into a bloody secret.Have you the
firmness to keep it?""I do not understand you, Sir John," answered the maiden.I have slain--murdered, if you will--my late master, the Duke
of Rothsay.The spark of life which your kindness would have fed
was easily smothered.You are
faint--bear up--you have more to hear.You know the crime, but you know
not the provocation.this gauntlet is empty; I lost my right hand
in his cause, and when I was no longer fit to serve him, I was cast off
like a worn out hound, my loss ridiculed, and a cloister recommended,
instead of the halls and palaces in which I had my natural sphere!Think
on this--pity and assist me.""In what manner can you require my assistance?"said the trembling
maiden; "I can neither repair your loss nor cancel your crime.""Thou canst be silent, Catharine, on what thou hast seen and heard in
yonder thicket.It is but a brief oblivion I ask of you, whose word
will, I know, be listened to, whether you say such things were or were
not.That of your mountebank companion, the foreigner, none will hold
to be of a pin point's value.If you grant me this, I will take your
promise for my security, and throw the gate open to those who now
approach it.If you will not promise silence, I defend this castle till
every one perishes, and I fling you headlong from these battlements.Ay, look at them--it is not a leap to be rashly braved.Seven courses of
stairs brought you up hither with fatigue and shortened breath; but you
shall go from the top to the bottom in briefer time than you can breathe
a sigh!Speak the word, fair maid; for you speak to one unwilling to
harm you, but determined in his purpose."Catharine stood terrified, and without power of answering a man who
seemed so desperate; but she was saved the necessity of reply by the
approach of Dwining.He spoke with the same humble conges which at all
times distinguished his manner, and with his usual suppressed ironical
sneer, which gave that manner the lie."I do you wrong, noble sir, to intrude on your valiancie when engaged
with a fair damsel.But I come to ask a trifling question."said Ramorny; "ill news are sport to thee even when
they affect thyself, so that they concern others also.""Hem!--he, he!--I only desired to know if your knighthood proposed the
chivalrous task of defending the castle with your single hand--I crave
pardon, I meant your single arm?The question is worth asking, for I
am good for little to aid the defence, unless you could prevail on the
besiegers to take physic--he, he, he!--and Bonthron is as drunk as ale
and strong waters can make him; and you, he, and I make up the whole
garrison who are disposed for resistance.""Never saw men who showed less stomach to the work," answered
Dwining--"never.Eviot and his companion Buncle now approached, with sullen resolution
in their faces, like men who had made their minds up to resist that
authority which they had so long obeyed.said Ramorny, stepping forward to meet them.Why have you left the barbican, Eviot?And you other fellow,
did I not charge you to look to the mangonels?""We have something to tell you, Sir John Ramorny," answered Eviot."We
will not fight in this quarrel.""How--my own squires control me?""We were your squires and pages, my lord, while you were master of the
Duke of Rothsay's household.It is bruited about the Duke no longer
lives; we desire to know the truth.""What traitor dares spread such falsehoods?""All who have gone out to skirt the forest, my lord, and I myself among
others, bring back the same news.The minstrel woman who left the castle
yesterday has spread the report everywhere that the Duke of Rothsay
is murdered, or at death's door.The Douglas comes on us with a strong
force--"

"And you, cowards, take advantage of an idle report to forsake your
master?""My lord," said Eviot, "let Buncle and myself see the Duke of Rothsay,
and receive his personal orders for defence of this castle, and if we do
not fight to the death in that quarrel, I will consent to be hanged on
its highest turret.But if he be gone by natural disease, we will yield
up the castle to the Earl of Douglas, who is, they say, the King's
lieutenant.Or if--which Heaven forefend!--the noble Prince has had
foul play, we will not involve ourselves in the guilt of using arms in
defence of the murderers, be they who they will.""Eviot," said Ramorny, raising his mutilated arm, "had not that glove
been empty, thou hadst not lived to utter two words of this insolence.""It is as it is," answered Evict, "and we do but our duty.I have
followed you long, my lord, but here I draw bridle.""Farewell, then, and a curse light on all of you!""Our valiancie is about to run away," said the mediciner, who had crept
close to Catharine's side before she was aware."Catharine, thou art a
superstitious fool, like most women; nevertheless thou hast some mind,
and I speak to thee as one of more understanding than the buffaloes
which are herding about us.These haughty barons who overstride the
world, what are they in the day of adversity?Let
their sledge hammer hands or their column resembling legs have injury,
and bah!Heart and courage is nothing to
them, lith and limb everything: give them animal strength, what are they
better than furious bulls; take that away, and your hero of chivalry
lies grovelling like the brute when he is hamstrung.Not so the sage;
while a grain of sense remains in a crushed or mutilated frame, his mind
shall be strong as ever.Catharine, this morning I was practising your
death; but methinks I now rejoice that you may survive to tell how the
poor mediciner, the pill gilder, the mortar pounder, the poison vender,
met his fate, in company with the gallant Knight of Ramorny, Baron in
possession and Earl of Lindores in expectation--God save his lordship!""Old man," said Catharine, "if thou be indeed so near the day of thy
deserved doom, other thoughts were far wholesomer than the vainglorious
ravings of a vain philosophy.Ask to see a holy man--"

"Yes," said Dwining, scornfully, "refer myself to a greasy monk, who
does not--he!he!--understand the barbarous Latin he repeats by
rote.Such would be a fitting counsellor to one who has studied both
in Spain and Arabia!No, Catharine, I will choose a confessor that is
pleasant to look upon, and you shall be honoured with the office.Now,
look yonder at his valiancie, his eyebrow drops with moisture, his lip
trembles with agony; for his valiancie--he!he!--is pleading for his
life with his late domestics, and has not eloquence enough to persuade
them to let him slip.See how the fibres of his face work as he implores
the ungrateful brutes, whom he has heaped with obligations, to permit
him to get such a start for his life as the hare has from the greyhounds
when men course her fairly.Look also at the sullen, downcast, dogged
faces with which, fluctuating between fear and shame, the domestic
traitors deny their lord this poor chance for his life.These things
thought themselves the superior of a man like me!and you, foolish
wench, think so meanly of your Deity as to suppose wretches like them
are the work of Omnipotence!"said Catharine, warmly; "the God I worship
created these men with the attributes to know and adore Him, to guard
and defend their fellow creatures, to practise holiness and virtue.Their own vices, and the temptations of the Evil One, have made them
such as they now are.Oh, take the lesson home to thine own heart of
adamant!Heaven made thee wiser than thy fellows, gave thee eyes to look
into the secrets of nature, a sagacious heart, and a skilful hand; but
thy pride has poisoned all these fair gifts, and made an ungodly atheist
of one who might have been a Christian sage!""Atheist, say'st thou?""Perhaps I have doubts on that
matter--but they will be soon solved.Yonder comes one who will send
me, as he has done thousands, to the place where all mysteries shall be
cleared."Catharine followed the mediciner's eye up one of the forest glades, and
beheld it occupied by a body of horsemen advancing at full gallop.In
the midst was a pennon displayed, which, though its bearings were not
visible to Catharine, was, by a murmur around, acknowledged as that of
the Black Douglas.They halted within arrow shot of the castle, and a
herald with two trumpets advanced up to the main portal, where, after a
loud flourish, he demanded admittance for the high and dreaded Archibald
Earl of Douglas, Lord Lieutenant of the King, and acting for the time
with the plenary authority of his Majesty; commanding, at the same time,
that the inmates of the castle should lay down their arms, all under
penalty of high treason.said Eviot to Ramorny, who stood sullen and undecided."Will
you give orders to render the castle, or must I?"interrupted the knight, "to the last I will command you.Open the gates, drop the bridge, and render the castle to the Douglas.""Now, that's what may be called a gallant exertion of free will," said
Dwining."Just as if the pieces of brass that were screaming a minute
since should pretend to call those notes their own which are breathed
through them by a frowsy trumpeter."said Catharine, "either be silent or turn thy thoughts
to the eternity on the brink of which thou art standing.""Thou canst not, wench,
help hearing what I say to thee, and thou wilt tell it again, for thy
sex cannot help that either.Perth and all Scotland shall know what a
man they have lost in Henbane Dwining!"The clash of armour now announced that the newcomers had dismounted and
entered the castle, and were in the act of disarming the small garrison.Earl Douglas himself appeared on the battlements, with a few of his
followers, and signed to them to take Ramorny and Dwining into custody.Others dragged from some nook the stupefied Bonthron."It was to these three that the custody of the Prince was solely
committed daring his alleged illness?"said the Douglas, prosecuting an
inquiry which he had commenced in the hall of the castle."No other saw him, my lord," said Eviot, "though I offered my services.""Conduct us to the Duke's apartment, and bring the prisoners with
us.Also should there be a female in the castle, if she hath not been
murdered or spirited away--the companion of the glee maiden who brought
the first alarm.""She is here, my lord," said Eviot, bringing Catharine forward.Her beauty and her agitation made some impression even upon the
impassible Earl."Fear nothing, maiden," he said; "thou hast deserved both praise and
reward.Tell to me, as thou wouldst confess to Heaven, the things thou
hast witnessed in this castle."Few words served Catharine to unfold the dreadful story."It agrees," said the Douglas, "with the tale of the glee maiden, from
point to point.They passed to the room which the unhappy Duke of Rothsay had been
supposed to inhabit; but the key was not to be found, and the Earl could
only obtain entrance by forcing the door.On entering, the wasted and
squalid remains of the unhappy Prince were discovered, flung on the bed
as if in haste.The intention of the murderers had apparently been to
arrange the dead body so as to resemble a timely parted corpse, but they
had been disconcerted by the alarm occasioned by the escape of Louise.Douglas looked on the body of the misguided youth, whose wild passions
and caprices had brought him to this fatal and premature catastrophe."I had wrongs to be redressed," he said; "but to see such a sight as
this banishes all remembrance of injury!"It should have been arranged," said Dwining, "more to your
omnipotence's pleasure; but you came suddenly on us, and hasty masters
make slovenly service."Douglas seemed not to hear what his prisoner said, so closely did he
examine the wan and wasted features, and stiffened limbs, of the dead
body before him.Catharine, overcome by sickness and fainting, at length
obtained permission to retire from the dreadful scene, and, through
confusion of every description, found her way to her former apartment,
where she was locked in the arms of Louise, who had returned in the
interval.The dying hand of the Prince
was found to be clenched upon a lock of hair, resembling, in colour and
texture, the coal black bristles of Bonthron.Thus, though famine had
begun the work, it would seem that Rothsay's death had been finally
accomplished by violence.The private stair to the dungeon, the keys of
which were found at the subaltern assassin's belt, the situation of the
vault, its communication with the external air by the fissure in the
walls, and the wretched lair of straw, with the fetters which remained
there, fully confirmed the story of Catharine and of the glee woman."We will not hesitate an instant," said the Douglas to his near kinsman,
the Lord Balveny, as soon as they returned from the dungeon."But, my lord, some trial may be fitting," answered Balveny."I have taken them red hand; my
authority will stretch to instant execution.Yet stay--have we not some
Jedwood men in our troop?""Plenty of Turnbulls, Rutherfords, Ainslies, and so forth," said
Balveny."Call me an inquest of these together; they are all good men and true,
saving a little shifting for their living.Do you see to the execution
of these felons, while I hold a court in the great hall, and we'll try
whether the jury or the provost marshal do their work first; we will
have Jedwood justice--hang in haste and try at leisure.""Yet stay, my lord," said Ramorny, "you may rue your haste--will you
grant me a word out of earshot?"said Douglas; "speak out what thou hast to say before
all that are here present.""Know all; then," said Ramorny, aloud, "that this noble Earl had letters
from the Duke of Albany and myself, sent him by the hand of yon cowardly
deserter, Buncle--let him deny it if he dare--counselling the removal
of the Duke for a space from court, and his seclusion in this Castle of
Falkland.""But not a word," replied Douglas, sternly smiling, "of his being flung
into a dungeon--famished--strangled.Away with the wretches, Balveny,
they pollute God's air too long!"The prisoners were dragged off to the battlements.But while the means
of execution were in the act of being prepared, the apothecary expressed
so ardent a desire to see Catharine once more, and, as he said, for
the good of his soul, that the maiden, in hopes his obduracy might have
undergone some change even at the last hour, consented again to go
to the battlements, and face a scene which her heart recoiled from.A single glance showed her Bonthron, sunk in total and drunken
insensibility; Ramorny, stripped of his armour, endeavouring in vain to
conceal fear, while he spoke with a priest, whose good offices he had
solicited; and Dwining, the same humble, obsequious looking, crouching
individual she had always known him.He held in his hand a little silver
pen, with which he had been writing on a scrap of parchment."Catharine," he said--"he, he, he!--I wish to speak to thee on the
nature of my religious faith.""If such be thy intention, why lose time with me?"The good father," said Dwining, "is--he, he!--already a worshipper of
the deity whom I have served.I therefore prefer to give the altar of
mine idol a new worshipper in thee, Catharine.This scrap of parchment
will tell thee how to make your way into my chapel, where I have
worshipped so often in safety.I leave the images which it contains to
thee as a legacy, simply because I hate and contemn thee something less
than any of the absurd wretches whom I have hitherto been obliged to
call fellow creatures.And now away--or remain and see if the end of the
quacksalver belies his life.""Nay," said the mediciner, "I have but a single word to say, and yonder
nobleman's valiancie may hear it if he will."Lord Balveny approached, with some curiosity; for the undaunted
resolution of a man who never wielded sword or bore armour and was in
person a poor dwindled dwarf, had to him an air of something resembling
sorcery.""You see this trifling implement," said the criminal, showing the
silver pen."By means of this I can escape the power even of the Black
Douglas.""Give him no ink nor paper," said Balveny, hastily, "he will draw a
spell.""Not so, please your wisdom and valiancie--he, he, he!"said Dwining
with his usual chuckle, as he unscrewed the top of the pen, within which
was a piece of sponge or some such substance, no bigger than a pea."Now, mark this--" said the prisoner, and drew it between his lips.He lay a dead corpse before them, the
contemptuous sneer still on his countenance.Catharine shrieked and fled, seeking, by a hasty descent, an escape from
a sight so appalling.Lord Balveny was for a moment stupified, and then
exclaimed, "This may be glamour!hang him over the battlements, quick
or dead.If his foul spirit hath only withdrawn for a space, it shall
return to a body with a dislocated neck."Ramorny and Bonthron were then ordered for
execution.The last was hanged before he seemed quite to comprehend what
was designed to be done with him.Ramorny, pale as death, yet with
the same spirit of pride which had occasioned his ruin, pleaded his
knighthood, and demanded the privilege of dying by decapitation by the
sword, and not by the noose."The Douglas never alters his doom," said Balveny."But thou shalt have
all thy rights.The menial whom he called appeared at his summons."What shakest thou for, fellow?"said Balveny; "here, strike me this
man's gilt spurs from his heels with thy cleaver.And now, John Ramorny,
thou art no longer a knight, but a knave.To the halter with him,
provost marshal!hang him betwixt his companions, and higher than them
if it may be."In a quarter of an hour afterwards, Balveny descended to tell the
Douglas that the criminals were executed."Then there is no further use in the trial," said the Earl."How say
you, good men of inquest, were these men guilty of high treason--ay or
no?""Guilty," exclaimed the obsequious inquest, with edifying unanimity, "we
need no farther evidence.""Sound trumpets, and to horse then, with our own train only; and let
each man keep silence on what has chanced here, until the proceedings
shall be laid before the King, which cannot conveniently be till the
battle of Palm Sunday shall be fought and ended.Select our attendants,
and tell each man who either goes with us or remains behind that he who
prates dies."In a few minutes the Douglas was on horseback, with the followers
selected to attend his person.Expresses were sent to his daughter, the
widowed Duchess of Rothsay, directing her to take her course to Perth,
by the shores of Lochleven, without approaching Falkland, and committing
to her charge Catharine Glover and the glee woman, as persons whose
safety he tendered.As they rode through the forest, they looked back, and beheld the three
bodies hanging, like specks darkening the walls of the old castle."The hand is punished," said Douglas, "but who shall arraign the head by
whose direction the act was done?""I do, kinsman; and were I to listen to the dictates of my heart, I
would charge him with the deed, which I am certain he has authorised.But there is no proof of it beyond strong suspicion, and Albany has
attached to himself the numerous friends of the house of Stuart, to
whom, indeed, the imbecility of the King and the ill regulated habits
of Rothsay left no other choice of a leader.Were I, therefore, to break
the bond which I have so lately formed with Albany, the consequence
must be civil war, an event ruinous to poor Scotland while threatened
by invasion from the activity of the Percy, backed by the treachery
of March.No, Balveny, the punishment of Albany must rest with Heaven,
which, in its own good time, will execute judgment on him and on his
house."The hour is nigh: now hearts beat high;
     Each sword is sharpen'd well;
     And who dares die, who stoops to fly,
     Tomorrow's light shall tell.We are now to recall to our reader's recollection, that Simon Glover and
his fair daughter had been hurried from their residence without having
time to announce to Henry Smith either their departure or the alarming
cause of it.When, therefore, the lover appeared in Curfew Street, on
the morning of their flight, instead of the hearty welcome of the honest
burgher, and the April reception, half joy half censure, which he had
been promised on the part of his lovely daughter, he received only the
astounding intelligence, that her father and she had set off early, on
the summons of a stranger, who had kept himself carefully muffled from
observation.To this, Dorothy, whose talents for forestalling evil, and
communicating her views of it, are known to the reader, chose to add,
that she had no doubt her master and young mistress were bound for the
Highlands, to avoid a visit which had been made since their departure by
two or three apparitors, who, in the name of a Commission appointed by
the King, had searched the house, put seals upon such places as were
supposed to contain papers, and left citations for father and daughter
to appear before the Court of Commission, on a day certain, under pain
of outlawry.All these alarming particulars Dorothy took care to state
in the gloomiest colours, and the only consolation which she afforded
the alarmed lover was, that her master had charged her to tell him to
reside quietly at Perth, and that he should soon hear news of them.This
checked the smith's first resolve, which was to follow them instantly to
the Highlands, and partake the fate which they might encounter.But when he recollected his repeated feuds with divers of the Clan
Quhele, and particularly his personal quarrel with Conachar, who was now
raised to be a high chief, he could not but think, on reflection, that
his intrusion on their place of retirement was more likely to disturb
the safety which they might otherwise enjoy there than be of any service
to them.He was well acquainted with Simon's habitual intimacy with
the chief of the Clan Quhele, and justly augured that the glover would
obtain protection, which his own arrival might be likely to disturb,
while his personal prowess could little avail him in a quarrel with
a whole tribe of vindictive mountaineers.At the same time his heart
throbbed with indignation, when he thought of Catharine being within the
absolute power of young Conachar, whose rivalry he could not doubt, and
who had now so many means of urging his suit.What if the young chief
should make the safety of the father depend on the favour of the
daughter?He distrusted not Catharine's affections, but then her mode
of thinking was so disinterested, and her attachment to her father so
tender, that, if the love she bore her suitor was weighed against his
security, or perhaps his life, it was matter of deep and awful doubt
whether it might not be found light in the balance.Tormented by
thoughts on which we need not dwell, he resolved nevertheless to
remain at home, stifle his anxiety as he might, and await the promised
intelligence from the old man.It came, but it did not relieve his
concern.Sir Patrick Charteris had not forgotten his promise to communicate to
the smith the plans of the fugitives.But, amid the bustle occasioned by
the movement of troops, he could not himself convey the intelligence.He therefore entrusted to his agent, Kitt Henshaw, the task of making it
known.But this worthy person, as the reader knows, was in the interest
of Ramorny, whose business it was to conceal from every one, but
especially from a lover so active and daring as Henry, the real place of
Catharine's residence.Henshaw therefore announced to the anxious smith
that his friend the glover was secure in the Highlands; and though he
affected to be more reserved on the subject of Catharine, he said little
to contradict the belief that she as well as Simon shared the protection
of the Clan Quhele.But he reiterated, in the name of Sir Patrick,
assurances that father and daughter were both well, and that Henry would
best consult his own interest and their safety by remaining quiet and
waiting the course of events.With an agonized heart, therefore, Henry Gow determined to remain quiet
till he had more certain intelligence, and employed himself in finishing
a shirt of mail, which he intended should be the best tempered and the
most finely polished that his skilful hands had ever executed.This
exercise of his craft pleased him better than any other occupation which
he could have adopted, and served as an apology for secluding himself
in his workshop, and shunning society, where the idle reports which were
daily circulated served only to perplex and disturb him.He resolved to
trust in the warm regard of Simon, the faith of his daughter, and the
friendship of the provost, who, having so highly commended his valour
in the combat with Bonthron, would never, he thought, desert him at this
extremity of his fortunes.Time, however, passed on day by day; and
it was not till Palm Sunday was near approaching, that Sir Patrick
Charteris, having entered the city to make some arrangements for the
ensuing combat, bethought himself of making a visit to the Smith of the
Wynd.He entered his workshop with an air of sympathy unusual to him, and
which made Henry instantly augur that he brought bad news.The smith
caught the alarm, and the uplifted hammer was arrested in its descent
upon the heated iron, while the agitated arm that wielded it, strong
before as that of a giant, became so powerless, that it was with
difficulty Henry was able to place the weapon on the ground, instead of
dropping it from his hand."My poor Henry," said Sir Patrick, "I bring you but cold news; they are
uncertain, however, and, if true, they are such as a brave man like you
should not take too deeply to heart.""In God's name, my lord," said Henry, "I trust you bring no evil news of
Simon Glover or his daughter?""Touching themselves," said Sir Patrick, "no: they are safe and well.But as to thee, Henry, my tidings are more cold.Kitt Henshaw has, I
think, apprised thee that I had endeavoured to provide Catharine Glover
with a safe protection in the house of an honourable lady, the Duchess
of Rothsay.But she hath declined the charge, and Catharine hath been
sent to her father in the Highlands.Thou
mayest have heard that Gilchrist MacIan is dead, and that his son
Eachin, who was known in Perth as the apprentice of old Simon, by the
name of Conachar, is now the chief of Clan Quhele; and I heard from one
of my domestics that there is a strong rumour among the MacIans that the
young chief seeks the hand of Catharine in marriage.My domestic learned
this--as a secret, however--while in the Breadalbane country, on some
arrangements touching the ensuing combat.The thing is uncertain but,
Henry, it wears a face of likelihood.""Did your lordship's servant see Simon Glover and his daughter?"said
Henry, struggling for breath, and coughing, to conceal from the provost
the excess of his agitation."He did not," said Sir Patrick; "the Highlanders seemed jealous, and
refused to permit him to speak to the old man, and he feared to alarm
them by asking to see Catharine.Besides, he talks no Gaelic, nor had
his informer much English, so there may be some mistake in the matter.Nevertheless, there is such a report, and I thought it best to tell it
you.But you may be well assured that the wedding cannot go on till the
affair of Palm Sunday be over; and I advise you to take no step till we
learn the circumstances of the matter, for certainty is most desirable,
even when it is painful.Go you to the council house," he added, after a
pause, "to speak about the preparations for the lists in the North Inch?"Well, Smith, I judge by your brief answer that you are discomposed with
this matter; but, after all, women are weathercocks, that is the truth
on't.Solomon and others have proved it before you."And so Sir Patrick Charteris retired, fully convinced he had discharged
the office of a comforter in the most satisfactory manner.With very different impressions did the unfortunate lover regard the
tidings and listen to the consoling commentary."The provost," he said bitterly to himself, "is an excellent man; marry,
he holds his knighthood so high, that, if he speaks nonsense, a poor man
must hold it sense, as he must praise dead ale if it be handed to him
in his lordship's silver flagon.How would all this sound in another
situation?Suppose I were rolling down the steep descent of the
Corrichie Dhu, and before I came to the edge of the rock, comes my Lord
Provost, and cries: 'Henry, there is a deep precipice, and I grieve to
say you are in the fair way of rolling over it.But be not downcast,
for Heaven may send a stone or a bush to stop your progress.However, I
thought it would be comfort to you to know the worst, which you will
be presently aware of.I do not know how many hundred feet deep the
precipice descends, but you may form a judgment when you are at the
bottom, for certainty is certainty.when come you to take
a game at bowls?'And this gossip is to serve instead of any friendly
attempt to save the poor wight's neck!When I think of this, I could go
mad, seize my hammer, and break and destroy all around me.But I will
be calm; and if this Highland kite, who calls himself a falcon, should
stoop at my turtle dove, he shall know whether a burgess of Perth can
draw a bow or not."It was now the Thursday before the fated Palm Sunday, and the champions
on either side were expected to arrive the next day, that they might
have the interval of Saturday to rest, refresh themselves, and prepare
for the combat.Two or three of each of the contending parties were
detached to receive directions about the encampment of their little
band, and such other instructions as might be necessary to the proper
ordering of the field.Henry was not, therefore, surprised at seeing a
tall and powerful Highlander peering anxiously about the wynd in which
he lived, in the manner in which the natives of a wild country examine
the curiosities of one that is more civilized.The smith's heart rose
against the man on account of his country, to which our Perth burgher
bore a natural prejudice, and more especially as he observed the
individual wear the plaid peculiar to the Clan Quhele.The sprig of oak
leaves, worked in silk, intimated also that the individual was one
of those personal guards of young Eachin, upon whose exertions in the
future battle so much reliance was placed by those of their clan.Having observed so much, Henry withdrew into his smithy, for the sight
of the man raised his passion; and, knowing that the Highlander came
plighted to a solemn combat, and could not be the subject of any
inferior quarrel, he was resolved at least to avoid friendly intercourse
with him.In a few minutes, however, the door of the smithy flew open,
and flattering in his tartans, which greatly magnified his actual size,
the Gael entered with the haughty step of a man conscious of a personal
dignity superior to anything which he is likely to meet with.He stood
looking around him, and seemed to expect to be received with courtesy
and regarded with wonder.But Henry had no sort of inclination to
indulge his vanity and kept hammering away at a breastplate which was
lying upon his anvil as if he were not aware of his visitor's presence.(the bandy legged smith), said the Highlander."Those that wish to be crook backed call me so," answered Henry."No offence meant," said the Highlander; "but her own self comes to buy
an armour.""Her own self's bare shanks may trot hence with her," answered Henry; "I
have none to sell.""If it was not within two days of Palm Sunday, herself would make you
sing another song," retorted the Gael."And being the day it is," said Henry, with the same contemptuous
indifference, "I pray you to stand out of my light.""You are an uncivil person; but her own self is fir nan ord too; and she
knows the smith is fiery when the iron is hot.""If her nainsell be hammer man herself, her nainsell may make her nain
harness," replied Henry."And so her nainsell would, and never fash you for the matter; but it
is said, Gow Chrom, that you sing and whistle tunes over the swords and
harnishes that you work, that have power to make the blades cut steel
links as if they were paper, and the plate and mail turn back steel
lances as if they were boddle prins?""They tell your ignorance any nonsense that Christian men refuse to
believe," said Henry."I whistle at my work whatever comes uppermost,
like an honest craftsman, and commonly it is the Highlandman's 'Och hone
for Houghman stares!'"Friend, it is but idle to spur a horse when his legs are ham shackled,"
said the Highlander, haughtily."Her own self cannot fight even now, and
there is little gallantry in taunting her thus.""By nails and hammer, you are right there," said the smith, altering his
tone."But speak out at once, friend, what is it thou wouldst have of
me?I am in no humour for dallying.""A hauberk for her chief, Eachin MacIan," said the Highlander."You are a hammer man, you say?said our
smith, producing from a chest the mail shirt on which he had been lately
employed.The Gael handled it with a degree of admiration which had something of
envy in it.He looked curiously at every part of its texture, and at
length declared it the very best piece of armour that he had ever seen."A hundred cows and bullocks and a good drift of sheep would be e'en
ower cheap an offer," said the Highlandman, by way of tentative; "but
her nainsell will never bid thee less, come by them how she can.""It is a fair proffer," replied Henry; "but gold nor gear will never buy
that harness.I want to try my own sword on my own armour, and I will
not give that mail coat to any one but who will face me for the best of
three blows and a thrust in the fair field; and it is your chief's upon
these terms.""Hut, prut, man--take a drink and go to bed," said the Highlander, in
great scorn.Think ye the captain of the Clan Quhele will
be brawling and battling with a bit Perth burgess body like you?Whisht,
man, and hearken.Her nainsell will do ye mair credit than ever belonged
to your kin.She will fight you for the fair harness hersell.""She must first show that she is my match," said Henry, with a grim
smile.I, one of Eachin MacIan's leichtach, and not your match!""You may try me, if you will.Do you know
how to cast a sledge hammer?""Ay, truly--ask the eagle if he can fly over Farragon.""But before you strive with me, you must first try a cast with one of my
leichtach.Here, Dunter, stand forth for the honour of Perth!And now,
Highlandman, there stands a row of hammers; choose which you will, and
let us to the garden."The Highlander whose name was Norman nan Ord, or Norman of the Hammer,
showed his title to the epithet by selecting the largest hammer of the
set, at which Henry smiled.Dunter, the stout journeyman of the smith,
made what was called a prodigious cast; but the Highlander, making a
desperate effort, threw beyond it by two or three feet, and looked with
an air of triumph to Henry, who again smiled in reply.said the Gael, offering our smith the hammer."Not with that child's toy," said Henry, "which has scarce weight to
fly against the wind.Jannekin, fetch me Sampson; or one of you help the
boy, for Sampson is somewhat ponderous."The hammer now produced was half as heavy again as that which the
Highlander had selected as one of unusual weight.Norman stood
astonished; but he was still more so when Henry, taking his position,
swung the ponderous implement far behind his right haunch joint, and
dismissed it from his hand as if it had flown from a warlike engine.The
air groaned and whistled as the mass flew through it.Down at length it
came, and the iron head sunk a foot into the earth, a full yard beyond
the cast of Norman.The Highlander, defeated and mortified, went to the spot where the
weapon lay, lifted it, poised it in his hand with great wonder, and
examined it closely, as if he expected to discover more in it than a
common hammer.He at length returned it to the owner with a melancholy
smile, shrugging his shoulders and shaking his head as the smith asked
him whether he would not mend his cast."Norman has lost too much at the sport already," he replied."She has
lost her own name of the Hammerer.But does her own self, the Gow Chrom,
work at the anvil with that horse's load of iron?""You shall see, brother," said Henry, leading the way to the smithy."Dunter," he said, "rax me that bar from the furnace"; and uplifting
Sampson, as he called the monstrous hammer, he plied the metal with a
hundred strokes from right to left--now with the right hand, now with
the left, now with both, with so much strength at once and dexterity,
that he worked off a small but beautifully proportioned horseshoe in
half the time that an ordinary smith would have taken for the same
purpose, using a more manageable implement.said the Highlander, "and what for would you be fighting
with our young chief, who is far above your standard, though you were
the best smith ever wrought with wind and fire?"said Henry; "you seem a good fellow, and I'll tell you the
truth.Your master has wronged me, and I give him this harness freely
for the chance of fighting him myself.""Nay, if he hath wronged you he must meet you," said the life guardsman."To do a man wrong takes the eagle's feather out of the chief's bonnet;
and were he the first in the Highlands, and to be sure so is Eachin,
he must fight the man he has wronged, or else a rose falls from his
chaplet.""Will you move him to this," said Henry, "after the fight on Sunday?""Oh, her nainsell will do her best, if the hawks have not got her
nainsell's bones to pick; for you must know, brother, that Clan
Chattan's claws pierce rather deep.""The armour is your chief's on that condition," said Henry; "but I will
disgrace him before king and court if he does not pay me the price.""Deil a fear--deil a fear; I will bring him in to the barrace myself,"
said Norman, "assuredly.""You will do me a pleasure," replied Henry; "and that you may remember
your promise, I will bestow on you this dirk.Look--if you hold it
truly, and can strike between the mail hood and the collar of your
enemy, the surgeon will be needless."The Highlander was lavish in his expressions of gratitude, and took his
leave."I have given him the best mail harness I ever wrought," said the smith
to himself, rather repenting his liberality, "for the poor chance
that he will bring his chief into a fair field with me; and then let
Catharine be his who can win her fairly.But much I dread the youth will
find some evasion, unless he have such luck on Palm Sunday as may induce
him to try another combat.That is some hope, however; for I have often,
ere now, seen a raw young fellow shoot up after his first fight from a
dwarf into a giant queller."Thus, with little hope, but with the most determined resolution, Henry
Smith awaited the time that should decide his fate.What made him augur
the worst was the silence both of the glover and of his daughter."They are ashamed," he said, "to confess the truth to me, and therefore
they are silent."Upon the Friday at noon, the two bands of thirty men each, representing
the contending clans, arrived at the several points where they were to
halt for refreshments.The Clan Quhele was entertained hospitably at the rich abbey of Scone,
while the provost regaled their rivals at his Castle of Kinfauns, the
utmost care being taken to treat both parties with the most punctilious
attention, and to afford neither an opportunity of complaining of
partiality.All points of etiquette were, in the mean while, discussed
and settled by the Lord High Constable Errol and the young Earl of
Crawford, the former acting on the part of the Clan Chattan and the
latter patronising the Clan Quhele.Messengers were passing continually
from the one earl to the other, and they held more than: six meetings
within thirty hours, before the ceremonial of the field could be exactly
arranged.Meanwhile, in case of revival of ancient quarrel, many seeds of
which existed betwixt the burghers and their mountain neighbours, a
proclamation commanded the citizens not to approach within half a mile
of the place where the Highlanders were quartered; while on their part
the intended combatants were prohibited from approaching Perth without
special license.Troops were stationed to enforce this order, who did
their charge so scrupulously as to prevent Simon Glover himself, burgess
and citizen of Perth, from approaching the town, because he owned having
come thither at the same time with the champions of Eachin MacIan, and
wore a plaid around him of their check or pattern.This interruption
prevented Simon from seeking out Henry Wynd and possessing him with a
true knowledge of all that had happened since their separation, which
intercourse, had it taken place, must have materially altered the
catastrophe of our narrative.On Saturday afternoon another arrival took place, which interested the
city almost as much as the preparations for the expected combat.This
was the approach of the Earl Douglas, who rode through the town with a
troop of only thirty horse, but all of whom were knights and gentlemen
of the first consequence.Men's eyes followed this dreaded peer as they
pursue the flight of an eagle through the clouds, unable to ken the
course of the bird of Jove yet silent, attentive, and as earnest in
observing him as if they could guess the object for which he sweeps
through the firmament; He rode slowly through the city, and passed out
at the northern gate.He next alighted at the Dominican convent and
desired to see the Duke of Albany.The Earl was introduced instantly,
and received by the Duke with a manner which was meant to be graceful
and conciliatory, but which could not conceal both art and inquietude.When the first greetings were over, the Earl said with great gravity:
"I bring you melancholy news.Your Grace's royal nephew, the Duke of
Rothsay, is no more, and I fear hath perished by some foul practices."said the Duke' in confusion--"what practices?Who dared
practise on the heir of the Scottish throne?""'Tis not for me to state how these doubts arise," said Douglas; "but
men say the eagle was killed with an arrow fledged from his own wing,
and the oak trunk rent by a wedge of the same wood.""Earl of Douglas," said the Duke of Albany, "I am no reader of riddles.""Nor am I a propounder of them," said Douglas, haughtily, "Your Grace
will find particulars in these papers worthy of perusal.I will go for
half an hour to the cloister garden, and then rejoin you.""You go not to the King, my lord?""No," answered Douglas; "I trust your Grace will agree with me that we
should conceal this great family misfortune from our sovereign till the
business of tomorrow be decided.""If the King heard of this loss, he
could not witness the combat; and if he appear not in person, these men
are likely to refuse to fight, and the whole work is cast loose.But
I pray you sit down, my lord, while I read these melancholy papers
respecting poor Rothsay."He passed the papers through his hands, turning some over with a hasty
glance, and dwelling on others as if their contents had been of the
last importance.When he had spent nearly a quarter of an hour in this
manner, he raised his eyes, and said very gravely: "My lord, in these
most melancholy documents, it is yet a comfort to see nothing which can
renew the divisions in the King's councils, which were settled by the
last solemn agreement between your lordship and myself.My unhappy
nephew was by that agreement to be set aside, until time should send him
a graver judgment.He is now removed by Fate, and our purpose in that
matter is anticipated and rendered unnecessary.""If your Grace," replied the Earl, "sees nothing to disturb the good
understanding which the tranquillity and safety of Scotland require
should exist between us, I am not so ill a friend of my country as to
look closely for such.""I understand you, my Lord of Douglas," said Albany, eagerly."You
hastily judged that I should be offended with your lordship for
exercising your powers of lieutenancy, and punishing the detestable
murderers within my territory of Falkland.Credit me, on the contrary, I
am obliged to your lordship for taking out of my hands the punishment of
these wretches, as it would have broken my heart even to have looked
on them.The Scottish Parliament will inquire, doubtless, into this
sacrilegious deed; and happy am I that the avenging sword has been
in the hand of a man so important as your lordship.Our communication
together, as your lordship must well recollect, bore only concerning a
proposed restraint of my unfortunate nephew until the advance of a year
or two had taught him discretion?""Such was certainly your Grace's purpose, as expressed to me," said the
Earl; "I can safely avouch it.""Why, then, noble earl, we cannot be censured because villains, for
their own revengeful ends, appear to have engrafted a bloody termination
on our honest purpose?""The Parliament will judge it after their wisdom," said Douglas."For my
part, my conscience acquits me.""And mine assoilzies me," said the Duke with solemnity."Now, my lord,
touching the custody of the boy James, who succeeds to his father's
claims of inheritance?""The King must decide it," said Douglas, impatient of the conference."I will consent to his residence anywhere save at Stirling, Doune, or
Falkland.""He is gone," muttered the crafty Albany, "and he must be my ally, yet
feels himself disposed to be my mortal foe.No matter, Rothsay sleeps
with his fathers, James may follow in time, and then--a crown is the
recompense of my perplexities."Thretty for thretty faucht in barreris,
     At Sanct Johnstoun on a day besyde the black freris.At an earlier period of the Christian Church,
the use of any of the days of Passion Week for the purpose of combat
would have been accounted a profanity worthy of excommunication.The
Church of Rome, to her infinite honour, had decided that during the holy
season of Easter, when the redemption of man from his fallen state was
accomplished, the sword of war should be sheathed, and angry monarchs
should respect the season termed the Truce of God.The ferocious
violence of the latter wars betwixt Scotland and England had destroyed
all observance of this decent and religious Ordinance.Very often the
most solemn occasions were chosen by one party for an attack, because
they hoped to find the other engaged in religious duties and unprovided
for defence.Thus the truce, once considered as proper to the season,
had been discontinued; and it became not unusual even to select the
sacred festivals of the church for decision of the trial by combat, to
which this intended contest bore a considerable resemblance.On the present occasion, however, the duties of the day were observed
with the usual solemnity, and the combatants themselves took share in
them.Bearing branches of yew in their hands, as the readiest substitute
for palm boughs, they marched respectively to the Dominican and
Carthusian convents, to hear High Mass, and, by a show at least of
devotion, to prepare themselves for the bloody strife of the day.Great
care had of course been taken that, during this march, they should not
even come within the sound of each other's bagpipes; for it was certain
that, like game cocks exchanging mutual notes of defiance, they would
have sought out and attacked each other before they arrived at the place
of combat.The citizens of Perth crowded to see the unusual procession on the
streets, and thronged the churches where the two clans attended their
devotions, to witness their behaviour, and to form a judgment from
their appearance which was most likely to obtain the advantage in
the approaching conflict.Their demeanour in the church, although not
habitual frequenters of places of devotion, was perfectly decorous; and,
notwithstanding their wild and untamed dispositions, there were few of
the mountaineers who seemed affected either with curiosity or wonder.They appeared to think it beneath their dignity of character to testify
either curiosity or surprise at many things which were probably then
presented to them for the first time.On the issue of the combat, few even of the most competent judges dared
venture a prediction; although the great size of Torquil and his eight
stalwart sons induced some who professed themselves judges of the thewes
and sinews of men to incline to ascribe the advantage to the party of
the Clan Quhele.The opinion of the female sex was much decided by
the handsome form, noble countenance, and gallant demeanour of Eachin
MacIan.There were more than one who imagined they had recollection
of his features, but his splendid military attire rendered the humble
glover's apprentice unrecognisable in the young Highland chief, saving
by one person.That person, as may well be supposed, was the Smith of the Wynd, who
had been the foremost in the crowd that thronged to see the gallant
champions of Clan Quhele.It was with mingled feelings of dislike,
jealousy, and something approaching to admiration that he saw the
glover's apprentice stripped of his mean slough, and blazing forth as a
chieftain, who, by his quick eye and gallant demeanour, the noble shape
of his brow and throat, his splendid arms and well proportioned limbs,
seemed well worthy to hold the foremost rank among men selected to live
or die for the honour of their race.The smith could hardly think that
he looked upon the same passionate boy whom he had brushed off as
he might a wasp that stung him, and, in mere compassion, forebore to
despatch by treading on him."He looks it gallantly with my noble hauberk," thus muttered Henry to
himself, "the best I ever wrought.Yet, if he and I stood together where
there was neither hand to help nor eye to see, by all that is blessed in
this holy church, the good harness should return to its owner!All that
I am worth would I give for three fair blows on his shoulders to undo my
own best work; but such happiness will never be mine.If he escape from
the conflict, it will be with so high a character for courage, that he
may well disdain to put his fortune, in its freshness, to the risk of
an encounter with a poor burgess like myself.He will fight by his
champion, and turn me over to my fellow craftsman the hammerer, when all
I can reap will be the pleasure of knocking a Highland bullock on the
head.I will to the other church in
quest of him, since for sure he must have come down from the Highlands."The congregation was moving from the church of the Dominicans when the
smith formed this determination, which he endeavoured to carry into
speedy execution, by thrusting through the crowd as hastily as the
solemnity of the place and occasion would permit.In making his way
through the press, he was at one instant carried so close to Eachin
that their eyes encountered.The smith's hardy and embrowned countenance
 up like the heated iron on which he wrought, and retained
its dark red hue for several minutes.Eachin's features glowed with a
brighter blush of indignation, and a glance of fiery hatred was shot
from his eyes.But the sudden flush died away in ashy paleness, and his
gaze instantly avoided the unfriendly but steady look with which it was
encountered.Torquil, whose eye never quitted his foster son, saw his emotion, and
looked anxiously around to discover the cause.But Henry was already
at a distance, and hastening on his way to the Carthusian convent.Here
also the religious service of the day was ended; and those who had so
lately borne palms in honour of the great event which brought peace
on earth and goodwill to the children of men were now streaming to
the place of combat--some prepared to take the lives of their fellow
creatures or to lose their own, others to view the deadly strife with
the savage delight which the heathens took in the contests of their
gladiators.The crowd was so great that any other person might well have despaired
of making way through it.But the general deference entertained for
Henry of the Wynd, as the champion of Perth, and the universal sense of
his ability to force a passage, induced all to unite in yielding room
for him, so that he was presently quite close to the warriors of the
Clan Chattan.Their pipers marched at the head of their column.Next
followed the well known banner, displaying a mountain cat rampant, with
the appropriate caution, "Touch not the cat, but (i.e.The chief followed with his two handed sword advanced, as if to
protect the emblem of the tribe.He was a man of middle stature, more
than fifty years old, but betraying neither in features nor form any
decay of strength or symptoms of age.His dark red close curled locks
were in part chequered by a few grizzled hairs, but his step and gesture
were as light in the dance, in the chase, or in the battle as if he had
not passed his thirtieth year.His grey eye gleamed with a wild light
expressive of valour and ferocity mingled; but wisdom and experience
dwelt on the expression of his forehead, eyebrows, and lips.The chosen
champions followed by two and two.There was a cast of anxiety on
several of their faces, for they had that morning discovered the absence
of one of their appointed number; and, in a contest so desperate as was
expected, the loss seemed a matter of importance to all save to their
high mettled chief, MacGillie Chattanach."Say nothing to the Saxons of his absence," said this bold leader, when
the diminution of his force was reported to him."The false Lowland
tongues might say that one of Clan Chattan was a coward, and perhaps
that the rest favoured his escape, in order to have a pretence to avoid
the battle.I am sure that Ferquhard Day will be found in the ranks ere
we are ready for battle; or, if he should not, am not I man enough for
two of the Clan Quhele?or would we not fight them fifteen to thirty,
rather than lose the renown that this day will bring us?"The tribe received the brave speech of their leader with applause, yet
there were anxious looks thrown out in hopes of espying the return of
the deserter; and perhaps the chief himself was the only one of the
determined band who was totally indifferent on the subject.They marched on through the streets without seeing anything of Ferquhard
Day, who, many a mile beyond the mountains, was busied in receiving such
indemnification as successful love could bestow for the loss of honour.MacGillie Chattanach marched on without seeming to observe the absence
of the deserter, and entered upon the North Inch, a beautiful and level
plain, closely adjacent to the city, and appropriated to the martial
exercises of the inhabitants.The plain is washed on one side by the deep and swelling Tay.There was
erected within it a strong palisade, inclosing on three sides a space of
one hundred and fifty yards in length and seventy-four yards in width.The fourth side of the lists was considered as sufficiently fenced
by the river.An amphitheatre for the accommodation of spectators
surrounded the palisade, leaving a large space free to be occupied by
armed men on foot and horseback, and for the more ordinary class of
spectators.At the extremity of the lists which was nearest to the city,
there was a range of elevated galleries for the King and his courtiers,
so highly decorated with rustic treillage, intermingled with gilded
ornaments, that the spot retains to this day the name of the Golden, or
Gilded, Arbour.The mountain minstrelsy, which sounded the appropriate pibrochs or
battle tunes of the rival confederacies, was silent when they entered on
the Inch, for such was the order which had been given.Two stately but
aged warriors, each bearing the banner of his tribe, advanced to the
opposite extremities of the lists, and, pitching their standards into
the earth, prepared to be spectators of a fight in which they were not
to join.The pipers, who were also to be neutral in the strife, took
their places by their respective brattachs.The multitude received both bands with the same general shout with which
on similar occasions they welcome those from whose exertion they expect
amusement, or what they term sport.The destined combatants returned
no answer to this greeting, but each party advanced to the opposite
extremities of the lists, where were entrances by which they were to be
admitted to the interior.A strong body of men at arms guarded either
access; and the Earl Marshal at the one and the Lord High Constable at
the other carefully examined each individual, to see whether he had the
appropriate arms, being steel cap, mail shirt, two handed sword, and
dagger.They also examined the numbers of each party; and great was the
alarm among the multitude when the Earl of Errol held up his hand and
cried: "Ho!The combat cannot proceed, for the Clan Chattan lack one of
their number."said the young Earl of Crawford; "they should have
counted better ere they left home."The Earl Marshal, however, agreed with the Constable that the fight
could not proceed until the inequality should be removed; and a general
apprehension was excited in the assembled multitude that, after all the
preparation, there would be no battle.Of all present there were only two perhaps who rejoiced at the prospect
of the combat being adjourned, and these were the captain of the Clan
Quhele and the tender hearted King Robert.Meanwhile the two chiefs,
each attended by a special friend and adviser, met in the midst of the
lists, having, to assist them in determining what was to be done, the
Earl Marshal, the Lord High Constable, the Earl of Crawford, and Sir
Patrick Charteris.The chief of the Clan Chattan declared himself
willing and desirous of fighting upon the spot, without regard to the
disparity of numbers."That," said Torquil of the Oak, "Clan Quhele will never consent to.You can never win honour from us with the sword, and you seek but a
subterfuge, that you may say when you are defeated, as you know you will
be, that it was for want of the number of your band fully counted out.But I make a proposal: Ferquhard Day was the youngest of your band,
Eachin MacIan is the youngest of ours; we will set him aside in place of
the man who has fled from the combat.""A most unjust and unequal proposal," exclaimed Toshach Beg, the second,
as he might be termed, of MacGillie Chattanach."The life of the chief
is to the clan the breath of our nostrils, nor will we ever consent that
our chief shall be exposed to dangers which the captain of Clan Quhele
does not share."Torquil saw with deep anxiety that his plan was about to fail when the
objection was made to Hector's being withdrawn from the battle, and
he was meditating how to support his proposal, when Eachin himself
interfered.His timidity, it must be observed, was not of that sordid
and selfish nature which induces those who are infected by it calmly
to submit to dishonour rather than risk danger.On the contrary, he was
morally brave, though constitutionally timid, and the shame of avoiding
the combat became at the moment more powerful than the fear of facing
it."I will not hear," he said, "of a scheme which will leave my sword
sheathed during this day's glorious combat.If I am young in arms, there
are enough of brave men around me whom I may imitate if I cannot equal."He spoke these words in a spirit which imposed on Torquil, and perhaps
on the young chief himself."I was sure the foul spell would be broken through, and that the tardy
spirit which besieged him would fly at the sound of the pipe and the
first flutter of the brattach!""Hear me, Lord Marshal," said the Constable."The hour of combat may not
be much longer postponed, for the day approaches to high noon.Let the
chief of Clan Chattan take the half hour which remains, to find, if he
can, a substitute for this deserter; if he cannot, let them fight as
they stand.""Content I am," said the Marshal, "though, as none of his own clan are
nearer than fifty miles, I see not how MacGillis Chattanach is to find
an auxiliary.""That is his business," said the High Constable; "but, if he offers a
high reward, there are enough of stout yeomen surrounding the lists,
who will be glad enough to stretch their limbs in such a game as is
expected.I myself, did my quality and charge permit, would blythely
take a turn of work amongst these wild fellows, and think it fame won."They communicated their decision to the Highlanders, and the chief of
the Clan Chattan replied: "You have judged unpartially and nobly, my
lords, and I deem myself obliged to follow your direction.So make
proclamation, heralds, that, if any one will take his share with Clan
Chattan of the honours and chances of this day, he shall have present
payment of a gold crown, and liberty to fight to the death in my ranks.""You are something chary of your treasure, chief," said the Earl
Marshal: "a gold crown is poor payment for such a campaign as is before
you.""If there be any man willing to fight for honour," replied MacGillis
Chattanach, "the price will be enough; and I want not the service of a
fellow who draws his sword for gold alone."The heralds had made their progress, moving half way round the lists,
stopping from time to time to make proclamation as they had been
directed, without the least apparent disposition on the part of any one
to accept of the proffered enlistment.Some sneered at the poverty of
the Highlanders, who set so mean a price upon such a desperate service.Others affected resentment, that they should esteem the blood of
citizens so lightly.None showed the slightest intention to undertake
the task proposed, until the sound of the proclamation reached Henry of
the Wynd, as he stood without the barrier, speaking from time to time
with Baillie Craigdallie, or rather listening vaguely to what the
magistrate was saying to him."A liberal offer on the part of MacGillie Chattanach," said the host of
the Griffin, "who proposes a gold crown to any one who will turn wildcat
for the day, and be killed a little in his service!exclaimed the smith, eagerly, "do they make proclamation for a
man to fight against the Clan Quhele?""Ay, marry do they," said Griffin; "but I think they will find no such
fools in Perth."He had hardly said the word, when he beheld the smith clear the barriers
at a single bound and alight in the lists, saying: "Here am I, sir
herald, Henry of the Wynd, willing to battle on the part of the Clan
Chattan."A cry of admiration ran through the multitude, while the grave burghers,
not being able to conceive the slightest reason for Henry's behaviour,
concluded that his head must be absolutely turned with the love of
fighting."Thou art mad," he said, "Henry!Thou hast neither two handed sword nor
shirt of mail.""Truly no," said Henry, "for I parted with a mail shirt, which I had
made for myself, to yonder gay chief of the Clan Quhele, who will soon
find on his shoulders with what sort of blows I clink my rivets!As for
two handed sword, why, this boy's brand will serve my turn till I can
master a heavier one.""This must not be," said Errol."Hark thee, armourer, by St.Mary, thou
shalt have my Milan hauberk and good Spanish sword.""I thank your noble earlship, Sir Gilbert Hay, but the yoke with which
your brave ancestor turned the battle at Loncarty would serve my turn
well enough.I am little used to sword or harness that I have not
wrought myself, because I do not well know what blows the one will bear
out without being cracked or the other lay on without snapping."The cry had in the mean while run through the multitude and passed into
the town, that the dauntless smith was about to fight without armour,
when, just as the fated hour was approaching, the shrill voice of a
female was heard screaming for passage through the crowd.The multitude
gave place to her importunity, and she advanced, breathless with haste
under the burden of a mail hauberk and a large two handed sword.The
widow of Oliver Proudfute was soon recognised, and the arms which she
bore were those of the smith himself, which, occupied by her husband on
the fatal evening when he was murdered, had been naturally conveyed
to his house with the dead body, and were now, by the exertions of
his grateful widow, brought to the lists at a moment when such proved
weapons were of the last consequence to their owner.Henry joyfully
received the well known arms, and the widow with trembling haste
assisted in putting them on, and then took leave of him, saying: "God
for the champion of the widow and orphan, and ill luck to all who come
before him!"Confident at feeling himself in his well proved armour, Henry shook
himself as if to settle the steel shirt around him, and, unsheathing
the two handed sword, made it flourish over his head, cutting the air
through which it whistled in the form of the figure eight with an ease
and sleight of hand that proved how powerfully and skilfully he could
wield the ponderous weapon.The champions were now ordered to march
in their turns around the lists, crossing so as to avoid meeting each
other, and making obeisance as they passed the Golden Arbour where the
King was seated.While this course was performing, most of the spectators were again
curiously comparing the stature, limbs, and sinews of the two parties,
and endeavouring to form a conjecture an to the probable issue of the
combat.The feud of a hundred years, with all its acts of aggression
and retaliation, was concentrated in the bosom of each combatant.Their
countenances seemed fiercely writhen into the wildest expression of
pride, hate, and a desperate purpose of fighting to the very last.The spectators murmured a joyful applause, in high wrought expectation
of the bloody game.Wagers were offered and accepted both on the general
issue of the conflict and on the feats of particular champions.The
clear, frank, and elated look of Henry Smith rendered him a general
favourite among the spectators, and odds, to use the modern expression,
were taken that he would kill three of his opponents before he himself
fell.Scarcely was the smith equipped for the combat, when the commands of the
chiefs ordered the champions into their places; and at the same moment
Henry heard the voice of Simon Glover issuing from the crowd, who were
now silent with expectation, and calling on him: "Harry Smith--Harry
Smith, what madness hath possessed thee?""Ay, he wishes to save his hopeful son in law that is, or is to be, from
the smith's handling," was Henry's first thought; his second was to turn
and speak with him; and his third, that he could on no pretext desert
the band which he had joined, or even seem desirous to delay the fight,
consistently with honour.He turned himself, therefore, to the business of the hour.Both parties
were disposed by the respective chiefs in three lines, each containing
ten men.They were arranged with such intervals between each individual
as offered him scope to wield his sword, the blade of which was five
feet long, not including the handle.The second and third lines were
to come up as reserves, in case the first experienced disaster.On the
right of the array of Clan Quhele, the chief, Eachin MacIan, placed
himself in the second line betwixt two of his foster brothers.Four of
them occupied the right of the first line, whilst the father and
two others protected the rear of the beloved chieftain.Torquil, in
particular, kept close behind, for the purpose of covering him.Thus
Eachin stood in the centre of nine of the strongest men of his band,
having four especial defenders in front, one on each hand, and three in
his rear.The line of the Clan Chattan was arranged in precisely the same order,
only that the chief occupied the centre of the middle rank, instead of
being on the extreme right.This induced Henry Smith, who saw in the
opposing bands only one enemy, and that was the unhappy Eachin, to
propose placing himself on the left of the front rank of the Clan
Chattan.But the leader disapproved of this arrangement; and having
reminded Henry that he owed him obedience, as having taken wages at his
hand, he commanded him to occupy the space in the third line immediately
behind himself--a post of honour, certainly, which Henry could not
decline, though he accepted of it with reluctance.When the clans were thus drawn up opposed to each other, they intimated
their feudal animosity and their eagerness to engage by a wild scream,
which, uttered by the Clan Quhele, was answered and echoed back by
the Clan Chattan, the whole at the same time shaking their swords and
menacing each other, as if they meant to conquer the imagination of
their opponents ere they mingled in the actual strife.At this trying moment, Torquil, who had never feared for himself, was
agitated with alarm on the part of his dault, yet consoled by observing
that he kept a determined posture, and that the few words which he spoke
to his clan were delivered boldly, and well calculated to animate them
to combat, as expressing his resolution to partake their fate in death
or victory.The trumpets
of the King sounded a charge, the bagpipes blew up their screaming and
maddening notes, and the combatants, starting forward in regular order,
and increasing their pace till they came to a smart run, met together
in the centre of the ground, as a furious land torrent encounters an
advancing tide.For an instant or two the front lines, hewing at each other with their
long swords, seemed engaged in a succession of single combats; but the
second and third ranks soon came up on either side, actuated alike by
the eagerness of hatred and the thirst of honour, pressed through the
intervals, and rendered the scene a tumultuous chaos, over which the
huge swords rose and sunk, some still glittering, others streaming with
blood, appearing, from the wild rapidity with which they were swayed,
rather to be put in motion by some complicated machinery than to
be wielded by human hands.Some of the combatants, too much crowded
together to use those long weapons, had already betaken themselves to
their poniards, and endeavoured to get within the sword sweep of those
opposed to them.In the mean time, blood flowed fast, and the groans of
those who fell began to mingle with the cries of those who fought; for,
according to the manner of the Highlanders at all times, they could
hardly be said to shout, but to yell.Those of the spectators whose
eyes were best accustomed to such scenes of blood and confusion could
nevertheless discover no advantage yet acquired by either party.The
conflict swayed, indeed, at different intervals forwards or backwards,
but it was only in momentary superiority, which the party who acquired
it almost instantly lost by a corresponding exertion on the other side.The wild notes of the pipers were still heard above the tumult, and
stimulated to farther exertions the fury of the combatants.At once, however, and as if by mutual agreement, the instruments sounded
a retreat; it was expressed in wailing notes, which seemed to imply a
dirge for the fallen.The two parties disengaged themselves from each
other, to take breath for a few minutes.The eyes of the spectators
greedily surveyed the shattered array of the combatants as they drew
off from the contest, but found it still impossible to decide which had
sustained the greater loss.It seemed as if the Clan Chattan had lost
rather fewer men than their antagonists; but in compensation, the bloody
plaids and skirts of their party (for several on both sides had thrown
their mantles away) showed more wounded men than the Clan Quhele.About
twenty of both sides lay on the field dead or dying; and arms and legs
lopped off, heads cleft to the chin, slashes deep through the shoulder
into the breast, showed at once the fury of the combat, the ghastly
character of the weapons used, and the fatal strength of the arms which
wielded them.The chief of the Clan Chattan had behaved himself with
the most determined courage, and was slightly wounded.Eachin also had
fought with spirit, surrounded by his bodyguard.His sword was bloody,
his bearing bold and warlike; and he smiled when old Torquil, folding
him in his arms, loaded him with praises and with blessings.The two chiefs, after allowing their followers to breathe for the space
of about ten minutes, again drew up in their files, diminished by nearly
one third of their original number.They now chose their ground nearer
to the river than that on which they had formerly encountered, which
was encumbered with the wounded and the slain.Some of the former were
observed, from time to time, to raise themselves to gain a glimpse of
the field, and sink back, most of them to die from the effusion of blood
which poured from the terrific gashes inflicted by the claymore.Harry Smith was easily distinguished by his Lowland habit, as well as
his remaining on the spot where they had first encountered, where he
stood leaning on a sword beside a corpse, whose bonneted head, carried
to ten yards' distance from the body by the force of the blow which had
swept it off, exhibited the oak leaf, the appropriate ornament of the
bodyguard of Eachin MacIan.Since he slew this man, Henry had not struck
a blow, but had contented himself with warding off many that were dealt
at himself, and some which were aimed at the chief.MacGillie Chattanach
became alarmed, when, having given the signal that his men should again
draw together, he observed that his powerful recruit remained at a
distance from the ranks, and showed little disposition to join them."Can so strong a body have a mean
and cowardly spirit?"You as good as called me hireling but now," replied Henry."If I am
such," pointing to the headless corpse, "I have done enough for my day's
wage.""He that serves me without counting his hours," replied the chief, "I
reward him without reckoning wages.""Then," said the smith, "I fight as a volunteer, and in the post which
best likes me.""All that is at your own discretion," replied MacGillis Chattanach, who
saw the prudence of humouring an auxiliary of such promise."It is enough," said Henry; and, shouldering his heavy weapon, he joined
the rest of the combatants with alacrity, and placed himself opposite to
the chief of the Clan Quhele.It was then, for the first time, that Eachin showed some uncertainty.He had long looked up to Henry as the best combatant which Perth and its
neighbourhood could bring into the lists.His hatred to him as a rival
was mingled with recollection of the ease with which he had once, though
unarmed, foiled his own sudden and desperate attack; and when he beheld
him with his eyes fixed in his direction, the dripping sword in his
hand, and obviously meditating an attack on him individually, his
courage fell, and he gave symptoms of wavering, which did not escape his
foster father.It was lucky for Eachin that Torquil was incapable, from the formation
of his own temper, and that of those with whom he had lived, to conceive
the idea of one of his own tribe, much less of his chief and foster
son, being deficient in animal courage.Could he have imagined this, his
grief and rage might have driven him to the fierce extremity of taking
Eachin's life, to save him from staining his honour.But his mind
rejected the idea that his dault was a personal coward, as something
which was monstrous and unnatural.That he was under the influence of
enchantment was a solution which superstition had suggested, and he now
anxiously, but in a whisper, demanded of Hector: "Does the spell now
darken thy spirit, Eachin?""Yes, wretch that I am," answered the unhappy youth; "and yonder stands
the fell enchanter!"exclaimed Torquil, "and you wear harness of his making?Norman,
miserable boy, why brought you that accursed mail?""If my arrow has flown astray, I can but shoot my life after it,"
answered Norman nan Ord."Stand firm, you shall see me break the spell.""Yes, stand firm," said Torquil."He may be a fell enchanter; but my own
ear has heard, and my own tongue has told, that Eachin shall leave the
battle whole, free, and unwounded; let us see the Saxon wizard who can
gainsay that.He may be a strong man, but the fair forest of the oak
shall fall, stock and bough, ere he lay a finger on my dault.Ring
around him, my sons; bas air son Eachin!"The sons of Torquil shouted back the words, which signify, "Death for
Hector."Encouraged by their devotion, Eachin renewed his spirit, and called
boldly to the minstrels of his clan, "Seid suas" that is, "Strike up."The wild pibroch again sounded the onset; but the two parties approached
each other more slowly than at first, as men who knew and respected
each other's valour.Henry Wynd, in his impatience to begin the contest,
advanced before the Clan Chattan and signed to Eachin to come on.Norman, however, sprang forward to cover his foster brother, and there
was a general, though momentary, pause, as if both parties were willing
to obtain an omen of the fate of the day from the event of this duel.The Highlander advanced, with his large sword uplifted, as in act to
strike; but, just as he came within sword's length, he dropt the long
and cumbrous weapon, leapt lightly over the smith's sword, as he fetched
a cut at him, drew his dagger, and, being thus within Henry's guard,
struck him with the weapon (his own gift) on the side of the throat,
directing the blow downwards into the chest, and calling aloud, at the
same time, "You taught me the stab!"But Henry Wynd wore his own good hauberk, doubly defended with a lining
of tempered steel.Had he been less surely armed, his combats had been
ended for ever.Even as it was, he was slightly wounded.he replied, striking Norman a blow with the pommel of his long
sword, which made him stagger backwards, "you were taught the thrust,
but not the parry"; and, fetching a blow at his antagonist, which cleft
his skull through the steel cap, he strode over the lifeless body to
engage the young chief, who now stood open before him.But the sonorous voice of Torquil thundered out, "Far eil air son
Eachin!"and the two brethren who flanked their
chief on each side thrust forward upon Henry, and, striking both at
once, compelled him to keep the defensive.cried MacGillie Chattanach."Save the
brave Saxon; let these kites feel your talons!"Already much wounded, the chief dragged himself up to the smith's
assistance, and cut down one of the leichtach, by whom he was assailed.Henry's own good sword rid him of the other.answered two more of his
devoted sons, and opposed themselves to the fury of the smith and those
who had come to his aid; while Eachin, moving towards the left wing of
the battle, sought less formidable adversaries, and again, by some show
of valour, revived the sinking hopes of his followers.The two children
of the oak, who had covered, this movement, shared the fate of their
brethren; for the cry of the Clan Chattan chief had drawn to that part
of the field some of his bravest warriors.The sons of Torquil did not
fall unavenged, but left dreadful marks of their swords on the persons
of the dead and living.But the necessity of keeping their most
distinguished soldiers around the person of their chief told to
disadvantage on the general event of the combat; and so few were now
the number who remained fighting, that it was easy to see that the Clan
Chattan had fifteen of their number left, though most of them wounded,
and that of the Clan Quhele only about ten remained, of whom there were
four of the chief's bodyguard, including Torquil himself.They fought and struggled on, however, and as their strength decayed,
their fury seemed to increase.Henry Wynd, now wounded in many places,
was still bent on breaking through, or exterminating, the band of bold
hearts who continued to fight around the object of his animosity.But still the father's shout of "Another for Hector!"was cheerfully
answered by the fatal countersign, "Death for Hector!"and though the
Clan Quhele were now outnumbered, the combat seemed still dubious.It
was bodily lassitude alone that again compelled them to another pause.The Clan Chattan were then observed to be twelve in number, but two or
three were scarce able to stand without leaning on their swords.Five
were left of the Clan Quhele; Torquil and his youngest son were of the
number, both slightly wounded.Eachin alone had, from the vigilance
used to intercept all blows levelled against his person, escaped without
injury.The rage of both parties had sunk, through exhaustion, into
sullen desperation.They walked staggering, as if in their sleep,
through the carcasses of the slain, and gazed on them, as if again to
animate their hatred towards their surviving enemies by viewing the
friends they had lost.The multitude soon after beheld the survivors of the desperate conflict
drawing together to renew the exterminating feud on the banks of the
river, as the spot least slippery with blood, and less encumbered with
the bodies of the slain."For God's sake--for the sake of the mercy which we daily pray for,"
said the kind hearted old King to the Duke of Albany, "let this be
ended!Wherefore should these wretched rags and remnants of humanity be
suffered to complete their butchery?Surely they will now be ruled, and
accept of peace on moderate terms?""Compose yourself, my liege," said his brother."These men are the pest
of the Lowlands.Both chiefs are still living; if they go back unharmed,
the whole day's work is cast away.Remember your promise to the council,
that you would not cry 'hold.'""You compel me to a great crime, Albany, both as a king, who should
protect his subjects, and as a Christian man, who respects the brother
of his faith.""You judge wrong, my lord," said the Duke: "these are not loving
subjects, but disobedient rebels, as my Lord of Crawford can bear
witness; and they are still less Christian men, for the prior of the
Dominicans will vouch for me that they are more than half heathen.""You must work your pleasure, and are too wise
for me to contend with.I can but turn away and shut my eyes from the
sights and sounds of a carnage which makes me sicken.But well I know
that God will punish me even for witnessing this waste of human life.""Sound, trumpets," said Albany; "their wounds will stiffen if they dally
longer."While this was passing, Torquil was embracing and encouraging his young
chief."Resist the witchcraft but a few minutes longer!Be of good cheer, you
will come off without either scar or scratch, wem or wound."How can I be of good cheer," said Eachin, "while my brave kinsmen have
one by one died at my feet--died all for me, who could never deserve the
least of their kindness?""And for what were they born, save to die for their chief?""Why lament that the arrow returns not to the
quiver, providing it hit the mark?Here are Tormot and I
but little hurt, while the wildcats drag themselves through the plain
as if they were half throttled by the terriers.Yet one brave stand, and
the day shall be your own, though it may well be that you alone remain
alive.The pipers on both sides blew their charge, and the combatants again
mingled in battle, not indeed with the same strength, but with unabated
inveteracy.They were joined by those whose duty it was to have remained
neuter, but who now found themselves unable to do so.The two old
champions who bore the standards had gradually advanced from the
extremity of the lists, and now approached close to the immediate scene
of action.When they beheld the carnage more nearly, they were mutually
impelled by the desire to revenge their brethren, or not to survive
them.They attacked each other furiously with the lances to which the
standards were attached, closed after exchanging several deadly thrusts,
then grappled in close strife, still holding their banners, until at
length, in the eagerness of their conflict, they fell together into the
Tay, and were found drowned after the combat, closely locked in each
other's arms.The fury of battle, the frenzy of rage and despair,
infected next the minstrels.The two pipers, who, during the conflict,
had done their utmost to keep up the spirits of their brethren, now saw
the dispute well nigh terminated for want of men to support it.They
threw down their instruments, rushed desperately upon each other with
their daggers, and each being more intent on despatching his opponent
than in defending himself, the piper of Clan Quhele was almost instantly
slain and he of Clan Chattan mortally wounded.The last, nevertheless,
again grasped his instrument, and the pibroch of the clan yet poured
its expiring notes over the Clan Chattan, while the dying minstrel had
breath to inspire it.The instrument which he used, or at least that
part of it called the chanter, is preserved in the family of a Highland
chief to this day, and is much honoured under the name of the federan
dhu, or, "black chanter."'Meanwhile, in the final charge, young Tormot, devoted, like his
brethren, by his father Torquil to the protection of his chief, had
been mortally wounded by the unsparing sword of the smith.The other
two remaining of the Clan Quhele had also fallen, and Torquil, with his
foster son and the wounded Tormot, forced to retreat before eight or ten
of the Clan Chattan, made a stand on the bank of the river, while their
enemies were making such exertions as their wounds would permit to come
up with them.Torquil had just reached the spot where he had resolved
to make the stand, when the young Tormot dropped and expired.His death
drew from his father the first and only sigh which he had breathed
throughout the eventful day.he said, "my youngest and dearest!But if I save
Hector, I save all.Now, my darling dault, I have done for thee all that
man may, excepting the last.Let me undo the clasps of that ill omened
armour, and do thou put on that of Tormot; it is light, and will fit
thee well.While you do so, I will rush on these crippled men, and make
what play with them I can.I trust I shall have but little to do, for
they are following each other like disabled steers.At least, darling of
my soul, if I am unable to save thee, I can show thee how a man should
die."While Torquil thus spoke, he unloosed the clasps of the young chief's
hauberk, in the simple belief that he could thus break the meshes which
fear and necromancy had twined about his heart."My father--my father--my more than parent," said the unhappy Eachin,
"stay with me!With you by my side, I feel I can fight to the last.""It is impossible," said Torquil."I will stop them coming up, while you
put on the hauberk.God eternally bless thee, beloved of my soul!"And then, brandishing his sword, Torquil of the Oak rushed forward
with the same fatal war cry which had so often sounded over that bloody
field, "Bas air son Eachin!"The words rung three times in a voice of
thunder; and each time that he cried his war shout he struck down one of
the Clan Chattan as he met them successively straggling towards him."Brave battle, hawk--well flown, falcon!"exclaimed the multitude,
as they witnessed exertions which seemed, even at this last hour, to
threaten a change of the fortunes of the day.Suddenly these cries were
hushed into silence, and succeeded by a clashing of swords so dreadful,
as if the whole conflict had recommenced in the person of Henry Wynd and
Torquil of the Oak.They cut, foined, hewed, and thrust as if they had
drawn their blades for the first time that day; and their inveteracy was
mutual, for Torquil recognised the foul wizard who, as he supposed, had
cast a spell over his child; and Henry saw before him the giant who,
during the whole conflict, had interrupted the purpose for which alone
he had joined the combatants--that of engaging in single combat with
Hector.They fought with an equality which, perhaps, would not have
existed, had not Henry, more wounded than his antagonist, been somewhat
deprived of his usual agility.Meanwhile Eachin, finding himself alone, after a disorderly and vain
attempt to put on his foster brother's harness, became animated by an
emotion of shame and despair, and hurried forward to support his foster
father in the terrible struggle, ere some other of the Clan Chattan
should come up.When he was within five yards, and sternly determined
to take his share in the death fight, his foster father fell, cleft
from the collarbone well nigh to the heart, and murmuring with his last
breath, "Bas air son Eachin!"The unfortunate youth saw the fall of
his last friend, and at the same moment beheld the deadly enemy who had
hunted him through the whole field standing within sword's point of
him, and brandishing the huge weapon which had hewed its way to his
life through so many obstacles.Perhaps this was enough to bring his
constitutional timidity to its highest point; or perhaps he recollected
at the same moment that he was without defensive armour, and that a
line of enemies, halting indeed and crippled, but eager for revenge and
blood, were closely approaching.It is enough to say, that his heart
sickened, his eyes darkened, his ears tingled, his brain turned giddy,
all other considerations were lost in the apprehension of instant death;
and, drawing one ineffectual blow at the smith, he avoided that which
was aimed at him in return by bounding backward; and, ere the former
could recover his weapon, Eachin had plunged into the stream of the Tay.A roar of contumely pursued him as he swam across the river, although,
perhaps, not a dozen of those who joined in it would have behaved
otherwise in the like circumstances.Henry looked after the fugitive in
silence and surprise, but could not speculate on the consequences of
his flight, on account of the faintness which seemed to overpower him
as soon as the animation of the contest had subsided.He sat down on
the grassy bank, and endeavoured to stanch such of his wounds as were
pouring fastest.The victors had the general meed of gratulation.The Duke of Albany and
others went down to survey the field; and Henry Wynd was honoured with
particular notice."If thou wilt follow me, good fellow," said the Black Douglas, "I
will change thy leathern apron for a knight's girdle, and thy burgage
tenement for an hundred pound land to maintain thy rank withal.""I thank you humbly, my lord," said the smith, dejectedly, "but I have
shed blood enough already, and Heaven has punished me by foiling the
only purpose for which I entered the combat.""Didst thou not fight for the Clan Chattan,
and have they not gained a glorious conquest?""I fought for my own hand," [meaning, I did such a thing for my own
pleasure, not for your profit] said the smith, indifferently; and the
expression is still proverbial in Scotland.The good King Robert now came up on an ambling palfrey, having entered
the barriers for the purpose of causing the wounded to be looked after."My lord of Douglas," he said, "you vex the poor man with temporal
matters when it seems he may have short timer to consider those that
are spiritual.Has he no friends here who will bear him where his bodily
wounds and the health of his soul may be both cared for?""He hath as many friends as there are good men in Perth," said Sir
Patrick Charteris, "and I esteem myself one of the closest.""A churl will savour of churl's kind," said the haughty Douglas, turning
his horse aside; "the proffer of knighthood from the sword of Douglas
had recalled him from death's door, had there been a drop of gentle
blood in his body."Disregarding the taunt of the mighty earl, the Knight of Kinfauns
dismounted to take Henry in his arms, as he now sunk back from very
faintness.But he was prevented by Simon Glover, who, with other
burgesses of consideration, had now entered the barrace."Oh, what tempted you
to this fatal affray?"No--not speechless," said Henry."Catharine--" He could utter no more."Catharine is well, I trust, and shall be thine--that is, if--"

"If she be safe, thou wouldst say, old man," said the Douglas, who,
though something affronted at Henry's rejection of his offer, was too
magnanimous not to interest himself in what was passing."She is safe,
if Douglas's banner can protect her--safe, and shall be rich.Douglas
can give wealth to those who value it more than honour.""For her safety, my lord, let the heartfelt thanks and blessings of a
father go with the noble Douglas.said the Earl: "a churl refuses nobility, a citizen despises
gold!""Under your lordship's favour," said Sir Patrick, "I, who am knight
and noble, take license to say, that such a brave man as Henry Wynd may
reject honourable titles, such an honest man as this reverend citizen
may dispense with gold.""You do well, Sir Patrick, to speak for your town, and I take no
offence," said the Douglas.But," he
added, in a whisper to Albany, "your Grace must withdraw the King from
this bloody sight, for he must know that tonight which will ring over
broad Scotland when tomorrow dawns.Yet even I
grieve that so many brave Scottishmen lie here slain, whose brands might
have decided a pitched field in their country's cause."With dignity King Robert was withdrawn from the field, the tears running
down his aged cheeks and white beard, as he conjured all around him,
nobles and priests, that care should be taken for the bodies and souls
of the few wounded survivors, and honourable burial rendered to
the slain.The priests who were present answered zealously for both
services, and redeemed their pledge faithfully and piously.Thus ended this celebrated conflict of the North Inch of Perth.Of
sixty-four brave men (the minstrels and standard bearers included)
who strode manfully to the fatal field, seven alone survived, who were
conveyed from thence in litters, in a case little different from the
dead and dying around them, and mingled with them in the sad procession
which conveyed them from the scene of their strife.Eachin alone had
left it void of wounds and void of honour.It remains but to say, that not a man of the Clan Quhele survived the
bloody combat except the fugitive chief; and the consequence of the
defeat was the dissolution of their confederacy.The clans of which it
consisted are now only matter of conjecture to the antiquary, for, after
this eventful contest, they never assembled under the same banner.The
Clan Chattan, on the other hand, continued to increase and flourish; and
the best families of the Northern Highlands boast their descent from the
race of the Cat a Mountain.While the King rode slowly back to the convent which he then occupied,
Albany, with a discomposed aspect and faltering voice, asked the Earl of
Douglas: "Will not your lordship, who saw this most melancholy scene at
Falkland, communicate the tidings to my unhappy brother?""Not for broad Scotland," said the Douglas."I would sooner bare my
breast, within flight shot, as a butt to an hundred Tynedale bowmen.I could but say I saw the ill fated youth dead.How he came by his death, your Grace can perhaps better explain.Were it
not for the rebellion of March and the English war, I would speak my own
mind of it."So saying, and making his obeisance to the King, the Earl rode off to
his own lodgings, leaving Albany to tell his tale as he best could."Ay, and
thine own interest, haughty earl, which, imperious as thou art, thou
darest not separate from mine.Well, since the task falls on me, I must
and will discharge it."The King looked at him with
surprise after he had assumed his usual seat."Thy countenance is ghastly, Robin," said the King."I would thou
wouldst think more deeply when blood is to be spilled, since its
consequences affect thee so powerfully.And yet, Robin, I love thee the
better that thy kind nature will sometimes show itself, even through thy
reflecting policy.""I would to Heaven, my royal brother," said Albany, with a voice half
choked, "that the bloody field we have seen were the worst we had to see
or hear of this day.I should waste little sorrow on the wild kerne who
lie piled on it like carrion.It must
be--it is Rothsay!"My lord--my liege, folly and mischance are now ended with my hapless
nephew.""Albany, as
thy brother, I conjure thee!But no, I am thy brother no longer.As thy
king, dark and subtle man, I charge thee to tell the worst."Albany faltered out: "The details are but imperfectly known to me; but
the certainty is, that my unhappy nephew was found dead in his apartment
last night from sudden illness--as I have heard.""Oh, Rothsay!--Oh, my beloved David!Would to God I had died for thee,
my son--my son!"So spoke, in the emphatic words of Scripture, the helpless and bereft
father, tearing his grey beard and hoary hair, while Albany, speechless
and conscience struck, did not venture to interrupt the tempest of his
grief.But the agony of the King's sorrow almost instantly changed to
fury--a mood so contrary to the gentleness and timidity of his nature,
that the remorse of Albany was drowned in his fear."And this is the end," said the King, "of thy moral saws and religious
maxims!But the besotted father who gave the son into thy hands--who
gave the innocent lamb to the butcher--is a king, and thou shalt know
it to thy cost.Shall the murderer stand in presence of his
brother--stained with the blood of that brother's son?What ho,
without there!--MacLouis!--Brandanes!Take arms, if
you love the Stuart!"MacLouis, with several of the guards, rushed into the apartment."Brandanes, your
noble Prince--" Here his grief and agitation interrupted for a moment
the fatal information it was his object to convey.At length he resumed
his broken speech: "An axe and a block instantly into the courtyard!Arrest--" The word choked his utterance."Arrest whom, my noble liege?"said MacLouis, who, observing the King
influenced by a tide of passion so different from the gentleness of his
ordinary demeanour, almost conjectured that his brain had been disturbed
by the unusual horrors of the combat he had witnessed."Whom shall I arrest, my liege?""Here is none but your
Grace's royal brother of Albany.""Most true," said the King, his brief fit of vindictive passion
soon dying away."Most true--none but Albany--none but my parent's
child--none but my brother.O God, enable me to quell the sinful passion
which glows in this bosom.Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis!"MacLouis cast a look of wonder towards the Duke of Albany, who
endeavoured to hide his confusion under an affectation of deep sympathy,
and muttered to the officer: "The great misfortune has been too much for
his understanding."not heard of the death of my nephew Rothsay?""The Duke of Rothsay dead, my Lord of Albany?"exclaimed the faithful
Brandane, with the utmost horror and astonishment."Two days since--the manner as yet unknown--at Falkland."MacLouis gazed at the Duke for an instant; then, with a kindling eye
and determined look, said to the King, who seemed deeply engaged in his
mental devotion: "My liege!a minute or two since you left a word--one
word--unspoken.Let it pass your lips, and your pleasure is law to your
Brandanes!""I was praying against temptation, MacLouis," said the heart broken
King, "and you bring it to me.Would you arm a madman with a
drawn weapon?my friend--my brother--my bosom
counsellor--how--how camest thou by the heart to do this?"Albany, seeing that the King's mood was softening, replied with more
firmness than before: "My castle has no barrier against the power of
death.I have not deserved the foul suspicions which your Majesty's
words imply.I pardon them, from the distraction of a bereaved father.But I am willing to swear by cross and altar, by my share in salvation,
by the souls of our royal parents--"

"Be silent, Robert!"said the King: "add not perjury to murder.And was
this all done to gain a step nearer to a crown and sceptre?Take them
to thee at once, man; and mayst thou feel as I have done, that they are
both of red hot iron!thou hast at least escaped
being a king!""My liege," said MacLouis, "let me remind you that the crown and sceptre
of Scotland are, when your Majesty ceases to bear them, the right of
Prince James, who succeeds to his brother's rights.""True, MacLouis," said the King, eagerly, "and will succeed, poor child,
to his brother's perils!You have reminded
me that I have still work upon earth.Get thy Brandanes under arms with
what speed thou canst.Let no man go with us whose truth is not known to
thee.None in especial who has trafficked with the Duke of Albany--that
man, I mean, who calls himself my brother--and order my litter to
be instantly prepared.We will to Dunbarton, MacLouis, or to Bute.Precipices, and tides, and my Brandanes' hearts shall defend the child
till we can put oceans betwixt him and his cruel uncle's ambition.Farewell, Robert of Albany--farewell for ever, thou hard hearted, bloody
man!Enjoy such share of power as the Douglas may permit thee.But seek
not to see my face again, far less to approach my remaining child; for,
that hour thou dost, my guards shall have orders to stab thee down with
their partizans!The Duke of Albany left the presence without attempting further
justification or reply.In the ensuing Parliament, the Duke
of Albany prevailed on that body to declare him innocent of the death
of Rothsay, while, at the same time, he showed his own sense of guilt by
taking out a remission or pardon for the offence.The unhappy and aged
monarch secluded himself in his Castle of Rothsay, in Bute, to mourn
over the son he had lost, and watch with feverish anxiety over the life
of him who remained.As the best step for the youthful James's security,
he sent him to France to receive his education at the court of the
reigning sovereign.But the vessel in which the Prince of Scotland
sailed was taken by an English cruiser, and, although there was a truce
for the moment betwixt the kingdoms, Henry IV ungenerously detained him
a prisoner.This last blow completely broke the heart of the unhappy
King Robert III.Vengeance followed, though with a slow pace, the
treachery and cruelty of his brother.Robert of Albany's own grey hairs
went, indeed, in peace to the grave, and he transferred the regency
which he had so foully acquired to his son Murdoch.But, nineteen years
after the death of the old King, James I returned to Scotland, and
Duke Murdoch of Albany, with his sons, was brought to the scaffold, in
expiation of his father's guilt and his own.The honest heart that's free frae a'
     Intended fraud or guile,
     However Fortune kick the ba',
     Has aye some cause to smile.We now return to the Fair Maid of Perth, who had been sent from the
horrible scene at Falkland by order of the Douglas, to be placed under
the protection of his daughter, the now widowed Duchess of Rothsay.That
lady's temporary residence was a religious house called Campsie, the
ruins of which still occupy a striking situation on the Tay.It arose on
the summit of a precipitous rock, which descends on the princely river,
there rendered peculiarly remarkable by the cataract called Campsie
Linn, where its waters rush tumultuously over a range of basaltic
rock, which intercepts the current, like a dike erected by human hands.Delighted with a site so romantic, the monks of the abbey of Cupar
reared a structure there, dedicated to an obscure saint, named St.Hunnand, and hither they were wont themselves to retire for pleasure or
devotion.It had readily opened its gates to admit the noble lady who
was its present inmate, as the country was under the influence of
the powerful Lord Drummond, the ally of the Douglas.There the Earl's
letters were presented to the Duchess by the leader of the escort which
conducted Catharine and the glee maiden to Campsie.Whatever reason
she might have to complain of Rothsay, his horrible and unexpected end
greatly shocked the noble lady, and she spent the greater part of the
night in indulging her grief and in devotional exercises.On the next morning, which was that of the memorable Palm Sunday, she
ordered Catharine Glover and the minstrel into her presence.The spirits
of both the young women had been much sunk and shaken by the dreadful
scenes in which they had so lately been engaged; and the outward
appearance of the Duchess Marjory was, like that of her father, more
calculated to inspire awe than confidence.She spoke with kindness,
however, though apparently in deep affliction, and learned from them
all which they had to tell concerning the fate of her erring and
inconsiderate husband.She appeared grateful for the efforts which
Catharine and the glee maiden had made, at their own extreme peril, to
save Rothsay from his horrible fate.She invited them to join in her
devotions; and at the hour of dinner gave them her hand to kiss, and
dismissed them to their own refection, assuring both, and Catharine in
particular, of her efficient protection, which should include, she said,
her father's, and be a wall around them both, so long as she herself
lived.They retired from the presence of the widowed Princess, and partook of
a repast with her duennas and ladies, all of whom, amid their profound
sorrow, showed a character of stateliness which chilled the light heart
of the Frenchwoman, and imposed restraint even on the more serious
character of Catharine Glover.The friends, for so we may now term them,
were fain, therefore, to escape from the society of these persons, all
of them born gentlewomen, who thought themselves but ill assorted with
a burgher's daughter and a strolling glee maiden, and saw them with
pleasure go out to walk in the neighbourhood of the convent.A little
garden, with its bushes and fruit trees, advanced on one side of the
convent, so as to skirt the precipice, from which it was only separated
by a parapet built on the ledge of the rock, so low that the eye might
easily measure the depth of the crag, and gaze on the conflicting waters
which foamed, struggled, and chafed over the reef below.The Fair Maiden of Perth and her companion walked slowly on a path that
ran within this parapet, looked at the romantic prospect, and judged
what it must be when the advancing summer should clothe the grove with
leaves.At length the gay
and bold spirit of the glee maiden rose above the circumstances in which
she had been and was now placed."Do the horrors of Falkland, fair May, still weigh down your spirits?Strive to forget them as I do: we cannot tread life's path lightly, if
we shake not from our mantles the raindrops as they fall.""These horrors are not to be forgotten," answered Catharine."Yet my
mind is at present anxious respecting my father's safety; and I cannot
but think how many brave men may be at this instant leaving the world,
even within six miles of us, or little farther.""You mean the combat betwixt sixty champions, of which the Douglas's
equerry told us yesterday?It were a sight for a minstrel to witness.But out upon these womanish eyes of mine--they could never see swords
cross each other without being dazzled.But see--look yonder, May
Catharine--look yonder!That flying messenger certainly brings news of
the battle.""Methinks I should know him who runs so wildly," said Catharine."But if
it be he I think of, some wild thoughts are urging his speed."As she spoke, the runner directed his course to the garden.Louise's
little dog ran to meet him, barking furiously, but came back, to
cower, creep, and growl behind its mistress; for even dumb animals can
distinguish when men are driven on by the furious energy of irresistible
passion, and dread to cross or encounter them in their career.The
fugitive rushed into the garden at the same reckless pace.His head was
bare, his hair dishevelled, his rich acton and all his other vestments
looked as if they had been lately drenched in water.His leathern
buskins were cut and torn, and his feet marked the sod with blood.His
countenance was wild, haggard, and highly excited, or, as the Scottish
phrase expresses it, much "raised."said Catharine, as he advanced, apparently without seeing
what was before him, as hares are said to do when severely pressed by
the greyhounds.But he stopped short when he heard his own name."Conachar," said Catharine, "or rather Eachin MacIan, what means all
this?Have the Clan Quhele sustained a defeat?""I have borne such names as this maiden gives me," said the fugitive,
after a moment's recollection."Yes, I was called Conachar when I was
happy, and Eachin when I was powerful.But now I have no name, and there
is no such clan as thou speak'st of; and thou art a foolish maid to
speak of that which is not to one who has no existence."unfortunate--"

"And why unfortunate, I pray you?""If I am coward
and villain, have not villainy and cowardice command over the elements?Have I not braved the water without its choking me, and trod the firm
earth without its opening to devour me?He will not
harm me; but I fear he will do evil to himself.See how he stares down
on the roaring waterfall!"The glee woman hastened to do as she was ordered, and Conachar's half
frenzied spirit seemed relieved by her absence."Catharine," he said, "now she is gone, I will say I know thee--I know
thy love of peace and hatred of war.But hearken; I have, rather than
strike a blow at my enemy, given up all that a man calls dearest: I have
lost honour, fame, and friends, and such friends!(he placed his hands
before his face).All know my shame; all should see my sorrow.Yes, all
might see, but who would pity it?Catharine, as I ran like a madman down
the strath, man and woman called'shame' on me!The beggar to whom I
flung an alms, that I might purchase one blessing, threw it back in
disgust, and with a curse upon the coward!Each bell that tolled rung
out, 'Shame on the recreant caitiff!'The brute beasts in their lowing
and bleating, the wild winds in their rustling and howling, the hoarse
waters in their dash and roar, cried, 'Out upon the dastard!'The
faithful nine are still pursuing me; they cry with feeble voice, 'Strike
but one blow in our revenge, we all died for you!'"While the unhappy youth thus raved, a rustling was heard in the bushes.he exclaimed, springing upon the parapet, but
with a terrified glance towards the thicket, through which one or two
attendants were stealing, with the purpose of surprising him.But the
instant he saw a human form emerge from the cover of the bushes, he
waved his hands wildly over his head, and shrieking out, "Bas air
Eachin!"plunged down the precipice into the raging cataract beneath.It is needless to say, that aught save thistledown must have been dashed
to pieces in such a fall.But the river was swelled, and the remains of
the unhappy youth were never seen.A varying tradition has assigned more
than one supplement to the history.It is said by one account, that the
young captain of Clan Quhele swam safe to shore, far below the Linns of
Campsie; and that, wandering disconsolately in the deserts of Rannoch,
he met with Father Clement, who had taken up his abode in the wilderness
as a hermit, on the principle of the old Culdees.He converted, it is
said, the heart broken and penitent Conachar, who lived with him in his
cell, sharing his devotion and privations, till death removed them in
succession.Another wilder legend supposes that he was snatched from death by the
daione shie, or fairy folk, and that he continues to wander through wood
and wild, armed like an ancient Highlander, but carrying his sword in
his left hand.Sometimes he
seems about to attack the traveller, but, when resisted with courage,
always flies.These legends are founded on two peculiar points in his
story--his evincing timidity and his committing suicide--both of them
circumstances almost unexampled in the history of a mountain chief.When Simon Glover, having seen his friend Henry duly taken care of in
his own house in Curfew Street, arrived that evening at the Place of
Campsie, he found his daughter extremely ill of a fever, in consequence
of the scenes to which she had lately been a witness, and particularly
the catastrophe of her late playmate.The affection of the glee maiden
rendered her so attentive and careful a nurse, that the glover said it
should not be his fault if she ever touched lute again, save for her own
amusement.It was some time ere Simon ventured to tell his daughter of Henry's late
exploits, and his severe wounds; and he took care to make the most of
the encouraging circumstance, that her faithful lover had refused both
honour and wealth rather than become a professed soldier and follow the
Douglas.Catharine sighed deeply and shook her head at the history of
bloody Palm Sunday on the North Inch.But apparently she had reflected
that men rarely advance in civilisation or refinement beyond the ideas
of their own age, and that a headlong and exuberant courage, like that
of Henry Smith, was, in the iron days in which they lived, preferable to
the deficiency which had led to Conachar's catastrophe.If she had
any doubts on the subject, they were removed in due time by Henry's
protestations, so soon as restored health enabled him to plead his own
cause."I should blush to say, Catharine, that I am even sick of the thoughts
of doing battle.Yonder last field showed carnage enough to glut a
tiger.I am therefore resolved to hang up my broadsword, never to be
drawn more unless against the enemies of Scotland.""And should Scotland call for it," said Catharine, "I will buckle it
round you.""And, Catharine," said the joyful glover, "we will pay largely for soul
masses for those who have fallen by Henry's sword; and that will not
only cure spiritual flaws, but make us friends with the church again.""For that purpose, father," said Catharine, "the hoards of the wretched
Dwining may be applied.He bequeathed them to me; but I think you would
not mix his base blood money with your honest gains?""I would bring the plague into my house as soon," said the resolute
glover.The treasures of the wicked apothecary were distributed accordingly
among the four monasteries; nor was there ever after a breath of
suspicion concerning the orthodoxy of old Simon or his daughter.Henry and Catharine were married within four months after the battle
of the North Inch, and never did the corporations of the glovers and
hammermen trip their sword dance so featly as at the wedding of the
boldest burgess and brightest maiden in Perth.Ten months after, a
gallant infant filled the well spread cradle, and was rocked by Louise
to the tune of--

     Bold and true,
     In bonnet blue.The names of the boy's sponsors are recorded, as "Ane Hie and Michty
Lord, Archibald Erl of Douglas, ane Honorabil and gude Knicht, Schir
Patrick Charteris of Kinfauns, and ane Gracious Princess, Marjory
Dowaire of his Serene Highness David, umquhile Duke of Rothsay."Under such patronage a family rises fast; and several of the most
respected houses in Scotland, but especially in Perthshire, and many
individuals distinguished both in arts and arms, record with pride their
descent from the Gow Chrom and the Fair Maid of Perth.Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.Upon news of her arrival, Captain Smith, either to increase his own
importance or because Pocahontas was neglected, addressed a letter or
"little booke" to Queen Anne, the consort of King James.This letter is
found in Smith's "General Historie" ( 1624), where it is introduced
as having been sent to Queen Anne in 1616.We find no mention of its receipt or of any acknowledgment of
it.Whether the "abstract" in the "General Historie" is exactly like
the original we have no means of knowing.We have no more confidence in
Smith's memory than we have in his dates.The letter is as follows:

"To the most high and vertuous Princesse Queene Anne of Great Brittaine."The love I beare my God, my King and Countrie hath so oft emboldened me
in the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee
presume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestie this short
discourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues,
I must be guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee
thankful."That some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the
power of Powhaten, their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage
exceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquaus, the
most manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage and
his sister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and well-beloved daughter,
being but a childe of twelve or thirteen yeeres of age, whose
compassionate pitifull heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause
to respect her: I being the first Christian this proud King and his grim
attendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I
cannot say I felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of
those my mortall foes to prevent notwithstanding al their threats.After
some six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of
my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save
mine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was
safely conducted to Jamestowne, where I found about eight and thirty
miserable poore and sicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those
large territories of Virginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore
Commonwealth, as had the Salvages not fed us, we directly had starved."And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly brought us by
this Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant
Fortune turned our Peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not
spare to dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have been oft appeased,
and our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to
imploy her, or the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or
her extraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am
sure: when her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought
to surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the dark night could not
affright her from comming through the irksome woods, and with watered
eies gave me intilligence, with her best advice to escape his furie:
which had hee known hee had surely slaine her.Jamestowne with her wild
traine she as freely frequented, as her father's habitation: and during
the time of two or three yeares, she next under God, was still the
instrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter
confusion, which if in those times had once beene dissolved, Virginia
might have laine as it was at our first arrivall to this day.Since
then, this buisinesse having been turned and varied by many accidents
from that I left it at: it is most certaine, after a long and
troublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father and our
Colonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres longer,
the Colonie by that meanes was releived, peace concluded, and at last
rejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,
with whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of
that Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe
in mariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly
considered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding."Thus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestic, what at your
best leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done
in the time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented
you from a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet
I never begged anything of the State, or any, and it is my want of
abilitie and her exceeding desert, your birth, meanes, and authoritie,
her birth, vertue, want and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly
to beseech your Majestic: to take this knowledge of her though it be
from one so unworthy to be the reporter, as myselfe, her husband's
estate not being able to make her fit to attend your Majestic: the most
and least I can doe, is to tell you this, because none so oft hath tried
it as myselfe: and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her
station: if she should not be well received, seeing this Kingdome
may rightly have a Kingdome by her meanes: her present love to us and
Christianitie, might turne to such scorne and furie, as to divert all
this good to the worst of evill, when finding so great a Queene should
doe her some honour more than she can imagine, for being so kinde to
your servants and subjects, would so ravish her with content, as endeare
her dearest bloud to effect that, your Majestic and all the Kings honest
subjects most earnestly desire: and so I humbly kisse your gracious
hands."The passage in this letter, "She hazarded the beating out of her owne
braines to save mine," is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the
paragraph which speaks of "the exceeding great courtesie" of Powhatan;
and Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up
his

"General Historie."Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the
first three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to
New England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the
service she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect
of the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there
Smith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only
one we have, must be given for what it is worth.According to this she
had supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He
writes:

"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured
her face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband
with divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself
to have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to
talke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, 'You
did promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to
you; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the
same reason so must I do you:' which though I would have excused, I
durst not allow of that title, because she was a king's daughter.With
a well set countenance she said: 'Were you not afraid to come into my
father's country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and
fear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and
you shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your
contrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other
till I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek
you, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much."'This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by
Powhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they
and their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make
notches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that
task.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him
to show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had
told so much.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had
heard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably
not coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was
convinced he had seen him.Then he replied very sadly: "You gave
Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave
me nothing, and I am better than your white dog."Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and "they
did think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen
many English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;" and
he heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,
as also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both
at the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but
the contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of
curiosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,
and the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson's "Christmas his Mask" at court, January
6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain
writes to Carleton: "The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father
counsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and
her assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though
sore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away."Neill says that "after the first weeks of her residence in England
she does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter
writers," and the Rev.Peter Fontaine says that "when they heard that
Rolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he
had not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian
princesse."His interest in the colony was never
the most intelligent, and apt to be in things trivial.15, 1609) writes to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King of
the Virginia squirrels brought into England, which are said to fly.The
King very earnestly asked if none were provided for him, and said he was
sure Salisbury would get him one.Would not have troubled him, "but that
you know so well how he is affected to these toys."There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a
portrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is
translated: "Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,
Emperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died
on shipboard at Gravesend 1617."This is doubtless the portrait engraved
by Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the
London edition of the "General Historie," 1624.It is not probable that
the portrait was originally published with the "General Historie."The
portrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:

Round the portrait:

"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim."In the oval, under the portrait:

         "Aetatis suae 21 A.1616"
Below:

"Matoaks als Rebecka daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan Emprour of
Attanoughkomouck als virginia converted and baptized in the Christian
faith, and wife to the worth Mr.Camden in his "History of Gravesend" says that everybody paid this
young lady all imaginable respect, and it was believed she would have
sufficiently acknowledged those favors, had she lived to return to her
own country, by bringing the Indians to a kinder disposition toward the
English; and that she died, "giving testimony all the time she lay sick,
of her being a very good Christian."The Lady Rebecka, as she was called in London, died on shipboard at
Gravesend after a brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably
on the 21st of March, 1617.I have seen somewhere a statement, which
I cannot confirm, that her disease was smallpox.George's Church,
where she was buried, was destroyed by fire in 1727.The register of
that church has this record:


       "1616, May 21 Rebecca Wrothe
        Wyff of Thomas Wroth gent
     A Virginia lady borne, here was buried
          in ye chaunncle."Yet there is no doubt, according to a record in the Calendar of State
Papers, dated "1617, 29 March, London," that her death occurred March
21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became
Governor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that
unscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the
company.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: "We cannot
imagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives
have given the country to Mr.Rolfe's child, and that they reserve it
from all others till he comes of years except as we suppose as some
do here report it be a device of your own, to some special purpose for
yourself."It appears also by the minutes of the company in 1621 that
Lady Delaware had trouble to recover goods of hers left in Rolfe's hands
in Virginia, and desired a commission directed to Sir Thomas Wyatt and
Mr.George Sandys to examine what goods of the late "Lord Deleware had
come into Rolfe's possession and get satisfaction of him."This George
Sandys is the famous traveler who made a journey through the Turkish
Empire in 1610, and who wrote, while living in Virginia, the first book
written in the New World, the completion of his translation of Ovid's
"Metamorphosis."John Rolfe died in Virginia in 1622, leaving a wife and children.This is supposed to be his third wife, though there is no note of his
marriage to her nor of the death of his first.October 7, 1622, his
brother Henry Rolfe petitioned that the estate of John should be
converted to the support of his relict wife and children and to his own
indemnity for having brought up John's child by Powhatan's daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas
to the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil
practices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle
Henry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned
to Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his
application to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the
Indian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother's sister.He left an only
daughter who was married, says Stith (1753), "to Col.John Bolling; by
whom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father
to the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to
Col.Campbell in his "History of Virginia"
says that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an
esteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,
grandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the
great granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with
fighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;
his own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,
and usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and
conquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not
defined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the
Potomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he
alternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of
which at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey
(York) River.He is said
to have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the
youngest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his
harem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into
all his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to
select.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:
"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold
and stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes
and attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is
supposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how
much more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a
sad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,
hanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so
on his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,
vigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath
been, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and
that to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,
as also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in
security and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions
of peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is
likewise more quietly settled amongst his own."It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives
whom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,
presenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,
or tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on
burning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put
on such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to
the necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)
the impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other
heathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the
knowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an
infused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall
be so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on
earth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the
appearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed
by Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or
conjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept
and conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but
propitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception
of an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a
ceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,
although Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the
devil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes
their own children.An image of their god which he sent to England
"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed
monster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are
no other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe
also pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief
that the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a
well-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the
better effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow's Relation,"
quoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
under date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought
a fast day was appointed.The
exercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to
prayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the
difference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name
of God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as
sometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the
ground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never
observed the like."It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of
those in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they
got a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth
and the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either
according to the custom of the country or as a defense against the
stinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says
Strachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so
discolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth
how they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the
women," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming
it the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden
quince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient
Britain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]
he or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this
collour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not
yet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their
oyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly
communicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"
London, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their
children are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors
presently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no
beards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at
the end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as
the Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty
hands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as
barbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an
ell long."A Puritan divine--"New England's Plantation, 1630"--says of
the Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before
like our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to
our gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from
Strachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:

"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in
the same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white
bone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up
hollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,
hawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,
squirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke
to the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these
holes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard
in length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes
familiarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt
tyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense
it bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves
his prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight
against the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for
the crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is
something pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death
of his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun
by the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege
of moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him
peace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the
cruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the
heart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle
words for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of
a gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has
woven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later
writers have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts
that industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and
unrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters
in her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the
appearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so
inclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt
to learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those
who taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,
sensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something
more than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger
and a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who
opposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in
civilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight
of a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural
to a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than
efforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the
whites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the
support of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on
sight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed
whites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a
base violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to
her situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her
captors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,
that her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always
remains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained
by the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her
adopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian
name she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than
she left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre
of 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she
might have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles
of the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying
when she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all
history, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose
empire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except
the remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people.Redfern and half a dozen directors of the new
trust company have been given long sentences at Sing Sing.”

“There are associates that ought to go, too!” Jimmie cried.“We’re not going to prosecute them,” Mr.“But this is
not to the point.The Federal Government wants you boys to undertake a
little mission for the Secret Service men.You see,” he went on, “you
boys made quite a hit in that Peruvian job.”

“Will Sam go?” asked Ben.“Sam is Sam no longer,” replied Mr.“He is now
Warren P. King, son of the banker!What do you think of that?”

“Then what was he doing playing the tramp?” asked Carl.“Oh, he quarreled with his father, and it was the old story, but it is
all smooth sailing for him now.He may go with you, but his father
naturally wants him at home for a spell.”

“Where are we to go?” asked Ben.“I’ll tell you that later,” was the reply.“Will you go?”

The boys danced around the room and declared that they were ready to
start that moment.The story of their adventures on the trip will be
found in the next volume of this series, entitled:

“The Flying Machine Boys on Secret Service; or, the Capture in the Air!”


                                THE END.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                            Transcriber’s Notes:

    Italicized phrases are presented by surrounding the text with
    _underscores_.Minor spelling, punctuation and typographic errors were corrected
    silently, except as noted below.Hyphenated words have been retained
    as they appear in the original text.On page 3, "smoldered" was left as is (rather than changed to
    "smouldered"), as both spellings were used in the time period.On page 99, "say" was added to "I don't care what you about Sam".On page 197, "good-by" was changed to "good-bye" to be consistent
    with other usage in the book.“There were scientists in the party!” was the reply.“There is no such word as ghost in the dictionary of the scientist!”
laughed Carl.“Following the stories told by the visitors,” Glenn went on, “a number
of people visited the vicinity of the temple, and all came away with
tales more vivid and more imaginative than those of the scientists.For
two years now the place has been left entirely alone.”

“We might go there and camp!” suggested Carl.“I move we take a look at it!” Jimmie cut in.“We can fly down on the
roof and get away before the goblins get us.”

“I’m game for anything you boys decide on,” Glenn declared, “but my
private opinion is that it will be only a waste of time for us to pay
much attention to the haunted temple!”

“The ghosts wouldn’t like us if we should leave their country without
making a formal call!” laughed Carl.“Who’s going to get supper?” asked Jimmie in a moment.“I feel like I
could eat one of the wild beasts which are said to flourish in this
region!”

“There isn’t much supper to get!” replied Ben, with, a laugh.“All we
have is a couple of pounds of ham, a few eggs, and a lot of tinned
provisions.Why don’t one of you boys go
and catch a fish?”

“Aw, I don’t believe there’s any fish in that river!” grinned Jimmie.“If there are fish there, they’ll be tough eating for they must be
acrobats!”

“Why acrobats?” asked Glenn.“Because they must stand on their heads and turn handsprings in order to
get something to eat in that swift water!”

“I believe we can get a fish for supper, just the same!” insisted Carl,
“and I’m going to get out a line and an imitation minnow and go try!”

“May the luck of the hungry fisherman go with you!” laughed Ben.“He’ll have better company than that!” Jimmie grinned.“I’m going along
myself!”

While Glenn and Ben arranged the camp for the night Jimmie and Carl
started away down the <DW72> leading to the river.Directly in front of
the tents the bank was clear of undergrowth, and covered with grass
almost waist high.Lower down, however, to the west, was a great thicket
which seemed to extend for miles.The opposite shore of the stream was
heavily wooded for some distance up.Above, the timber line showed the
bare, brown <DW72>s of mountains.When the two boys reached the bank of the stream the prospects were not
attractive, the water being broken into rapids and falls by jagged rocks
which occupied the bed of the river at this point.To the west, however,
where the stream entered the forest, the surface of the water appeared
to be unbroken, so the lads made their way in that direction.In a few
minutes their lines were out and almost instantly sharp twitches at the
hooks informed the boys that they were not fishing in barren waters.But before the first fish was landed an exciting interruption occurred.WHAT THE FISHERMEN CAUGHT.Seated with his back to the thicket, Jimmie heard a rustle and turned
about expecting to see one of his chums.Instead, he saw the ugly, vicious face of an Ecuadorian savage.While he
looked, the fellow was joined by another, equally repulsive and equally
naked.During that first moment of amazement Jimmie dropped his fish
pole and it went bobbing down the river.“Carl!” he said, in a low whisper.The boy shouted back from lower down the stream.“Got a fish?”

“Come up and see!” cried Jimmie.Carl came panting through the undergrowth, and Jimmie pointed with a
hand which was not quite steady at the two figures in the underbrush
just back of him.“Look what I’ve found!” he whispered.“Did you call me up to give me my share?” asked Carl.“If you did, I
don’t want it!You’re welcome to everything you find in that line!”

“Gee!” Jimmie exclaimed.“I wish we were back by the machines!”

“I wish so, too!” Carl put in.“I wonder why they stand there looking at
us in that way.”

“Maybe they’re out after supper, too!” remarked Jimmie.“Do they eat folks?” asked Carl.“The savages who come over from the Amazon valley eat folks,” Jimmie
answered, “and those fellows look as if they came from that
neighborhood.”

“Let’s start on up toward camp and see if they will interfere!”
suggested Carl.“Have you got a gun with you?” asked Jimmie.“Of course not!” was the reply.“I didn’t come out to shoot fish!”

“And I left mine at the camp, too!” Jimmie complained.“I’ll never do it
again!”

“Well, let’s make a start and see what comes of it!” suggested Carl.As the boys moved away the savages, men of medium height but apparently
very strong and supple, lifted naked arms in gestures which commanded
them to remain where they were.“I wonder if they’ve got guns?” questioned Jimmie.“They’ve got little short spears!” answered Carl.“I saw one in that
fellow’s hand.”

“And I suppose they’re poisoned, too!” Jimmie asserted.The two savages now advanced from the thicket and stood threateningly
before the two boys.Except for breech-clouts, which seemed to be woven
of some sort of fiber, the men were naked.In color they were almost as
dark as the <DW64> of Africa.Their features seemed to be a cross between
the tribes of Asia and Africa.They were armed with short spears which
they flourished with many hostile gestures.“Good-evening!” Jimmie said.The savages conversed together in a dialect which seemed to the boys to
resemble a confidential conversation between two hogs, and then pointed
down the river.“Here’s where we get abducted!” Carl exclaimed.“You needn’t get funny about it!” Jimmie expostulated.“This is no
joke!”

“Anyhow,” Carl went on, “the ginks don’t know anything about good
manners.They never answered your salutation!”

The savages were still uttering what appeared to be wordless commands,
and, as they continued to point down the river, very reluctantly the
boys started in that direction.“I wonder if the brutes have captured the camp, too?” queried Jimmie.“Oh, I suppose so!” Carl answered.“These fellows travel in droves, like
wild hogs, and I guess we lit right in the middle of a large tribe.”

In spite of the impatience expressed by the gestures of their captors,
the boys proceeded very slowly.As they walked they listened for some
indication of trouble at the camp.They knew that Glenn and Ben were
well armed, and that they would not submit to capture without first
putting up a spirited defence.“We haven’t heard any shooting yet,” Jimmie said in a moment.“I don’t believe there’s any use of our being lugged off in this style!”
Carl advised.“We ought to be able to break away from these brutes and
get back to camp.The boys there are all right up to this time, for we
haven’t heard any fighting, and the four of us ought to be able to
induce these two savages to beat it!”

“If we can only get back to the flying machines,” Jimmie suggested, “we
can get away, all right.I believe these fellows would drop dead if they
saw the _Louise_ or the _Bertha_ slanting up into the air!”

“Well, then, let’s make a break!” Carl advised.“All right!” Jimmie replied.“When we get to the next jungle where the
bushes are so thick they can’t throw a spear very far, you duck one way
and I’ll duck the other, and we’ll both make for the camp.”

The boys knew very well that they were in a perilous situation.The
savages were more familiar with travel through underbrush than
themselves.Besides, they would undoubtedly be able to make better time
than boys reared on city streets.In addition to all this, the spears
they carried might carry death on every tip.However, to remain seemed fully as dangerous as to attempt to escape.So
when they came to a particularly dense bit of jungle the boys darted
away.As they did so Jimmie felt a spear whiz within an inch of his
head, and Carl felt the push of one as it entered his sleeve.Dodging
swiftly this way and that, uttering cries designed to bring their chums
to their assistance, the boys forced their way through the undergrowth
some distance in advance of their pursuers.Every moment they expected to feel the sting of a spear, or to be seized
from behind by a brown, muscular hand.After all it was their voices and
not their ability as runners which brought about their rescue.Hearing the cries of their chums, Ben and Glenn sprang for their guns
and, walking swiftly toward the river, began firing, both for the
purpose of directing the boys toward the camp and with the added purpose
of frightening away any hostile element, either human or animal, walking
on four legs or on two.Panting, and scarcely believing in their own
good fortune, Jimmie and Carl presently came to where their chums stood
not far from the machines.Both boys dropped down in the long grass the
instant they felt themselves under the protection of the automatics in
the hands of their friends.To say that Glenn and Ben were surprised at the sudden appearance of
their chums only feebly expresses the situation.The savages had not
followed the boys into the open plaza where the grass grew, and so there
was no physical explanation of the incident.“What’s doing?” demanded Glenn.“You must be running for exercise!” Ben put in.“For the love of Mike!” exclaimed Jimmie, panting and holding his hands
to his sides.“Get back to the machines and throw the truck on board!These woods are full of head-hunters!”

“What did you see?” asked Ben.“Savages!” answered Jimmie.“They got us, too!” Carl put in.“They did?” demanded Glenn.“Then how did you get away?”

“Ran away!” answered Jimmie scornfully.“You don’t suppose we flew, do
you?I guess we’ve been going some!”

“Where are the savages now?” demanded Glenn.“I don’t know!” Jimmie answered.“I don’t want to know where they are.I
want to know where they ain’t!”

“Come on!” Carl urged.“Let’s get back to the machines!”

Glenn and Ben did not seem to take the incident as seriously as did
their chums.In fact, they were rather inclined to make facetious
remarks about little boys being frightened at black men in the woods.Ben was even in favor of advancing into the thicket on a tour of
investigation, but Jimmie argued him out of the idea.“They’re savages, all right!” the latter insisted.“They’re naked, and
they’re armed with spears.Look to me like head-hunters from the Amazon
valley!If you go into the thicket you’re likely to get a couple of
spears into your frame!”

“Then I won’t go!” Ben grinned.“Come on,” urged Carl, “it’s getting dark, so we’d better be getting
back to camp!Perhaps the <DW65>s have beaten us to it already!”

“I guess the two you saw are about the only ones in the vicinity,”
answered Glenn.“You’d feel pretty cheap, wouldn’t you, if you’d get back to camp and
find that the savages had taken possession?” demanded Jimmie.Thus urged, Glenn and Ben finally abandoned the idea of advancing into
the forest.Instead, they turned their faces toward the camp, and all
four boys advanced with ever-increasing speed as they neared the spot
where the aeroplanes and the tents had been left.About the first thing they saw as they came within sight of the broad
planes of the flying machines was a naked savage inspecting the motors.He stood like a statue before the machine for an instant and then glided
away.They saw him turn about as he came to a cluster of underbrush,
beckon silently to some one, apparently on the other side of the camp,
and then disappear.“And that means,” Glenn whispered, “that the woods are full of ’em!”

“Oh, no,” jeered Jimmie, “the two we saw are the only ones there are in
the woods!I guess you’ll think there is something in the story we told
about being captured and abducted!”

The short tropical twilight had now entirely passed away.It seemed to
the boys as if a curtain had been drawn between themselves and the tents
and flying machines which had been so plainly in view a moment before.There was only the glimmer of the small camp-fire to direct them to
their camp.“Who’s got a searchlight?” asked Glenn.“I have!” replied Ben.“I never leave the camp without one!”

“Then use it!” advised Glenn, “and we will make for the machines.”

“Don’t you do it!” advised Jimmie.“They’ll throw spears at us!”

“Well, we’ve got to have a light in order to get the machines away!”
declared Carl.“Perhaps the <DW65>s will run when they see the
illumination.The light of a searchlight at a distance, you know,
doesn’t look like anything human or divine!”

It was finally decided to advance as cautiously and silently as possible
to the camp and spring at once to the machines.“We’ll never be clear of these savages until we get up in the air!”
declared Ben.“But that will leave our tents and our provisions, and about everything
we have except the machines, behind!” wailed Carl.“It won’t leave all the provisions behind!” declared Jimmie.“I’ll
snatch beans and bread if I get killed doing it!”

During their progress to the camp the boys neither saw nor heard
anything whatever of the savages.They found the fire burning brightly
and the provisions which had been set out for supper just as they had
been left.In fact, the statue-like
savage they had observed examining the flying machine now seemed to have
come out of a dream and retreated to his world of shadows again.“Perhaps it won’t be necessary to leave here to-night,” Glenn suggested.“I don’t think it’s safe to remain,” Ben contended.“You boys may stay if you want to!” Jimmie exclaimed.“But Carl and I
have had enough of this neck of the woods.We’ll take the _Louise_ and
fly over to Quito, and you can find us there when you get ready to move
on.You boys certainly take the cake for not knowing what’s good for
you!” he added with a grin.“Oh, well, perhaps we’d all better go!” Glenn advised.“I don’t see
anything nourishing in this part of the country, anyway.If you boys had
only brought home a couple of fish it might have been different.I’m of
the opinion that a square meal at Quito wouldn’t come amiss just now.”

“It’s so blooming dark I don’t know whether we can find the town or
not,” suggested Carl.“Oh, we can find it all right!” insisted Ben.“If the savages let us!” exclaimed Jimmie excitedly.“I don’t see any savages!” replied Glenn.“Can’t you hear them?” demanded Jimmie.“I think I can smell something!” Carl exclaimed.“Don’t get gay, now!” Jimmie answered.If
you’ll listen, you’ll hear the snakes creeping through the grass.”

The boys listened intently for an instant and then, without looking into
the tents, sprang toward the machines.It seemed for a moment as if a
thousand voices were shouting at them.They seemed to be in the center
of a circle of men who were all practicing a different style of
war-whoop.To this day the boys assert that it was the whirling of the electric
searchlights which kept the savages from advancing upon them.At any
rate, for a time, the unseen visitors contented themselves with verbal
demonstrations.“We’ll have to jump out on the machines!” advised Glenn.“We can’t fight
a whole army!”

“Why, there’s only two!” Jimmie taunted.“You said yourself that we saw
all the black men there were in this neighborhood!”

“Aw, keep still,” Ben cried.“We haven’t got time to listen to you boys
joke each other!You and I for the _Louise_!”

It was now very dark, for banks of clouds lay low in the valley, but the
boys knew that the machines were situated so as to run smoothly until
the propellers and the planes brought them into the air.With a chorus of savage yells still ringing in their ears, the boys
leaped into their seats, still swinging their searchlights frantically
as their only means of protection, and pressed the starters.The
machines ran ahead smoothly for an instant then lifted.The boys were certain
that if they could have looked down upon the savages who had been so
threatening a moment before they would have seen them on their knees
with their faces pressed to the ground.“They’ll talk about this night for a thousand years!” Jimmie screamed in
Ben’s ear as the _Louise_ swept into and through a stratum of cloud.“They’ll send it down to future generations in legends of magic.”

“Little do we care what they think of us after we get out of their
clutches!” Ben called back.“It seems like a miracle, our getting away
at all!”

“Do you really think they are head-hunters?” shouted Jimmie.“You saw more of them than I did,” Ben answered.After passing through the clouds the starlight showed the way, and in a
very short time the lights of Quito were seen glittering twenty miles or
so to the south.“What are we going to do when we get to the town?” shouted Jimmie.“Hire some one to watch the machines and get a square meal!” Ben
replied.“And buy new tents and provisions and everything of that kind!”
he went on.“I suppose those savages will have a fine time devouring our
perfectly good food.”

“And they’ll probably use the oiled-silk tents for clothing!” laughed
Jimmie.“I wonder if we can buy more at Quito.”

“Of course we can!” replied Ben.“Quito has a hundred thousand
inhabitants, and there are plenty of European places of business there!”

The _Bertha_ with Glenn and Carl on board was some distance in advance,
and directly the boys on the _Louise_ saw the leading machine swing
about in a circle and then gradually drop to the ground.Ben, who was
driving the _Louise_, adopted the same tactics, and very soon the two
flying machines lay together in an open field, perhaps a mile distant
from Quito, the capital of Ecuador, the city known throughout the world
as the “City of Eternal Spring.”

It was dark at the ground level, there being only the light of the
stars, faintly seen through drifting masses of clouds, many hundred feet
higher here than those which had nestled over the valley.“What next?” asked Carl as the four boys leaped from their seats and
gathered in a little group.“Supper next!” shouted Jimmie.“But we can’t all leave the machines!” declared Glenn.“Don’t you ever worry about the machines being left alone!” asserted
Ben.“Our lights will bring about a thousand people out here within the
next ten minutes.Dark as it is, our machines were undoubtedly seen
before we landed, and there’ll soon be an army here asking questions.We’ll have little trouble in finding English-speaking people in the
mob.”

“I guess that’s right!” Jimmie agreed.“Here comes the gang right now!”

A jumble of English, Spanish and French was now heard, and directly a
dozen or more figures were seen advancing across the field to where the
flying machines had landed.“There’s some one talking United States, all right!” Jimmie declared.Directly the visitors came up to where the boys were standing and began
gazing about, some impudently, some curiously and some threateningly.“Keep your hands off the machines!” Glenn warned, as a dusky native
began handling the levers.The fellow turned about and regarded the boy with an impudent stare.He
said something in Spanish which Glenn did not understand, and then
walked away to a group of natives who were whispering suspiciously
together.“Where are you from?” asked a voice in English as Glenn examined the
levers to see that nothing had been removed or displaced.“Gee!” exclaimed Jimmie.“That United States talk sounds good to me!”

The man who had spoken now turned to Jimmie and repeated his question.“Where do you boys come from?”

“New York,” Jimmie replied.“And you came across the Isthmus of Panama?” was the next question.“Sure we did!” answered the boy.“Well,” the stranger said, “my name is Bixby, Jim Bixby, and I’ve been
looking for you for two days.”

“Is that so?” asked Jimmie incredulously.“You see,” Bixby went on, “I am a dealer in automobile supplies,
probably the only one doing a large business in this part of the
country.Some days ago I received a telegram from Louis Havens, the
millionaire aviator, saying that four pupils of his were coming this
way, and advising me to take good care of you.”

“Where did Mr.Havens wire from?” asked Jimmie.“First from New York,” was the reply, “and then from New Orleans.It
seems that he started away from New York on the day following your
departure, and that he has been having trouble with the _Ann_ all the
way down.His last telegram instructed me to ask you to wait here until
his arrival.He ought to be here sometime to-morrow.”

“That’ll be fine!” exclaimed Jimmie.“And now,” Bixby went on, “you’ll have to employ two or three fellows to
watch your machines for the night.The natives would carry them away
piecemeal if you left them here unguarded.”

“Perhaps you can pick out two or three trusty men,” suggested Glenn.“I have had three men in mind ever since I received my first message
from Mr.Havens!” replied Bixby.“When your machine was sighted in the
air not long ago, I ’phoned to their houses and they will undoubtedly be
here before long.”

“How’ll they know where to come?” asked Jimmie.“Don’t you think that half the people in Quito don’t know where these
wonders of the air lighted!” Bixby laughed.“The news went over the city
like lightning when your planes showed.Your lights, of course, revealed
your exact whereabouts to those on this side of the town, and telephones
and messenger boys have done the rest.”

While the boys talked with this very welcome and friendly visitor, the
clamor of an automobile was heard, and directly two great acetylene eyes
left the highway and turned, bumping and swaying, into the field.“There will be damages to pay for mussing up this grass!” Carl
suggested, as a fresh crowd of sight-seers followed the machine into the
enclosure.“Of course,” replied Bixby, “and they’ll try to make you pay ten times
what the damage really amounts to.I can
handle these fellows better than you can!”

“We shall be glad to have you do so!” Glenn replied.In a moment the automobile ran up to the planes and stopped.Of the four
men it contained, three alighted and approached Bixby.“These are the guards,” the latter said turning to the boys.The men, who seemed both willing and efficient, drew a long rope and
several steel stakes from the automobile and began enclosing the
machines with the same.As the rope was strung out, the constantly
increasing crowd was pushed back beyond the circle.“Won’t they make trouble for the guards during the night?” asked Ben.“I think not,” was the reply.“I have already arranged for a number of
native policemen to assist these men.”

“Gee!” exclaimed Carl, “I guess Mr.Havens picked out the right man!”

“How did he know we were going to stop at Quito?” asked Ben.“He didn’t know!” replied Bixby.“But he surmised that you’d be obliged
to land here in order to fill your fuel tanks.”

“Well, we didn’t come here for that purpose,” laughed Glenn.“We came
here because the savages chased us out of a cute little valley about
twenty miles away!”

“It’s a wonder you got away at all if they saw you!” said Bixby.“I guess they didn’t seem to understand about our motors getting into
the air!” laughed Jimmie.“The minute the wheel left the ground their
war-cries ceased.”

“It’s a wonder you were permitted to get to the machines at all if they
caught you away from them!” said Bixby.“Aw, we always have the luck of the Irish,” Jimmie replied.“The
shooting and the display of electric searchlights kept them away until
we got into the seats and our way of ascending into the sky did the
rest.”

“You are very lucky boys!” insisted Bixby.“It’s nice to hear you say so!” Ben answered, “because we’re going to
follow this line of mountains down to Cape Horn, and visit every ruined
temple on the route that has a ghost on its visiting list.”

“If you’ll listen to the stories you hear in the cities,” laughed Bixby,
“you’ll visit a good many ruined temples.”

“Glenn was telling us about a temple down on Lake Titicaca,” Ben
replied.“He says that figures in flowing white robes appear in the
night-time, and are seen by the light that emanates from their own
figures!He says, too, that there are illuminations of red, and green,
and yellow, which come from no determinable source, and that there are
noises which come out of the clear air unaccounted for!”

“There is such a temple, isn’t there, Mr.“There is a temple about which such stories are told,” laughed Bixby.“Are you boys thinking of going there?”

“Sure thing, we’re going there!” asserted Jimmie.During this conversation the three men who had been employed by Bixby to
guard the flying machine during the night had been standing by in
listening attitudes.When the haunted temple and the proposed visit of
the boys to it was mentioned, one of them whose name had been given as
Doran, touched Jimmie lightly on the shoulder.“Are you really going to that haunted temple?” he asked.Jimmie nodded, and in a short time the four boys and Bixby left for the
city in the automobile.As they entered the machine Jimmie thought that
he caught a hostile expression on Doran’s face, but the impression was
so faint that he said nothing of the matter to his chums.In an hour’s time Bixby and the four boys were seated at dinner in the
dining-room of a hotel which might have been on Broadway, so perfect
were its appointments.“Now let me give you a little advice,” Bixby said, after the incidents
of the journey had been discussed.“Never talk about prospective visits
to ruined temples in South America.There is a general belief that every
person who visits a ruin is in quest of gold, and many a man who set out
to gratify his own curiosity has never been heard of again!”




                              CHAPTER IV.PLANNING A MIDNIGHT RIDE.“If the people of the country believe there is gold in the temples said
to be haunted,” Glenn asked, “why don’t they hunt for it themselves,
without waiting for others to come down and give them a tip?”

“Generally speaking,” replied Bixby, “every ruin in Peru has been
searched time and again by natives.Millions of treasure has been found,
but there is still the notion, which seems to have been born into every
native of South America, that untold stores of gold, silver and precious
stones are still concealed in the ruined temples.”

“What I can’t understand is this,” Glenn declared.“Why should these
natives, having every facility for investigation, follow the lead of
strangers who come here mostly for pleasure?”

“I can’t understand that part of it myself,” Bixby replied, “except on
the theory that the natives ascribe supernatural powers to foreigners.Even the most intelligent natives who do not believe in the magic of
Europeans, watch them closely when they visit ruins, doubtless on the
theory that in some way the visitors have become posted as to the
location of treasure.”

“Well,” Ben observed, “they can’t make much trouble for us, because we
can light down on a temple, run through it before the natives can get
within speaking distance, and fly away again.”

“All the same,” Bixby insisted, “I wouldn’t talk very much about
visiting ruins of any kind.And here’s another thing,” he went on,
“there are stories afloat in Peru that fugitives from justice sometimes
hide in these ruins.And so, you see,” he added with a laugh, “you are
likely to place yourself in bad company in the minds of the natives by
being too inquisitive about the methods of the ancient Incas.”

“All right,” Glenn finally promised, “we’ll be careful about mentioning
ruins in the future.”

After dinner the boys went to Bixby’s place of business and ordered
gasoline enough to fill the tanks.They also ordered an extra supply of
gasoline, which was to be stored in an auxiliary container of rubber
made for that purpose.“Now about tents and provisions?” asked Bixby.“Confound those savages!” exclaimed Jimmie.“We carried those oiled-silk
shelter-tents safely through two long journeys in the mountains of
California and Mexico, and now we have to turn them over to a lot of
savages in Ecuador!I believe we could have frightened the brutes away
by doing a little shooting!Anyway, I wish we’d tried it!”

“Not for mine!” exclaimed Carl.“I don’t want to go through the country
killing people, even if they are South American savages.”

“I may be able to get you a supply of oiled-silk in Quito,” Bixby
suggested, “but I am not certain.It is very expensive, you understand,
of course, and rather scarce.”

“The expense is all right,” replied Glenn, “but we felt a sort of
sentimental attachment for those old shelter-tents.We can get all the
provisions we need here, of course?” he added.“Certainly,” was the reply.“Look here!” Jimmie cut in.“What time will there be a moon to-night?”

“Probably about one o’clock,” was the reply.“By that time, however, you
ought all to be sound asleep in your beds.”

“What’s the idea, Jimmie?” asked Carl.The boys all saw by the quickening expressions in the two boys’ faces
that they had arrived at an understanding as to the importance of
moonlight on that particular night.“Why, I thought—” began Jimmie.“I just thought it might not do any harm
to run back to that peaceful little glade to see if the tents really
have been removed or destroyed!”

“Impossible!” advised Bixby.“The tents may remain just where you left
them, but, even if they are there, you may have no chance of securing
them.It is a risky proposition!”

“What do you mean?” asked Ben.“I mean that the superstition of the savages may restrain them from
laying hands on the tents and provisions you left,” replied Bixby, “but,
at the same time,” he continued, “they may watch the old camp for days
in the hope of your return.”

“What’s the idea?” asked Glenn.“Do they want to eat us?” asked Jimmie.“Some of the wild tribes living near the head waters of the Amazon,”
Bixby explained, “are crazy over the capture of white men.They are said
to march them back to their own country in state, and to inaugurate long
festivals in honor of the victory.And during the entire festival,”
Bixby went on, “the white prisoners are subjected to tortures of the
most brutal description!”

“Say,” giggled Jimmie, giving Carl a dig in the ribs with his elbow,
“let’s take the train for Guayaquil to-morrow morning!I don’t think
it’s right for us to take chances on the savages having all the fun!”

“As between taking the first train for Guayaquil and taking a trip
through the air to the old camp to-night,” Bixby laughed, “I certainly
advise in favor of the former.”

“Aw, that’s all talk,” Ben explained, as Bixby, after promising to look
about in the morning for oiled-silk and provisions, locked his place of
business and started toward the hotel with the boys.“What do you say to it, Carl?” Jimmie asked, as the two fell in behind
the others.“I’m game!” replied Carl.“Then I’ll tell you what we’ll do!” Jimmie explained.“You and I will
get a room together and remain up until moonrise.If the sky is clear of
clouds at that time, and promises to remain so until morning, we’ll load
ourselves down with all the guns we can get hold of and fly out to the
old camp.It’ll be a fine ride, anyway!”

“Pretty chilly, though, in high altitudes at this time of night,”
suggested Carl.“I’m most frozen now!”

“So’m I,” Jimmie replied, “and I’ll tell you what we’ll do!When we
start away we’ll swipe blankets off the bed.I guess they’ll keep us
warm.”

“Well, we’ll have to keep Glenn and Ben from knowing anything about the
old trip,” Carl suggested.“Of course they couldn’t prevent us going,
but they’d put up a kick that would make it unpleasant.”

“Indeed they would!” answered Jimmie.“But, at the same time, they’d go
themselves if they’d got hold of the idea first.I suggested it, you
know, and that’s one reason why they would reject it.”

Arrived at the hotel, Jimmie and Carl had no difficulty in getting a
double room, although their chums looked rather suspiciously at them as
they all entered the elevator.“Now,” said Ben, “don’t you boys get into any mischief to-night.Quito
isn’t a town for foreigners to explore during the dark hours!”

“I’m too sleepy to think of any midnight adventures!” cried Jimmie with
a wink and a yawn.“Me, too!” declared Carl.“I’ll be asleep in about two minutes!”

It was about ten o’clock when the boys found themselves alone in a large
room which faced one of the leading thoroughfares of the capital city.Quito is well lighted by electricity, and nearly all the conveniences of
a city of the same size in the United States are there to be had.The street below the room occupied by the two boys was brilliantly
lighted until midnight, and the lads sat at a window looking out on the
strange and to them unusual scene.When the lights which flashed from
business signs and private offices were extinguished, the thoroughfare
grew darker, and then the boys began seriously to plan their proposed
excursion.“What we want to do,” Jimmie suggested, “is to get out of the hotel
without being discovered and make our way to a back street where a cab
can be ordered.It is a mile to the field where the machines were left,
and we don’t want to lose any time.”

Before leaving the room the boys saw that their automatic revolvers and
searchlights were in good order.They also made neat packages of the
woolen blankets which they found on the bed and carried them away.“Now,” said Jimmie as they reached a side street and passed swiftly
along in the shadow of a row of tall buildings, “we’ve got to get into a
cab without attracting any attention, for we’ve stolen the hotel’s
blankets, and we can’t talk Spanish, and if a cop should seize us we’d
have a good many explanations to make.”

“I don’t think it’s good sense to take the blankets,” Carl objected.“Aw, you’ll think so when we get a couple of thousand feet up in the air
on the _Louise_!” laughed Jimmie.After walking perhaps ten minutes, the boys came upon a creaking old cab
drawn by a couple of the sorriest-looking horses they had ever seen.The
driver, who sat half asleep on the seat, jumped down to the pavement and
eyed the boys suspiciously as they requested to be taken out to where
the machines had been left.The lads were expecting a long tussle between the English and the
Spanish languages, but the cabman surprised them by answering their
request in excellent English.“So?” exclaimed Jimmie.“You talk United States, too, do you?Where did
you come from?”

“You want to go out to the machines, do you?” asked the cabman, without
appearing to notice the question.“That’s where we want to go!” replied Carl.“What for?” asked the cabman.“None of your business!” replied Jimmie.“I’ve been out there once to-night!” said the cabman, “and the party I
drew beat me out of my fare.”

“That’s got nothing to do with us!” replied Carl.“It’ll cost you ten dollars!” growled the cabman.“Say, look here!” Jimmie exclaimed.“You’re a bigger robber than the New
York cabmen!It’s only a mile to the field, and we’ll walk just to show
you that we don’t have to use your rickety old cab.”

With a snarl and a frown the cabman climbed back up on his seat and gave
every appearance of dropping into sound slumber.“Now what do you think of that for a thief?” asked Carl, as the boys
hastened away toward the field.“I’d walk ten miles before I’d give that
fellow a quarter!”

“We’ve got plenty of time,” Jimmie answered.“The moon won’t be up for
an hour yet.Perhaps we’d better walk up anyway, for then we can enter
the field quietly and see what’s going on.”

On the way out the lads met several parties returning from the field,
and when they reached the opening in the fence they saw that many
curious persons were still present.There were at least half a dozen
vehicles of different kinds gathered close about the roped-off circle.“Say,” Carl exclaimed as the boys passed into the field, “look at that
old rattletrap on the right.Isn’t that the same vehicle the cabman
pretended to go asleep on as we came away?”

“Sure it is!” answered Jimmie.“I don’t remember the appearance of the
cab so well, but I know just how the horses looked.”

“He must have found a ten-dollar fare out here!” Carl suggested.“Yes, and he must have come out by a roundabout way in order to prevent
our seeing him.Now what do you think he did that for?Why should he
care whether we see him or not?”

As the boy asked the question the rig which they had been discussing was
driven slowly away, not in the direction of the road, but toward the
back end of the field.“Something mighty funny going on here!” Jimmie declared.“I guess it’s a
good thing we came out.”

When the boys came up to where the machines were lying, Doran was the
first one to approach.“Little nervous about your machines, eh?” he asked.“Rather,” replied Jimmie.“We came out with the idea of taking a short
trip to see if they still are in working order.”

“Well,” Doran said with a scowl, “of course you know that you can’t take
the machines out without an order from Mr.Bixby!”




                               CHAPTER V.

                          A WAIF AND A STRAY.“Bixby doesn’t own these machines!” exclaimed Carl angrily.“Who does own them?” demanded Doran.“We four boys own them!” was the reply.“Well, you’ve got to show me!” insisted Doran, insolently.“I’ll tell you what we’ll do!” Jimmie announced.“We’ll go right back to
Bixby and put you off the job!”

“Go as far as you like,” answered Doran.“I was put here to guard these
machines and I intend to do it.You can’t bluff me!”

While the boys stood talking with the impertinent guard they saw two
figures moving stealthily about the aeroplanes.Jimmie hastened over to
the _Louise_ and saw a man fumbling in the tool-box.“What are you doing here?” demanded the boy.The intruder turned a startled face for an instant and then darted away,
taking the direction the cab had taken.Carl and Doran now came running up and Jimmie turned to the latter.“Nice old guard you are!” he almost shouted.“Here you stand talking
with us while men are sneaking around the machines!”

“Was there some one here?” asked Doran in assumed amazement.“There surely was!” replied Jimmie.“Where are the other guards?”

“Why,” replied Doran hesitatingly, “they got tired of standing around
doing nothing and went home.It’s pretty dull out here.”

“Well,” Jimmie answered, “I’m going to see if this machine has been
tampered with!Get up on one of the seats, Carl,” he said with a wink,
“and we’ll soon find out if any of the fastenings have been loosened.”

The boy was permitted to follow instructions without any opposition or
comment from Doran, and in a moment Jimmie was in the other seat with
the wheels in motion.Seeing too late the trick which had been played upon him, Doran uttered
an exclamation of anger and sprang for one of the planes.His fingers
just scraped the edge of the wing as the machine, gathering momentum
every instant, lifted from the ground, and he fell flat.He arose instantly to shake a threatening fist at the disappearing
aeroplane.Jimmie turned back with a grin on his freckled face.“Catch on behind,” he said, “and I’ll give you a ride!”

“Did you see some one fumbling around the machine?” asked Carl, as
Jimmie slowed the motors down a trifle in order to give a chance for
conversation.“Sure, I did!” was the reply.“He ducked away when he saw me coming, and
ran away into the field in the direction taken by the cab.”

“Gee!” exclaimed Carl.“Do you think the cabman brought that man out to
work some mischief with the flying machines?”

“I don’t think much about it,” Jimmie answered, “because I don’t know
much about it!He might have done something to the machine which will
cause us to take a drop in the air directly, but I don’t think so.Anyhow, it’s running smoothly now.”

“Still we’re taking chances!” insisted Carl.The moon now stood well up in the eastern sky, a round, red ball of fire
which looked to the lads large enough to shadow half the sky a little
later on.Below, the surface of the earth was clearly revealed in its
light.“We’ll have to hurry!” Carl suggested, “if we get back to the hotel
before daylight, so I’ll quit talking and you turn on more power.”

“I may not be able to find this blooming old valley where we left the
tents,” Jimmie grumbled.“If you remember, son, we left that locality in
something of a hurry!”

“I certainly remember something which looked to me like a jungle scene
in a comic opera!” grinned Carl.“And the noise sounded not unlike some
of the choruses I have heard in little old New York!”

Jimmie drove straight north for an hour, and then began circling to left
and right in search of the little valley from which they had fled so
precipitously.At last the gleam of running water caught his eyes and he
began volplaning down.“Are you sure that’s the place?” asked Carl, almost screaming the words
into Jimmie’s ears.“I don’t see any tents down there, do you?”

“I see something that looks like a tent,” Jimmie answered.“We are so
high up now that we couldn’t distinguish one of them anyhow.”

As the aeroplane drove nearer to the earth, a blaze flared up from
below.In its red light they saw the two shelter-tents standing in
exactly the same position in which they had been left.“There!” cried Jimmie.“I had an idea we’d find them!”

“But look at the fire!” cautioned Carl.“There’s some one there keeping
up that blaze!”

“That’s a funny proposition, too!” exclaimed Jimmie.“It doesn’t seem as
if the savages would remain on the ground after our departure.”

“And it doesn’t seem as if they would go away without taking everything
they could carry with them, either!” laughed Carl.“We can’t guess it out up here,” Jimmie argued.“We may as well light
and find out what it means.Have your guns ready, and shoot the first
savage who comes within range.”

When the rubber-tired wheels of the machine struck the ground which they
had occupied only a short time before, the boys found a great surprise
awaiting them.As if awakened from slumber by the clatter of the motors,
a figure dressed in nondescript European costume arose from the fire,
yawning and rubbing his eyes, and advanced to meet them.It was the figure of a young man of perhaps eighteen, though the ragged
and soiled clothing he wore, the unwashed face, the long hair, made it
difficult for one to give any accurate estimate as to the years of his
life.He certainly looked like a tramp, but he came forward with an air
of assurance which could not have been improved upon by a millionaire
hotel-keeper, or a haughty three-dollar-a-week clerk in a ten-cent
store.“Je-rusalem!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Now what do you think of this?”

“I saw him first!” declared Carl.“All right, you may have him!”

The intruder came forward and stood for a moment without speaking,
regarding the boys curiously in the meantime.“Well,” Jimmie said in a moment, “what about it?”

“I thought you’d be back,” said the other.“Where are the savages?” asked Carl.“Didn’t you bump into a war party
here?”

The stranger smiled and pointed to the tents.“I am a truthful man,” he said.“I wouldn’t tell a lie for a dollar.I
might tell six for five dollars, but I wouldn’t tell one lie for any
small sum.My name is Sam Weller, and I’m a tramp.”

“That’s no lie!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Unless appearances are deceiving!”

“Perhaps,” Carl suggested, “we’d better be getting out of here.The
natives may return.”

“As soon as you have given me time to relate a chapter of my life,” Sam
Weller continued, “you’ll understand why the savages won’t be back here
to-night.”

“Go on!” Jimmie grunted.“Tell us the story of your life, beginning with
the poor but dishonest parents and the statement that you were never
understood when you were a baby!”

“This chapter of my life,” Sam went on, without seeming to notice the
interruption, “begins shortly after sunset of the evening just passed.”

“Go ahead!” Carl exclaimed.“Get a move on!”

“While walking leisurely from the Isthmus of Panama to Cape Horn,” Sam
began, “I saw your two flying machines drop down into this valley.At
that time,” he continued, “I was in need of sustenance.I am happy to
state, however,” he added with a significant look in the direction of
half a dozen empty tin cans, “that at the present moment I feel no such
need.For the present I am well supplied.”

“Holy Mackerel!” exclaimed Carl.“But you’ve got your nerve.”

“My nerve is my fortune!” replied Sam whimsically.“But, to continue my
narrative,” he went on.“It seemed to me a dispensation of providence in
my favor when you boys landed in the valley.In my mind’s eye, I saw
plenty to eat and unexceptionable companionship.You were so thoroughly
interested in landing that I thought it advisable to wait for a more
receptive mood in which to present my petition for—for—well, not to put
too fine a point upon it, as Micawber would say—for grub.”

“Say!” laughed Carl.“It’s a sure thing you’ve panhandled in every state
in the union.”

Sam smiled grimly but continued without comment.“So I hid myself back there in the tall grass and waited for you to get
supper.Don’t you see,” he went on, “that when a boy’s hungry he doesn’t
radiate that sympathy for the unfortunate which naturally comes with a
full stomach.Therefore, I waited for you boys to eat your supper before
I asked for mine.”

“You’re all right, anyhow!” shouted Jimmie.“But it seems that your meal was long-delayed,” Sam went on, with a
little shrug of disgust.“I lay there in the long grass and waited,
hoping against hope.Then in a short time
I heard cries of terror and supplication.Then your two friends rushed
out to your assistance.Then, being entirely under the influence of
hunger and not responsible for my acts, I crawled into one of the tents
and began helping myself to the provisions.”

“And you were there when the savages flocked down upon us?” asked Carl.“You saw what took place after that?”

“I was there and I saw,” was the reply.“When you boys came running back
to the machines I stood ready to defend you with my life and two
automatic revolvers which I had found while searching through the
provisions.When you sprang into the machines and slipped away, leaving
the savages still hungry, I felt that my last hour had come.However, I
clung to the guns and a can of a superior brand of beans put up at
Battle Creek, Michigan.”

“How did you come out with the Indians?” asked Carl.“Did you tell them
the story of your life?”

“Hardly!” was the laughing reply.“I appeared at the door of the tent in
a chastened mood, it is true, ready for peace or war, but when I saw the
savages lying upon their hands and elbows, faces bowed to the tall
grass, I reached the conclusion that I had them—well Buffaloed!”

“The machines did it?” asked Jimmie.“The machines did it!” replied Sam.“The Indians bowed their heads for a
long time, and then gazed in awe at the disappearing aeroplanes.As I
said a moment ago, they were Buffaloed.When they saw me standing at the
door of the tent, they looked about for another machine.So did I for a
matter of fact, for I thought I needed one just about then!”

“Can you run a machine?” asked Carl.“Sure I can run a machine!” was the reply.“I can run anything from a
railroad train to a race with a township constable.Well, when the
machines disappeared, the savages vanished.Not a thing about the camp
was touched.I appointed myself custodian, and decided to remain here
until you came back after your tents.”

“Then where are you going?” asked Carl.“With your permission, I will place three days’ provisions under my belt
and be on my way.”

“Not three days’ supplies all at once?” questioned Jimmie.“All at once!” replied Sam.The two boys consulted together for a moment, and then Jimmie said:

“If you’ll help us pack the tents and provisions on the machine, we’ll
take you back to Quito with us.That is, if the _Louise_ will carry so
much weight.I think she will, but ain’t sure.”

“It surely will be a treat to ride in the air again!” declared the
tramp.“It has been a long time since Louis Havens kicked me out of his
hangar on Long Island for getting intoxicated and filling one of the
tanks with beer instead of gasoline.”

The boys smiled at each other significantly, for they well remembered
Mr.Havens’ story of the tramp’s rather humorous experience at the Long
Island establishment.However, they said nothing to Sam of this.“And, in the meantime,” the tramp said, pointing upward, “we may as well
wait here until we ascertain what that other machine is doing in the air
at this time of night!”




                              CHAPTER VI.Shortly after midnight Ben was awakened by a noise which seemed to come
from the door of his room.Half asleep as he was, it came to his
consciousness like the sparkling of a motor.There was the same sharp
tick, tick, tick, with regular pauses between.As he sat up in bed and listened, however, the sounds resolved
themselves into the rattle of one metal against another.In a minute he
knew that some one unfamiliar with the lock of his door was moving the
stem of a key against the metal plate which surrounded the key-hole.Then he heard the bolt shoot back and the door opened.There was an
electric switch on the wall within reach of his hand, and in a second
the room was flooded with light.The person who stood in the center of
the floor, halfway between the doorway and the bed, was an entire
stranger to the boy.He was dressed in clothing which would not have
been rejected by the head waiter of one of the lobster palaces on
Broadway, and his manner was pleasing and friendly.He smiled and dropped into a chair, holding out both hands when he saw
Ben’s eyes traveling from himself to an automatic revolver which lay on
a stand at the head of the bed.“Of course,” he said, then, as Ben sat down on the edge of the bed, “you
want to know what I’m doing here.”

“Naturally!” replied the boy.The man, who appeared to be somewhere near the age of twenty-five, drew
a yellow envelope from his pocket and tossed it over to Ben.“I am manager at the Quito telegraph office!” he said.“And I received
this despatch for you just before twelve o’clock.In addition to this I
received a personal message from Mr.Read your message and then
I will show you mine!”

Ben opened the envelope and read:

“Be sure and wait for me at the point where this message is delivered.Complications which can only be explained in person!”

The manager then passed his own despatch over to the boy.It read as
follows:

“Mr.Charles Mellen, Manager: Spare no expense in the delivery of the
message to Ben Whitcomb.If necessary, wire all stations on your circuit
for information regarding aeroplanes.If Whitcomb is at Quito, kindly
deliver this message in person, and warn him to be on the watch for
trouble.I hope to reach your town within twenty-four hours.”

“Now for an explanation regarding my surreptitious entrance into your
sleeping room,” Mellen went on.“My room is next to yours, and in order
not to awaken other sleepers, and at the same time make certain that you
understood the situation thoroughly, I tried my hand at burglary.”

“I am glad you did!” replied Ben.“For if there is anything serious in
the air it is quite important that no stir be created in the hotel at
this hour of the night.”

“That was just my idea!” Mellen answered.“I knew that if I asked the
clerk to send a page to your room every person in the hotel would know
all about the midnight visit in the morning.So far as I know,
understand, the complications hinted at by Mr.Havens may have had their
origin in Quito—perhaps in this very hotel.”

“It was very thoughtful of you,” answered Ben.Havens
personally?” he asked then.“Certainly!” was the reply.“He is a heavy stock-holder in the company I
represent; and it was partly through his influence that I secured my
present position.”

“After all,” smiled Ben, “this is a small world, isn’t it?The idea of
finding a friend of a friend up near the roof of the world!”

“Yes, it’s a small world,” replied Mellen.“Now tell me this,” he went
on, “have you any idea as to what Mr.Havens refers in his two rather
mysterious messages?”

“Not the slightest!” was the reply.“I wish we knew where to find Havens at this time,” mused Mellen.“I don’t think it will be possible to reach him until he wires again,”
Ben answered, “because, unless I am greatly mistaken, he is somewhere
between New Orleans and this point in his airship, the _Ann_.”

“I gathered as much from his messages to Bixby,” replied Mellen.“You
see,” the manager went on, “I got in touch with Havens to-night through
the despatches he sent to Bixby yesterday, I say ‘yesterday’ because it
is now ‘to-morrow’,” he added with a smile.“Then you knew we were here?” asked Ben.“That is,” he corrected
himself, “you knew Bixby was expecting us?”

“When Bixby left you at the hotel,” Mellen laughed, “he came direct to
the telegraph office, so you see I knew all about it before I
burglarized your room.”

“Bixby strikes me as being a very straightforward kind of a man,” Ben
suggested.“I rather like his appearance.”

“He’s all right!” replied Mellen.“And now,” Ben continued, “I’d like to have you remain here a short time
until I can call the other boys and get a general expression of
opinion.”

“Of course you’ll wait for Mr.Havens?” suggested Mellen.“Of course,” answered Ben.“However,” he continued, “I’d like to have
the other members of the party talk this matter over with you.To tell
the truth, I’m all at sea over this suggestion of trouble.”

“I shall be pleased to meet the other members of your party,” replied
Mellen.“I have already heard something of them through my
correspondence with Mr.Havens.”

Ben drew on his clothes and hurried to Glenn’s room.The boy was awake
and opened the door at the first light knock.Ben merely told him to go
to the room where Mr.Mellen had been left and passed on to the
apartment which had been taken by Jimmie and Carl.He knocked softly on the door several times but received no answer.Believing that the boys were sound asleep he tried the door, and to his
great surprise found that it was unlocked.As the reader will understand, he found the room unoccupied.The bed had
not been disturbed except that some of the upper blankets were missing.He hastened back to his own room, where he found Glenn and Mellen
engaged in conversation.Both looked very blank when informed of the
disappearance of Jimmie and Carl.“What do you make of it?” asked Mellen.“I don’t know what to make of it!” replied Glenn.“I think I can explain it!” Ben cried, walking nervously up and down the
room.“Don’t you remember, Glenn,” he went on, “that Jimmie and Carl
suggested the advisability of going back to the old camp after moonrise
and getting the valuable tents, arms and provisions we left there?”

“Sure I remember that!” answered Glenn.“But do you really think they
had the nerve to try a scheme like that?”

“I haven’t the least doubt of it!” declared Ben.“It’s just one of their tricks,” agreed Glenn.“They must be rather lively young fellows!” suggested Mellen.“They certainly are!” answered Ben.“And now the question is this,” he
continued, “what ought we to do?”

“I’m afraid they’ll get into trouble,” Glenn suggested.“It was a foolhardy thing to do!” Mellen declared.“The idea of their
going back into the heart of that savage tribe is certainly
preposterous!I’m afraid they’re already in trouble.”

“Perhaps we ought to get the _Bertha_ and take a trip out there!”
suggested Glenn.“They may be in need of assistance.”

“That’s just my idea!” Ben agreed.“It seems to me that the suggested course is the correct one to pursue,”
Mellen said.“Perhaps we can get to the field before they leave for the valley,” Ben
interposed.“They spoke of going after the moon came up, and that was
only a short time ago.”

“Well,” said Mellen, “the quicker we act the more certain we shall be of
success.You boys get downstairs, if you can, without attracting much
attention, and I’ll go out and get a carriage.”

“Will you go with us to the field?” asked Ben.“I should be glad to,” was the reply.When the boys reached the corner of the next cross street, in ten
minutes’ time, they found Mellen waiting for them with a high-power
automobile.He was already in the seat with the chauffeur.“I captured a machine belonging to a friend of mine,” he said, with a
smile, “and so we shall be able to make quick time.”

As soon as the party came within sight of the field they saw that
something unusual was taking place there, for people were massing from
different parts of the plain to a common center, and people standing in
the highway, evidently about to seek their homes, turned and ran back.“Can you see the flying machines?” asked Ben.“I can see one of them!” answered Mellen in the front seat.“And it
seems to be mounting into the air!”

“I guess the little rascals have got off in spite of us!” declared Ben.“Perhaps we’d better hold up a minute and follow the direction it takes.It may not head for the valley.”

“It’s heading for the valley, all right!” Glenn exclaimed.“Yes, and there’s something going on in the field below,” Mellen
declared.“There are people running about, evidently in great
excitement, and the second machine is being pushed forward.”

“Do you think the little rascals have taken a machine apiece?” demanded
Ben.“There’s no knowing what they will do!”

“No, I don’t,” replied Glenn.“They’d be sure to stick together.”

“Then we’d better hustle up and find who’s taking out the second
machine!” exclaimed Ben.“This does look like trouble, doesn’t it?”

“Oh, it may be all right,” smiled Mellen.“The boys may have taken a
machine apiece.”

When the party reached the field the second flying machine was some
distance away.The driver, however, seemed to be wavering about in the
air as if uncertain of his control of the levers.Once or twice in an
uncertain current of air the _Bertha_ came near dropping to the ground.In time, however, he gained better control.One of the native policemen secured by Bixby rushed up to the automobile
as it came to a stop.He recognized Mellen in the car and addressed him
in Spanish, speaking as if laboring under great excitement.The boys listened to the conversation very impatiently, noting with no
little apprehension the look of anxiety growing on the face of the
manager as he listened to the story of the policeman.At length Mellen
turned to the boys and began translating what he had heard.The story told by the policeman was virtually the story told in the last
chapter, with the exception that it included the departure of Doran and
another in pursuit of the _Louise_.“The policeman,” Mellen went on, “is of the opinion that Doran means
mischief.He declares that he rather forced himself on Bixby, and was
instrumental in securing the absence of the two Englishmen who were to
assist him in guarding the aeroplanes.”

“It seems that the trouble arrived shortly after the Havens’ telegram,”
suggested Ben.“I wish I knew what it meant.”

“No one this side of Kingdom Come knows!” declared Glenn.“That is, no
one save Mr.“Anyway, it’s trouble!”

“How far is it to that valley?” asked Mellen.“At least twenty miles!” replied Ben.“Would it be possible to reach it in this machine?”

“I can’t answer that question,” replied Ben, “because it was dark when
we came over the ground.It seems, however, to be all up hill and down
on the way there.I don’t think the machine could make the trip.”

“I’ve a great notion to try it!” declared Mellen.“Anyway,” he went on,
“we can tour along in that direction.The man in charge of the last
aeroplane doesn’t seem to be next to his job and he may get a tumble.”

“And if he does,” cried Ben, “we’ll give him a lift, patch up the
machine, and start over to the old camp!”

And so, with the two machines in the air, the automobile went roaring
and panting over the rough mountain trails in the direction of the
valley!Occasionally the occupants saw the last machine but not often!“That other machine,” Jimmie observed glancing hastily in the direction
pointed out by Sam, “looks to me like the _Bertha_.”

“Can you identify an aeroplane at that distance in the night-time?”
asked Sam.“I’m sure I couldn’t do anything of the kind!”

“I don’t know as I can express it,” Jimmie replied, “but to me every
flying machine has a method and manner of its own.There is something in
the way an aeroplane carries itself in the sky which reminds me somewhat
of the manner of a man in walking.In the case of the man, you know who
it is long before you can see his face, and in the case of the flying
machine, you know her long before the details of construction are in
view.I’m sure that is the _Bertha_!”

“It is the _Bertha_, all right!” Carl cut in.“And she isn’t being
handled by one of our boys, either!”

“It isn’t possible, is it, that that fellow Doran found the nerve to
chase us up?” asked Jimmie.“If he did, he’s a poor aviator, all right!”

“It’s a wonder to me he doesn’t tip the machine over,” Sam suggested.“He may tip it over yet!” exclaimed Carl.“Just see, how it sways and
sags every time it comes to one of the little currents of air sweeping
out of the gorges.I anticipate a quick tumble there!”

“That’s a nice thing,” exclaimed Jimmie, “for some one to steal the
machine and break it up!If the _Bertha_ goes to pieces now, we’ll have
to delay our trip until another aeroplane can be bought, and the chances
are that we can never buy one as reliable as the _Bertha_.”

“She isn’t smashed yet!” grinned the tramp.“She’s headed straight for
the camp now, and may get here safely.The aviator seems to understand
how to control the levers, but he doesn’t know how to meet air currents.If he had known the country well enough, he might have followed an
almost direct river level to this point.”

“We didn’t know enough to do that!” Carl exclaimed.“We came over
mountains, gorges, and all kinds of dangerous precipices.”

“That was unnecessary,” laughed the tramp, still keeping his eyes fixed
on the slowly-approaching flying machine.“The south branch of the
Esmeraldas river rises in the volcano country somewhere south of Quito.The east branch of the same river rises something like a hundred miles
east and north of Quito.These two branches meet down there in front of
the camp.You can almost see the junction from here.”

“Could a boat sail down either branch of the river?” asked Carl.“I don’t know about that,” was the reply, “but there must be a
continuous valley from Quito to the junction.If yonder aviator had
followed that, or if you had followed it, there would have been no
trouble with gorge winds or gusty drafts circling around mountain tops.”

“Is there a road through the valley?” asked Jimmie.“A wagon road, I
mean.It seems that there ought to be.”

“There are a succession of rough trails used by teamsters,” was the
reply.The trails climb over ridges and
dip down into canyons, but it seems to me that the roadbed is remarkably
smooth.In fact, there seems to be a notion in the minds of the natives
that a very important commercial highway followed the line of the river
a good many centuries ago.I don’t know whether this is correct or not,
but I do know that the highway is virtually unknown to most of the
people living at Quito.I blundered on it by mistake.”

“We’ll go back that way,” Carl suggested, “and, as we can fly low down,
there will be no risk in taking you along with us.”

The flying machine which had been discovered approaching the camp a few
minutes before was now near enough so that two figures could be
distinguished on the seats.The machine was still reeling uncertainly,
the aviator undoubtedly seeking a place to land.“You see,” Carl explained, “the fellow is a stranger so far as this camp
is concerned.If he had ever been here before, he would now know exactly
what to do.Either Ben or Glenn could lay the machine within six inches
of the _Louise_ without half trying.”

“Then you are certain that it is not one of your friends in control of
the aeroplane?” asked Sam.“I am sure of that!” replied Jimmie.“Neither one of the boys would
handle a machine the way that one is being handled.”

“When she gets a little nearer we can tell whether that man Doran is on
board or not,” suggested Carl rather anxiously.“If you are certain that the machine has been stolen from the field
where she was left,” Sam went on, “you ought to decide without delay
what course to take when she lands.The man having her in charge may
have followed you here with hostile intentions.”

“That’s very true!” Carl agreed.“We have two automatics apiece,” Jimmie grinned, “and we know how to use
them, so we’ll be able to take care of ourselves, whatever happens!”

“And I have two which I found lying with the provision packages in one
of the tents,” said Sam.“Perhaps I shall be able now to pay for my
dinner.I’m always glad to do that whenever I can.”

The oncoming machine was now circling over the valley, and it seemed
that a landing would be made in a few minutes.The boys moved back to
where the _Louise_ lay, then stood waiting and watching anxiously.“Do you think the men on the machine saw you?” asked Jimmie, in a
moment, turning to Sam.“It doesn’t seem possible that they did!”

“Certainly not!” answered Sam.“You must remember that it is dark down
here, and that they are virtually looking into a black hole in the
hills.Only for the
remnants of the fire, I don’t believe they could have found the valley
at all!”

“Perhaps they haven’t seen us, either!” Carl suggested.“I don’t think they have,” Sam answered.“Then I’ll tell you what we’ll do!” Jimmie exclaimed.“We’ll scatter and
hide in three different places, in three different directions.Then,
when they land, we’ll perform the Jesse James act and order them to
throw up their hands!With six automatics pointing in their direction,
they’ll probably obey orders without argument.”

“I should think they would!” laughed Carl.“What’s the idea after that?” Sam questioned.“I don’t know,” Jimmie returned.“Anyway, we’ll get the machine and
leave them to walk back to Quito.By the time they have accomplished
that stunt, we’ll be on our way to the haunted temples of Peru.I’m
getting sick of this old country, anyway.”

Bending low in the darkness so as to avoid being seen from above, the
three scattered, in accordance with this arrangement
